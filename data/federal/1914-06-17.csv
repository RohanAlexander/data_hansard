It is headedCoos's LATEST. The police are taking names off the roll, but will put none on. The police are not taking names off the roll. That is for the officials of the Electoral Department to do, when they have ascertained in the proper way-in the way provided for by honourable members opposite-that those names ought not to be there. When the officials have' discovered that there are names on the rolls which have no right to be there, they put into operation machinery designed for the purpose by honourable members opposite, and these officials are men who have been selected for their work by the Publio Service Commissioner. To Bay that "" Cook "" has anything to do with the removal of names from the rolls is a slander and a lie. Here are other state75,000 Labour voters disfranchised. Labour voters must act at once, as rolls close immediately. The police are collecting State rolls, but not Federal. I do not know what is meant by that.",11

I do not see my way clear to facilitate these proposals being dealt with at all. I do not believe in them; I do not want to facilitate them.

28,Mr ATKINSON,CLOSING OF BONDS AT,"The honourable member for Darwin is reported to have stated that the Customs Houses at Strahan, Burnie, and Stanley have been closed, and he is also reported to have accused the Government of having done this with intent. Assuming the honourable member to have been correctly reported, I ask the Minister of Trade and Customs whether the statements are in any way correct?",13
29,Mr GROOM,CLOSING OF BONDS AT,"My notice was drawn this morning to the report in which the honourable member for Darwin is said to have referred to the proposed closing of the Customs Houses at Strahan, Burnie, and Stanley as "" one of Mr Cook's tricks to furthe r the interest of large merchants, and with a view to concentrating business in the city at the expense of the poorer man."" OPPOSITION MEMBEBS - Hear , hear!",13
30,Mr GROOM,CLOSING OF BONDS AT,"Honourable members have a right to say "" He a r , hear!"" seeing that the whole statement is an absolute inaccuracy. The position is this: In the ordinary course of inspection of outports by the inspector attached to the AUGUSTA . Central Staff, it came under notice that the bonds at Strahan, Burnie, and Devonport (not Stanley) were being kept open for an infinitesimal amount of business. There is no bond at Stanley. The amounts collected as charges on goods stored in these bonds during the previous twelve months were as under:-Strahan , £ 1 6s. 7 d . ; Burnie, £ 2 2s. l O d . ; Devonport, £ 5 8s. lOd. The rent paid for a bonded store at Devonport was £ 2 0 per annum, and at Burnie £ 8 per annum. The fees collected at the three places were only about equal to the rent of one alone. Owing to the revestment of premises at Devonport, the disparity between rent paid and fees received would have been much greater in the future . At Burnie, the most imwith portant of the ports named, from the Innapoint of view of Customs revenue, the inspector reported that there have been only fifteen transactions at the bond during the last four years. The inspector recommended that, in such circumstances, these bonds should be closed. This was endorsed By the Comptroller-General, and on the latter's recommendation, approved by the Minister, the closing is to take place on the 30th June. The honourable member for Darwin is quite in error in referring to the closing of the Customs Houses at the outports named. It is not proposed to close the Customs Houses in these places at all. My regret is that members, before they make these statements, will not first of all communicate with the Department. In this case the honourable member for Darwin has made a statement that we propose to do something which we do not propose to do, and on that a grossly unfair charge has been brought against the Prime Minister.

39,Mr FENTON,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Will the Minister representing the Minister of Defence have full inquiries made in regard to the circumstances in which a young cadet named Charles A. Spong was fined in the Essendon Police Court for an offence against the regulations? The cadet had appeared on parade without a uniform, and was ordered to go to his home, and return in uniform, but the boy's father, thinking that his son would be too late for that parade, detained him at home, and, in consequence, the boy was fined for having disobeyed the order of his officer.",14
40,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I shall ask the Minister of Defence to look into the circumstances the honourable member has detailed.

41,Mr KELLY,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,I shall endeavour to get an answer to the question submitted by the honourable member by tomorrow. ELECTORAL ROLLS.,14
42,Mr ARCHIBALD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,Why is the Electoral Department striking the names of mariners from the rolls by refusing to recognise their ships as their residences ?,14
43,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I know nothing whatever about the matter, but I shall have inquiries made.  country electorates in Queensland are so extensive, can the Prime Minister say approximately what period there will be between the issue of the new rolls and the issue of writs, so that there will be opportunity for electors to see whether their names are on the rolls?",14
44,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I do not quite see the bearing of the question. The Government will do all they can within the law to see that a clean roll is presented to the electors. More than that I cannot say.  Minister does not understand the question. From Charleville, the seat of administration in Maranoa so far as electoral matters are concerned, to the furthest outposts of the division, a journey by coach takes exactly two weeks. I wish to know if the Minister will give us time after the printed rolls-o r the clean rolls, as the Prime Minister calls them-ge t to those outlying places, so that we can see that every one who is entitled to be on the roll is there, or, if not, is placed on the supplementary roll. Also I wish to know what period the Minister proposes to give between the date of the issue of the printed roll from Charleville, and the issue of the writs, which will be the last opportunity for getting names on the rolls?",14

49,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am aware of of that; but that does not take away from what I am saying, namely, that the rolls are being printed-in all the States. All inatter ? contracts for printing stipulate that the rolls are to be completed within the visited month. Therefore, within a month shall have the rolls ready. Then will be two months u n t i l the day of election.",15

51,Mr BAMFORD,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,How long will there be matter. before the issue of the writs?,15
52,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"This is my answer: The Government will give the fullest possible time consistent with, ting, as far as possible, clean rolls.",15
53,Mr JH CATTS,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"Is the Prime Minister aware that, on the last occasion of the printing of the rolls, it was that the Government Printing Office i New South Wales could not turn out combat. rolls in the time specified, and the work had to be hawked all over Sydney, and farmed out to any place that could do it? Will the Prime Minister steps on this occasion ro satisfy himself that the rolls can be printed in the time specified, seeing that the New South Wales caricature ?

64,Sir JOHNFORREST,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am not in any way responsible for the cartoon.

Is it not fact that in New South Wales candidates have applied for thousands of claim cards to be issued to them; and, if so, will the practice be discontinued?",15
65,Mr JOSEPH COOK,KALGOORLI E TO PORT AUGUSTA,"I am afraid that both parties are making application for claim cards, so that there is much of a muchness on either side. I that every claim card has to be investigated and scrutinized, and no name is placed on the roll until it has been ascertained that it has a right to be there. It is, however, quite a different proposition in regard to purging the rolls, which seems to be very much more dimcult. ELECTION OFFICIALS.  Minister, upon notice I.

78,Mr HOWE,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"Dalley) [3.7] - On Friday I was referring to the refusal of the Government to grant the House any information regarding the memorandum or memoranda placed before the Governor General in connection with the double dissolution. I fel t justified in taking up my then attitude; inasmuch as a' great constitutional question has arisen in the history of Federation, and it is the duty of the Government, not only to this House, but to the country, to give the fullest possible information. I admit that the Prime Minister has, within the last few minutes, refused to give any information; but I enter my protest, which I hope will go to the country, against such a stand being taken by the Government. It suggests that the Prime Minister has somethin g behind, and is not prepared to meet the country with that full information to which it is entitled. We are, as I sayj face tp face with a great constitutional issue on which the two Houses are to be dissolved at once. SUPPLY. never occurred before, and may not occur again for years to come. Y e t we cannot get at the bed-rock facts-w e cannot obtain that statement which fell from the REPBESENTAlips or pen of the Attorney-General, expressing in detail the reasons which have GUARANprompted the Governor General to grant the dissolution. This is a course of action on the part of the Government that deserves every possible censure, and I sincerely trust that this side of the WORKERS' House will continue to fight until we are placed in possession of the actual facts of the situation. I do not know what MATERIALother members are prepared to do, but, personally, I am prepared to sit here and tie up Supply until we have the statement to which I have referred. A few OFFICERS days ago I saw from the public press that MARINERS' the Prime Minister had declared that this memorandum must not be disclosed. A day or two afterwards I read a statement from the Private Secretary to the Governor General, repudiating this assertion, and saying that no such statement had emanated from the Governor General.",18

80,Mr HOWE,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"I have not at hand the statement made by the Private Secretary to the Governor General, but the honourable gentleman will find that it is to the effect I have mentioned. In view of the importance of the question, and the desire of honourable members opposite to bring about what they describe as a reform of the Senate, is it not absolutely essential that we should have this information] The action taken means, I shall not say the abolition of the Senate, but the n u l l if y in g of its powers, and the constitutional point at issue is so great that we should have the fullest information regarding it .",18
81,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"The honourable member's concern for the Senate, which is supposed to represent minoritieswhich is supposed to be an Upper House - is quite touching.",18
82,Mr HOWE,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"I am not much concerned with the question as to whether it represents majorities or minorities, but I object to the interruption of the honourable member. If , in effect, the Senate is to be absolutely dependent upon a vote of this House-if there is to be a double dissolution directly it rejects a second time This has any Bill passed hy this House-surel y we ought to have placed before us the memorandum prepared by the Attorney General dealing with the constitutional aspect of the question, upon which the Governor General took action. As it is, we are in complete ignorance of necessary facts which ought to be disclosed for our guidance. The attitude taken up by the Government on this question deserves the censure of the House, and I trust that when we go to the country it will receive the censure of the people. Let me pass now to certain propositions that the Government are now putting before us. Within the last few days the Treasurer has expressed pleasure at the fact that the Labour party, whilst in power, were able to provide out of revenue for our naval and military defence schemes. I now find him fighting for the right to borrow for naval and military purposes. Where does the right honourable gentleman stand ? What position does he really take up? Would he favour the cost of naval and military defence being provided for out of revenue, or does he really think that it should be provided for out of loan? Leaviug that point, I would remind honourable members that for some time the Government have been telling us that the whole question of Tariff reform has been placed in the hands of the Inter-State Commission, and that the Tariff cannot be dealt with in any way until the Commission has investigated every case that could possibly come before it in respect of trade, commerce, and industry. We now find the Minister of Trade and Customs and his colleagues expressing a readiness to rectify Tariff anomalies immediately. They propose to go to the country with a cry of that sort. How unfair and untrue it is. The position is that the Government and their supporters will try to gull the public in this way, and if they are successful at the polls they will do nothing with the Tariff. They will have three years of office, and studiously refrain from resurrecting the Tariff question.",18
83,Mr RILEY,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,They will not come back to office again.,19
84,Mr HOWE,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"I hope they will not. Another change in their attitude is in respect of constitutional amendments for the purpose of electoral reform. We have heard so much from the great brains of the Liberal party as to the sacredness of the Commonwealth Constitution that it is surprising to learn that they are prepared now to favour such an amendment of it as will permit of electoral reform in a certain direction. They propose a proportional scheme of representation for the Senate and preferential voting for the House of Representatives. They also state that they are in favour of the initiative and referendum. But what has been their attitude all along to the Referenda Bills that have been sent down from another place? The Leader of the Opposition asked this afternoon that an opportunity should be given this House to deal with them; but his request was refused. The Government will not give us that opportunity, and are not prepared to give the people a chance to vote upon the referenda questions. What, then, is the meaning of this change of front on the part of the Ministry in respect of electoral reform? Is it that they have found themselves handicapped by the present electoral system in their efforts to defeat the Labour party. Their hopes and anticipations were that the Labour party would never enter the Senate. Sir William MCMillan, speaking at the Convention, referred to a position in the Senate as likely to be the blue ribbon of Australian political life. It was thought that no one would dare enter those sacred doors who had not wealth enough to cover the country, and whose superior position did not place him on a pedestal; that we, the hobnailed people, would not dare to enter there. Now that we have entered, and the people recognise our status, they desire the alteration of the Constitution to provide for the initiative and referendum. But I must leave that subject, because my time is limited, and there is another to which I wish to make reference. The Prime Minister said a day or two ago that he knew nothing of a report of which we have heard much in the press recently, a report relating to a property wortli nearly £1,000,000, and for which £75,000 is asked to make it effective; I refer to the Fitzroy Dock. It has been said in the press that I bring in the Fitzroy Dock as Mr Dick used to bring in King Charles' head. Well, King Charles is dead, and I do not mind kicking his skull about. Mr King Salter, reporting on the position of affairs at the dock, has thrown on the shoulders of the men employed there the chief responsibility for its inefficiency. I repudiate the charge. I say that the inefficiency is to be placed, not on the men, but on the Naval Department. The inefficiency that he speaks of, and any consequent in j u r y to the vessel which may be launched a couple of years hence, is not the fault of the men, certainly not of the Australian workmen employed on Cockatoo Island. challenge the Naval Department and Mr . K in g Salter to refute my statement that 90 per cent, of the men on the Island today have been brought from Great B r i tain. Mr K in g Salter wishes to introduce the old-world methods of working, and these men say, "" We have obtained improved conditions in Australia, and are not going back to the slavery that we suffered in England.""",19
85,Mr EILEY,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,Piece-wor k !,20
86,Mr HOWE,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"Mr K in g Salter wants piece-work, but he wants something more. Mr Justice Heydon, when, for the first time in the history of our people, piecework was imposed on the engineering trade, found that we were so bitterly opposed to it that he tied up his award in such a way that no employer would take advantage of it . In the first place, the normal wage earned under the time system must be paid. Further, men must have 5 per cent, additional for piecework, whether the output is greater or not, and must be permitted to earn up to 50 per cent, above the normal rates before any attempt is made to reduce their pay. The employers do not want a piece-work system that safeguards the interests of the men. They want a system under which they can take the smartest man at a trade or calling, and make him a sort of bell-wether of the flock, every other man being forced to work at the same rate, or receiving proportionately less. This has been the damnation of the engineering trade in England. The VickersMaxim Company has a bonus system ; Hawthorn Leslie, Thorneycroft, the Greenock Company, the Palmer Company, and Thames Limited pay time rates. The Yarrow, Clydebank, and John White companies pay bonuses. The Dumbarton and Cammell-Laird companies pay piece-work, but as to Parsons and the Wallsend companies I have no information. Mr K in g Salter came from Chatham Dockyard, which is known as the scrap yard of England, and a "" scab"" yard. He seeks, not alone to introduce piece-work, but to get all the "" s c a b "" labour he can, building the vessels with low-paid labour.",20
87,Mr FENTON,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,Such men will give bad work.,20
88,Mr HOWE,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"Yes, every time. Have I not seen it myself? I have known vessels to be built with lead I rivets inserted instead of steel. Vessels have been turned out of some dockyards in that way. Such a thing must not happen here. If the M in ister of Defence, or the Ministry, attempts this sort of thing, we shall not be afrai d to close down Fitzroy Dock, whether vessels of war are built or are not built. The inefficiency for which the men are blamed is the fault of the Defence Department. There are two destroyers on the slips today almost ready for launching; but when they are launched they will have to be tied up to the wharf. They cannot put the boilers in , because they have not yet got the plates out, and hundreds of tons of machinery have yet to come from the Old Country. Neither Mr K in g Salter nor Mr Cutler, but the Naval Board, is to blame for any inefficiency, and for not getting out material which would enable the work to be done efficiently. What is the position of the Brisbane? She is practically plated up efficiently but for one great heavy plate which has not been brought out yet. They are boring holes to test the strength of the basement on which the slip is built, to see whether the launching will go off effectively, but when the vessel is launched, they will not have machinery to put into her. They tell ns that they cannot get the necessary supply of labour; but they can get labour if they will pay the rates that are paid by outside establishments. They will not pay these rates except to new-comers.",20
89,Mr FENTON,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,What is meant by newcomers ?,20
90,Mr HOWE,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"Me n who have recently come from England, whether working men or officers. Three years ago I knew nearly every man on Cockatoo Island; today I know scarcely one. Although the Minister of Defence issued the instructions that, ability being proved, Australian workmen should have preference, men who have been in the service for twenty-five years are being cast out every day, new men taking their places. When an Australian workman asks for an increase of pay he is refused it, but when his place has been taken by a new man, that new man gets the increase. Those are facts that I know of, and speak of with assurance. Is it to be wondered that they cannot get the men? There is no dearth of labour, but they wish to reduce the status of the workmen. They wish to get all the skilled hands they can, and to introduce underpaid labour, with a hope that they may thus reduce the cost of the vessels that are building.",20
91,The CHAIRMAN,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,The honourable member's time has expired.,21
92,Mr SHARPE,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"Oxley) [3.31] - I am pleased to see the honourable member for Eden-Monaro in the chamber, because it is my intention to touch on a subject with which he proposes to deal by a motion of which he has given notice on the business-paper. The Treasurer said that he was the first Commonwealth Treasurer to pay old-age pensions; I hope that he will add to his fame by agreeing to some of the proposals that I shall make this afternoon. ""We know that the cost of living has increased considerably of late, and that old-age pensioners are not able to live in decent comfort on their present pensions.",21
93,The CHAIRMAN,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"The honourable member has stated that he proposes to discuss a matter covered by a notice of motion that has been placed on the business-paper by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro. He will not be in order in doing that. He may refer incidentally to the old-age pension system, but he must not discuss the motion of which notice has been given.",21
94,Mr SHARPE,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"I thought that motion had disappeared. The old-age pensioners are now in a deplorable condition, and many honourable members would be pleased if the Government brought forward again the Bill introduced last session, which Ministers hesitated about pushing on with because they found the Opposition unanimously in favour of it.",21
95,The CHAIRMAN,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"The honourable member may speak of the need for increasing the old-age pensions, but he may not definitely refer to that proposal.",21
96,Mr SHARPE,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"I have not very much to say on the matter, but I hope that what I shall say will be sumcient to induce the Treasurer to agree to the suggestions which I am about to make, and that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro will have a word or two to say on the subject. It will be a pity for the Parliament to come to an end before the Government has done something for our old friends.",21
97,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,Will the honourable member help me?,21
98,Mr SHARPE,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,I shall do my very best.,21
99,Sir JOHN FOKEEST,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,You are all very friendly just now.,21
100,Mr SHARPE,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"It might suit the Treasurer to be more friendly towards our old people. They would be delighted if he closed, his career as Minister by doing something of the kind that I am about to propose. Many of them have had to go into State institutions, because the pensions were not sufficient to enable them to live in comfort. When these old people forfeit their pensions and go into institutions the Commonwealth makes a profit of 2s. per head. . That amount might very well he paid to the oldpeople in the institutions. When a pensioner is not receiving sufficient to pay rent and keep himself in food and clothing, he makes application for admission into one of the State institutions; and if he is drawing a pension he has no trouble in getting in. The Commonwealth pays the institution 8s. per week for his keep, and that 2s. which the Commonwealth thus saves might very well be paid to the pensioner. Many female pensioners, too, are obliged to enter these institutions, and they are treated in the same manner. If the Commonwealth would pay the 2s. which at present is saved, the Government would be doing a great service to our old friends, which the whole of the people of Australia would be grateful for. I believe the Treasurer will agree to something of this nature, because this matter has been discussed frequently in this chamber, and if a vote were taken almost every member would show his sympathy with an increased pension to our old friends. Many of our invalid pensioners, who have to buy medicine, find the 10s. a week allowed by the Commonwealth insufficient to maintain them in ordinary comfort. The invalid pensioners are not very great in number,' and even if the Government are' not prepared to increase the old-age pension, they might, at any rate, take into consideration the possibility of giving"" an increased pension to our invalid friends. Last session the claims of the blind people were brought before the Chamber, and I think the Treasurer expressed the opinion that the .Commonwealth is not treating them with anything like liberality. Other members have expressed similar views, and it is due from the Government that they should formulate some scheme to pay the blind people the full amount that is being paid to the old-age pensioners. The number of blind people who are eligible for a pension is about 2,700, and, as many of them are at present receiving a pension, the proposal I am making will not mean a very heavy increased expenditure. The aged, blind, and invalid pensioners are all contributing to the revenue of the Commonwealth, and many of them have paid a good deal more in taxation than will ever be returned to them. Many countries of the old world have a contributory system of pensions; but in 'Australia our revenue is sufficient to provide our aged and invalid people with a pension without imposing any additional taxation on them.",21
101,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,Y o u do not suggest pensions on a contributory basis?,22
102,Mr SHARPE,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"No ; but our opponents have suggested that. I say that the country is rich enough to provide for a full and sufficient pension from revenue. A matter of serious importance is the number of blind people who are to be seen begging in the streets; and, if only to remove those people from that form of obtaining a livelihood, the Government should long ago have taken into consideration the possibility of providing them with a pension. In some of the institutions a few of the blind people are earning decent wages. If they are earning 10s., they receive a pension of 10s. per week; but if they get a rise of 2s. 6d. or 5s. per week, that amount is taken off their pension, so that there is no inducement to them to become energetic. Many, who are not energetic, are receiving a full pension; and I say that it is the duty of the Government to pay the blind people a full pension without any restriction in regard to their earnings. Erom the few speeches made on this subject last session, I had come to the conclusion that the Government intended bringing forward some scheme which would provide pensions for our blind folk. We know that if the [83] Government could, by any means, bring forward a measure to place pensions on a contributory basis, they would do so.",22
103,Mr MCDONALD,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,The Attorney-General said he would do it if he had his way.,22
104,Mr SHARPE,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"But he will not get his way in that matter. The people of Australia do not desire our aged people to contribute towards their pensions. There are many people in Australia who are drawing handsome pensions, and who have not contributed in any way to such pensions. No one objects to them drawing pensions, because, no doubt, they have rendered valuable service to the community, but their services were not more valuable than those which many of the old age pensioners rendered. They contributed all they possibly could to the country, and made it possible for the people following them to produce greater wealth and bear heavier taxation. The Government have an idea of introducing a Bill to provide pensions for members of the Militar y Forces, but our first duty is to see that our old-age pensioners are properly treated, seeing that to them we owe much of our present prosperity and the development of the country. That is why I say it would be a pity to allow Parliament to close without some reason being given by the Government as to why they are not making more adequate provision for the old-age pensioners.",22
105,Mr BOYD,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,The reason is that you would not allow us to do anything.,22
106,Mr SHARPE,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,Then why did the Government not resign?,22
107,Mr BOYD,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,Did you ever hear of a majority resigning?,22
108,Mr SHARPE,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"The Government had not a majority or they would have brought forward these measures. The matter of pensions was of a non-contentious character, and would have had the whole-hearted support of all members. c",22
109,Mr AGAR WYNNE,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"You talk that way, but I could not pass a two-clause Postal Amendment Bill last session.",22
110,Mr SHARPE,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"Muc h has been said regarding the rural workers, and during the passage of the Pensions Bill through the House of Commons those were the people who were referred to as requiring pensions more than any other class of worker. Their wages have been so poor that it has been impossible for the rural workers to save a penny, and, unfortunately, even in Australia many of the same class of workers are found in our benevolent asylums and charitable institufavorably tions. Many of our rural workers, who assisted to build our roads and bridges and railways, did not receive a sumcient wage to enable them to live in decency their old age. That is why they are glad today to be receiving the miserable tance which the Government are paying them. I hope that when our friends criticise the rural workers, as they done in the past, they will remember that the major portion of the people in instiGreat ° Britain . tutions are those who have worked on the land, but have not received sumcient wages to enable them to live in decency in their old age. That is certainly an argument island. in favour of providing better wages for the rura l workers. If the Government are not inclined to increase the old-age pensions by 2s. 6d. a week, they might well take into consideration the granting of 2s. a week to all old persons in instiand tutions. At present, the Government making a saving of 2s. a week out of these old persons. Our object should not to derive a benefit from the fact of these people living in homes. Our duty should be to allow them to have the money which they are justly entitled, and Government should see their way clear pay it .

111,Mr HOWE,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"Dalley) [3.52] - I make no apology for again addresing myself a question of such great importance the building of ships of war. I had not sufficient opportunity when speaking little while ago to develop my remarks. They are not prepared to do it . We are involved in the expenditure nearly a million of money on Cockatoo Island and the possibility of spending another £75,000 for the purchase and maintenance of machinery for the pur Mr. pose of making the dockyard efficient the matter of shipbuilding. There is siderable disruption and disagreement the island; the men are fighting the as heads in every way; and I wish to solve .the problem that is facing us. pleased that Senatoi' Milieu , the Minister of Defence, is endeavouring to arrive some solution of the trouble. The tion is: What line must be taken to arrive sideration. at it? The impression of the men on island is that the officials there are not do' not know where they stand. disposed towards naval shipbuilding in Australia. They are all men who have come out from Great B r it a in ; for instance, Mr K in g Salter, the manai n ger, who has come from Chatham with a high reputation- I have nothing to say pitagainst him-and others. The impression among the men is that these gentlemen are prejudiced, and wish in every way to have keep down naval shipbuilding in Australia, in order that it may be done m I cannot say whether that impression correctly states the position, but, at any rate, it accounts to some extent for the disruption upon the I have already said that men are leaving the dockyard. They are doing this because the conditions existing on Cockatoo Island are not those that they can obtain elsewhere, because the Australian practice is not the English practice, because Australian workmen are not are prepared to submit to conditions that, have been in operation in places in the be Old World , whether in a dockyard for naval shipbuilding or in a dockyard for mercantile shipbuilding, especially when to those conditions are laid down by men the who have not the Australian spirit. We to know that a man does a certain amount the of riveting per day. The new boss comes in along and says, "" I want fifty more toHe gets the fifty more, and also then he asks for another fifty. So the are being driven to desperation, and to many of those who are resenting this are importations, good - capable men, no doubt, who have come to ths country, to and who have been driven to their preas sent attitude by those who have reduced the dockyard to a condition of chaos and a strife. The men will not do this work. I of have already said that the Defence Department is responsible in a very large way for the delay that is taking place, and I am going to set myself against K in g Salter and even against the in administration of Cockatoo Island prior conto his advent. Much of the inability of on the dockyard to turn out the boats an effective fighting force is due not to the men, but to the Defence I am Department. I have been in close touch with the Minister of Defence for some at time, because tliere are certain features quesof work on the island that need conFirst, there is the question the of the framing of regulations. The men They have no status. They may he dismissed at any moment. Many of them who have had years of service are being gradually passed out, thrown on one side, and scrapped, as it were, for newcomers. How can we expect a body of Australian workmen to sit down and remain silent in circumstances such as those ? A man who has given good service to the dockyard naturally looks forward to some reasonable conditions under which he can work, but the introduction of new men and the displacement of the old hands create considerable trouble, about which the men are very justly complaining. The island can be well conducted if the Government are prepared to pay the wages that are prevailing outside. There is no dearth of labour in Australia, provided good wages are paid, but the Government will not pay proper wages, and therefore the men seek for them outside. I know the boilermakers very well, and, to some extent, I represent the engineers, and I know that if the Government attempt to interfere with the conditions that the trade unionists have built up in Australia for the betterment of the people, and that if an attempt is made by Mr K in g Salter or Senator Millen to introduce any system of labour into that dockyard that is not in harmony with those improved labour conditions that have been built up here, so surely will the dockyard go down, the men will not work, and I would be one of the first to associate myself with my fellows in the dockyard in saying, "" If you black list us, we shall make you black."" I have a copy of a document-it is supposed to be a secret one-whic h illustrates the methods attempted to be introduced at Cockatoo Island to bring the men under the whip, but which will not come about. there is the ordinary form issued to a man who is an applicant for work. is as follows: Name of applicantWhere last employedDepartmentDuration of employmentWagesName of foremanEvery applicant for employment in the Cockatoo Island dockyard must f i ll in that form, but here comes the sting and the black list, au evil of the past, which they are seeking to introduce in Australia.

Mr Cutler is a brained, thoroughly capable engineer, but for whom naval shipbuilding would never have been considered as a practical position in this country.

131,Sir JOHN FORREST,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,Yes .,26
132,Mr MCDONALD,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,Where is the Treasurer reported to have said that?,26
133,Sir JOHN FORREST,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,The honourable member can read it in Hansard.,26

137,Sir JOHN FORREST,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,I shall not bother to reply to them ,26
138,Mr MCDONALD,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"But we desire to know the actual facts. We shall tell If the country that the Treasurer, after being in office for twelve months, has landed the country in a deficit of £1,819,000. This experience, so far as he is concerned, is not a new one. A few years ago, when he took office as Treasurer, he inherited a surplus of £600,000, and-nine months later, when he retired from office, there was a deficit of £500,000. He now tells us that we shall close the present year with an estimated surplus of £800,000. How has that been obtained? In the first place, the Government have depleted to a very large extent the Old-age Pensions Fund. The Treasurer did not tell the House last week what the Government proposed to do in respect of the old-age pensions.",26
139,Sir JOHN FORREST,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,God forgive us if we have to listen to this sort of thing 1,26
140,Mr MCDONALD,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,The right honourable member will have to listen to a lot of it . I shall repeat this statement from every platform on which I stand during is not an the election campaign.,26
141,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,The honourable member ought to make sure that it is accurate. use Mr MCDONALD - It is more accurate than the statement which . the Treasurer made last week in asking for Supply.,26
142,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"Why not read what I said? The honourable member would rather misrepresent me. the - Mr MCDONALD - Did not the right honourable member say that it was estimated that there , would be a surplus of £824,305 on the year's transactions?",26
143,Sir JOH NFOBBEST,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,I explained that point full y. The honourable member can read what I said.,26
144,Mr MCDONALD,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"I have read the right honourable member's speech, and I say that he did not explain this point. If he chooses to quibble, I shall have no objection. It would seem that the Treasurer is following in the footsteps of other members of his party who make statements, and, when we seek to p in them down to tbem, try to run away from them.",26
145,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,The member is at it again.,27
146,Mr MCDONALD,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"I wish to get a statement of fact. The Treasurer is interrupting me so repeatedly that I have no hope of making a connected statement. I want to show that, according to the right honourable member's own statement, the revenue for the year just closing amounts to £21,462,000, and not, as he would have us believe, to over £23,000,000. The further point I wish to emphasize is that on the transactions of the financial year, during which the right honourable gentleman has been in charge of the Treasury, there is shown a deficit of £1,819,000. He told us f u r ther that, owing to the non-completion of certain work, an expenditure of £200,000 would go over as a commitment to next year. If that £200,000 had been expended, as provided for, there would have been a deficit of over £2,000,000 on the year's transactions. But there is more to come. surer told us that large reductions had been made in the military stores, and that large savings had been effected by him in the various Departments. did not tell us how those savings had been brought about. that they have been holding up a large number of works which should have been with. Instructions were given by the Government to the various Departments not to proceed with certain works which had been authorized. the year the Departments have been starved to such an extent that the ordinary expenditure will have to be considerably increased next year to restore their efficiency. The Postmaster-General told us the other day that, to bring his Department to the standard of efficiency that he desired, an expenditure of £4,000,000, spread over a period of four years, would be necessary. so, the Treasurer should have made provision for that additional expenditure.",27
147,Mr FALKINER,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,Why should it be necessary in view of all the money spent in previous years by the Labour party?,27
148,Mr MCDONALD,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"When the Labour Government took office, it found that the Departments had been starved. In the early years of Federation, we experienced a severe drought, and tliere was an almost insane desire on the part of the Parliahonorable ment- I shall not lay the blame at the door of any particular Government-to return to the States more than the three-fourths of Customs and Excise revenue to which they were entitled. Instead of spending on Commonwealth Departments what was necessary to keep them efficient, the Governments of the day cut down expenditure, and returned to the States, by way of surplus revenue, more than £6,000,000.",27
149,Mr FALKINER,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,But that cutting down should have been rectified by the way in which the Labour party spent the money.:,27
150,Mr MCDONALD,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"When the Labour party took office, they found it necessary to expend enormous sums to bring the various Departments to an efficient standard. We were not in office long enough to spend all that was necessary in that direction.",27
151,Mr RILEY,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,But we did not starve the Departments.,27
152,Mr MCDONALD,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"No . The present Government, on the other hand, has The Treastarved them to an unparalleled extent. We wish now to learn of the commitments of the present Ministry in respect of the coming year. The Treasurer did He not tell us what they were.",27
153,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,I did not make a The truth is secured by Budget speech.,27
154,Mr MCDONALD,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"The statement proceeded which the right honourable member made last week, then, was only in the nature of a preliminary canter?",27
155,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"That is all . During Mr MCDONALD - If we do not obtain from the Budget more information than was given us by the right honourable member last week, then heaven help the country. The Treasurer has admitted that we shall have to pay next year on account of the Navy, a sum of £200,000, which should have been paid this year. That is one commitment. Then the automatic annual increase in respect of oldI f that is age pensions is about £200,000 a year. Is that not correct? Sir JO HN FOBBEST - The honourable member knows more than I do.",27
156,Mr MCDONALD,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"That is understood. When the Treasurer makes a statement, we naturally expect him to know what he is talking ahout, hut he £23,000,000, leaving a admits now that he did not know what he £824,000. was talking about last week. The matic increase in respect of the maternity allowance next year will be about vent £150,000, and the automatic increase i respect of military defence at least £150,000. Under Admiral Henderson's scheme, the automatic increase in naval expenditure next year would be, I underhundreds stand, about £200,000, but I am putting it down at £150,000; while a moderate estimate of the increased expenditure the Federal Capital, if there is any honesty of purpose on the part of the vernment, is £200,000.",27
157,Mr FALKINER,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,It will cost that to the rabbits which the Labour party allowed to grow on the leasehold lands the Territory.,28
158,Mr MCDONALD,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"When I was there I saw men digging out the rabbits and wire netting the land, so that, I presume, by this time the rabbits have all been killed off. Returning to my estimate, i the Government's great scheme of developover ing the Northern Territory is proceeded with, next year there will probably be expenditure of £50,000 there apart altodo. gether from railway construction. These automatic increases and commitments to which I have referred total £1,100,000, aud, added to the deficit of £1,819,000, will bring us face to face with a deficit £2,919,000, less the alleged surplus of £824,000, which the Treasurer tells us in the Trust Funds. No matter what party is in power next year, the Government the day will have to provide for this. Why did not the Treasurer take the House into Ins confidence last week, and make a frank statement of the actual posivenue tion ? All this was carefully glossed over. cotton goods. The finances of this country-and no one knows it better than does the Treasurerare in a rotten condition. When the present Treasurer took office upon the retirement of the Fisher Administration, he said like there was a surplus of £200,000, and sum of £2,400,000 accumulated in the Trust Funds. He inherited that from the Labour Government. But the right honthat orable gentleman was not prepared to tell us last week that, on his own figures, there would be a deficit of £1,819,000 on it. the actual transactions of the present financial year. He tells us that the reafraid venue was £21,462,000, or, adding the accumulated surplus, about £24,000,000, while the expenditure was only about year ? surplus of I wish to know how the autoGovernment proposes to obtain the £2,000,000 which will be necessary to prea deficiency next year ? It will have n to raise loans for the construction of the east and west railway, which will eost several millions, and for the Northern Territory railway, which' will cost some of thousands of pounds. M i nisters will probably propose to pay for some of the defence works out of loan on money, but they cannot pay for all i u that way. Is it their intention to conGostruct the Navy, and to carry out military defence works, wholly with loan k ill money ? Of course, that may be so. The method of the Attorney-General when in Premier of Victoria was to reduce the old-age pensions. I hope that that method is not going to be adopted by this Government, though it is about the level of its standard of economy. I know what that Attorney-General did when Premier f of Victoria, and I know that his influence the Treasurer and the other members of the Cabinet is so great that they an will have to do what he tells them to If he says that' a saving is to be made on the old-age pensions and maternity allowance, it must be made. The Treasurer has declared that the greater part of the maternity allowance expendiof ture should be stopped, the allowance being given only to those considered deis serving. Thus he proposes, in order to square the ledger, to pauperize those who of take advantage of the beneficent piece of legislation passed by the Labour party.

164,Mr MCDONALD,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"Probably that is what the Treasurer intends. He belongs to a Government which brought about a dead-lock and strike on the transcontinental railway, to prevent money being paid out, building up a surplus by delaying the construction of the line.",29

170,Mr MCDONALD,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"The right honourable gentleman has looked very sorry. As the Postmaster-General is present, I should like to ask him a question, which I hope he is not too fared to answer. I wish to know why certain parts of Australia are given preference in the matter of telephone construction hy not being called upon to furnish the ordinary guarantees. I am very pleased to know that there is now a telephone line between Dalgety and Bendock, but I should like to be informed wby the persons interested were treated by the Department differently from the way in which persons in other districts were treated?",29

172,Mr MCDONALD,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"It is stated- I have here a newspaper cutting giving the particulars-that it was estimated that there would be a loss of from £20 to £25 on the line, and that the inhabitants of the district to be served were asked to guarantee £200, but that when there was a change of Government, the honourable member for Gippsland induced the Department to forego the guarantee. In nearly every other case in which application has been made for telephone construction, especially by honourable members of the Opposition, guarantees have been demanded from the districts interested, to meet any possible loss. Why was an exception made in the case of the district to which I have referred?",29

175,Mr THOMAS,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"Barrier) [4.46] There are one or two matters to which I wish to call the attention of the Postmaster-General. In last night's Herald, and this morning's Age and Argus, are published statements regarding payments made in Sydney in connection with a wireless telegraph plant. Some little while ago, during a debate in this chamber regarding the purchase of material by this Government without calling for tenders, the Postmaster-General interjected that the last Government carried out a great deal of work in connection with wireless telegraphy without calling for tenders, of which he had said nothing. I do not know whether the interjection referred to purchases from the Maritime Wireless Compaiy Limited, and shall be glad if the honourable gentleman will give us some information on the point. It is stated in the newspapers that Mr Haldane, the Chief Accountant of his Department, was «ent to Sydney to examine the books, and, according to the Herald-the statement does not appear in the Age or the Argus- Mr Haldane is of opinion that sufficient was not paid for the material obtained. We are told that the Government has now settled the matters in dispute. I should like to know whether anything more has been paid. I raise no objection to any increase in the payment if , after the examination of the books by Mr Haldane, it was thought right to increase it ; but I would point out that the facts show that the last Government made an arrangement which was not in any respect disadvantageous to the public. The Postmaster-General told the representatives of the Age and Argus that wherever possible he called for tenders for the supply of material. That was the practice of his predecessors. He said, too, that the business of the Department cannot be conducted expeditiously without occasionally purchasing material for the supply of which tenders had not been called. He told the press representatives that some of the material required is patented, and can be obtained only from one firm, and that other material is made only by one or two places in Australia, ancl that it - would be - waste of time to call for tenders for the supplying of it . I quite agree that that is so, and have nothing to say in criticism of the But in view of the interjection which the Postmaster-General made in this chamber some time ago, I shall be very glad if he will be good enough to give us a full explanation of this matter, because apparently what he said was a reflection upon either the late Postmaster-General or myself. I trust I will not be misunderstood in what I am about to say, but I am very much in favour of a M in ister attending the Madrid Postal Conference. If there had been no dissolution, and the present Postmaster-General had been going to the Conference, I think the Opposition would have given him a pair; but I am rather sorry that, whilst the honourable member for Balaclava intends to attend the Conference, he has stated that he does not intend to return to this Chamber. I am sufficiently a party man to admit that I would be very glad to see a Labour man capture the Balaclava seat, but if that could not be I should be glad to see the present Postmaster-General return. has announced definitely, however, that he will not stand for re-election, and I think it is unfortunate that the Government are to be represented at the Madrid Conference by one who will no longer be a member of the Ministry.",29

183,Mr AGAR WYNNE,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,I quite agree with but the difficulty cannot be overand to come without amending the Act.,30
184,Mr THOMAS,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"There are difficulties in the way, but it would be a 'good if some of those arbitrary lines I may menMany months ago, approval Was given to the construction of ata telephone line between the towns of a r Wentworth, in New South Wales, and Mildura, in Victoria. elapsed, and I received a from Wentworth asking when the connection with Mildura was to he effected. Apparently the Victorian portion Mildura to the River Darling had heen done, hut the New South portion had not. The was that a line built practically the Darling River was lying useless for some months, whilst waiting for the short connection with Wentworth I am not blaming the Postmaster-General, but I just mention this instance to show what things occur under the present system. I have communicated with the Department, and the result has been that tenders have been called for the completion of the line to connect with Mildura. Had it not been for the arbitrary State lines, the work, started from Mildura. would have been carried right on to Wentworth. is another matter I desire to call attention to. The present Government gone in for the building of a lot of these lines by contract instead of day labour. Last session a good deal of took place about the superiority of day labour over contract in connection the construction of telephone lines,"" the argument being that day labour was cheaper and more expeditious. vernment are now calling for tenders for the building of a lot of telephone which class of work was previously by day labour. I do not know what the result is in other constituencies, connection with two or three small lines in my own constituency I know that in the time wasted in calling for tenders work could have been done by the Department. The distance from to the River Darling is very short, hut the line has not been built, although the line for the 12 or 15 miles to has been completed. Had this been intrusted to day labour, it would have been completed long ago. another instance. For some time the residents of Menindie have desired direct telephone connection Broken HilT, a distance of from 60 to 70 miles. After the required guarantee was paid, the Department decided that the line should be built, and called for tenders. The Postmaster-General ness man, and no doubt has endeavoured Mr Thomas. Supply.

Balranald, and Euston. The telegraph poles are already standing, and for the laying of a single wire the Department are inviting tenders. It does seem to me that in the time that is wasted in calling for tenders, the work Wentworth could be done. I shall be glad if the Postmaster-General will look into that matter, when but I am more anxious to get some reply regarding the supply of wireless fittings There in Sydney. I was surprised a few days ago when the Prime Minister stated that have there was to be a double dissolution. I had no idea that the conspiracy of capitalism and privilege would be so successdiscussion f u l as to bring about a double dissolution. I venture to say that the outcome of this with double dissolution will be extremely far reaching. I had intended to express m y views upon this subject, but as an The Go- article in today's Age expresses them far more ably, I shall content myself by readlines, ing a portion of that articledone Just as people sometimes build better than they know, so they often destroy more than but in they had any conception of. The Federal Ministry, in getting the Senate dissolved over a dead-lock specially manufactured to that end, the has, without intending it, virtually made the House of Representatives supreme. For all future time, should Sir Ronald Munro FerguWentworth son's precedent be sustained, the Senate, as an independent authority, will be abolished, or at least rendered a nullity. Any party GovernMildura ment of the day, as long as responsible governwork ment may continue, can drill the Senate into submission by presenting to it some obnoxious measure, and compel it to accept the same There is under the penalty of a dissolution. The manconsiderable ner in which this coup has been effected virtually annihilates the Senate as an independent voice of the people. It may be surmised that with the majority of Ministerial followers had no idea of what they were doing when creating their artificial dead-lock. All that they probably saw was a means to an end of breaking up a powerful Labour majority in the Senate. For this single purpose the expedient was not is a busi- without its merits, since Labour could scarcely hope, in the balance of parties in the constituencies, to maintain such a lop-sided House as that which exists at present of twenty-nine Labourites to seven Fusionists. But little as the Conservatives guessed at the radical nature of the change they were bringing about, the Attorney-General was fully aware of it . Nor has he been guilty of any concealment about it . When he went down to Warrnambool some few months since, he gave the cue to what was in his thoughts, in presenting a forecast of the extinction of the Senate as a part of the Constitution. then showed how very little use to the people the Senate is, and asked the electors to contemplate its being set aside as an expensive encumbrance. Liberals who have growing doubts about the value of the bicameral system did not affect to be horrified at Mr . Irvine's plain indication of the direction in which his aspirations were travelling. Conservatives blenched a little, but forbore anything more than a mild expostulation. What the true reformer of Parliament sees is that, with the more direct association of the people with legislation through the means of the referendum and elective Ministries, there is not much need for a second Chamber of Review. The referendum makes the people themselves perpetual reviewers of the work of Parliament, and the experience of the world is that the populace can do the work more cheaply and - effectively than any second Chamber can do it . There will not, tlierefore, be any cause for wailing amongst true reformers over the fate which has overtaken, not only this Senate, but all other Senates, in being made, as the Governor General has made it , a cipher in the Constitution. But, for all that-far-reachin g and perhaps salutary as this action of the Government and the Governor General may become-the change has been brought about by quite improper means. A great alteration in the Constitution, as this must prove if the Governor General's - fiat be consummated, should have been put to the people in proper form, and adopted only after their verdict had been given. No Minist r y, or majority in one Chamber, in concert with the Vice-Regent, ought to have any right or power to radically modify the Constitution -.as it stands. We have only to reverse in - thought the state of political parties to how full of significance this argument is. us suppose a Senate with a large majority of ""Liberals and Conservatives in it . In an equal balance of parties and a defective electoral such as now exists, that contingency is just likely as the present one. If there were a large Labour majority in the House of Representa_ tives, such as came in in 1910, and a large 'Conservative majority in the Senate, such may at any time occur under present condineed tions, the Labour House of Representatives w be able to treat the Conservative Senate nullity by holding over it the threat of a dissolution. The argument is too clear need any reinforcement. In that case it ' become conspicuous that the on legislation has been abolished. The proposal put forward by Mr Irvine in Warrnam-bool will have been effected. In servatism will see that it builded in reform - far better than it knew. I have not time to elaborate these views, which represent mine. A little while ago, at an Australian Natives' Association Conference, I spoke about the non-necessity for sending State Governors to Australia, and Mr ""Watt, who was the Premier of Victoria until yesterday, in criticising my remarks at Malvern, said that He I had stated that Governors should be born, bred, and elected in Australia. I may explain that at the conference to which 1I have referred I was dealing with State Governors. I said that I could agree with that part of the programme The of the Australian Natives' Association that said that Governors should not be sent to us from the Motherland. I pointed out that prior to Federation I had not held that view, but that since Federation I did not consider it necessary for State Governors to be sent to us from the Motherland. I said that they should be elected, not merely from those born in Australia, but also from those' who had come to Australia many years previously, and rendered long and distinguished service to Australia. Then I went on to say that while I did not in any way commit myself to the views I was about to express, in view of what had been done, and in view of the tremendous effect of the decision of the Governor General upon our Constitution, the views of the Prime Minister of Australia, Mr Cook, were worthy of being considered. And I quoted what those views were. These are the words of the present Prime MinisterNow I take leave to dispute that statement altogether. It docs not follow at all that to have parliamentary government we must have a Governor General appointed by the authorisee ties in England. . . . It seems to me that Let the better way to harmonize colonial with I m perial interests would be to allow the people of the colonies to select a Governor General of law their own, who would be in touch with the as aspirations of those people, who would know what their prejudices and aspirations are, what their conditions of life arc, more intimately and closely, by reason of his having lived here as a great number of years himself. And this not necessarily interfere with the governi l l ment as we know it to exist under the Crown. as a It would not do so. I venture to say that we penal should have a littl e less friction created into the machinery of government if permission would were given to the colonies to elect their own Senate as a check Governor General.  that day ConCook's views prior to Federation.",30
185,Mr THOMAS,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"Yes ; they were expressed during a debate in the New South ""Wales Parliament. I said that, without committing myself to those views, they were worthy of being considered. I do not think that it was out of the way for me to say that.",32
186,Mr RILEY,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"South Sydney) [5.16]. - During the reign of the present Government I have not been able to get any satisfaction in the matter of postal accommodation for the district I represent. There is urgent need for a post-office at Botany, and there has been a great deal of correspondence over it. If I go to the Home Affairs Department I am told that the matter is in the hands of the Postmaster-General. If I go to the Postmaster-General he ;smiles, and says, "" I shall do what I can,"" and then in a few days tells me that the matter is in the hands of the Home Affairs Department. Between the two Departments I can get no satisfaction. At the Kensington end of my district there is also ungent need for a new post-office. It is a growing residential suburb of Sydney, and the people there are anxious to have facilities for doing their business and telegraphic communication. No finality, however, can be ;got from the present Ministry. The same remarks apply to a post-office site that was almost decided upon before the last Ministry went out of office. Tenders had been called for a site, and they had been received, but twelve months have gone by and nothing has been done. The Prime Minister, as head of the Department of Home Affairs, has the assistance of the Honorary Minister and the Vice President of the Executive Council, but yet there is nothing but chaos in the Department. It is time Parliament bad some explanation as to wby there is this chaos. Ministers .are trying to save money so that they can show a decent financial statement when the Treasurer comes to explain his financial proposals.  uot believe that story.",33
187,Mr RILEY,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"I think I can persuade my constituents to believe it. In the whole of 'the district I represent there has not been a shilling spent by the present Government, whereas during the time of the Eisher Government two urgently required post-offices were built, and the Department were making provision for others. The present Government have come into starve public works. They have refused to vote the money to carry on the services of the Commonwealth, and so far as Sydney is concerned, they have done nothing towards its progress, nor that of my particular district.",33
188,Mr AGAB WYNNE,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,There has been more money spent in Sydney than in any other part of Australia.,33
189,Mr RILEY,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"I represent a very large part of Sydney, and I can assure the Postmaster-General that I have heard nothing but growls from my constituents because things cannot be done. I do not blame the Postmaster-General-h e does his best-bu t between the Postal Department and the Department of Home Affairs there is something wrong. No matter what Government comes into power after the next election, in place of allowing the two Departments to fool away time in selecting sites and getting valuations and having repor.ts sent along, a Committee should be appointed to do the work without taking up all the time that the two Departments now waste upon doing it. If I wish to buy a piece of land I go to look at it, and if it suits me, I buy dt. But, of course, that cannot be done by a Minister; and, consequently, there is much correspondence, red-tape, and expense.  same under the Labour Government?",33
190,Mr RILEY,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"It is 100 per cent, worse now.",33
191,Mr FALKINER,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,There are the same lot of officers.,33
192,Mr RILEY,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"If the officers are under instructions to keep down expenses, I do not blame them.",33
193,Mr FALKINER,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,Then the Government are not spending all the millions of money that they have been accused of spending ?,33
194,Mr RILEY,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"The Government may be spending .millions on the Defence side, but not on the Post Office. Twelve months ago there were over 600 men employed in the Federal Territory, but we were told .hy the Honorary Minister the other day that over 200 less are now there. I do not see why this should be, because on the last Estimates we voted £200,000 for the development of the Territory. At the present time, liowever, there is a lack of employment.there, and no real advance with the work has been made, although Mr Griffin has been.appointed as the head of the .architectural branch. The brickworks, which are only of a temporary character, under an old and expensive system, are almost suspended; and altogether there seems to be no management in the Territory. There is a compact with the people of New South Wales, and it was canned out, as far as possible, by the late Government. Parliament has never grudged money for this purpose; but, although the Government have been twelve months in office, we have almost a state of chaos. I protest against the people's money being spent on roads where the traffic is so little as to permit of the grass growing. should like to suggest that workmen's cottages be provided in the Territory, so that the men may not be obliged: to live in tents during the present very cold weather: They are prepared to pay rent for proper housing, the provision of which would induce them to take their wives and families, there, and thus help to swell, the population within the area. The Government, however, are trying to save money, and thus we find an unemployed' trouble brewing, not only there, but in all the laTge cities. A Government whose only policy is to "" mark time "" ought to be sent about its business. When the honourable member for Darwin was M in ister of Home Affairs, the ]3resent Prime Minister and the Honorary Minister constantly attacked him for not pushing forward the public works at the Federal Capital; but those honourable gentlemen are now dumb, and it is only right that the public should be made aware of the apathy of the Government. When the Fisher Government were in power, they passed a Workmen's Compensation Act, on a non-contributory basis, under which a workman who was injured received two-thirds of his wages, while, in case of death,, his dependants were given a grant of from £ 2 00 to £500. A man from my district was employed to go on a barge to the Northern Territory,, and at the port of destination he was drowned. I placed the . facts before the Minister, pointing out that there was a widow and. small family without means, and suggested the advisability of putting the Act in force; I received the reply that the matter would be inquired into, and, later, when I asked the reason for. delay, I wasinformed in another letter that thelaw authorities considered that the woman had no case. I do not think that it is right for the G'overnment, under such circumstances, to take advantage of any legal flaw, having, regard to the intention of Parliament when the Act was passed. It certainly is not creditable on the part of the Government to flout an Act of Parliament in the way they have done; but, although personally and otherwise, I have kept this case to the front , I have not been able to obtain justice for these poor people. I can only say that I shall make as much use as I can of this case when I am before the electors. The Labour party are looking forward witli pleasure to the coming election, because they firmly beI lieve that it will result in a change of Government, thus affording an opportunity for the prosecution of a vigorous, strong policy, with ' the object of developing the resources of the countiry.. Members on this side would be only too anxious to assist the Government in any progressive legislation; but, as we know, none has been introduced;, and, therefore, it is quite time that the way was made for others with, capacity and a record for work. During, the tliree years of the Labour Government, the prosperity of all the States was unparalleled, and, notwithstanding, the great in flux of immigrants; the country was able to absorb and. find employment for. ail.' It is certainly significant that when we' have a reactionary Government in power we should, for the first time, see an. unemployed difficulty looming ahead. It reflects no credit on any Minister to so conduct the business of his Department as to retard the employment of the people, for this only means a lessening of the-production of wealth. There seems now to have arrived a period of stagnation.",33
195,Mr FALKINER,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"That is because all the immigrantswho came in under the Labour regime, to the number of 50,000,. are in the towns.",34
196,Mr RILEY,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"If the honourable: member and other pastoralists. are prepared to pay a decent living wage, they will find men quite willing to live and work in the country. In the dairying, districts, however, we find that men are paid from 15s. to 17s. per week, and are asked to live, like cattle, in sheds.",34
197,Mr MASSYGREENE,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"Where , is that done?",34
198,Mr RILEY,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,In the honourable member's own district.,34

201,Mr AGAR WYNNE,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"BalaclavaPostmaster-General) [5.34] - I am very sorry that the honourable member for rier has asked me to deal with the wireless telegraphy business. I have made comments on the position up to the present; and, but for the special attention drawn be done. to it by the honourable member, I should have considered the short report I gave the newspapers as much as I was justified in making public. A sum of something like £24,000 has been paid to the Mariments, time Wireless Company of Sydney. The late Government, without calling for tenders, entered into a contract with that profit. company for the supply of plant and chinery. No provision was made in the contract that the machinery should be lost money. manufactured in Australia, as to the of wages, or the employment of and other foreign labour, or for any penalties. A large part of the machinery supplied to the Government was not secret at all, and was imported from America. Upon an investigation of the books we found that very large profits were made in respect of the imported goods. In addition to that a sum of £2,250 was given to the company ostensibly to assist them in the purchase of machinery; but since settled with the company. it was not a vote by Parliament. company received it by way of amounts added to the accounts that they rendered. To one account there would be an addiported tion of £ 5 0 , while to another an addiin tion of £ 1 5 0 would be made. I do not think that that was a reasonable or fair way of making a grant to the pany. If the Government thought it necessary to give them assistance should have provided for it on the Estipatents. mates, instead of hiding it away, by on adding these amounts to accounts that  master-General, Mr Thomas, do that on in the his own initiative?",35
202,Mr AGAR WYNNE,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"I am not going to refer specifically to any one. I did not wish to deal with the matter, but to I have been forced to speak of it since n the the honourable member for Barrier asked that I should make a full explanation of in the Some time ago the managing is director of this company told me that he that was unable to obtain from the Department a sum of £4,000, which, he said, was owing to him. I said to him, "" I cannot understand these grants that you have been receiving; I believe that we have been overcharged, but if you will allow Mr Haldane, the chief accountant of the BarDepartment, who is at present in Sydney, to examine your books, I shall no be prepared to make a settlement upon his report."" He agreed that this should Mr Haldane examined the books, and found that, whilst considerable profits had been made by the Maritime Wireless Company on the imported goods, it had carried on certain experipartly in its own interests and partlv in the interests of the Department, in connection with which it had made no On the imported goods it had mamade a large profit, but on the material which was made locally it had actually Taken as a whole, the rate transactions had not yielded them any Asiatic profits worth speaking of. _ Mr HUGHES - What was the proportionate value of the imported goods to that of the locally-manufactured goods?",35
203,Mr AGAR WYNNE,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"Speakin g at random, I should say that the value of the imported goods represented nearly two-thirds of the whole. Upon receipt of Mr Haldane's report I had an adjustment of the accounts, and we have Much The has been made of the desirableness of insuring secrecy in the manufacture of these goods, but the fact is that the imgoods could have been obtained England as well as other countries.

205,Mr AGAR WYNNE,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"That is the allegation. Father Shaw says that he is the inventor of a certain apparatus, which Mr Balsillie has used, whereas Mr Balsillie says exactly the reverse. That is a question which they must fight out between themselves. It is not a Government matter, and I am not in terfering with it .",36
206,Mr FENTON,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,Coul d that machinery have been manufactured here ?,36
207,Mr AGAR WYNNE,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"Yes ; some machinery of the same class has since been manufactured here. The honourable member for Barrier also dealt with the question of postal districts. I agree with him that if we could disregard State boundaries in this matter an improvement would be effected. At present, if any trouble arises connection with the Department at Broken Hill , a letter has to be sent through Adelaide and Melbourne to the Sydney office, and has then perhaps to be returned to Melbourne to be dealt with finally. Surely it should be possible to make Broken Hill the administrative centre of the district! And so with Deniliquin and Albury. A l b u ry might be made the centre of a postal district extending 50 miles into Victoria, and 50 miles into New South Wales. At present, however, each State is dealt with separately. Some time ago, in connection with certain work at Albury, there was a shortage of material, and a delay of sometliing like two months occurred in obtaining supplies from Sydney. sent to the Sydney office were overlooked, and there was a shortage of stock there. On the other hand, we had plenty of the required material in Melbourne, and when I learnt of the facts I wanted to know why the stock had not been obtained from this city. I was told at once that it was a New South Wales matter, since A l bury was in that State. I have given in structions, however, that in such circumstances material is to be obtained from the nearest available source. It is, after all, only a question of bookkeeping and of subsequent adjustment between the State branches of the Department. As to the question of calling for tenders for works, to which the honourable member for Barrier referred, I may explain that the practice I follow is to obtain first of all an estimate of the value of a work proposed to be carried out, and then to invite tenders for it . If the tenders are higher than the departmental estimate, I cause the work to be carried out by day labour; but if they are lower, I accept a tender for the work.' The honourable member for Ballarat asked me a question regarding the cost of undergrounding wires in that city. In that case the tenders were something like 25 per cent, higher than the departmental estimate, whereas in connection with an Adelaide work the tenders were below the departmental estimate. Taken aa a whole, I think that the system works very well.",36
208,Mr THOMAS,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,But I was dealing with the time wasted.,36
209,Mr AGAR WYNNE,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,There is no doubt tha'E work is done by contract quicker than by the Department.,36
210,Mr THOMAS,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,But while it was adverin tising for tenders for a work the Department could carry it out.,36
211,Mr AGAR WYNNE,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"No . In New South Wales, the Department is eighteen months in arrears with its works. If we do not call for tenders for them, we shall not be able to make up this lost ground. We have not sufficient engineers and other officers to supervise the carrying out of all such works by the Department.",36
212,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,But does not the Department have an officer to supervise work done by tender!,36
213,Mr AGAR WYNNE,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"We have an overseer on every job, but in New South Wales at present we have not sufficient officers to enable the Department to carry Letters out all these works, and therefore, if honourable members desire telephone and telegraph lines to be constructed in tlieir districts, they must put up with the tender system whether they like it or not. As to the complaint made by the honourable member for South Sydney, I may say that when I was last in Sydney I paid a visit to Kensington, which is in his electorate, and found there was room for postal improvements there. There ought to be a new post-office. I may say, however, that I have been endeavouring to give the first call to people in the back-blocks who are without postal facilities. At the present time, when a district which has, say, an allowance post office, begins to grow, the municipal council quickly agitates for a post-office. The allowance post-office is no longer thought good enough for the district, and eventually a new post-office is built . Then a deputation of councillors asks what is going to be done for the allowance postmaster or postmistress, who, because of the provision of an oflicial post-office, ceases to be employed by the Department.",36
214,Mr MATHEWS,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,That sort of thing takes place in rural rather than in urban - districts.,37
215,Mr AGAR WYNNE,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"No . happened at Sandringham, a suburb of Melbourne, and at various places round Sydney. It is rather unfortunate that many of these allowance omcers who have been doing the work for ten or twenty years, and have built up a good business for the Department, should lose their positions as soon as an official post office is created.",37
216,Sir JOHN FOKEEST,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,It is very hard on them.,37
217,Mr BENNETT,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,Can they not pass an examination ?,37
218,Mr AGAR WYNNE,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,They usually shut out by the regulation imposing an age limit. Reference was also made to my proposed visit to Madrid. I candidly admit that I am not at all anxious to go.,37
219,Mr HUGHES,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"Go , by all means.",37
220,Mr AGAR WYNNE,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"The Government, however, think that Australia should be represented at the Madrid Conference, and I propose, therefore, to retain my present office u n t i l after the next election, so that I may attend in a representative capacity. There are several important questions to be discussed. One of these, which relates to the reduction of foreign postage on letters, will affect Australia very materially. Its adoption would involve us in a loss of from £50,000 to £100,000 a year, and for that reason I do not propose to support it . We have to look to ourselves, and cannot afford to be too generous to outside people. It is proposed that we shall carry an ounce of mail matter for the price that we are now charging for half-an-ounce. If that reform were adopted in respect of foreign letters we should be asked to do the same in respect of the local service. The Postal Department is losing something like £500,00 0 a year, and it is not fair to ask the people to submit to taxation in order to permit of concessions abroad.",37
221,Mr THOMAS,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,It is the rather than the Postal Branch of the Department that is a losing service.,37
222,Mr AGAR WYNNE,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,It sliould not be a losing service. The cost of management in Sydney amounts to £ 4 2s. 8d. in respect of every £ 4 received from a telephone.,37
223,Mr HUGHES,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,That is without the calls? It has Mr AGAR WYNNE - Yes .,37
224,Mr HUGHES,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"Allowin g for calls, what is the position ?",37
225,Mr AGAR WYNNE,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"E v e n then there is a loss. A Departmental Committee is at present obtaining very valuable information in Sydney on the subject. I propose to visit Sydney next week, and to go fro m there to Brisbane to inquire into certain postal matters. I shall then reporb to Parliament, and I trust that the information that I shall be able to obtain will be of considerable value to my successor.",37

His statement with regard to the Maritime Wireless Company, however, seems to leave room for censure upon that company, and I therefore ask him to supply us with the actual amounts paid for imported and locally-made goods. The honourable gentleman said that two-thirds' of the total value of the transactions were in respect of importations.",37
227,Mr AGAK WYNNE,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,That is making a guess.,37
228,Mr HUGHES,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,I am informed that the importation is relatively small.,37
229,Mr AGAK WYNNE,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,I do not assert that I am correct.,37
230,Mr HUGHES,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"I do not pretend to speak with precision, but my information is that about £2,000 worth is imported, and about £29,000 manufactured locally. I hope that the Postmaster-General will supply the Committee with accurate particulars. The loss made by the Telephone Branch is a matter for regret, but we are becoming case-hardened to the complaints about that Department. The honourable member for Barrier attempted to put it on a business basis, and, if a loss is occurring now, there mnst have been a very much greater loss then. It s operations ought to be on a business footing. Telephone I am glad to have the assurance of the Postmaster-General that the day-labour system is not the hideous conspiracy to plunder the public that it has been described by interested politicians, but that, on the contrary, it is often the best and cheapest means of getting work done. Coming now to another matter: On the 28th May last, I stated that the method of dealing with applications for employment uncier the Home Affairs Department at Jervis Bay was opposed to, and destructive of, the alleged policy of the Government, upon which Ministers had secured the simultaneous dissolution of both Houses. It has been reiterated repeatedly by Ministers that no distinction has been, and would be, made between applicants for employment who belonged to industrial or other organizations, and other applicants. On the 28th May I read to the House letters which completely shattered that position, and so that I may deal with the subject now to better advantage, I shall read those letters again to the Committee. The first letter is as follows:Commonwealth of Australia. DEPARTMENT OF HOME AFFAIRS. Resident Engineer's Office, Naval College, Jervis Bay, Memorandum for I am in receipt of your application for employment, dated the 10th instant, and should glad if you would furnish me with the name of your union and also further particulars cf your experience. (Sgd.) The Attorney-General asked, "" B y whom was that written?"" I repliedBy the Resident Engineer- Mr Jeffrey is, I think, the name; but the name is not so important as the astounding nature of the communication. I venture to say that in the history of the Commonwealth Public Service this is absolutely unique. On the 19th of the same month there came from the same gentleman to this applicant the following communication :"" In reply to your application for employment here, I have to inform you that there are no vacancies at present. Your name has, however, been filed for future reference."" The Minister was admittedly a little disturbed by this revelation, and inquiries were promised. On the 10th June, the honourable and gallant member for North Sydney addressed a series of questions on the subject to the Minister of Home Affairs, to which replies were furnished by the Assistant Minister. We must assume that these replies afford the only explanation possible of the amazing gulf between the protestation and the performance of Ministers; between their platform oratory and their administration. The first question asked was1. Why was the applicant asked for the name of his union T This is the answerSmith was asked for the name of his union, because in his letter to the Resident Engineer, while stating that he was a unionist, he did not state to which of the two unions he belonged. There are two painters' unions in Sydney. I am informed that there is a federated body registered throughout Australia under the name of the Federated House and Ship Painters Paperhangers and Decorators' Employees of Australasia. A disagreement occurred, and the New South Wales branch then registered under the State Act in the name of the Amalgamated House and Ship Painters Paperhangers and Decorators' Employees Association of New South Wales. The federated body then formed another branch in New South Wales, which, I understand, has not yet obtained registration. That explanation was put forward with all seriousness by a Minister whose Government has made the prohibition of preference the corner stone of its appeal to the people, and has secured the infliction on this Parliament of the severest 12th May, 1914. penalty that could be imposed for daring to question its sincerity and its action in l>e this matter. We are now gravely assurad that the reason why Ministers have abandoned their principles and broken their pledges, is that there are two unions, one of which is a federated body. What an astounding anti-climax! Professing to recognise no union, and to refuse preference to any unionist, they yet meticulously inquire which union an applicant belongs to! Public money is to be expended, we are told by Ministers, without regard to anything except the value given by the employees to the Government. "" Naval College, "" 19th May, 1914. Neither creed, colour, political opinions, membership of an industrial association, nor anything else has any influence in the making of appointments. That being so, why was this man asked whether be belonged to a union? That he was asked such a question damns the Government's position. We are told that the question was asked because there are two unions, and a man might have been appointed who belonged to the wrong one. What can the question mean if it does not mean that the Government wished to ascertain whether the man belonged to a union? It was found that he did belong to a union, and lie was turned down. Those two facts are perfectly well established. Another applicant, who belonged to a union, did not say so, and was appointed. Under the Constitution, no discrimination is to be made because of any one's religious belief. What would be thought if an applicant for employment were asked, "" What religion are you? Not that we want to know, because we do not care two straws, but you might belong to the wrong religion."" Membership of a union, we are told, has nothing to do with the making of appointments to the Public Service. ""Sheep and goats are treated alike. Why then was the question asked? Why, indeed! The only reply that suggests itself to the fertile minds of the Minister in charge of the Department- I suppose Mr Jeffrey is still there; unhappily it would be impossible to sack him even for this f r i g h t f u l indiscretion-appear s from the following questions and answers2. Was Smith's application subsequently refused T The answer is "" Yes."" 3. If so, whyf Answer Because, in the opinion of the Resident Engineer, his statement of experience was not satisfactory. The reply sent to Smith was on a stereotyped form to the effect that there were no vacancies at present. Then comes question 4Is it correct, as stated by the honourable member for West Sydney, that the late Government never asked the name of an applicant's union ? To that the reply was givenUnder the late Government the Works Branch was instructed to write to or inquire of the Secretary of any Trade Union if any men were required, or if men applied at the office they were asked whether they belonged to a union. The last Government had a right to ask whether an applicant was a unionist or not. It believed in preference to unionists, and it acted in accordance with its beliefs. It did not announce that preference would not be given to unionists, and then ask whether a man is a unionist before appointing him! This ment says of preference, "" We will not touch, taste, nor handle the accursed thing."" All applicants are to be treated alike. Why then was Smith asked, "" Do you belong to a union?"" and why, when he had replied, ""Yes,"" was he turned Mr Hughes. down? We are told that he was turned down because he had not sufficient experience. What had the name of his union to do with that? Suppose I were applying for a position, say, as paperhanger or undertaker-that after the election I may officiate at the political obsequies of my esteemed and distinguished friends opposite, is the one thing that bears me up in the hour of our affliction-and being asked my religion, I replied, "" I am a Primitive Methodist."" What would be said if the reply was, "" Had you been any other kind of Methodist, it would be all right, but a Primitive Methodist will not do, because it is proved by the factj of your being a Primitive Methodist that you have not sufficient experience at your business ' ' ? That is absurd, but not more so than the so-called explanation of my honourable friend. The letter means this, if it means anything at all. Smith was asked which of the two unions he belonged to. This long and meandering dissertation on the internecine struggles of these two unions is f r i g h t full y interesting, but absolutely irrelevant. W h at does the departmental reply mean ? That Smith's experience, or lack of it , is adduced from the fact that he belonged to the wrong union. Could any honourable member tell what experience a man has or has not by the fact that he belonged to this or other union, or this or other religion? Such a thing, is absolutely absurd. It is a perfectly proper thing to ask a man what his experience is, but it is a perfectly improper thing to ask a man what union he belongs to, when the Government do not believe in preference to unionists of any sort. The question continuedIs it correct, as suggested by the honourable member for West Sydney, that every applicant for employment is now asked the name of his union f And the Minister's reply wasNo, it is not correct. The Government has no_ objection to its employees belonging to anions, and throws absolutely no bar in the way of the employment of unionists. The principle of every artisan having an equal opportunity for Government employment is the only Govern- innovation it has introduced. An instance of this is the case of the employment of Painter C. York at Jervis Bay mentioned below. The charge was that the resident engineer asked this man Smith what union he belonged to, and the answer now is, "" We do not care whether you belong to a union or not. "" But that is not the answer the Minister gave. He says it was most important to know which of the two unions he belonged to. Then we are told the late Government sent out these same notices, and what of it? It was right that we should do so, because we believe in unionism. But they do not. How comes it that the Government, after being in office for twelve months, sent out a notice asking a man what union he belonged to? is perfectly obvious on the face of their own statement that the Government lack courage to tur n down unionists as such, and are making a hollow pretence of disci imiuating between unions, which is an odious thing to do, and which they have no right to do. I do not know anything at all about these two unions. I have not heard of any quarrel between them, and, indeed, that is not a matter which concerns us. All we are concerned with is whether Smith is a competent painter. No evidence has been adduced to show that he was not, but the evidence is clear that he was a member of a union. York, also, was asked whether he was a member of a union, but he did not say ""Yes."" He knew the Government, so he said nothing. Like Br'er Fox, he "" lay low,"" and he has got a job. Smith told the truth in saying that he belonged to a union, and he was told, "" Because you belong to the wrong union, we shall not employ y o u . "" I do not want to delay the Committee any longer. I am taking up the Government's own statement of the case. That is the best defence they can give. They do not deny that, practically twelve months after the Government took office, this man Smith was asked to what union he belonged. If they say that they were using the same forms as were used by their predecessors, that answer is absolutely no excuse for doing what they did. A man is charged with larceny, and he pleads that, "" The man who used to live in this place before is doing seven years for larceny; he has only been out of the house about twelve months, and it is very hard, to get out of the ways of those who went before us."" That is the kind of defence the Honorary Minister makes. He does not deny that Smith was asked if he belonged to a union, and that he was turned down: but he states that the man was turned down because, in the opinion of the resident engineer, his statement of experience was not satisfactory. The statement of the resident engineer, so far as it is expressed in the correspondence, is that the real reason why Smith was turned away was that he belonged to the wrong union. The Government were afraid to engage a man who belonged to the weak union, lest the men belonging to the other union should leave them. It is to this pitiable extremity that my honourable friends are reduced. They It face nothing. They side step every difficulty. The idea of preference to unionists is repugnant to their souls, but they have no objection to unionism; far from it-excepting , of course, in certain circumstances. I will leave it to the electors of this country to decide between us. There the matter stands, and no further explanation by my honourable friends can get over the facts I have given. Those letters remain as proof positive of the reliance that is to be placed upon the statements, promises, and platform mouthings of my honourable friends.",37
231,Mr KELLY,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"Wentworth-Assistant Minister of Home Affairs) [6.10] - The honourable member for West Sydney has made a characteristically amusing statement in regard to this matter, and in a characteristic declamatory way he said that he was content to allow the charge to stand where it is, and allow the people of Australia to deal with it . I hope that by the time this matter has been properly considered, apart altogether from rhetorical tricks and amusing distortion, the public will say that this charge does not stand, any more than any other of the charges we have been hearing lately, but that this charge lies. And I am going to show honourable members why. I would remind honourable members that when this matter was brought before this House on a previous occasion it was then the Government, and the Minister especially, who were charged with giving preference to non-unionists. The Government and the Minister personally were held to be responsible, and to have personally connived at this most atrocious of all forms of preference - preference to artisans who would not join and subscribe to the unionist movement. That charge was repudiated immediately by Ministers in this House, and, in view of the statement to which we have just listened, I take it that that charge is absolutely and entirely withdrawn; for the honourable gentleman referred all through to what a resident engineer distant 500 miles from Melbourne had done, and he suggested in one of his utterances that this man should have been "" sacked "" for doing such a thing ! It is no longer the Government, but a Government oflicer, who is held wholly and solely responsible for all the trouble. However, I pass from that point. I desire now only to say that when the country finds its ears tickled with the statement that the Government have been giving preference to non-unionists, I would like the statement of the honourable member, who is the president of the new union which has been recently formed, to weighed side by side with the constant charges made by the secretary of that union, the honourable member for Cook, who for many weeks has been accusing me in this House of having given a stronger and more straight out preference to unionists than any previous Government have ever given! One honourable member, who is president of the union, accuses me of giving preference to non-unionists, and so that honourable members opposite may toss the doubleheaded penny with complete success, another honourable member, who is secretary of the same union, accuses me of going to the other extreme, and giving preference to unionists to an extent never previously attempted. I only refer to this in passing, because it is now admitted that whatever charge the honourable gentleman may attempt to out of the letters of the men and the answers of the Resident Engineer, he now, by his very utterances, confesses that the primal charge against Ministers was unfounded, and ought not to have been made. Now let me look into the question of discrimination between unions. honourable member for West asks, "" What haa it to do with the works oflicer whether a man belongsto one union or another union?"" not want to say anything that damage one union as against another, York! and for that reason, until the honourable gentleman has driven me to it, I have not said orsuggested anything that would' have had anysuch effect. But I will say just this, that there are painters and Mr Kelly. painters, as the honourable gentleman knows j there are ship painters and house painters. When one wants house painters he does not want ship painters. In one of these unions there is a greater number of ship painters proportionately than in. the other union. The application of the man Smith opened with the statement that he had started his training in the Brooklyn Navy Yards, United States of America, and thereby showed conclusively that that man was by origin a ship painter and not a house painter.",40
232,Mr HUGHES,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,Did you want a ship painter or a house painter?,41
233,Mr KELLY,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,A house painter. And the man's application justified the assumption that he was by origin a ship painter. be Mr HUGHES - What has his origin to do with the question?,41
234,Mr KELLY,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,It created a reasonable assumption in.the mind of the Resident Engineer that the man belonged to a particular branch of the painters' trade whichdeals specially with ship painting.  who paints a ship could not paint a house?,41
235,Mr KELLY,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"I do not say that he cannot cover a house with paint, but he cannot do that class of work as well as a regular house painter. ",41
236,Mr KELLY,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"I am informed by the works officer that the sole idea underlying the request to know which of the two unions the man belonged to was that one union contained a greater proportion twist of ship, painters than the other.",41
237,Mr HUGHES,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,But York belonged totlie same union as Smith.,41
238,Mr KELLY,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"Q u it e so, but otherwisehis references are satisfactory. I havestated how the letter happened to bewritten, and I also told the honourable member that the works officer stated that The one of these unions, to which both tbese Sydney men belonged, bad been providing b i m with men, some of whom had. been, unsatisfactory. They were not the sort of I did painters that were wanted.. might Mr HUGHES,-After that, vou took Mr KELLY . : - No , "" before "" that w e took York.",41
239,Mr HUGHES,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,You took York twenty-one days after. That is your own. statement.,41
240,Mr KELLY,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"If honourable members will cast their minds back they will remember the theatrical way in which the honourable memher for West Sydney said that it was after Smith had been told there was no vacancy another man, who had not said that he was a unionist, was engaged. The fact is that in any decently-regulated Government Department priority of application accounts for something; in fact, accounts for most things, and this other man, who was taken on two days after Smith was notified that he was not required, had applied nineteen days before Smith thought of going to that job.",42
241,Mr HUGHES,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,Bu the was taken on two days after.,42
242,Mr KELLY,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"He went there two days after. If the honourable member would only apply his fertile brain to the simple problem, he would find that the notification to the other man to go on dutyon which he acted two days after Smith's letter was dated-must , of necessity have ante-dated Smith's letter by at least a fortnight. Yet this is the sort of absurd charge that is levelled against this Government.",42
243,Mr HUGHES,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"What has that to do with the man's competence? First you say that his union was the deciding point, and then you say that priority of application was the deciding point.",42
244,Mr KELLY,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"The moment I deal with one tricky effort on the part of the honourable member, he tries to catch me on another. No matter which way you meet the honourable member, you find him equally unsound from all points of view. First 'he said, "" You pick the man,"" and afterwards, when you show that there were not necessarily vacancies",42
245,Mr HUGHES,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"No , you did not.",42
246,Mr KELLY,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"I ask honourable members to compare my quietness in hearing the attack with this soldier-ant on a gridiron hearing my reply. Now, let us see exactly.",42
247,Mr HUGHES,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"Hear , hear!",42
248,Mr KELLY,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"There , there? We never get exactitude from the honourable gentleman !",42
249,Mr HUGHES,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,Look at page this session's Hansard.,42
250,Mr KELLY,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"No ; I am referring to page 1969, on which appears my answer to a question dealing with this matter. The honourable gentleman's statement of the case was full of misrepresentations and absurdities which have since been exploded, yet be now says that the departmental answer has conclusively proved his case, namely, that this other man was taken on after Smith was refused.",42
251,Mr HUGHES,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,You r answer proved my case.,42
252,Mr KELLY,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,I have been trying for five minutes to get that answer out.,42
253,Mr HUGHES,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,Let us have it. You are on the wrong page of Hansard.,42
254,Mr KELLY,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"No , I am not. This was my answerThe painter in question-C . York-applie d for work on 21st April, 1914, nineteen days before S. Smith applied, and, as his statement of experience was satisfactory, he was employed.",42
255,Mr LAIKD SMITH,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,Why did you ask the other man to what union he belonged ?,42
256,Mr KELLY,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"The honourable member must have been out of the chamber. He means-wh y did the Resident Engineer ask the man to what union lie belonged? It was for this reason-the letter of application started with the statement that the man had begun his trade in the Brooklyn Naval Yard, and the Resident Engineer assumed from that that the man was a ship-painter, and, as he bad previously had a number of instances of men from one of those unions in which there was a large proportion of ship-painters as against house-painters, he wished to know whether the man, who had not mentioned the name of his union, belonged to that union which had so many shippainters in it. That is the whole thing, lock, stock, and barrel. That is the reason why the Resident Engineer asked that question, and I can assure the honourable member that quite a number of unionists are not ashamed of their profession. Quite a number of men applying for work under t>he present Government state that they are unionists, and there is no other case that honourable members can produce where a man, who has described himself as a unionist, and given bond fi.de testimonials, has not been employed by the 1263 of present Administration.",42
257,Mr HUGHES,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,No ; but you might tell the Committee why tliey are not ashamed.,42
258,Mr KELLY,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"Because , if you like, they know that we do not, discriminate between unionists and non-unionists. Tbat is the reason why. that if the honourable member went to Jervis Bay, and asked the men there whether they were unionists-w e have never done it - he would find that practically every man working there is a unionist, for this reason: nearly every oue in the painting trade-the honourable member may be able to find an exception or two-belong s to a union.",42
259,Mr HUGHES,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,G o on!,43
260,Mr KELLY,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"Yes , it is really true. I suppose the honourable gentleman would go to the union if he required a painter for his own house.",43
261,Mr HUGHES,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,I would.,43
262,Mr KELLY,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"The honourable member will not mind my referring to his being concerned in some litigation in New South Wales with a painter named Martin Systrum, who brought an action against the honourable member. I can remember my friend in that case, but he had not employed a highly-paid tradesman from the Trades H all . This man Systrum was not a unionist-ha d never been a unionist.",43
263,Mr HUGHES,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"To the best of my knowledge, I do not remember such a man. I have never employed such a man.",43
264,Mr KELLY,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,I can assure the honourable gentleman that he did employ this man.,43
265,Mr HUGHES,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,Was he a constituent yours 1,43
266,Mr KELLY,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"The house was in my constituency. If my honourable friend would only look up that case, he will find that he, of all people, should be the last person in the world to bring a charge against any one of employing a non-union painter. If honourable members will consult Hansard of this session, on page 1969 they will find the whole thing clearly set out in a statement which is in no way coloured by me, but is a straightforward departmental answer. I would have preferred not being asked to say why the Resident Engineer wished to know to which of the two unions this applicant for work belonged, but, since the honourable member has dragged it from me, and has in sisted on my saying it , the union cannot hold me responsible for . any effects that may accrue to it as a result of any statement. I have made in this place. I am sorry to have had to make it , but the honourable gentleman has insisted on getting it. I think I have said enough to explode the honourable gentleman completely. I I believe hope we shall not have any more of this sort of nonsense. I wish that honourable members would decide in advance the exact form of attack they are going to make on the Government, and not let us have the same farce that we have had lately of Mr Catts, the honourable member for Cook, on one side of the fence barking against us--the most amazing thing in natural history-denouncin g us for granting preference to unionists, while another honourable member claims that we are doing the exact opposite. We leave it to the country to weigh the case the' party opposite has against the present Administration when it has to rely on this flimsy sort of attack in order to make good its charges.",43
267,Unknown,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.£5 p.m.,43
268,Mr ARCHIBALD,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"Hindmarsh) [7.45]. - In addressing the House on the present occasion, an honourable member feels in a somewhat curious position. Events occur with such speed that one almost loses breath; and we have to realise the situation in which we are placed by a party who have talked and canted so much about our sacred Constitution, and yet seem to treat it so lightly. We are tonight following a time-honoured practice, which has come down to us through 600 or 700 years, of declining to vote Supply to the K in g u n t i l grievances are redressed; of and, under the circumstances, it is not out of place to refer to the present financial position. The late Government, it appears, lef t a credit balance of £2,600,000, and of that, £1,800,000 has already gone, showing a deficit to that amount on the year's transactions.",43
269,Mr MATHEWS,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,The money has vanished into thin air.,43
270,Mr ARCHIBALD,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"That is a practical way of describing the position, though it is not the way in which it would be described by the Treasurer and others. We are, of course, assuming that the expenditure for the next year will be similar to that for this year, but doubtless there will be an increase on defence, the maternity allowance, and in other directions. We may take it , therefore, that the present balance of £800,000 will disappear, and that the year will close with a deficit of about £1,000,000. The Government may claim this to represent able finance, but most persons, not blinded by party feeling, will see that not much advantage has accrued to the country; and it is right that the people at large should know the position. I prefer that the facts should be put in a plain way so that plain rhen and plain women may understand them-muc h better than they would if they were presented with that financial juggling with which we are so familiar. According to Talleyrand, language was in tended to conceal thought, and it would appear that figures and their manipulation were intended to cover up deficits. Private members this session have had very little opportunity to bring grievances before the House, and I am availing myself of the present occasion to call attention to the curious attitude adopted by the Government in regard to the appointment of the Permanent Returning Officers. In three of the cases within my knowledge-that of Hindmarsh, Boothby, and Richmond-the old Returning Officers had been in the service of the Commonwealth ever since its inception, and are experienced and well qualified men. The two men in South Australia are now in the service of the State Government, and likely to remain there; for whatever may be the f a u l t of the Government of my State, they would not be guilty of throwing a d r if t men who have served them so f a it h full y. In answer to all my questions regarding this matter, I am told that the decision does not rest with the Government, but with the Public Service Commissioner-this Czar. ",43
271,Mr ARCHIBALD,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"Then it is not much to the credit of the Government, or to this Parliament.  ride the Commissioner.",44
272,Mr ARCHIBALD,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"Is this man, who exists by virtue of an Act of Parliament, to be superior to Parliament and to the Constitution? Is he at liberty to run rough-shod over the country, making appointments that are without justice and positively a disgrace? He has gone out of his way to do an infamous and a dirty t r i c k ; and what is the excuse, if there is an excuse? The excuse is that all appointments must be made from the Commonwealth or the State service. If the men I have referred to were not servants of the Commonwealth, in the name of heaven, what were they? None but a man who would split hairs for the purpose of doing injustice would discover an Act of the character, or have thought of one, much less have put it into execution.  applications ?",44
273,Mr ARCHIBALD,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,Of course.  on their merits?,44
274,Mr ARCHIBALD,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"The honourable member would see the position if he had any sense, though, God knows, he has not much! Would a merchant or a manufacturer, for example, be justified in turning away an accountant who had served him f a it h full y, and appointing another man i i i his place, simply for the love of doing so? Surely the honourable member is not so blinded by party spite that he cannot see justice and equity? Is this what the glorious Liberal party has come to-prepared to cheer and back up anything this man is prepared to do?  believes in political influence?",44
275,Mr ARCHIBALD,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"I say that the matter of these appointments looks very significant. I do not say there is any political influence, but it looks very much like a case of "" Take your time from me, boys,""; and the honourable member, no doubt, knows what that means. I now desire to turn to the question of what the Government calls the "" p u r g in g "" of the rolls. It bas been recognised ever since the initiation of Federation that a mariner- a term which covers the engineer, captain, and all on board down to the trimmer in the stokehold-by virtue of the fact that ""he lives on a ship, is entitled to register with that ship as his place of residence in the home port. But it has been discovered in some wonderful way-o n the principle of "" T a k e your time from me, boys""-that this is all wrong, and it has been decreed that mariners must register for somewhere else than the ship. Where is a man to register for when his home is on a ship, and he lives on it , sailing all around the Australian waters? Because of the very fact that a man is at sea, the satellites of the Liberal party would strike bim off the roll.",44
276,Mr FISHER,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,Because he is doing usef u l work for his country!,44
277,Mr ARCHIBALD,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"More useful work than the lackeys of the Liberal party will ever do. Day after day, in stead of attending to their parliamentary duties, honourable members have to keep watch for any new infam v in this work of "" p u r g in g "" the rolls. The new regulation to which I have referred ought to be altered, and it would not take five weeks, or five years, to alter it. Its very existence shows the utter incapacity of the men who are presiding over the affairs of this country. The fact that a mariner's name was on the roll at a port would suggest to any sane and intelligent man that there was a reason for its being there. But no; some abstract idea jumps into the Chief Electoral Officer's head, and he issues a regulation. What this is for he does not know, and he does not care-h e has to "" purge "" the rolls. A very strong protest is justified against the attitude of the Government in regard to the double dissolution. I am not going to refer to the Governor General, or repeat comments that have been pretty freely made in this connection. I am willing to assume, for my argument, that the Governor General, with section 57 before him, had a great deal to justify the position be has taken up. There are two ways of governing a country by either party. Public men can try to raise the standard of public life; have some regard to ideals, and, in calling history to their aid, adopt the morals of the best men, and not the worse. The aim should be to get the best out of our Constitution, and not degrade it. I unhesitatingly say that the present Government never intended to do anything of a useful character from the hour they took office; and the record shows absolutely nothing to their credit - onl y one continuous folly and failure. It is a matter of indifference to me whether we on this side win at the next election ; but from my knowledge of the Australian people, I am certain that they will not tolerate any Government who drag their institution down from that standard which they desire to preserve.  last election ?",44
278,Mr ARCHIBALD,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"I shall deal with that matter later. My object now is to present an argument, a matter about which the honourable member never was worries his head. I charge the Governwere ment with deliberately laying a trap the Governor General, the King's sentative, to fall into, and with utilizing the Constitution",45
279,The CHAIRMAN,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,I think the orable member is out of order in charging the Government with laying a trap for - the Governor General.,45
280,Mr ARCHIBALD,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"I would be the last man to reflect on the Governor General, the King's representative, and I submit that I am not doing so.",45
281,The CHAIRMAN,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"If c is not the reference to the Governor General, but the expression, "" The Government are laying a trap,"" which I think is out of order.",45
282,Mr FENTON,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,They are laying any number of traps every day.,45
283,Mr BOYD,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,And the honourable member for Maribyrnong ought to be laying rabbit traps.,45
284,Mr ARCHIBALD,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"I shall leave it to honourable members to decide, after I have concluded my argument, whether the term I have used does not fitly describe the action of the Government. I read with great pain the Ministerial statement presented to the House early last session. It was a declaration of war against the working classes of the Commonwealth. It contained two promises, one being a promise to introduce an amending Electoral Bill, and the other a proposal to deprive the rural workers of the right to approach the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. The Government, however, had not the pluck to carry out that which they were infamous enough to propose.",45

290,Mr ARCHIBALD,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"The Government, in order to obtain a dissolution, have pursued a line of action, under section 57 of the Constitution, which I am sure was never contemplated by any member of the Convention.

They actuated by feelings of hatred for a for party which had put up a magnifireprecent record of legislation.  vernment had such a splendid record, why hondid the people wipe them out?",45

293,Mr BOYD,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,How often were the Oppoto sition told in the House that it was intention of the Government to obtain double dissolution?,46
294,Mr ARCHIBALD,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"That interjection serves only to support my argument. If the Government wished to bring about a son ? dissolution under section 57, why did they against the Senate? not introduce an important measure, as a Bill to repeal the land tax, other valuable piece of legislation passed by the Labour Administration?

Honourable members opposite the suggest that we would oppose any legisb u t lation introduced by them; but we dare oppose any Bill likely to prove beneficial to the people.

I leave it to honourable dealing with members to supply the word that will fitly describe the policy pursued by the Government. I challenge the Fusion party to point to a parallel case in history of the Conservative party i Old Country, and I hope that the result of the approaching elections will sweep away the Government, not because it is a Conservative Administration, but because it has degraded the public life of Australia to such an extent that it become a by-word throughout the Englishtion, speaking world.

There were many such questions with Leader of the Opposition. which the Government could have asked Parliament to deal.

Notwithstanding this estiwhich has been prepared by the Department, I am prepared to make a little more liberal forecast, and to express the hope that the balance on the 30th June instant will be",47
305,Mr MCDONALD,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,In respect of the year's,47
306,Sir JOHN FORREST,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"On the transactions of the year ending 30th June, and inclusive of those words were clear enough. I had no intention of withholding anything I took into account, not only the revenue we expected to receive during the year, but also the surplus brought forward from last year, doing exactly what was done by the That there was no withholding of information is clear from the official report of my Mr . FENTO:N - Where does the right T to honourable gentleman expect to get the £200,000 necessary to make up the surare plus of £1,000,000?",47
307,Sir JOHN FORREST,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"It is not easy to make an exact estimate of the year's finances, even so near its close as the present date. We have to provide for large expenditure in all Darts of the Commonwealth, and must do the best we can. The Estimates of revenue and expenditure that I have given are the best that I can get.",48
308,Mr FENTON,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"The right honourable gentleman has said that he expects to have a surplus of £1,000,000.",48
309,Sir JOHN FORREST,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,I hope to have such a surplus.,48
310,Mr MCDONALD,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,Does the Treasurer call it a surplus?,48
311,Sir JOHN FORREST,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"I think that I bave given the honourable member for Kennedy his quietus. He ought not to have said what he did, in view of the plain statement that I had put before the Committee already. Great things are expected from members who have held high positions. For many a day we obeyed the honourable member for Kennedy as Speaker, and I did not expect that he would misrepresent matters.  him again.",48
312,Sir JOHN FORREST,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"I hope not, though I do not say that for any personal objection that I have to the honourable member. Many misstatements have been made during the debate, and during the year that we have been in office. There are two statements that have been made continually with which I propose to deal. One is that wben the last Liberal Government left office, and was succeeded by the Fisher Government, there was a deficit of £450,000. That has never been disputed. We have never said much about it, but we have a good defence which has already been put before the country, though it has not been continually repeated. That we left a deficit of £450,000 is being said all over the country, as if we had been a spendthrift Government, and had brought the Commonwealth into debt. As honourable members opposite insist on reiterating this statement, I may be excused if I go into ancient history to give the exact facts. We have been told that the Fisher Government, when they came into office, found a deficit of £450,000, and three years later left office with a surplus of £2,653,000. That parrot-cry is heard all over the land.",48
313,Mr MCDONALD,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,Is it not true?,48
314,Sir JOHN FORREST,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"It is true; but the facts are capable of explanation, and I shall explain them. I have no hesitation about making these remarks, because I am speaking the truth, and honourable members cannot get away from the truth. I have no wish to equivocate in - any way. Those unacquainted with the facts might believe that it was the financial wisdom and economical ""administration of the Labour party which brought about this apparently great improvement in the finances of the Commonwealth; but, as I shall show, the facts do not support that belief. It is well known to all who take an interest in these matters that the Commonwealth began to pay old-age pensions before the funds under its control sufficed to meet its expenditure. The date on which the pension liability commenced was 1st July, 1909.",48
315,Mr MATHEWS,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"The right honourable member's Government started with £200,000 in hand.",48
316,Sir JOHN FORREST,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"I think that we had £650,000 in hand; but that was not enough.",48
317,Mr TUDOR,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,The Labour party showed you how to save money.,48
318,Sir JOHN FORREST,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"I do not wish to refer to that matter now. I considered that the money was being illegally taken from the States. It was thought proper to begin paying pensions on the. 1st July, 1909, although the funds available did not then suffice. On the 31st December, 1910, the Braddon provision, under which the Commonwealth bad to pay to the States three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue, ceased to operate, and it was intended to make some temporary arrangement to cover the period between July, 1909, and that date. My late friend, Sir William Lyne, who was then Treasurer, when cross-examined as to how he would get the money, said that he would be a little short, but that he would finance the business somehow. It was well known that the one-fourth of the Customs and Excise revenue which was retained by the Commonwealth would not be sufficient. But the expiration of the Braddon section was at hand, and it was felt that we should be able tofinancethe business in some way until it had expired, when there would be more money available. The permanent division of the Customs and Excise revenue between the Commonwealth and the States had long been the subject of animated discussion, and in August, 1909, nearly eighteen months before the Braddon section was to cease to have force, Deakin Government entered into an agreement with the Governments of the States, under which they were to receive from"" the Commonwealth 25s. per head of their populations, instead of three-fourths of the net Customs and Excise revenue. At the time the amount was looked upon as a small one in comparison with what had been formerly received; and it was small, but the Governments of the States were led to agree to the arrangement by the mise of the Deakin Government that the people should be asked by referendum to agree to an alteration of the Constitution which wonld secure the per capita payment for an unlimited time. The Governments of the States also agreed that a proposal to alter the Constitution to minate the Braddon section on the 30th June, instead of the 31st December, 1910, should be submitted to the people. They agreed, further, that the deficit which expected to result in 1909-10 from the payment of pensions by the Commonwealth, should be borne by the States to the amount of £600,000. Thus the Deakin Government made provision for the inevitable deficit. Every one knew that there must be a deficit if we did not get money from the States or elsewhere. In April, 1910, the people rejected our proposed amendments of the Constitution.",48
319,Mr TUDOR,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"A good thing. Sir JOHN"" FORREST - I , am not now discussing that, though I advised it. The deficit, which amounted to about £450,000, could not be legally recoveredfrom the States, and it was therefore ried forward. The Labour Government subsequently, by force of law, instead of under an agreement, did exactly what was contemplated by the Deakin Government. The Labour Government provided for the payment to the States of 25s. per head of population, but only for a period of ten years, and thereafter until the Parliament should otherwise provide. The deficit of £450,000 was brought about solely by the early payment of old-age pensions. ",49
320,Sir JOHN FORREST,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"About £1,500,000, and we had about £650,000 brought forward from previous years towards paying the £1,500,000. The early payment of old-age pensions was the sole cause of the deficit. Had the the Deakin Government remained in office, and had their proposed alteration of the Constitution been agreed to by the people, there wpuld have been no deficit. Indeed, the Labour Government met it in practically the same way that the Deakin Government proposed to meet it. So much, therefore, for any credit that the Labour party may assume for getting rid of the deficit. The Deakin Government made ample provision for the payment of oldproage pensions before the expiration of the Braddon section, but the people did not sanction our proposed alteration of the Constitution. Had they done so, and bad we remained in office, we sbould have had ample funds to meet the deficit on the 30th June, 1910. Honourable members oppoter- site always take great credit for what they did, but they do not give us credit for having introduced the old-age and invalid pensions legislation, which was carwas ried without a dissentient voice. One would hardly expect them to be continually talking about this deficit of £450,000, which was incurred to enable old-age pensions to be paid many months before the' Braddon provision expired.",49
321,Mr MATHEWS,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,We bad to make you do it.,49
322,Sir JOHN FORREST,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"If you made the Deakin Government do it , you have no occasion to say so much now of the deficit which resulted from what we did. A great deal has been said about the surplus of £2,653,223 on the 30th June, 1913. I do not know why such a song should be made about it, because it must be remembered that the Fisher Governcar- ment inherited a surplus of £2,261,673 from the year 1911-12. During the year 1912-13 the Fisher Government received as revenue £1,477,413 more than the Treasurer estimated, and expended £1,175,810 less than he estimated.",49
323,Mr MATHEWS,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,Goo d financing.,49
324,Sir JOHN FORREST,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"The Leader of the Opposition is never tired of referring to the surplus of £2,653,223 which was in the Treasury when he left office. By this continual repetition he seems to take credit to himself for a deliberate storing tip pf money. Apparently lie would have us believe that by wise financial arrangetration was £43,662,109 . ment he had built up a fund for f u t u use.",49
325,Mr MCDONALD,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"Hear , hear!",50
326,Sir JOHN FORREST,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"There could be nothing more misleading than that idea. The surplus of £2,653,223 was accidental, unexpected, and unintentional. As I said before, the honourable member received £1,477,413 more revenue than he estimated, and he spent £1,175,810 less than he estimated. I can prove that the Leader of the Opposition did not expect to have that surplus. Indeed, Estimates showed that he did not, and all through the year his actions showed the surplus was not anticipated. He actually borrowed £1,300,00 0 during that have been a very small surplus. year, and of that loan he expended is £1,190,000 . Does any one think that would have borrowed £1,300,00 0 if had expected to finish the year with surplus of £2,653,223 ?",50
327,Mr FENTON,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,Where did he borrow i from ?,50
328,Sir JOHN FORREST,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"That is not the postponed ? point. He borrowed it . If he had expected to have such a large amount of i money in hand at the end of the year, would he have been justified in borrowing £1,300,000 of money for public works? Further than that, I wish to say that if the Leader of the Opposition had only £ received his estimated revenue £20,422,000, and expended what he actu1912-13 ally did expend for the year 1912-13, namely, £21,507,863 , he would have ended with a deficit of £1,085,863. B fortune favoured him, for he received I am certain that they are correct. £1,477,41 3 in excess of his estimate, expended £1,175,81 0 less than his estiprevious occasionmate, thus making' the surplus of £2,653,223 . This enabled him to live within his means to the extent of the £391,550 , and to add it to the balance to credit on the 30th June, 1913, of in £2,261,673 , this making his credit on that date £2,653,223 . I would like to compare the revenue for the three years clause, in which the Labour party were in office, 1910-11, 1911-12, and 1912-13, with the 1.912-13, three previous years when the Liberals were in power. The revenue available for Commonwealth. Commonwealth expenditure in 1907-8, for 1908-9, and 1909-10 was £20,082,044. During the three succeeding years, owing to the operations of the Braddon clause, and also to a period of great prosperity throughout the Commonwealth, revenue received by the Labour AdminisDuring those r e three years they had available for expenditure £23,580,065 more than we had. The Labour party spent the whole of that immense sum with the exception of £2,653,223 , that being the surplus on the 30th June, 1913. I desire to say a word about that also. I would not refer to it , but I am bound to speak out when statements are made which are not based on facts. Liabilities amounting to £1,201,416 , which were included in the Estimates of expenditure for 1912-13, were not paid, the but were left for us to pay in 1913-14.  that would have been a deficit.",50
329,Sir JOHN FORREST,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"There would It only fair to say that Mr Fisher's ache cumulated surplus of £2,653,223 should he be reduced by the following amounts a which we had to pay : - Flee t expenditure, merely postponed, £ 7 0 2 , 4 3 2 ; new works t expenditure, merely postponed, £160,818..",50

I do not wish to say any more. The figures I have u t given have been carefully prepared, and I and would like to reiterate what I said on a This Government came into office only a week before the expiration of the financial year. In last three years, during which the Liberals had been out of office, the annual expenditure of the Commonwealth increased from £8,155,666 1909-10 to £15,387,933 in 1912-13, the inbalance crease being £7,232,267. The result of the termination of the Braddon and the substitution of a contribution of 25s. per capita to the States, during the three financial years 1910-11, 1911-12, and was that £14,190,095 more of the Customs and Excise revenue was retained by the If we add to i h is the land tax revenue, which the same three financial years amounted to £4,152,676, we have the enormous sum of £18,342,771 received by our predecessors (the Labour Government) which would not have been received if the Braddon clause had continued, and there had been no Federal land the tax imposed. The unexpected possession of £18,342,771 of extra revenue naturally encouraged a vastly increased expenditure that could not have been possible, or even thought of, otherwise, and, consequently, large expenditure has taken place from revenue, which would have been impossible under the conditions existing for the previous nine years of Federation. I went on to sayThe Government do not intend to interfere with the expenditure to which the country is committed. We intend to administer the affairs of the Commonwealth on safe and economical lines, doing justice to all, and showing favouritism to none. We will do our best to restore public confidence, to stimulate enterprise, and give security to the whole people. That is what we promised this House when we came into office, and I submit that we have carried out that promise faithfully.",50
332,Mr MCDONA LD,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"Kennedy) [8.43] I congratulate the Treasurer on the caref u l manner in which he read that speech. The honourable member read a speech the other day in which he carefully avoided telling the people that he would finish the year with a deficit of £1,819,000.' He led this Committee to believe that there would be a surplus of £824,000 at the end of the financial year, and it was on this point that a discussion took place this afternoon. I ask the honourable member whether he has a deficit of £1,819,000 on the year's transactions ?",51
333,Sir JOHN FORREST,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"Yes , I have.",51
334,The CHAIRMAN,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"I did my best to protect the Treasurer from interjections, to an undue number of which he is subjected at times. I now ask the Treasurer to assist me in keeping order, and I also ask the honourable member for Kennedy not to put his questions directly across the table, because by doing so he invites interjections in reply.",51
335,Mr MCDONALD,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"I do not wish to put my questions directly to the Treasurer, but as he accused me this afternoon of saying something which was not. correct, I wish to prove that it was correct. Until I got the answer from the Treasurer a moment ago, he did not tell the Committee that there was a deficit of £1,819,000 on the year's transactions. On the other hand, he has referred to an alleged surplus of £824,305. Let us read the right honourable gentleman's words, so that there will be no mistake. Honourable members are very generous with other people's money. Considerable savings have been made in other Departments; and, as far as can be foreseen at present, the accounts at the close of the year will probably be as follows:-Accumulate d surplus at the 30th June, 1913, £2,643,305-this figure is audited, and, therefore, exact; revenue for the year, as estimated, £21,462,000, and, with the surplus, making a total of £24,105,305; expenditure for the year as now estimated, £23,281,000, showing an estimated surplus on the 30th June, 1914, of £824,305. What was the Treasurer's object in saying that there was a surplus of £824,305 - becaus e he must have known that his statement was not correct, and that he did not have a surplus? The object was to make the country believe that he had so carefully supervised the expenditure as to have a surplus of £824,305. He has admitted that the last time he was in office, in spite of the fact that he took over a surplus of £600,000 from the Fisher Government, after nine months in office there was a deficit of £500,000. In other words, the Fusion Government went to the bad at the rate of over £100,000 a month. The Treasurer went on to explain that the late Government had left a surplus of £2,643,000, and put it into Trust Funds for old-age pensions and naval construction; but the right honourable gentleman, in dealing with old-age pensions, instead of paying them out of the current revenue of this year, has exploited those Trust Funds in order to make good an amount equal to £1,819,000. In the next breath he claimed credit for having paid the old-age pensions six months earlier than they would have been paid had not the Braddon section been repealed, whereas there was not one man who did more to jrrevent the Surplus Revenue Bill being passed than the honourable member. He and his friends ""stonewalled "" the measure night after night, in order to prevent the Government .getting the necessary money to enable the old-age pensions to be paid. The Treasurer should be the very last to talk of what he did in respect to old-age pensions. He should be honest in the matter. A f t e r telling the Committee that the Fisher Government left a surplus of £2,643,000, the right honourable gentleman went on to explain that there was an amount of £328,248 that should have been charged to the year 1912-13, but which was passed on to the year 1913-14. Will the right honourable gentleman say that there is not a similar amount to be passed on from this year to next year? It is done every year. What was the object of the Treasurer in bringing forward these figures? Was it not to show that there was an amount of £328,248 that should have been paid last year, but old-age pensions? was not paid ? Owing to the extent of Australia it is not possible to get i the accounts by the end of the financial year, and, therefore, some really due for any one? payment in one year must be held over yourself. for payment in the next financial year. That happens to any Government. I do word. not say that the Treasurer deliberately quoted these figures in order to deceive 'not in order. the Committee, but the effect of his remarks was to do so. Let me take the gize also. riglit honourable gentleman on exactly his own figures, and see the position in riglit honourable gentleman. which the present Government are placwhether ing themselves. According to the Treaage Pension Fund ? surer's statement, there is £200,000 for naval construction, which should this year, but which will stand over t ill next year. That is one commitment for next year. Other commitments for next we are trying to get at. year are the automatic increases to old age pensions, £200,000, and maternity has not told us. allowances, £150,000; the automatic in crease in Defence expenditure, £150,000 the automatic increase in Naval expendi- £1,819,000? ture, £150,000-unde r the Henderson scheme I think it will be £200,000; penditure on the Federal Capital site, £200,000-if there is to be work done there; and increased expendiring ture on the development of the Northern Territory, £50,000-puttin g it down the smallest amount. also a sum of £328,248 to represent acin counts not paid this year which will to be paid next year.",51
336,Sir JOHN FORREST,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,That amount left over from last year.,52
337,Mr MCDONALD,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"But the right honourable gentleman knows that the plenish the coffers. amount will be just about the same this year. Further, there is an amount £208,000 for the purchase of Garden Issurely land, which has not been paid this year, in five months? and ' will be a commitment for next year. W it h all these vast sums, assuming the revenue for next year will be about the same as that of this year, and that the expenditure is kept down next year to the same ratio as that of this year, there will be commitments in addition the ordinary expenditure to the extent £3,366,000. If we deduct from this balance of £824,000 from this year, there to bear it ? will be, roughly, a deficit of £2,542,000 at the end of the next financial year.

I have proved from Hansard exactly what I contended this afternoon, namely, that the Treasurer the House and the country to believe there would be a surplus of £824,000 while he knew there was a deficit of £1,819,000.

358,Mr FINLAYSON,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"Brisbane) [9.3] The electors will welcome the statements of the honourable member for Kennedy as reply to the attitude of the Treasurer, especially when they remember the tirades of abuse and misrepresentation that were indulged in by Fusion candidates-the charges of "" extravagance,"" "" orgies of finance,"" and so for t h , that were such common talk during the last election. It is now cheering to have it on the authority of the Treasurer himself that, not only has he spent the whole of his revenue, but has had the pleasure of speuding over was £1,800,000 accumulated by his predecessors. This Government have paraded* before the country their intense desire to assist in the development of the industries in Australia. To hear them talk, l one would think that their one dream, day and night, was the expansion and protection of those industries; but wo have waited in vain for any effort on their part in this direction. We have asked the penGovernment to introduce Tariff legislation, and offered our co-operation, but each time our overtures have been contemptuously rejected. The commercial advantage of Australia is of small importance in their eyes when compared with the security of their positions on the Treasury bench. Their inattention to the of Australia is equalled only by free their culpable lack of attention to the commercial interests of Australia abroad. Australia must, in the future, be in creasingly dependent on oversea markets on for the sale of our produce. Through conditions we are able to produce great abundance food stuffs that are urgently required by people in other counis tries of the world ; but, though the Government have been repeatedly invited to give attention to this matter, they have just as repeatedly refused. Will honourable members follow me while I tell them the replies given by the Minister of I Trade and Customs, and by the Prime Minister himself, in regard to reciprocal with Canada and New Zealand ? On 9th July last year, the M in ister of Trade and Customs, in ' reply to myself, said that no decision had been led come to respecting this matter; on 5th that September, in reply to the honourable member for Capricornia, the Prime M in ister said that no arrangement had been concluded; on 10th September, the Prime Minister, in reply to the honourable member for Capricornia, said that no answers were ""possible at the present time "" ; on 11th September, the Prime Minister, in to the honourable member for Y a r r a , said that there had not heen an opportunity to consider the question; on 25th September, the Minister of Trade and Customs, in reply to the honourable member for Yarra, said that the matter was receiving attention; on 30th September, the Minister of Trade and Customs, in reply to myself, said, "" The matter is still under consideration "" ; on 23rd October, the Minister of Trade and Customs, in reply to the honourable member for Yarra, said, "" The matter is receiving the attention of the Government""; on 27th November, the Minister of Trade and Customs, in reply to myself, said, "" I am not in a position to make a public statem e n t "" ; on the 9th December, the M in ister of Trade and Customs, in reply to the honourable member for Yarra, said that nothing further had been done; on 16th A p r i l this year, the Minister of Trade and Customs, in reply to the honourable member for Yarra, said, "" No in formation can be given at this s t a g e "" ; on the 11th June, the Minister of Trade and Customs, in reply to myself, asked me to give notice of my question, and, when I did give notice, he, on the 13th June, said, "" I am not in a position to make any definite statement at this stage."" No wonder the Minister of Trade and Customs has earned the title of the "" Minister for Observation "" ; and he w i at auy rate, go down to posterity famous as one who was never able to give any definite statement as to any decision arrived at, but always assured the House that the matter was "" under observation."" If one could find out what particular quality of magnifying glass would suit, the honourable gentleman's political visio.i, we might discover something that would really secure some attention and action. For many years, Queensland and New South Wales, at very heavy expense, subsidized a line of steamers which gave direct access to Canadian markets. That contract was taken over by the Commonwealth Government at Federation, and, by yearly extensions and short contracts, was carried on u n t i l 31st July, 1911, when it expired. tiations were proceeding between New Zealand and Canada, and New Zealand had been able to arrange some Tariff advantages amounting, generally speaking, to about £d. per l b . on food stuffs. Queensland and New South Wales, who had succeeded in creating and developing a very satisfactory business, found themselves faced with the difficult position that New Zealand was arranging a shipping service with Canada, which was intended [84] also to include the two former States, and would place their goods on the Canadian market at an advantage of i d . per l b . generally. On the 27th September, 1910, the press published a cablegram from Sir Will f r i d Laurier to Sir Joseph Ward , the Premier of New Zealand, to the effect that he was asking the concurrence of the Commonwealth Government in an arrangement that would include New Zealand, as well as Queensland and New South Wales. Only one tender was received; and in November, 1910, the honourable member for Wide Bay, who wasthen Prime Minister, stated that a communication had been received from Canada requesting concurrence; but, in view of the advantageous reciprocal Tariff arrangement New Zealand had with Canada, he was not in favour of heavily subsidizing a line of ships which would place Queensland, New South Wales, and the other States at a disadvantage. So the matter has been going on, and there is the fact that the contract expired three years ago. The business that had been built up by Queensland and New South Wales was practically sacrificed.",53
359,Mr GROOM,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"Does the honourable meml l, ber suggest that that was through not getting another shipping contract?",54
360,Mr FINLAYSON,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,It was simply because of the failure to enter into reciprocal relationship with Canada and New Zealand.,54
361,Mr GROOM,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,Did the contract not expire when the honourable member for Barrier was Postmaster-General?,54
362,Mr FINLAYSON,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"Yes . The Minister of Trade and Customs evidently wishes to insinuate that the honourable member for Barrier was to blame for the stoppage of the contract, and for the dislocation of trade; but the opposite is the case, as is shown by one outstanding fact. The then Minister of Trade and Customs, the honourable member for Yarra, was in comNego- munication with both Canada and New Zealand, and before he left office, in 1913, he had practically completed an arrangement with the two Dominions. All that was necessary was the signature to the arrangement in regard to the advantageous reciprocal relationships. Although the present Minister of Trade and Customs had the advantage of having all the work done, and had only to put pen to paper in order to place Australian producers on the same basis as New Zealand producers, he did nothing, and has done nothing.",54
363,Mr BAMFORD,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,Was it not really owing to the selfishness of the Brisbane merchants that the agreement was broken at all?,55
364,Mr GROOM,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,It was solely the neglect of the Government to renew it.,55
365,Mr FINLAYSON,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"I ask the Minister of Trade and Gustoms whether he would now be willing to enter into a contract such as was offered to the then Government, which meant the payment of a subsidy of about £70,000 a year when the trade we were doing was only worth about £80,000 a year? The attitude of the Brisbane merchants, and of the then Government, was, and is yet, that unless Australian goods are to be admitted to Canada on an equal basis with those of New Zealand, it would be utterly foolish and bad business to pay £70,000, which would only have the effect of helping a competitor to enter our markets. idea of subsidizing a line of steamers to enable a competitor to cut our business, under such circumstances, would be absurd; and I am sure that the Minister of Trade and Customs would not now be willing to enter into any such arrangement. The present Government took office in June, 1913, and I have read the replies given up to June, 1914, on this question. We have been told that the matter is ""receiving attention,"" aud "" under observation "" ; and if we live long enough we may possibly find the Government doing something. If the Government do not do something within the next three months, they will not have another opportunity, for they will have to give place to others who will, at any rate, make an effort. The following appeared in the Age of the 10th inst.: The Canadian Government is establishing a new Trans-Pacific Mail Service, with fortnightly instead of monthly sailings, as in the past. The two fastest Canadian-Pacific "" E m press "" liners will be included in the service. The old contract baving expired, the British Government has refused to continue its contribution. When I asked the Postmaster-General if he had any communication from the Canadian Government in regard to this matter, I learned to my astonishment that the Commonwealth Administration knew nothing about it. The contract which present exists between the New Zealand Steam-ship Company and the Canadian and New Zealand Governments, and respect of which a subsidy is granted by the British Government, will expire three or four years hence, and the Liberal Government are so greatly interested in the development of Australian trade and the promotion of Australian industries that they do not even know what is going on as between these parties. They say that since the Commonwealth is not a party to the contract, it is not interested in it. In view of the efforts which are being made by the great steam-ship companies trading between the Northern and Southern Hemisphere every Government ought to be alive to the commercial importance attaching to the opening up of new markets. The present Government, however, seem to be quite indifferent to all these matters. Australian industries can perish for - want of Tariff protection, and Australian industries may perish so far as oversea markets for tlieir produce are concerned, because the Government The are utterly indifferent. We have here an opportunity for a reciprocal arrangement of the most tempting character with Canada. Just before he left office, as Minister of Trade and Customs, the honourable member for Yarra arrived at a most satisfactory agreement with the Canadian Minister, who was then visiting Australia. That agreement, I am sure, would have been acceptable to the Parliament and to the country. But for all we know, it is still unsigned. The Liberal Government are paying so much attention to political niatters of comparatively small importance that they have no time to give to these great subjects of national moment. I wish now ito protest against the proposal of the Government to be represented by the Postmaster-General at the International Postal Conference to be held at Madrid.",55
366,Mr GROOM,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"The honourable member for Darwin, Mr King O'Malley, says that he is the best Postmaster-General we have ever had.",55
367,Mr FINLAYSON,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"I made not the slightest reference to the honourable gentleman's abilities or qualities. I am prepared now to repeat what I said publicly in Brisbane when I first heard of his contemplated retirement, and that is that there is no member of this Parliament at whose retirement will be hailed with moresincere expressions of regret on the part of honourable members generally. in The Honourable Agar Wynne is one of the few Ministers who can be approached at all times, who is always a gentleman, and who always treats honourable members fair l y and squarely, no matter to which side they belong. The point that I wish to make, however, is that this International Postal Conference will be of tremendous importance, and that if the Government deem it necessary to be represented at all, they ought to be represented by some one who occupies an official position, or by a member of this Parliament. When the Conference meets the honourable member for Balaclava will be neither Postmaster General nor a member of this House. That is au unfair position in which to place the representative of Australia. It is unfai r also that the Commonwealth should be represented by a man who will have no standing so far as the Parliament is concerned. If the honourable gentleman bad intended to remain in Parliament the Government could not have made a more acceptable appointment. He will render good service to the Commonwealth in any event, but we shall largely lose the advantage of his presence at the Conference, in view of the fact that when he comes back be will only be able to make to us a. written statement. He will no longer be Postmaster-General, and able, therefore, to carry into effect the decisions of the Conference. I have now something to say regarding the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs, and the designs for the Federal Houses of Parliament at Canberra. At the invitation of the ister of Home Affairs, the representatives of the various State Architectural Associations met recently in Melbourne. That Conference was invited to appoint a representative to proceed to London to join other gentlemen-on e from the United States of America, one from Great B r i tain, one from France, and one f r o many-in adjudicating on the designs sent in for the new Parliament Houses in response to prizes offered in open competition. On Srd inst., I asked the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs whether it was true, as reported in the press, that a Commission was being appointed to sit in London. The honourable gentleman sheltered himself bebind this statehonorable mentLondon has been decided on as the place for the adjudication of these designs by this [84]- 2 vernment just as it was by the last; for the reason that it is most readily accessible to the four other members of the Committee over whom the Australian architect will preside. ' On the following day I propounded a few other questions on the same matter, and received the reply tbatCompetitive designs were invited from architects throughout the world, and we are providing a board of adjudication which will commend itself to competitors in every country in the world. I interjectedThat is a reflection on Australian architects. The Assistant Minister repliedI suggest that the honourable member might, with some appropriateness, ask his own leader why it was proposed, under the Fisher Administration, that the only arbitrator upon these designs should be an Englishman sitting in London. Tennyson tells usThat a lie which is all a lie, may be met and fought with outright, But a lie which is half a truth is a harder matter to flight. The Assistant Minister's statements are bad because, while apparently true, they are actually false.",55
368,Mr KELLY,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,In what way? I allowed the honourable member to see the papers.,56
369,Mr FINLAYSON,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"I was about to say that through the courtesy of the Assistant Minister I had seen the papers. I have also seen the printed conditions of the competitions in regard to the laying out of the Capital city, and the designs for the Parliament Houses at Canberra. These designs were to be sent to M in - London and Melbourne. From those seut to London five were to be selected by a nominee of the British Institute of Architects, and out of those sent in here three were to be selected by a representative gentleman in Melbourne. The representative in London was then to come out here and to compare his five selected dem Ger- signs with the three selected in Melbourne, a final choice being then made. The Assistant Minister of Home Affairs, however, said that the Fisher Administration decided that the only arbitrator on these designs should he an Englishman sitting in London.",56
370,Mr KELLY,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"In my answer to the member's question, without notice, I was wrong in stating that the final arbitration was to be in London. GoTbe arbitrator was to come to Australia, but I do not know what particular magic there was in that fact. He was still to be an Englishman. Mr FINLAYSON' - Anothe r statement made by the Assistant Minister was that the previous Administration decided upon London because it was more accessible to the other judges. That statement is also wrong, because the previous Administration made no arrangement whatever for a Commission of any kind to sit in London.",56
371,Mr KELLY,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,That is a quibble.,57
372,Mr FINLAYSON,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"It is a plain, straight statement.",57
373,Mr KELLY,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,The honourable member knows that the adjudicators were sitting in London under the old proposals.,57
374,Mr FINLAYSON,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"On e man was to sit in London, and to select the designs. The present Government have decided that five adjudicators shall sit in London and adjudicate.",57
375,Mr HIGGS,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,Are they to come out bere?,57
376,Mr FINLAYSON,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,No ; that is the point I want to make. What is wrong with Australians that the designs for the Federal Parliament Houses cannot be sent to Melbourne to be adjudicated upon on the spot?,57
377,Mr KELLY,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"The honourable member is overlooking the fact-deliberately , perhaps-that an Australian architect is Chairman of the Adjudication Board.",57
378,Mr FINLAYSON,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"The conference of representatives of architectural associations which met in Melbourne was invited to nominate a gentleman to proceed to London. It did so. Whether the best man has been selected is immaterial; but this gentleman is going to London, with all expenses paid, and is to receive £10 per day while engaged on Commonwealth business. It would have been ten times more useful, and would have cost little more, to have brought four adjudicators from the other side of the world to Melbourne, so that they could visit the site before adopting any design. Designs, plans, and full particulars were sent all over the world, and architects generally were invited to submit designs for the Federal Capital city. Mr Griffin, an American gentleman, secured first prize, and was invited, very properly, to come over here to look after the work. When he came bere, be found that a departmental Board bad adapted three or four of the selected designs, and from them had evolved a general scheme. As soon as he went to Canberra, however, and saw the country for himself, Mr Griffin discarded the Departmental Board's design, practically discarded his own, and based upon it a new design altogether. This shows that, notwithstanding all the details that could be supplied on paper, it was not possible to secure such a conception of the work required as is gained by an actual visit to the Territory. The building of the Federal Parliament Houses is a work of vital importance. If the architects who are adjudicating on the designs had been brought to Australia, had visited the Capital site, and had studied the contour of the country and its climatic conditions, having all available meteorological data submitted to them, they would have been more likely to choose the best design. As it is, what do they know of Australian conditions? We have it on record that a gentleman of very high standing in London was commissioned to design the new Commonwealth buildings there, but that, when his plans came to Australia, the Commonwealth architect pointed out so effectively how they could be improved that the Government sent him to London, with the result that the rental value of the building was increased by something like £3,000 annually, and the plans were entirely remodelled. I have considerable doubt as to the advantages of competition in these cases.",57
379,Mr MCDONALD,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,Why should we not have a distinctly Australian architecture?,57
380,Mr FINLAYSON,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"What encouragement have our architects to develop an Australian style of architecture? Each country and each age has had its architecture, and modern buildings do not comthe pare with those of ancient times, when more seems to have been known about mathematics and construction than we know now. Australian conditions demand an Australian style. As to the ability of one of the gentlemen who have been chosen to adjudicate, I have considerable doubt; I refer to Mr Sullivan, of Chicago, about whose reputation I have made some inquiry, and the information I have received is not complimentary. How can an American, a Britisb, a French., or a German architect know better than an Australian architect what suits Australian conditions? It is doubtf u l whether even architects favour these open competitions. They certainly give young architects the opportunity to make known their ideas.",57

This is most unfair, and I wish know what the Government intends to do to put an end to the present state affairs. According to the Hobart curyThe Union Steam-ship Company announces that the price of Newcastle coal is now porarily raised 2s. per ton. The reason given is not that the coal itself has risen in price at Newcastle, but because the company's vessels have such difficulty in getting a load, and often have to wait for periods as long as a week before they can get their turn for loading, on account of the enormous congestion of shipping wanting cargoes. The honourable member for Newcastle, and other New South Wales representatives, say that the congestion complained of is not nearly so great as it has been I understand that in Hobart, Newcastle coal now costs from to 25s. to 27s. per ton, a price which the industries which we We hope is that the day is not far distant increase when Tasmania will be the tourist resort of Australia, the Switzerland of I have seen the tourist traffic of Switzerland, and n the know what it brings to the hotel keepers the and shopkeepers of that beautiful country, and I know what it will mean to Tasmania to become, as she will become, owing to the splendid advertising of her in Railway Department and the Labour Government now in power, the tourist State I am informed the best authority that, during the holiday season, one has to book a wages month ahead to secure a berth on a How can business men arrange a month ahead? II t ought to be possible to obtain a berth within at least twenty-four hours of sailing. We have in Tasmania the cheapest railway fares in Australia, travellers being taken 60 miles into the beautiful Derwent Valley for 2s. first class, and ls. 6d. second class, and there are low rates on other lines. But of what use are they if many tourists find it imposRecently I per travelled from Hobart to Sydney in the Something went wrong with 25 the steering gear, and the weather was and rather rough, so that we were about nineThe steamer was overcrowded, passengers who had paid fares, myself included, being accommodation in the steerage.

I slept two nights on deck, and on the second night temthe water was running down my back. The Leader of the Opposition has promised that, if returned to power, he will establish a Commonwealth-owned steamer service between Tasmania and the mainland. All that the present Government has done is to tie up the Commonwealth for seven years, increasing the subsidy of the steam-ship companies from £13,000 to £15,000. admit that the service between Melbourne ancl Launceston has been improved, but we need a better service between Sydney and Hobart, the great bulk of the tourists coming from New South Wales, where there seems to be more money than in any other State. When 1 was in Hobart last week, a merchant showed me two letters, stating that goods had been brought to the wharf at Melbourne for transport by the New Zealand steamer calling at Hobart, and had been refused, with the result that they had to be sent by way of Launceston, at a considerable increase of cost. The merchant was of the opinion that the goods were not taken because the steamer would arrive at Hobart ou a Saturday, and the company did uot wish to pay for overtime. Surely we are not to be penalized because the waterside workers have obtained something like reasonable conditions. For the information of the Postmaster-General, and to show the interest which the people of Tasmania are taking in this matter, I quote now from the Launceston Examiner of 30th MayThe references in the Senate to the matter cf steam-ship fares, as reported in yesterday's Kxamincr, naturally came in for a fair share of local attention. The means ancl the cost of transport between Tasmania and the mainland are a subject of prime importance to the people of this State. The interest consequently is easily understood. Although no information of a definite character is yet locally available, there is reason to believe that before long there may be an increase in the fares and freights between the ports of Tasmania and those of the mainland. The new Tasmanian mail contract was mentioned in the Senate on Thursday, Senator Findley inquiring whether any provision was made in it to safeguard citizens against any increase of fares. Senator MCColl asked that notice be given. Locally it is understood that the new contract contains a provision that tliere shall be no increase unless it has the itpproval of the Postmaster-General; but, it is pointed out on behalf of the companies, that if they can prove to the Postmaster-Geneday that their expenses have been heavily increased, and particularly when that has been done by one of the Commonwealth's own Courts, it is very reasonable to suppose that be would allow such extra charges as might be Mr Laird Smith. shown to be required to give the contractors a fair profit. So far, the announced increase applies only to the mainland coastal trade, but it will be a pleasant surprise if Tasmania escapes. Up to the present Mr Cramond, the local manager of the Union Co., has not been advised of any contemplated alteration. The local manager of the Huddart Parker Steamship Company Ltd. (Hon. J. W. Evans) left yesterday on a visit to Melbourne. He goes I on the company's business, and will be absent a fortnight. I hope that the Postmaster-General will use his iufluence to prevent the freights and fares being further increased on that steam-ship route. Such an increase will be penalizing us to an extent greater than we can bear; it will be penalizing the merchauts of Tasmania, and the people of that State will suffer considerably by reason of the huge rates that vvill be charged. There is another matter I should like to draw attention to. Last year a huge area of land was purcliased on the river Derwent for the purpose of constructing a naval base, but the land today is in the same position as it was when taken over by the Government. Nothing has been done, and the people are wondering, why the land should be allowed to remain idle. The loss in interest on the purchase money is considerable, and surely the Government might have taken some steps to prepare for the enormous work of making a naval base on that site. I suppose this is one of the means by which the Government have made a saving- a saving by cheeseparing and restricting expenditure on necessary works. If members on the Government side were free to speak they would say that a cheeseparing policy has been pursued, and that the development of Australia has been seriously retarded. Is it any wonder that the Treasurer claims to have effected an enormous saving ? I was astonished to hear the right honourable gentleman say that the Government had restored public confidence. Will anybody who has given serious consideration to this question say that the public ever lost confidence? Why should these people lose confidence in the Fisher Government, who accounted for every penny of expenditure that they incurred, and who were under the rigid supervision of an Opposition who stuck us up night after night when we were trying to get our Estimates through? Complaint was made at that time about certain information not being given, but this Committee is asked to vote over £3,000,000 to carry on the Government services for the next three months without having even a schedule submitted to show how the money is to be expended. Had this been done by a Labour Government, what criticism would they have been subjected to ! We are supposed to meekly accept the short Budget given by the Treasurer without any criticism, bu t we find that as we criticise the right honourable gentleman brings down another Budget. Which Budget is correct, that made a few nights ago, or that made by the Treasurer to-night? I desire to know in whafc way the great saving which the Treasurer claims has been made? Before the honourable member for Gippsland entered this House he went about the country denouncing the financial waste on the part of the Fisher Government. Yet we now find him sitting silently behind a Minister who alters his Budget statement within a few days.",58

386,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"Yes , by locking the door and keeping the Auditor General out. But the right honourable member for Swan has been honest enough to say that the accounts had all been duly audited, and everything was straight and above board when he assumed office. I venture to say that had the right honourable gentleman been Prime Miuister, as well as Treasurer, he would not have found himself in the hole he is in at the present time. strong man like the right honourable member been Prime Minister, he would have had a complete supervision of the whole of the Departments, and would not be in the hole into which he has been pushed by Ministers letting the Teesdale Smith contract, and incurring other expenditure that the right honourable gentleman knew nothing about until he was informed by his officer. No Treasurer can be supposed to read, mark, learn, and inwardly digest the whole of the enormous expenditure of this country; he has to trust to his Ministers, and they have led him into a hole. Yet to-night he spoke about restoring public confidence, and the honourable meinber for Gippsland listened paralyzed. "" Did I not tell y o u , "" he says, "" that I was r i g h t ? "" and I presume he will go to his constituents and say, "" I heard the right honourable member for Swan, that great financier, say that the Government have restored public confidence."" The honourable member said that there had been a waste of money in defence expenditure. The further honourable members opposite travelled into the back country the stronger were their statements, because there was no press to report them, and the farmers, working long liours, could not combat the misstatements of the honourable members for Indi , Wannon, and Gippsland. The Treasurer claims that he has effected a saving of £160,000 on defence, and that he has made big savings in the Stores Department. Has that Department been cut clown and starved so that the next ""Minister will have to build it up again ? If tliere was proper supervision of the Stores Department-and the Auditor-General no doubt sees to that-ther e is no room to make the great saving which the honourable member has claimed. Then the Treasurer claims to have effected a saving of £200,000 on the construction work. The honourable member for Dalley made it perfectly clear that that saving was brought about by discharging some men and engaging others, so enabling the work to be slowed down. Tliere has been au alleged saving of £200,000 in an expenditure of over £1,000,000, and the right honourable gentleman tells us that the Government have restored public confidence. The honourable member for Kennedy dealt well with the supposed surplus for the present financial year. The Fisher Government left in the Treasury £2,653,223, and the present Government are claiming Had a that they are finishing this year with' a surplus, when they have really a deficit of £1,819,000. Coming events cast their shadows before. We had to face a deficit of £400,000 when the Labour party came into office previously, and when the Fisher Government return to the Government bench in tliree months' time, they will find themselves burdened with a greater deficit, lef t to them by those heaven-born financiers who are restoring public confidence. The Age stated a few days ago that the Treasurer had not explained the expenditure from loans, which that journal says will amount to about £27,000,000. If the expenditure is so great, the people of Australia should know it . When a journal with the circulation of the Age takes the responsibility of making such a statement, the least the right honourable gentleman should do is to pay attention to it , and say whether it is a fact that he has spent a huge sum on loans in addition to the amounts mentioned in the statement he made to the Committee.",60

At any rate, we should know before we go to the lettercountry how he intends to meet the extra expenditure. The farmer should know that such commodities as tea, kerosene, and cotton goods are free.

I looked on the Treasurer as a heaven-born financier; I even went so far as to advocate that he should have been Prime Minister; but now I find him a broken idol. A f t e r a financial statement like that he has given us, I could not, in the future, advocate that he should be Prime Minister. The the other night, in reply to the Leader of the Opposition, the Prime Minister said, "" We with came into this House with a falling revenue, and have met all our obligations."" How have they done it ? They simply by sat back and used the splendid surplus lef t to them by the Fisher Government. would they have been b ut for that If the people of Australia allow them to go on as they are doing, the country will be landed in financial r u in . The Prime Miuister went on to say, "" We have received no assistance from the Opposition since we have been in power, the struggling on with our majority of one. If we had not had a majority, we would get not have remained in office.""",61

The having presented their report to Parliament, my executive considers that the denial sbould be made public in manner, and we will, therefore, be glad if you will acquaint Parliament with the fact as set forth in the letter of 6th inst., above referred to, and oblige, Tours truly, The Victorian Provincial Press Association, W. H . WADDELL, Secretary. The letter forwarded to the Inter-State Commission is dated the 6th June, and reads as follows: At an executive council meeting of the Victorian Provincial Press Association, held yesterday, the Inter-State Commission's report upon the combination known as Typothetna was considered. In the report it is stated that the Victorian Provincial Press Association is an affiliated member of the above combination, and that affiliation involves co-operation in observing and enforcing the cardinal features of the contract said to bave been entered into between the Melbourne Master Printers' Association, paper merchants, and suppliers of printers' materials in the State of Victoria. W it h regard thereto I am directed by my executive to inform you that the Victorian Provincial Press Association is not now, and never has been, in affiliation with the combination referred to in the report; that it is not aware of any contract between any of the parties; .and that it has never been asked to observe or enforce any of the provisions of such a contract; and my executive council therefore fails to see any justification for our association's inclusion as a member of the combination.",61
394,Mr ARTHUR,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,And . yet we are asked to accept the Inter-State Commission's report without evidence - I am,62
395,Mr SAMPSON,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"The Provincial Press Association was never requested send any representatives to give evidence sentiments he has expressed. before the Inter-State Commission. has heen included by the Commission as part of the combine without having had the opportunity of giving evidence, or, far as the association knows, without any evidence being presented to the Commisevidence sion that it was affiliated or connected with the combine, which this letter plicitly denies.",62
396,Mr FENTON,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,Who is responsible for a serious blunder like that?,62
397,Mr SAMPSON,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,We can only ascertain that after the evidence is presented.,62
398,Mr BRENNAN,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,But the evidence is not to be presented.,62
399,Mr SAMPSON,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"There is only a bald report declaring that there is affiliation between the Victorian Master Printers' Association and the Victorian Provincial Press Association, and we have no evidence as to how the Commission has based its statement to that effect. The Victorian Provincial Press Association has never been connected with the Master Printers' Association, and knows nothing of any contracts. It is in no way associated with the combine, and it has not been asked to give evidence. We are all most anxious that the Inter-State Commission shall provide Parliament with valuable information in connection with the Tariff and other matters, but if reports of this character are to be submitted, they will very largely discount the value of the Commission's reports when they come before us. The Secretary of the Victorian Provincial Press Association has taken the proper course of forwarding this letter to the Inter-State Commission. The association is desirous that the Inter-State Commission shall justify its finding in relation to the Victorian Provincial Press Association, or else withdraw absolutely its report associating that body with the Master Printers' Association. So far no reply has been received from the Inter-State Commission, and, in order to vindicate its position and justify itself to the public, and gain for its denial the same publicity as is given to the report of the Commis- sion, I have been requested to read these letters, and hand them to Hansard for publication.  exceedingly pleased to hear the statement made by the honourable memto ber for Wimmera. I quite endorse the If the It Inter-State Commission makes a big blunder over one particular item, how can we depend on its reports when they come so before us ? Some honourable members profess to be satisfied with a summary of the the Commission takes. I have already indicated that I shall not be satisexfied with anything less than a report which is as near a verbatim report as it is possible to get. The Treasurer has given us two small statements in regard to the finances, but honourable members are not - yet satisfied, and I add my plea to those already made this afternoon for a very concise statement of the condition of the finances to be submitted prior to the House being dissolved. I do not know whether Ministers agree to a statement made on the 11th March by the Attorney General at the Glenlee State School, in the Wannon electorate, and reported in the N h ill Free Press of the 13th March. This statement has a very important bearing on the manner in which the Government are dealing with the finances just prior to a general election. The Attorney-General is reported to Eave saidWhy, then, is an autumn session necessary? If we are going to carry out the intention of getting a double dissolution, and getting the people to support us in that, it will be lutely necessary to have a meeting of Parliament by which we can send up the test Bills, and have them rejected, before the time arrives for the Treasurer to bring down the statement of thefinancialposition. I call the special attention of the Treasurer to the concluding words. To use a plain phrase heard every day i u the streets, "" Does this account for the milk in the cocoanut?"" Is this the reason why the House and the country are to be kept in absolute ignorance of the true state of the finances, simply because Ministers desire to get a dissolution and go to the country without showing exactly what the financial position is ?",62
400,Sir JOHN FOKREST,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,We did not get the Budget speech last year until the 2nd October.,63
401,Mr FENTON,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"The Treasurer cannot shield himself behind an excuse of that character, because he has always been a* stout protestor against delayed Budget statements. Over and over again, when in Opposition, he has denounced Treasurers for not presenting Budget statements earlier, notwithstanding that sometimes there was justifiable excuse for delay. As far back as the 11th March, we had the Attorney-General saying that it was necessary to bring the test Bills in and have them rejected, and to get a dissolution, and not to tell the country of the state of the nnances. It is a very serious position we find ourselves in within a few days of an election and of the close of the financial year, when the Treasurer ouglit to be able to tell us the exact financial position.",63
402,Sir JOHN FORREST,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"We could not have the Budget until August, anyhow.",63
403,Mr FENTON,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"Parliamen t will then be dissolved, and we ought to have a fuller statement than we have had.",63
404,Sir JOHN FORREST,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,I have given all I can.,63
405,Mr FENTON,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"Does the speech of the Attorney-General in the Wannon electorate explain why the Government were in such a h u r ry to get a double dissolution? The present Government came in to put the finances and the Departments right, but they bave made a muddle of both. The replies of the Prime Minister and other members of the Government to questions in respect to the Tariff were of a very different character Friday last from what they were abso- some days before. On Friday last, i u answer to the earnest pleadings of the honourable member for Indi - it was an arrangement, and a nice b it of play-the Minister of Trade and Customs, with quite a show of enthusiasm, said that should the Government survive the general election, aud once more find themselves on the Treasury bench, the anomalies in the Tariff would be rectified on the assembling of the new Parliament. On 14th May of this year the honourable member for Capricornia asked the following questions:1. Has the Prime Minister or the Minister of Trade and Customs invited or instructed the Inter-State Commission to make recommendations for the adjustment and revision of the Tariff ? 2. Is it the intention of the Inter-State Commission to make any progress report as to the amendment of the Tariff? 3. Is it the intention of the Inter-State Commission to wait until it has completed the taking of evidence on all requests and in nil States before making any recommendations to Parliament with respect to Tariff amendment or revision? 4. On what date, if at all, was the Inter-State Commission asked to make an interim cr progress report with respect to the Tariff ? To these questions the Prime Minister replied as follows:1. Yes, under date 8th September, 1913. The Inter-State Commission advises tliat2 and 3. Pending the hearing of evidence in all the States interested, the Commission is unable to arrive at any definite conclusions which would enable it to submit a progress report in connection with the Tariff. If , however, as the investigation proceeds, such a course is found by the Commission to be expedient, it will be taken. 4. No special request has been made for an interim report. (See reply to 2 and 3.) On 2Sth May, about a fortnight ago, the Prime Minister, when speaking on the same subject, and referring to some observations of my own, is thus reported in Hansard, page 1645-6When the Inter-State Commission has completed its investigations into the Tariff, the responsibility of this Parliament will commence, and it will be for this Parliament to exercise that responsibility in the light of the information furnished by the Inter-State Commission. . . . Have they not been appointed for the purpose of informing this House? It is their prime function; but what the honourable member wants is that we shall dictate to them what they shall do, what industries they shall investigate, when they shall report, and what evidence they shall submit. That would be an interference with the proper functions of the Commission, as laid down in the Act, and on the Government do not intend to lend themselves to any such action. Here we have from the head of the Government very different statements in reference to the Tariff, and the first was no doubt given after deliberation and consultation with the Inter-State Commission. The second statement was made, I think, on the motion for the adjournment of the House by the honourable member for Cook.",63
406,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"""What is wrong with the statement?",64
407,Mr FENTON,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,A1 1 I can say is that it seems to be a direct contradiction of what the Minister of Trade and Customs said on Friday last.,64
408,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,I do not think so.,64
409,Mr FENTON,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"I do, and it proves the insincerity of the Government on the Tariff issue. The Government speak with so many voices that it is difficult to know what their intentions really are. Here is something about a leading article which appeared in the Times, though I do not know why that newspaper should call this a "" Liberal "" Government, because it is Fusion from top to bottom, and not nearly such a good fusion as the previous oneTlie Times, in a leading article, says that the Liberal Ministry's policy appears to be mainly one of negation, and policies of that order do not usually appeal to the Democracies of new countries.",64
410,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,The Times correspondent out here is very friendly to the Labour party.,64
411,Mr FENTON,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"This is not a contribution by the correspondent, but a leading article coming from the editorial chair.",64
412,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,We know who informs the editor.,64
413,Mr FENTON,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"-The Times, which is a leading newspaper in the British community, is not considered to show any extreme bias, particularly in favour of the Labour party, and yet we find it expressing the opinion that the policy of the present Liberal Goveniment here is one of negation.",64
414,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,I tell the honourable member very plainly that the correspondent is biased in favour of the Labour party.,64
415,Mr AKCHIBALD,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,That is quite incorrect.,64
416,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"We never get a "" show,"" anyhow.",64
417,Mr FENTON,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"All I can say is that the press of Australia bas been extremely kind to the Prime Minister and his Government, and if the Labour party could get the same journalistic support they would sweep the polls in the easiest fashion. Mr JosErn COOK - I am not talking of the Australian press.",64
418,Mr FENTON,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"It is a strange thing that in both the Postal Department and the Defence Department the Australian-born, however educated and expert, does not seem, to obtain a fair "" show."" I have information regarding highly intelligent, well-qualified young officers in the military, who, because they happened to be Australian-born, and not from the Imperial service, are denied positions to which they naturally aspire:",64
419,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,That cannot be laid at the door of this Government.,64
420,Mr FENTON,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,I am speaking of what is happening at the present time.,64
421,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,We have just filled two of the highest positions from our own people.,64
422,Mr FENTON,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"That is so; and there is Colonel Parnell, who has occupied the highest position in this State as Commandant, and who has been sent to the Military College. It seems to me thai. Australian-trained officers can manage Australian cadets in a far better fashion than do the imported men.",64
423,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,And Australian oflicers are doing it.,64
424,Mr FENTON,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"The officers to whom I refer, when they were placed in certain positions, were promised by their superior officers that, should they qualify on certain lines, they would be entitled, after examination, to posts that were offering. Young men of exceptional intelligence, after triumphantly coming through the most severe tests, were denied a chance of stepping higher up the ladder. They submitted applications for transfer to the Instructional Staff, and were prepared to undergo examinations similar to the examinations which the ex-Imperial men are subjected to; but, to their disappointment, the A.A.G. returned their papers, with a memorandum stating that, owing to their not having Imperial service, the applications could not be considered. I hope that inquiries will be made regarding this, because if there is one thing necessary to the success of our defence scheme it is that young Australians may be able to go up the ladder, rung by rung, to the most important positions. Mr JosErn COOK - I suggest that the honourable member should compare the number of omcers we have brought to Australia with the number of officers brought by our predecessors.",64
425,Mr FENTON,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,I do not tliink that our Government was responsible for the appointment of the manager of the Cordite Factory.,65
426,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,I was not referring to that appointment.,65
427,Mr FENTON,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"It is well known at the time there was no one in Australia ladder. who understood the manufacture of cordite, and that we had therefore an officer for the purpose.",65
428,Mr RILEY,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,And so with the Small Arms Factory.,65
429,Mr FENTON,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"Quite so. I am not going to detract from the able members opposite in connection with the defence system, but I think they will lation. admit that the late Administration had to lay the foundation of the various services in connection with the Department, ancl that it was almost essential that some of the officers required for them should be imported; but we have now a number of young Australians highly intelligent and qualified in every way to f ill tliese posisubjected tions. I have some in my own electorate, but they are debarred from promotion. officers Surely the Prime Minister does prove of that sort of thing. They are prepared to submit to the necessary exAct. aminations and to stand aside if they cannot pass them. . The Commanding be amended. Officer tells them, however, that they are not competent to f ill these positions because they have not had Imperial service.",65
430,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,Does the honourable member say that an ordinary officer is barred from promotion because he has not tions. had Imperial service?,65
431,Mr FENTON,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"I can vouch f o information. I have gone to considerable trouble to investigate the whole matter, and can vouch for the statement which I have before me. It is an actual fact that Act. this takes place, and it is a disgrace to Australia. In this written statement it is set out thatOflicers have submitted applications transfers to the Instructional StaffThat is in respect of the artillery and otlier branches of the service. SergeantMajors have been actually doing instructional work and have done it well. They have been promoted from time to time, but they are now debarred from further promotion and transfer. This barrier must have been raised by an English officer.",65
432,Mr KENDELL,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,When was this regulation issued ?,65
433,Mr FENTON,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"It must have been issued quite recently, because these men thought that they had a right to go for these positions. It was thought that a man, no matter how bumble his b i r t h , was eligible for promotion, and that he that could go on and reach the top of the",65
434,Mr MATHEWS,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,The senior officers to import have barred that for years.,65
435,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,That is the honourable member's answer. That grievance is years old.,65

446,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,The honourable member every day is up against the legisfor lation of his own party. He is denouncing his own legislation.,65
447,Mr FENTON,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,"That is a wrong statement. The Postal Department is also importing men to fill certain vacancies to which men already in the Service should be appointed. I understand, for instance, that the position of Chief Electrical Engineer for the Department in Queensland is vacant, and that it is said that there is no one in the Service f it to fill it. During the absence of the Chief Electrical Engineer from Victoria his duties were satisfactorily carried out by men who are now held not to be competent to fill the Queensland appointment. Australians who have been trained here, and who know more about local conditions than men coming from abroad could possibly hope to' know, are being put aside. If this sort of thing is to continue, we might just as well put up, over the door of many of our Departments, the notice, "" No Australian need apply."" Some of the cleverest young men in the Department are being kept down, in certain cases, by their superior officers, although they have passed the necessary examinations for promotion. In answer to a question which I asked in the House I was given a long list of officers who have been imported by the Postal Department. The full list ought to have appeared in Hansard. I asked the Postmaster-General recentlyWas it necessary to negotiate with an electrical engineer in Ceylon to fill the vacant position of electrical engineer in Queensland (Postmaster-General's Department) while one of the applicants for that position is considered capable to occupy the position of acting electrical engineer for Viotoria during the absence of Sir. Dircks for eight or nine months, and is not this position a more important one than the one for which he was an applicant? The reply that I received wasTwo members of the engineering staff of the British Post Office, who are eligible for appointment, without examination, uncier section 31 of the Publio Service Act, have been nominated for appointment as assistant engineers, Chief Electrical Engineer's Office, Postmaster General's Department, at the salary of £468 per anncfm. Suitable engineering offioers, with the qualifications desired in the position in question, are not available from within the Service, and the nominations have been made to more effectively meet the public requirements for an official Telegraph and Telephone Service. Here, again, we find Australians having to give place to a man from Ceylon or some other place over sea. tice' is having a very discouraging eifect on some of the finest men we have in the Postal Department. I applaud what the Postmaster-General has done in causing men in the Service to be trained to occupy high positions in it . Training schools sbould have been established years ago in connection with all the Departments. Such a school was established many years ago in the Department of Trade and Customs, with the result that some of the best men in the Service today are not more than thirty or thirty-five years old. Mr Lockyer told me that he would have no hesitation in recommending any one of them to act as a State Collector of Customs.  orable member do with others who have spent practically all their lives in the Service ? Would he keep them down t",66
448,Mr FENTON,DIVISIONAL RETURNING,Certainl y not. I am simply pointing out that the Department itself has trained young men to fill the highest positions in the Service.,66
