1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon Leo MCLeay) took the chair at 2 p.m., and read prayers. NA NA",11
2,Mr COBB,FRIGATE CONTRACT,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware of the statement to the National Crime Authority made on 17 August 1989 regarding the matter of alleged corruption committed by John Francis Halfpenny? In particular, is the Prime Minister aware of clause 6 and subsequent clauses of the statement, which includes an allegation relating to Transfield and its involvement in the frigate contract? Will the Prime Minister investigate these allegations?",11
3,Mr HAWKE,FRIGATE CONTRACT,"No, I am not aware of those statements to which the honourable gentleman refers. I will have them looked at. NA NA",11
4,Mr GEAR,YOUNG PEOPLE,My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security. I refer to the Government's social justice strategy for young people. Could the Minister tell the House what measures were announced as part of. this strategy to improve income support for disadvantaged young people?,11
5,Mr HOWE,YOUNG PEOPLE,"The question from the honourable. member concerns the development by the Government of a comprehensive social justice strategy with respect to young people. One characteristic of that strategy is that it has been formulated with very close recognition of the importance of the various portfolios working together. There has been a recognition that there needs to be Commonwealth cooperation, not only between a number of departments, but also with States and the voluntary sector. It has also been recognised that it is important for the Government to make a strong financial commitment with respect to the young homeless. That has been done in what is more than a $100m package. The Government has taken account of the Burdekin report into homeless children and of the concerns that exist .among people working very closely with youth, particularly our homeless youth, with respect to the need to target our income support arrangements more effectively and to ensure that the assistance provided is appropriate and substantial. The Government has improved the young homeless allowance and provided an additional increase of $7.50 a week. The young homeless allowance will be indexed annually as a result of this Budget. There will be an increase in the maximum payment to young people forced to live away from home of almost $14 a week in January 1990-from $81.40 to $95.10. One of the areas that I am sure the honourable member for Canning would have encountered that has caused concern has been the question of waiting periods. We have been concerned' to approach this area in a respopsible way which deals with the needs of young people who are often in extreme situations of crisis. It will be possible under the new legislation to reduce the waiting period from a maximum of six weeks to' two weeks in exceptional circumstances. It will be possible to pay someone immediately in cases of absolute necessity where physical or sexual abuse is involved when a young person returns home. We have also made some changes that do 'flot technically deal with the problem of young homeless people. There is a necessity for some young people to move away from home and often in rural situations that is unavoidable. We have made an adjustment to the job search allowance at a level equivalent to the young homeless allowance. This will allow for payment to be made to young people who have worked for a period of up to six months and have had time away from home without parental support. Something like 4,000 young people will benefit from these changes. I think all members of the House have shown some concern for young homeless people over the last year. The matter has been taken very seriously. The Government has the Burdekin report. We think the' response that has been made by the Government is comprehensive. In terms of my own area of responsibility, the response has been very substantial. It has broadly been welcomed by people, especially by those who work closely with young homeless people. I hope it is one that will be followed through by all members of the House. I hope that they will take a particular interest in those people, particularly those in the voluntary sector who work day in and day out to provide services for very disadvantaged young people.",11
6,Mr SPEAKER,YOUNG PEOPLE,"Before calling the honourable member for Parkes, I advise the House that the photographer in the Gallery is taking photographs for a production for the Department of the House of Representatives. NA",12
7,Mr COBB,FRIGATE CONTRACT,I direct my question to the Minister for Defence. Did a Mr John Francis Halfpenny make representations to the Minister about the frigate contract? On how many occasions did he discuss this issue with him? On whose behalf were these representations made?,12
8,Mr BEAZLEY,FRIGATE CONTRACT,"Along with probably thousands of others, John Halfpenny made frequent representations to me on the question of the frigate project. His advocacy was within the framework, as presented to me, of the activities of the Trades and Labour .Council of Victoria. The Trades and Labour Council and the various unions in. Victoria have made absolutely no secret about the fact that over the last few months and years they have been strongly supporting a successful bid by Australian Marine Engineering Consolidated Ltd for the frigate project. I cannot really say how many times Mr Halfpenny approached or talked to me about it but I would say it would have been a very substantial number of times. Likewise, I received representations from union officials and others from New South Wales and Victoria. I do not think Mr Halfpenny's advocacy of the frigate project is anything like national secret. NA  Security aware of claims that pensioners in most need will gain little from the Government's retirement incomes policy? Can the Minister inform the House what immediate benefits will flow to maximum rate pensioners from the Government's statement?",12
9,Mr HOWE,RETIREMENT INCOMES POLICY,"It is true that, while there has been some recognition and welcoming of the statement on retirement incomes policy that the Government made in association with the Budget, there have been those who have sought to minimise what the Government's commitment has been to age pensioners. I think it is worth recording for the House and for the honourable member for Chifley the facts of the matter. Rather than there being merely an increase of $2 to age pensions, we are taking a number of steps which will substantially improve the lot of age pensioners. We are bringing indexation forward 12 weeks. The November increase will be $4.40 a week for single pensioners and $7.30 a week combined for couples. The April indexation increase will be eight weeks early. In association with that there will be a special additional increase, over and above indexation, Â·of $2 for single people and $3.30 for married couples. There will also be a substantial improvement for what all pensioners regard as their most needy group-those who are renting privately. Their rent assistance will increase from $15 to $30 in the course of the next 12 months, and, of course, the pension free tax area will become 100 per cent tax free by next July. In the course of the next year the almost typical pensioner will be receiving unprecedented increases-a pension increase of around $11 for single pensioners, the dramatic increase of up to $15 maximum that I referred to in rent assistance and the fact that the free area will - ecome tax free over the next 12 months. Over and above those increases this Government will be making a further commitment to indexation. So we will have the most comprehensive indexation in place in any period in Australia's history. We will be indexing the pension, rent assistance, the free a area and fringe benefits limits. Never before has the age pension been protected in terms of income security more strongly than in this package, announced in this Budget. Given that fact, it is no surprise that age pensioners, particularly the Combined Pensioners Association of New South Wales, have been somewhat concerned. Apparently, they are not impressed by the assurances of the honourable member for Wentworth. They want to know much more clearly the Opposition's position with respect to the major reforms that have been introduced. They do not mind having a cup of tea or a chat, but they would like to know publicly and see on the record the Opposition's position.",12
10,Mr TUCKEY,RETIREMENT INCOMES POLICY,"Mr Speaker, I take a point of order. Section 145 deals with relevance. I remind you that under this Government we have seen the number of ministerial statements fall from 513 to 267.",13
11,Mr SPEAKER,RETIREMENT INCOMES POLICY,Order! There is no point of order.,13
12,Mr TUCKEY,RETIREMENT INCOMES POLICY,"Mr Speaker, the point of order is-",13
13,Mr SPEAKER,RETIREMENT INCOMES POLICY,Order! The honourable member for O'Connor has raised a point of order. He will resume his seat and I will give him a ruling.,13
14,Mr TUCKEY,RETIREMENT INCOMES POLICY,"Mr Speaker, on a further point of order-",13
15,Mr SPEAKER,RETIREMENT INCOMES POLICY,"The honourable member might first let me give him a ruling on his first point or order. There is no point of order. The Minister is answering the question in the terms of the Standing Orders. The one in question is standing order 145, not a section, as the honourable member referred to it.",13
16,Mr TUCKEY,RETIREMENT INCOMES POLICY,"Mr Speaker, standing order 145 states, 'An answer shall be relevant to the question'. The Minister, having made a statement, is wasting the time-",13
17,Mr SPEAKER,RETIREMENT INCOMES POLICY,Order! Does the honourable member have a second point of order?,13
18,Mr TUCKEY,RETIREMENT INCOMES POLICY,"Yes, Mr Speaker. My second point of order is that the Minister is now reverting to Opposition policies, which are not within his competence.",13
19,Mr SPEAKER,RETIREMENT INCOMES POLICY,Order! The honourable member will resume his seat. There is no point of order. Previous Speakers have frequently ruled that a Minister can allude to other matters when he is answering a question.,13
20,Mr HOWE,RETIREMENT INCOMES POLICY,"All I was seeking to do was to put on the record, within the context of this Parliament, what is effectively contained in a press release and a statement of the Combined Pensioners Association of New South Wales. The pensioners have raised a number of specific issues-indexation of the base pension rate, increases in rent assistance, the rent assistance supplement, the income test free area of the pension, the pensioner tax rebate and improvements for people in the 60 to 64 years age group-and asked whether they can get from the Opposition a clear-cut and firm position that can be put against the policy the Government is putting in place, for the first time, regarding retirement incomes. It is all very well for the Opposition to talk about saving $1 billion in social security expenditure while, on the other hand, saying that it will protect the aged, families, youth or any group that puts any pressure on it. It will look after the veterans, it will look after every group but, on the other hand, from social security it will save $1 billion. When the honourable member for Wentworth goes to New South Wales and has a cup of tea, he should tell them something a bit more specific than last time and should tell them where he is going to find that $1 billion. Mr Connolly- Mr Speaker, on a point of order, just for the record: the Minister has misrepresented the Opposition's position.",13
21,Mr SPEAKER,RETIREMENT INCOMES POLICY,"Order! The honourable member for Bradfield will resume his seat. Mr Connolly-We are offering full indexation for pensioners, as we have always done.",13
22,Mr SPEAKER,RETIREMENT INCOMES POLICY,"Order! I warn the honourable member for Bradfield. If he attempts to use that sort of strategy again, I will name him. NA  the Arts, Tourism and Territories to his remarks yesterday that the pilots dispute 'has got to be cleaned up, it's got to be settled, and I think the tourist industry has had enough, and I don't think it can run much longer'. Does the Minister still stand by these remarks? What progress has he made in persuading the Prime Minister and the Minister for Industrial Relations to this viewpoint?",13
23,Mr HOLDING,AIRLINE PILOTS DISPUTE,"I have pointed out to the House on a number of occasions, and I pointed out again yesterday, the great damage that this strike is doing to the tourism industry and the fact that the longer it goes the more difficulty will be created for various elements in the tourism industry. The honourable gentleman will realise that the very nature of this dispute, which is taking place outside the guidelines and outside the industrial relations structures we have in this country, and in accordance with the policies advocated by the Opposition and most recently endorsed by the Federal President of his own Party, has created a situation that is totally unique in Australian industrial relations. There are no short term solutions, either from the Opposition or from me. What I am doing is proposing, and have proposed, that full cognisance should be taken by the pilots and the Australian Federation of Air Pilots of the great damage they are doing not only to the tourism industry but to the Australian economy. NA",13
24,Dr CHARLESWORTH,MEDICARE,"Can the Minister for Community Services and Health inform the House whether independent research establishes Medicare as. Australia's most popular health insurance system for at least 20 years? Also, do the majority of Australians nontinate social and financial equity as its biggest advantages?",14
25,Dr BLEWETT,MEDICARE,"I am most happy to answer the question from the honourable member for Perth. It is true that the latest survey shows that the support for Medicare is now at an all-time high of 71 per cent. That is higher than for any health insurance scheme in this country in the last 25 years. A tracking study has been done each year of Medicare, and those studies show that the support for Medicare has risen from 44 per cent in the months before its introduction to 71 per cent today. That 71 per cent represents a 4 per cent increase over 1988. Equally important, the opposition to Medicare has dropped from 39 per cent to 25 per cent in the same six-year period and only 12 per cent-the Opposition's friends-want the scheme abolished. The survey quite plainly shows that the main advantage perceived by the population in Medicare is its basic cover for all, in that it financially helps the less well off and really represents value for money, particularly involving the direct billing process. Indeed, many people want to change Medicare but, when one examines the reasons they want to change it, one sees that they want it extended to cover an even wider range of service by the same fair income related way. It is clear from the survey that Medicare is now very much an established part of Australian life. Its greatest advantage seems to be the stability and security that it provides. By contrast to the previous Liberal Government, which in seven years gave us five distinctly different health schemes, this Government has had one scheme giving stability and security throughout that period. We learnt that the Opposition wants to support the 12 per cent who want to abolish Medicare. It is very difficult to find out what the Opposition stands for in health policy because in six whole years it has not presented us with a stable health alternative.",14
26,Mr HAWKE,MEDICARE,"We have had four or five shadow Ministers. Dr BLEWETTYes, I think there have been four or five shadow health Ministers but there has been no stable alternative health policy. We know from the Opposition's vague utterings in this area that it intends to abolish the levy to allow for the reintroduction of private health insurance for medical services and tear the guts out of Medicare. Mr Tim Fischer-I rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker. I take a quite different point of order from that of my colleague. Specifically it relates to the fact that the question asked by the honourable member for Perth was related to the independent survey into Medicare. The Minister answered that question completely. Under standing order 146 a question answered fully cannot be renewed. Further I put to you that he is now moving into a totally different area and should be asked to resume his seat.",14
27,Mr SPEAKER,MEDICARE,The honourable member for Perth asked a two-point question. The Minister is answering the question.,14
28,Dr BLEWETT,MEDICARE,"As I pointed out, the survey revealed that 12 per cent wanted to see the abolition of Medicare. That is the part of the survey that I am now discussing because it is the attitude taken by the Opposition. Although it wants to tear the guts out of Medicare it is not willing to admit it. It is very interesting to look at the Medical Observer dated 3 August. It states: Mr Shack was asked why the policy proposed to retain the name of Medicare, albeit in a reduced scope. The very frank answer from the honourable member for Tangney was: The political strategy is to recognise regrettably that the constituents whom we have to win are wider than this roomthey were mainly surgeons, I thinkand Medicare does have substantial support. What does the phrase 'we have to retain the name Medicare' remind honourable members of? What did Malcolm Fraser say in 1975? He said, 'We will preserve Medibank'. In seven years he had five different health schemes. By the end of those seven years not a single element of Medibank remained. If the Australian people were foolish enough to choose this alternative they would get the same instability of schemes changing year after year, just as the Fraser Government promised to preserve Medibank but then in seven years gave us five health schemes until, in the end, no trace of Medibank remained. I am quite sure that the Australian people will opt for the fairness and stability of Medicare in preference to that alternative. AIRLINE PILOTS DISPUTE: TOURIST NA",14
29,Mr JULL,INDUSTRY,I refer the Prime Minister to his statement last Friday that airlines were asking the Government to look at some form of compensation and that it would consider their request. Has the Government now considered this matter and did the consideration include compensation for operators in the tourist and other affected industries?,15
30,Mr HAWKE,INDUSTRY,"No, the Government has not considered this matter yet. NA NA",15
31,Mr DUBOIS,DRUG ABUSE,"Can the Minister for Community Services and Health inform the House whether there has been a reduction in the consumption of full strength beer as a result of the Government's policies to encourage drinking in moderation as part of the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse? Dr BLEWETTI thank the honourable member for his question, which reflects his interest in the maintenance and improvement of the health status of Australians. I think it is true to say that all members of the House are aware of the health problems that derive from the abuse of alcohol-that is, in terms of illness as a result of the excessive use of alcohol and the problems posed by the use of alcohol in driving and in workplace situations. The problem of alcohol abuse, particularly by young Australians, has been a major emphasis of the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse. That has been supported actively by the governments of all States and Territories, irrespective of party. Earlier this year the States and Territories endorsed the first national health policy on alcohol, adopting a uniform bipartisan stance to alcohol-related issues. That decision by all the health Ministers reflected the wisdom of last year's Budget announcement that we would have a major reform of taxation of beer designed to favour the consumption of lower alcohol beverages. In his Budget statement last year, the Treasurer said that the excise regime relating to beer would be changed to an alcohol content basis better targeted to discouraging excessive alcohol consumption. That was a very simple and effective way of tackling this problem. People would pay less for lower strength beer, protecting both their pockets and their health. I am pleased to be able to say that the pleasure has had a significant effect on the beer market. Independent research conducted by Roy Morgan and Associates, and confirmed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, shows that the market share figures for the consumption of lower strength beer, both reduced and low alcohol beer, rose from approximately 12 per cent to 16 per cent of the total beer market over those 12 months following the introduction of that change in the excise. This is a welcome indication of potential reduction in total per capita consumption of alcohol. This news, I am sure, will be welcomed by all those in the health field, particularly my State colleagues and health Ministers. It shows the wisdom of the Government's policy from a social and economic perspective. It enables the making of healthy choices, making those choices sensible on both personal and economic grounds. PHARMACISTS' REMUNERATION",15
32,Mr SHACK,DRUG ABUSE,"In light of the fact that in relation to pharmacy remuneration the Minister for Housing and Aged Care is so committed to the principle that the umpire's decision should be accepted, why has the Government appealed against a Federal Court ruling on pharmacists' fees which found in favour of the pharmacists?",15
33,Mr STAPLES,DRUG ABUSE,"The answer is quite simple: the process allows it to occur. The maceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal can make a decision and the reality is that the process allow appeals through the courts to occur, and so the Government is doing that. In the current situation, if the Pharmacy Guild of Australia believes that in the process of the latest determination it has a case, it can go through exactly the same process. It invites the very obvious comparison with the Opposition's health policy. My friend and colleague the Minister for Community Services and Health quite clearly and unequivocally exposed the parlous nature of the Opposition's health policy. We saw another good example of that the other day with the statements of the shadow Minister for health, the honourable member for Tangney. He is also now seemingly encouraging pharmacists to overcharge general patients. The Opposition's health policy becomes more in tatters every day because it is launching an attack on people on fixed incomes, particularly older people. That is the state of the Opposition's policy. As the Minister for Social Security also pointed out in Question Time today, the Opposition goes from group to group to try to curry a bit of favour because it knows it is on the nose. It is trying to get votes from any section of electorate. Mr Donald Cameron- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order which is probably the same as that the honourable member for O'Connor would have raised. What in the world has this to do with the question asked of the Minister?",16
34,Mr SPEAKER,DRUG ABUSE,Order! The honourable member for Moreton will resume his seat. The Minister will answer the question.,16
35,Mr STAPLES,DRUG ABUSE,"We can go through it piece by piece if we want to, but the reality is that the Opposition is now questioning the integrity of the Tribunal. The Opposition will not come out and say clearly and simply that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal is biased. It does not have the guts to say it. It cloaks it in terms that suggest that the Government, and principally I as Minister, have done so.",16
36,Mr TUCKEY,DRUG ABUSE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order concerning relevance. The Minister does not seem to understand the question, Pharwhich was about the Federal Court-",16
37,Mr SPEAKER,DRUG ABUSE,Order! The honourable member for O'Connor will resume his seat.,16
38,Mr BEAZLEY,DRUG ABUSE,"Mr Speaker, on the point of order: the Minister was asked a question in terms of the functioning of the Tribunal. Manifestly his answer addresses the question of the functioning of the Tribunal.",16
39,Mr SPEAKER,DRUG ABUSE,"Order! The honourable member for O'Connor has no point of order. The Minister was asked a question on the Tribunal and is answering a question on the Tribunal. The Minister will answer the question. However, he might draw his answer to a close.",16
40,Mr STAPLES,DRUG ABUSE,"I shall, Mr Speaker. In doing so, I want to point out a very strong inconsistency which the pharmacists as well as the general population should be aware of. First of all, the Government is committed to the Tribunal being an independent body. We accept the umpire's decision in that regard. I would hope that the Opposition would as well. But no, that is not what the honourable member for Tangney was saying. He wants to go back through the process to change what was set up in 1981 and politicise it again. It is very strange and inconsistthe ent when one considers that the honourable member for O'Connor, in talking about the remuneration for members of parliament, says that the decision of the Remuneration Tribunal, whatever it is, should be accepted. What is the position of those opposite? Where is their industrial relations policy? Where is the consistency of their policy? Their policy is irrelevant. Mr Shack- Mr Speaker, I request the Minister to table the piece of paper the Prime Minister gave him, which he read from.",16
41,Mr SPEAKER,DRUG ABUSE,Order! Was the Minister quoting from a confidential document?,16
42,Mr STAPLES,DRUG ABUSE,Yes.,16
43,Unknown,DRUG ABUSE,Opposition members interjecting-,16
44,Mr SPEAKER,DRUG ABUSE,Order! The honourable member for Tangney will resume his seat. NA,17
45,Mr FITZGIBBON,ROAD FUNDING,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support. Does the increase of $120m in Federal road funding announced in the Federal Budget represent an increase in the real level of funding for roads by the Hawke Government? Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. Under standing order 144, questions cannot ask for an opinion. That question, in the way in which it was phrased, was asking for the Minister's opinion.",17
46,Mr ROBERT BROWN,ROAD FUNDING,There is no point of order.,17
47,Mr SPEAKER,ROAD FUNDING,Order! There is no point of order. I do not need the Minister to tell me there is no point of order.,17
48,Mr ROBERT BROWN,ROAD FUNDING,The honourable member for Hunter is asking for a statement of fact. That is what I propose to give him.,17
49,Mr SPEAKER,ROAD FUNDING,Order! The Minister will answer the question.,17
50,Mr ROBERT BROWN,ROAD FUNDING,"It is a very perceptive question too, as it would be from the honourable member for Hunter, who has been one of the most effective members of this total Parliament in securing additional funds. Mr Donald Cameron- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The Minister just misled the House.",17
51,Mr SPEAKER,ROAD FUNDING,Order! If the honourable member for Moreton does that again he will not be in here to hear much more.,17
52,Mr ROBERT BROWN,ROAD FUNDING,"Not only has there been a substantial increase in the commitment of Federal funds to the electorate of Hunter but I notice that in the last few days, as a result. of the powerful and compelling representations that have been made by the honourable member for Hunter, the New South Wales Minister for Transport went to that electorate to supplement our funds and to make additional funds available to that electorate as well. It has been a very effective campaign which the honourable member for Hunter has undertaken. The particular question that he asked me was whether or not the additional $120m that this Government has made available for the nation's road system this year, in addition to the very substantial nominal increase, represents an increase in real terms. Briefly, yes, of course it does. The $120m is an increase of about 10 per cent in nominal terms on the amount last year. Everyone knows that the consumer price index (CPI) increase over the last year was about 7 per cent. If there has been an increase in the CPI of 7 per cent and an increase in road funding of 10 per cent, there has been an increase of 3 per cent in real terms. That 3 per cent real increase has brought us this year to a total allocation of funds at the Federal Government level alone-and, of course, the States and local government make their own contributions-of $1,341m. Government members-How much?",17
53,Mr ROBERT BROWN,ROAD FUNDING,"A total of $1,341m at the Federal Government level alone. Last year it was $1,221.5m. As the honourable member for Hunter has indicated, that represents a nominal increase of $120m. I have indicated on other occasions that while some legitimate concern has been expressed by members of the community about the level of road funding, as well as about the level of funding in all other competing areas of government policy and programs, we have to keep in mind, when we get to the final measure, what this Government has done for road funding at the national level compared with any other government in the history of the Commonwealth. There has never been a comparable seven-year period when the level of funding at the Federal level has been higher. We have indicated our commitment, despite the fact that during those years the Government had to contend with very difficult circumstances in order to overcome all of the accumulated deficiencies that we inherited in 1983. Not only have we turned around a Budget deficit of $10m to a surplus of over . $9m, but. also we were able to provide more funds for roads. The Australian people know that. They applaud it. They are driving on the better roads that result from that funding. In answer to the honourable member for Hunter, that improvement which has taken place in road funding, construction and maintenance will continue. NA",17
54,Mr BEALE,HERCULES AIRCRAFT,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. He will recall that previously I have asked him several questions about the Hercules fiasco and, particularly, the disastrous aid mission to Ethiopia. Is the Prime Minister aware that while the Hercules aircraft was in Ethiopia, the Hercules' spare parts at Laverton in Victoria were moved from the Government's control to a red brick building not under the Government's control? Is he further aware that all those spare parts have now been removed from the red brick building without Government authorisation and sold to the company in the Philippines that bought four of the Hercules aircraft? Will the Prime Minister undertake to ask the Australian Federal Police to investigate this matter and report back to the Parliament on how this further theft associated with the Hercules took place?",18
55,Mr HAWKE,HERCULES AIRCRAFT,"Mr Speaker, it may come as a surprise to you and all members of the Parliament that I did not know the shape, size or composition of the building-whether it was made of red bricks, cream bricks or purple bricks. If it is an oversight on my part that as Prime Minister of this country, concerned as I am with the major matters that exist, I did not know what building these spare parts we-e in and what the. colour, shape and size of the building was, or the colour of the bricks, I apologise fervently for such a grave dereliction of duty. Having confessed to not knowing the shape, size or colour of the building, or whether it was brick, straw or timber",18
56,Mr TUCKEY,HERCULES AIRCRAFT,You don't have to be frivolous.,18
57,Mr HAWKE,HERCULES AIRCRAFT,"It was a silly question, asked in a silly form. If the question had asked me to make inquiries about this matter arid not had the stupid preface about the building's shape and the size and colour of bricks, it would have been more sensibly put. In regard to the question having any substance, of course I will have inquiries made and respond to the honourable member. NA",18
58,Mr FREE,BADGERYS CREEK AIRPORT,My question is directed to the Minister for Administrative Services. What is the current position regarding the compulsory acquisition of land at Badgerys Creek for S'ydney's second airport?,18
59,Mr WEST,BADGERYS CREEK AIRPORT,"The Government's recent decisions on Sydney's airport require me to accelerate property acquisition on the Badgerys Creek site. By early 1990 the Government needs to be in a position whereby construction can start on at least a general aviation facility and possibly on a much more substantial airport, depending on the findings of the environmental assessment of the third runway option at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. We decided to use the compulsory process available to the Government under the new Lands Acquisition Act which, amongst other things, offers advantages to owners, including numerous statutory protections and appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal about any of the Government's decisions in the acquisition process. There is also a provision for payment of a 90 per cent advance of the Commonwealth's valuation immediately. This cquld enable relocation elsewhere while compensation negotiations or appeals continue. I have already issued pre-acquisition declarations for the remaining III properties at Badgerys Creek which remain to be acquired by the Government. We will not be seeking to have previous owners vacate their properties prematurely but will allow them to enter into lease-back arrangements if practicable. If particular properties are not required for the first stage of development at Badgerys Creek and the environmental assessment of the third runway proposal at Kingsford Smith does not result in a more extensive development of Badgerys Creek, the previous owners may be able to lease their former properties for several more years yet. NA",18
60,Mr MACPHEE,QANTAS AIRWAYS LTD,Does the Minister for Transport and Communications have complete confidence in all members of the board of Qantas Airways Ltd?,18
61,Mr WILLIS,QANTAS AIRWAYS LTD,Yes. NA,18
62,Mr MILTON,VOYAGER II,"Could the Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business advise the House of the extent of the participation of Australian scientists in the recent historic close encounter of the spacecraft Voyager II with the planet Neptune and the value to Australians of such participation? Perhaps he could also indicate how many millions of miles the craft has travelled since I first tried to ask this question three weeks ago.",18
63,Mr BARRY JONES,VOYAGER II,"Mr Speaker, this is my first answer since you have been in the chair and I pass on my congratulations. Since the honourable member for La Trobe first intimated that he would like to ask a question about Voyager II, it has travelled, according to my roughback-of-the-enve1ope calculation, an additional 37 million kilometres. It is extraordinary to reflect on how much has happened since Voyager began its historic visit. It began in 1977 or, as we on this side of the House think of it, the year 6BH. There is no doubt that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation's Parkes radio telescope, along with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's tracking station at Tidbinbilla, was quite central in picking up the signals from Voyager II's extraordinary encounter with Neptune. The strength of the signal sent out and picked up at Parkes could be measured as 10 to the minus 21 watts per square metre. If one wanted to write it out, it would be the figure 1, with a bar line underneath and then the figure 10 with 20 noughts after it. It is a quite extraordinary piece of technological skill. The Americans deserve the greatest credit for putting up Voyager I and Voyager II. The fact that the one or two minor errors which have occurred in that period have been self-correcting has meant that we have learned more about the composition of the universe since 1977 than probably from the time of Galileo. In Australia we have secured our reputation as being absolutely in the forefront 6f radio astronomy. We have achieved a triumph that has been recognised internationally by the opening of the Australia Telescope last year when the Prime Minister went up to Narrabri. When the Parkes telescope was established in 1964 it was one of the two or three biggest radio telescopes in the world. Since then we have managed to extend and expand our capability. One of the great fringe benefits of this achievement is that we now have a number of space qualified industries in Australia. We have learned more about microengineering than we ever believed possible. It is extraordinary to reflect that when the Parkes installation began, 85 per cent of its content was imported from Germany. By the time the Australia Telescope was inaugurated in our bicentennial year, last year, about 90 per cent of the technology used at the Parkes installation was Australian. We can proudly claim to be leaders in radio astronomy. The contribution made by Voyager II has been extraordinary and, incidentally, it has put Australia on the front pages of science internationally because of the extraordinary prediction by Dr Andrew Prentice from Monash University about the formation of the additional moons found in Neptune. It is very pleasing to see that an area where Australia has held a strong international place for so long has been reinforced in the last few weeks. NA",19
64,Mr BEAZLEY,PRESENTATION OF PAPER,"A paper is tabled as listed in the schedule circulated to honourable members earlier today. Details of the paper will be recorded in Hansard and the Votes and Pr(r ceedings. The schedule read as follows- . Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody-Report of the Inquiry into the death of Darryl Horace Garlett. NA NA Motion (by l\:fr Beazley) agreed to. That this House, in aq:ordance with the provisions of the Parliamentary Papers Act 1908, authorises the pUblication of the report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody of the inquiry into the death of Darryl Horace Garlett. NA Discussion of Matter of Public Importance",19
65,Mr SPEAKER,AIRLINE PILOTS DISPUTE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The devastation of the Australian tourist industry caused by the pilots' dispute and the Government's responsibility in this action. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places",19
66,Mr JULL,AIRLINE PILOTS DISPUTE,"The economy of Australia is poised on the brink of economic disaster. That is a very strong statement but it is Olle that is not too strong to illustrate the current situation that exists in terms of the flow-on effects of the air pilots dispute. The Opposition believeS that we should bring this matter to the attention of the House today in an effort to get the Government at last to do something to solve this particular dispute. All around Australia the effects are now being felt very much indeed. On my latest phone-around today I found that over the weekend in a place like Townsville, for example, we have seen some massive stand-downs in the tourist industry; 548 people have been stood down so far.' In Cairns 600 to 800 casual staff have been stood down and 300 permanent staff have been stood down. That story is the same right around Australia. We are still getting reports of hotels with less than 10 per cent occupancy rates. We are still getting reports of overseas tour operators who are cancelling travel arrangements and incentive travel programs for major groups of holiday-makers into Australia. While last week was bad enough for the industry, the effects are still to be fully felt. The Opposition believes that more than ever before, now is the time that the parties involved in this particular dispute have to get together and to start talking. If they do not get together and start talking we will see the effects of this strike linger on this country for many years to come. Let us lay it firmly on the record that the tourist industry is our biggest export earner. When the domestic industry is taken into account, it is worth $6.5 billion in foreign exchange and it is worth more than $25 billion around Australia. Let us put it on the line that the tourist industry is the biggest private sector employer in Australia. The tourist industry employs more people in Australia than any other area, other than the combined public services of Commonwealth, State and local governments. These areas are being attacked at the moment and driven to a point of economic disaster. A week down the track we have to say: What has happened from the Government in terms of those charter aircraft which last week were just sitting off Australia waiting to come in? We have not as yet seen any sign of those particular aircraft. What has happened to the hundreds of applications that allegedly have been received, from pilots both in Australia and overseas, by the domestic airlines? Why has not some move come about there to make sure that our aircraft can get flying again? What has happened to the invitation for overseas airlines to interline in Australia and to fly on new routes? What has happened in terms of what we have been able to achieve in the emergency clearance of some of the traffic that has been banked up in Australia? Ansett Airlines of Australia alone, reports that 113,000 people around Australia have been left stranded. If 113,000 people have been left stranded by Ansett, we can be assu,red that Australian Airlines would have a similar number of people waiting to be carried. While we ponder these questions, the real truth comes out about some of the disastrous situations that continue to face us in the weeks to come.' For example, the Australian Associated Press report this morning stated: The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) today confirmed that foreign pilots would have to sit examinations and be certified before they could fly Australian jets. The spokesman said that it was impossible to put an exact figure on how long the process would take, but said that it would not be a speedy process. The airline sources said that, if a foreign pilot were rushed in through, at best he may be able to fly within a fortnight. But maybe a fortnight is too long. Maybe the rumours that we are receiving from all over Australia at the momentthat is, that Australia is possibly facing this particular strike for another three weeks or as long as two months-are correct. If that is correct-I sincerely hope that it is notthen we are on the brink of a major economic disaster. It does not matter which people one speaks to in the industry, they are affected. While we make a great point about the difficulty facing the hotel and hospitality industry, let us never forget that tourism affects everybody in our community. Last week I gave some examples of what was happening to the $19 billion in projected developments of tourist infrastructure around Australia and what loss it would be to the Australian economy if those developments were in any way impeded. Let us not forget the very basics-some people say that it is tourism trivia. Do honourable members know that every international visitor who comes to Australia on average consumes three eggs per day? One might say: What has that got to do with the price of eggs? But the plain facts are that the extra consumption that tourists undertake while they are visiting Australia has enormous effects on our primary producers. It is not just eggs; it is also the wheat growers. It is not just the cattle producers; it is also the abattoirs. Mr Andrew-The citrus producers.",20
67,Mr JULL,AIRLINE PILOTS DISPUTE,"It is not just the citrus producers; it is also the manufacturers. Right the way down the line the whole of the Australian economy will be very much affected by this strike and is being affected by this dispute the longer it goes on. The great point about tourism is that it affects every sector of our society. At the moment there are some very worried people in the banking industry because they too know of the difficulties that are being faced by many tourist operators, and they too know what that lack of turnover will do in terms of their profits, just as it does for the egg producer, the citrus producer or somebody who provides the wrapping for a loaf of bread. Australia cannot afford this dispute to go on. What moves have we had by the Government in recent days to try to get on top of the situation? We have had none. The only person from the Government side who I think has made any sense is the man who is sitting at the table, the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Holding). He has at last started to acknowledge the real effects that this strike is having on the industry and throughout Australia. While we did not get any indication from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in Question Time today that any discussion had taken place about compensation, I am sure that we on this side of the House know that that has been very much on the agenda. We know that compensation has been put forward as one of the ways of easing the burden for the airlines. If the easing of the burden for the airlines is to be undertaken, we must think about that great sector of Australian society, the tourist industry. There has been no indication that any compensation will be paid to it. Of course, no compensation could be paid to it because the industry is so huge that it would send the country bankrupt the moment we undertook that course. Let us look at what the real effect might be of providing compensation to Australian Airlines and Ansett Airlines. The Government must take into consideration the fact that if compensation is provided the net effect will be the prolonging of this particular strike; and that is the worse thing that could possibly happen. The pilots dispute is a manifold subject. It is all about politics. It is all about the position of the Prime Minister in his capacity to bring the strike to an end. The point that has not been highlighted in this dispute is the fact that it is all about deregulation and what is going to happen to the Australian airline industry on 31 October next year when we enter the deregulation phase. That is another reason why compensation should not be considered. The problem we have had in Australia for so longeven though I am the first to admit that we have had a very good civil aviation systemis that this industry is now top heavy. The expenses are so great that, once we enter into a deregulated arena, the existing airlines would have a very great capacity not to be able to compete. We have mentioned before that, when the Federal Government asked for applications of interest from new airlines to come onto the route, it received 17 applications. Of those 17, there are only two airlines left in the middle of the field, and those two airlines will be fighting for a small percentage of the available market. I suggest that only one of those airlines will get up. It is interesting to talk to those potential new operators. They make a salient point, that is, with their streamlined operations, on a staff per aircraft ratio, they would be looking at approximately 105 staff for every aircraft. The present domestic operators are now relying on 360 staff per aircraft. We have to realise that, when we talk about this particular dispute, we are talking about deregulation. We are talking about a major restructuring of Australian Airlines and of Ansett. When we hear the Government mentioning the prospect of compensation going to the airlines, we wonder what it is all about. Is it a chance to keep this dispute going much longer than it should so that the existing airlines have the possibility of shedding even more staff? The press reported today that the two major domestic airlines want to shed 25 per cent of their pilots and that they will be looking forward to shedding extra staff so that they will be in a position to take on the deregulated atmosphere on 31 October next year. If that is what this strike is all about, surely there was an easier way to handle it than to take out the bludgeon and smack everybody around the head, as the Prime Minister has done in recent weeks. We on this side of the House have no sympathy for the claims the pilots have made and the way they have gone about the dispute, but we have to remember, too, that the pilots are trying to get themselves to a position of strength so they can negotiate for the best deal they can possibly get at the end of next year with deregulation. This dispute is really in a nasty bind. I have seen no indication from the Government at this stage that there is even the remotest of cracks in its veneer. There is certainly no indication from the airlinesÂ· that they want to accept the Government's proposition, nor is there an indication from the pilots that they are prepared to accept it. As I have said, the only person who has really come to grips with the whole situation is the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories, who is seated at the table at the moment. He knows the tremendous hardship that is coming through. But the plain fact of the situation is that this dispute is about more than just a possible 30 per cent increase for the pilots; this dispute is really about the future of the Australian economy and, by the end of this week, the future of up to 150,000 jobs in the tourism and hospitality industry and the outflow of foreign exchange. Foreign visitors are not coming to Australia and the foreign airlines presently operating on Australia's domestic routes are shipping home millions of dollars in fares as payment for taking domestic passengers around Australia. The Opposition is saying that it is about time there were some cool heads in this dispute for the sake of Australia. It is about time that people started getting together to talk about possible ways of overcoming this dispute. It is perfectly obvious that Australia's present industrial system cannot handle this dispute. All the options that the Government has had have now been knocked off. There is very little room to move, but we must move. Every time we see a net increase of 25,000 international visitors coming into Australia we see another 1,400 jobs for young Australians. I assume that that figure from the Bureau of Industry Economics is reversed when those tourists do not come in. If that is true, we can see what this dispute will do to future employment prospects and the future prosperity of Australia. All around Australia we are now getting reports of tour groups cancelling. Just today visits by 20 tour groups, made through the inbound tourist association and worth $153,800 to Australia, were cancelled. The cancellation of 4,500 room nights has resulted in a loss of revenue of $541,000 and that does not take into account consumption. The real losers in this pilots dispute are the tourist industry in particular and the whole of Australia. We have to get the dispute resolved soon. It must be the prime concern of the Government now at least to get the parties together; to realise that the present industrial system is not working; and to make sure that we get those planes back in the air as soon as we possibly can. If that does not happen there will be no jobs for young Australians, foreign exchange will not come into Australia and the losses around this country will be too horrific to imagine.",21
68,Mr HOLDING,AIRLINE PILOTS DISPUTE,"Melbourne Ports-Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories) (3.04)-First of all, let me divide the speech of the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), into two categories. In the first category he correctly pointed out to the House that the innocent victim of this 8trike is everyone involved in the tourism industry at every level. If the time were made available, he and I could probably spend double the time just recording the litany of economic disasters that the Australian tourism industry faces. That disaster should not be mitigated; it should not be down-played. The fact is that a crisis of enormous proportions is affecting our major export earner. I do not believe that any objective person, looking at this situation, could not but reach the sad but inevitable conclusion that the tourist industry in Australia is facing a major crisis as a result of these actions. So, there would be a measure of agreement as to the effects of this stoppage. Mr Donald Cameron-Why don't you get them talking?",22
69,Mr HOLDING,AIRLINE PILOTS DISPUTE,"We have to analyse the unique quality and nature of this stoppage. As I said in Question Time, the situation here is really outside the parameters of previous industrial relations conflicts in Australia. The interesting statement of the shadow Minister is, 'Get the Government to do something'. The tragedy is that remark belies the whole problem of the Opposition on this issue. The shadow Minister has experience in the problems of the tourist industry. He knows the anguish which has led to sections of that industry seeking legal advice to initiate common law proceedings under section 45D of the Trade Practices Act. He is aware of the recent move initiated on behalf of the Australian Tourism Industry Association and Sir Frank Moore who petitioned the Governor General to invoke sections of the Crimes Act while at the same time offering to provide eminent counsel to negotiate independently with any pilots that were offering. That is evidence of anguish. But it is also evidence that what the Opposition will not face up to is that the pilots in this country have so organised themselves to follow almost step by step the industrial relations policy of the coalition. Mr Tim Fischer-Rubbish!",23
70,Mr HOLDING,AIRLINE PILOTS DISPUTE,"The honourable member now for Farrer can say 'Rubbish', but let me through it. Central to the whole aspect of the Opposition's industrial policy is that ployers and workers should opt out of the industrial relations system. That is what occurred here. Both employers and pilots have opted out of the industrial relations system in accordance with the policy and philosophy of the coalition's industrial policy. Let us not oversimplify the Opposition's policy. It believes, as an integral part of that opting out, that if there is to be a strike there ought to be a secret ballot. Presuming. ably, in the Opposition's mind, that gives a strike some efficacy. The pilots had a secret ballot. So. they followed step 2 of the Opposition's policy. Step 3 is that once one is outside the system employers and workers should negotiate directly on wages and conditions and reach a voluntary agreement. The Opposition should ponder its own words that employers and workers should negotiate directly on wages and conditions and reach a voluntary agreement. There is no mention there of government intervention or anything that says that if there is some disruption to the total economy of Australia, there should be government intervention. The policy of the Opposition on this matter is that employers and workers should negotiate directly on wages and conditions and reach a voluntary agreement. The fourth item is that common law should be used to back up voluntary agreements and that legal aid should be forthcoming. That is about the role that the Opposition sees for government for those who seek damages against either side breaking such an agreement. The Opposition goes on to say that such agreement should be based on more flexible or more productive work practices. Looking at the history of this, it is a microcosm of Liberal Party and coalition industrial relations policy. The pilots have opted to go outside the industrial relations system. They had their ballot. They voted for this form of action. It was open to the airlines to seek to put a bans clause in the award, but they opted to follow the philosophy of the coalition and say, 'If you are wanting to go outside the system, very well, resign and we will accept your resignations. We are prepared to negotiate new agreements with you'. go That is precisely what has been occurring. In my daily conversations with the airlines, emI am assured that attempts to have such discussions are taking place. Nowhere in the has Opposition's policy is there any suggestion that when that process is taking place there is any significant role for government. Mr Dobie-But this is happening under your policy, not our policy.",23
71,Mr HOLDING,AIRLINE PILOTS DISPUTE,"That very interjection concedes the efficacy of the point I am makThat is why last week in this House a series of questions relating to this matter were directed mainly to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). What was the net effect of that? The net effect of those questions, put together, was to be supportive of the actions of the pilots in going outside the industrial relations system. We have seen the devastation and the problems that that causes. Today the shadow Minister for tourism said that he has .no sympathy for the claim or the way the pilots have gone about making it. The way they went about it was exactly in accordance with the Opposition's philosophy and principles. Let us not come in here today, having examined the real problems and anxieties that are prevalent throughout the tourism industry, and shed crocodile tears for a philosophy of industrial relations or a policy of industrial relations which is the logical application of coalition policy. Let there be absolutely no doubt about that. The Opposition can only say, 'We think you ought to do something about it'. The problem that this presents for the Government-Mr Ruddock-Why don't you resign and let us do something about it? That is the option.",23
72,Mr HOLDING,AIRLINE PILOTS DISPUTE,"One does not want to compound the problems that face the tourism industry in Australia and other sections. Is the Opposition suggesting for one moment that we should be telling the airlines how to conduct their negotiations? Should the relevant Ministers be on the telephone to Sir Peter Abeles saying, 'This is how you will conduct your negotiations with the airlines'? If members of the .Opposition want to suggest that, they should at least have the honesty and integrity to say that that is the course they should follow. That is not being suggested because it is completely contrary to the underlying philosophy and policy of the Opposition which tacitly approves this particular approach. The pilots are acting straight down the line in accordance with Opposition policy. Opposition members are the people who say that we have to do something. I do not have any problem with that. Let us look at the latest contribution that has been made to this dispute by no less a person than the national President of the Liberal Party. Honourable members have heard of Mr Elliott. He approves of going outside the industrial relations system. He makes no secret about it; he believes everybody should be outside that system. When we go outside that system the Government has to make a decision either to intervene directly in the dispute and direct the parties or to leave them to it. Mr Dobie-So what do you think should happen?",24
73,Mr HOLDING,AIRLINE PILOTS DISPUTE,"I believe that the pilots ought to go back into the system. They have been invited to go back into the system by the Prime Minister. Let there be no misunderstanding about that. Has the Opposition invited the pilots to go back into the system? Do the shadow Minister for industrial relations and those opposite say that the pilots ought to be back in the system and that they should never have left it? Of course, they do not. Let us hear what Mr Elliott, the prophet and bagman for the coalition, says. He talks about the overseas examples. He says that this is the system that operates in the United States of America, and Australia has the entire industrial relations system wrong and that we have to leave the parties free to bargain. That is his position. But he admits that, in the end, if one airline wants to bargain hard with its pilots, the pilots might stay out for three or four months. He goes on to say that in the United States there have been long strikes in the process of bargaining for wages. At least I will say this for Mr Elliott: he has the integrity to face up to the consequences of his policy. That integrity was not shown in the House today. The pilots have gone outside the system. The Prime Minister and the responsible Ministers have indicated that the pilots should come back into the system because under it, for all their criticism of it, they have done better than any other section of the work force. That is the history. Although average weekly earnings have increased by 38 per cent in recent years, under this system which is now under attack, pilots have won increases of 49 per cent. In this situation the Crimes Act will not work, as I told the sponsors of the petition which was going to the Governor General. It will not work because it talks about strikes or lockouts. We do not have a strike or a lockout. The common law processes are long and difficult. Sections of the industry are organising themselves for protracted common law actions. The position of the Government is clear. The position of the Prime Minister is clear. We believe the pilots ought to be negotiating. We believe they ought to be back in the system and subject to the same kinds of disciplines as every other section of the work force. That view is completely contrary to the policy and philosophy of the Opposition. The shadow Minister and I are totally agreed on the problems the strike has caused for innocent victims. But let me say .this to the  policy which he did not formulate but which he is committed to enunciate-I do not know whether he seriously believes in its efficacypromises this sort of dispute and hardship every time the Opposition encourages groups to go outside the existing industrial relations system. This is a foretaste of things that would come if by some terrible political mishap the Opposition should come to government.",24
74,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AIRLINE PILOTS DISPUTE,Order! The Minister's time has expired.,25
75,Mr TUCKEY,AIRLINE PILOTS DISPUTE,"The Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Holding), having told the public the other day that the pilots dispute was a problem that had to be cleaned up and settled and that the tourist industry had had enough-and the information supporting that is legion-has just spent his 15 minutes saying that he does not think the dispute can run much longer. What is that but an absolute and total admission of the failure of his Government? I underline the word 'Government'. To be in government means to be in charge. That is one of those funny things that the Minister, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) choose to forget when it suits them. You are in charge. You are responsible for the tourist industry. You are responsible for people such as the private hire car driver who picked me up last Friday and who, when I apologised for being late, said 'Don't worry. it is the first job I have had this week, notwithstanding the fact that I have paid $200,000 in the last couple of months to buy into this business'. You are responsible for that man.",25
76,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AIRLINE PILOTS DISPUTE,I ask the honourable member forÂ· O'Connor to direct his remarks through the Chair.,25
77,Mr TUCKEY,AIRLINE PILOTS DISPUTE,"The Minister is responsible. The Government of which he is a member is responsible. Yet, it spends all its time trying to promote this wonderful argument whereby the Opposition .and the policies it proposes are the cause of the problem. They are not, are they? The problem is of the Government's making. The Minister knows better. He went out over the weekend, when no-one was around to hold his hand, and made some very sensible statements. The Minister forgets that the last time this thing happened-this was under the Whitlam Government-the present Prime Minister, who was then President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), was on his side. As Paul Kelly tells us this morning in relation to that dispute: Hawke persuaded Whitlam to capitulate and the TAA pilots got their money. The dispute showed that the AFAP could target a government . . . Of course it can target a government under the system that exists now. We still have a two-airline policy, which the Minister chooses to ignore entirely in making his comparisons with Opposition policy. The Minister has to read all the 28 policies. He has to realise our very strong commitment to privatisation and micro-economic reform, which is another area where this Government has failed and where; in deciding to break up the two-airline policy, it has committed itself through other agreements to locking up the airline terminals, which will perpetuate the problem that is before us now. While a certain group of pilots and their employers have got a monopoly over the Australian people in terms of the provision of air travel, it becomes very difficult to do anything but use the system that we have. But the realities are that the Government has flunked it. It is so desperate to maintain its accord and comparative wage justice that what has it done? It has broken every principle that its leader would have stood forusing foreign workers and the military to break strikes. We are not necessarily critical of the Government for doing that but the Minister should not stand up in times to come and say that it is not practical to do that same thing down at the waterfront because the Government is getting instructions from the ACTU that that is not on. The Minister should not tell us that the Government's system is working in Australia today-a system which could fail if the Government eventually capitulates. We have the evidence of everybody going down the slammer-",25
78,Mr HOLDING,AIRLINE PILOTS DISPUTE,It is your system that is operating at the moment.,26
79,Mr TUCKEY,AIRLINE PILOTS DISPUTE,"No, it is your system, Minister. You can talk about isolated policies of the Opposition until you are blue in the face .. Let me tell you again what you are. You are the Government. You are the Minister for tourism who has created a situation where 16 people are the only occupants of a majOI: resort hotel in Western Australia. It is your system. It is your policy. Do not tell me that it is anybody else's.",26
80,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AIRLINE PILOTS DISPUTE,Order! I ask the honourable member for O'Connor to address his remarks through the Chair in the third person. Mr TUCKEy-It is the Minister's policy.,26
81,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AIRLINE PILOTS DISPUTE,That is correct.,26
82,Mr TUCKEY,AIRLINE PILOTS DISPUTE,"He sits there and interjects without any remarks from you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and then you worry when I address him personally. He invites it and I welcomeÂ· his doing so because he is an absolute failure. Bookings for taxis are down 50 per cent.",26
83,Mr HOLDING,AIRLINE PILOTS DISPUTE,I can give you better statistics than that.,26
84,Mr TUCKEY,AIRLINE PILOTS DISPUTE,"The Minister tells me that he can give me better statistics than that-a further admission of the fact that he knows, as he said over the weekend, that the matter has to be fixed. He is equally concerned because his Prime Minister and his Minister  have told him this morning that they are not prepared to fix it but are going to create history by ramboing their way through this dispute that involves the two-airline system under which the airlines have a huge monopoly. This morning Paul Kelly gave us all the history of the disputes under the system. One does not just opt out of the arbitration system. This is an area in which, when we do these things, there will be no opportunity for secondary boycotts as we know them today, and no opportunity to have a union sued only under sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act. There will be no monopolies granted to airlines. Is it not interesting that all new airlines are registering in Queensland? There may be another reason for that that is not obvious, but the one that is very obvious to me is that that State Government has already legislated for voluntary agreements. The Minister says it will not work. He should take himself off some time to the Lincoln Electric Co. (Australia) Pty Ltd, and look at the simple procedure that company has had for 65 years-a procedure whereby 25 per cent of its pre-tax profits are put into a bonus scheme for. its work force. It is an automatic productivity arrangement that works without the assistance of Simon Crean and Bill Kelty. They do not like it, because they know that they do not have to renegotiate that arrangement every year or two. That procedure does not need renegotiating because it is clear-cut. It is totally oriented to productivity. If I can use the airline analogy, the people, whether they are the cleaners of the aeroplanes, the pilot elite or the refuellers, know that to stop that airline, or even to slow it down, would cost them money. ' That situation is well within the ambit of what the Liberal and National parties are talking about. We would be encouraging people to talk about those concepts. The management of Lincoln Electric, which competes in the international marketplace, tell us that they are very happy with the 75 per cent of profits that they retain, because there is no featherbedding and there is no cousin of the shop steward, in a secondary move, as a safety officer. The company does not need him, and the work force would not tolerate him, because he would cost them money. The reality is that these schemes are available, but all that the Minister, with his tunnel vision on the issue of industrial relations, can see is that, really and truly, it will all happen under our system, but it will be a little bit different. Of course, it will not. We propose a different system whereby people can genuinely get out. I would like to have talked a bit more had it not been for the Minister's commentand speech, about the effects on small businesses, which will be the first to benefit' from our arrangements. Small businesses will set' the target for big business because theirs will be the growth industry if it does not happen. That includes small airlines. They will talk to their 50 or 60 pilots and their 100-member --rk forces per aeroplane, and they will find It IS very easy under our system. The problem is that the Minister's system does not allow f-r that, and when someone says, 'I am leavmg the system', his system has had it. There is no other solution. We have a solution, of course, because we - re retaining the old where it fits, modifying It to ma-e people responsible, and giving other opttons. We will get our system to work. The Minister's system has failed, and the Government has failed and in the process, ha- done very funny things, considering the philosophy that the Minister and his leader have espoused all these years. I remind the Minister that the last time this situation happened it was his leader who demanded that the Prime Minister of the day capitulate.",26
85,Mr MILTON,AIRLINE PILOTS DISPUTE,"For the past two weeks I have been listening very carefully to the comments of the Opposition in relation to this airlines dispute. I had hoped in all that time, in the matters of public importance and questions raised in the House, that I would get something positive from honourable members opposite-something that could assist the Government in what is a very serious dispute. But no' nothing. All we hear from the Opposition .is carping criticism and talk about the problems that the economy is suffering and the har- - hat. is being caused, as though it is glorlfymg m the fact that these things are happening. If one looks at this matter of public importance, one sees that the Opposition raises the devastation to the Australian tourism industry, which is being caused by the dispute as though we, in the Government, did not know that that was happening, and as though we were not concerned that it was happening. Of course, we are. It is the pilots who are caus-ng these problems. It is the pilots who decided they would operate outside the wage fixing agreement by claiming a 30 per cent increase in their salaries. Do honourable members realise what that means? It is an in-rease of about $30,000 a year. The pilots said to the airlines, 'This is not an ambit claim. This is our claim and we're not going to talk about anything else'. We are talking about a 30 per cent wage increase, which is !ll0re than man- workers in this country get m a year. That IS what the pilots are after. The Mini-ter for Industrial Relations (Mr Peter Morns) made the point-and it is a very important point-that the pilots are attempting to operate outside the industrial relations system. That is in accordance with the 0ppositi0t;l's industrial relations policy. That IS what It advocates and that is what the pilots are doing. Today we see the great harm that that is causing to our economy pa-ticularly the tourist industry. We arseemg the Opposition's industrial relations policy in operation. We have asked that the pilots operate within the system. That is what we want them to do. As soon as they come to us and say, 'Look, we're going to operate within the system' we can start talking turkey. The airlines can then talk to them about what is happening. But no, the pilots are not prepared to do that. They say that they will operate outside the system. Over the years what has happened with our system? In over six years of the Hawke Labor Government there has been far less industrial disputation. That has been because of the wages and prices accord. I am not the only one supporting the accord' that has been done by many newspaper dorrespondents. Only recently Kenneth Davidson when writing in the Age newspaper-this 'is not what the Government is saying; it is what correspondents are saying-said: But the success of the accord can be shown by reference to the budget papers. They show that between 1982-83 and 1988-89, while real unit labour co.sts fell by 15 per cent, the corporate gross operatmg surplus as a percentage of non-farm GDP increased from 11.3 per cent to 16.5 per cent. In .other - ords, the economy has prospered. It IS the aim of the wages and prices accord that, i- exchange for workers accepting lower wage mcreases, the Government will improve the social wage. Of course, there is argument about exactly how much improvement has occurred but there is no doubt that there has been an improvement in the health system, in the social security system, in the education system, in housing-as the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr John Scott) knows only too well as far as his electorate is concerned-in roads and in the transport system. All these areas of the social wage have been improved. We would like to see more- boat owners?",27
86,Mr MILTON,AIRLINE PILOTS DISPUTE,"The plain fact of the matter is that the social wage, a concept which the Opposition and the honourable member for Adelaide have no understanding of whatsoever, has managed to keep industrial disputation at a very low level. The Business Council of Australia has allowed its executives to have huge salary increases. We have seen salaries of $200,000 to $400,000 a year being gained by the executives. Mr John Scott-That's obscene.",28
87,Mr MILTON,AIRLINE PILOTS DISPUTE,"As the honourable member for Hindmarsh points out, that sort of level is obscene. As I was pointing out, the executives of this country have let down the nation, and it is the executives that the pilots have been exemplifying. They say, 'Look at the very high salaries that they have been able to negotiate. They've done it outside the system. We want to do the same kind of thing'. So they have come out with a preposterous demand for a 30 per cent wage increase. Mr John Scott-They must have some other sources of income.",28
88,Mr MILTON,AIRLINE PILOTS DISPUTE,"That is interesting. I take it that the honourable member for Hindmarsh is concerned about this too. It is rather strange that the pilots have been able to go on strike in the way they have-that is, by withdrawing their labour. Obviously they must have other sources of income. How else are they managing to live? They must have investments in real estate, such as shopping centres and that sort of thing. We know that for months the Australian Federation of Air Pilots has been preparing its members for this sort of industrial dispute. It warned its members what could happen. I come back to what Kenneth Davidson said: To the extent - hat the pilots' pay claim is anything more than a naked grab based on industrial muscle, it is a c\\lim based on comparative wage justice with executives. Of course, that is just what it is. In the debates that we have had in the House over the past two weeks it has been very clear indeed that the Opposition has aligned itself with the pilots. What would it mean were the pilots to get their 30 per cent wage increase? It would mean-and quite rightly-that all of the maintenance workers in the airline industry, the flight attendants, the mechanics and the engineers would be entitled to make a 30 per cent wage claim. And why not? The pilots have been talking about the years that they need to train to enable them to do their job. I am not denying that. It is a responsible job, as are the jobs of the maintenance engineers, the flight attendants and many of the other people who work in the airline industry. If the pilots were to get a 30 per cent wage increase, then those people would also seek a 30 per cent increase. Thus it would flow on throughout the community. Then what would happen? All companies would pass on that wage increase in the form of price increases and we would have a hefty bout of inflation. Our level of competition in worldÂ· markets would go down. This country would indeed have a Third World economy. These are the kinds of policies that the Opposition has been advocating. Again, as Kenneth Davidson said: Only under a centralised wages system can wage increases be traded for tax cuts or increased expenditure on the social wage. As I said before, I could have gone over figures in the same way as the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) and the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) who, incidentally, have taken part in the debate but who are no longer in the chamber. They do not seem to be interested in the debate any longer. The main point that we have to look at is that the objective of the Government is not to take vengeance on the pilots. We want to see the airline industry and the tourist industry working again together as soon as possible. We appeal to the pilots to come back within the system. If the pilots come back within the system there will be a chance that some trade-off can be made for productivity increases. Of course the pilots deserve some increase in wages but it has to be done within the wage fixing guidelines and not outside them, in some anarchistic system which the Opposition is proposing here today. Again we have seen the Opposition carping with no real criticism, no real positive measures about the way its members can assist the Government in ensuring that the pilots come back within the wage-fixing system. I appeal to the pilots: Come back within the system and we can solve this problem.",28
89,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AIRLINE PILOTS DISPUTE,"Orderl The time for the debate has expired. APPROPRIATION BILL (No.1) Second Reading (Budget Debate) Debate resumed from 31 August, on motion by Mr Keating: That the Bill be now read a second time.",29
90,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,AIRLINE PILOTS DISPUTE,"1 offer my congratulations to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, on your elevation to your present position. This is the first opportunity I have had to do so since you were successful. I am continuing my speech from last Thursday evening. Unfortunately I do not have the benefit of the previous speaker's words fresh in my mind. Those who were following the debate will recall that we had some criticism, from my recollection from the honourable member for Page (Mr Ian Robinson), that the Government should do something-that old catch-cry: the Government should go out and do something-but carefully avoiding to say what should be done. That seems to be the hallmark of the negative comments of the Leader of the Op alternatives. Nor does he generate the economic debate that this country needs. That therefore means that the onus for economic debate falls solely on the Government. In this chamber we find Government members putting forward views, alternatives and choices to ensure that at least an economic debate is taking place in terms of alternatives. The major aspect of this Budget, which I think is exciting and has the greatest. impact on this country's future, is the dramatic movement that is taking place with superannuation. The fact is that as a country we have lagged behind most developed countries in terms of our investment capacity. Our investment capacity has been kept low for a variety of reasons, one of which is that we rewarded speculation and windfall gains by making them tax free. We punished production by ensuring that companies that were profitable paid tax twice, first with company tax and then with personal tax. We tilted the whole strategy on investment, markets and savings towards speculation and windfalls rather than production. At the same time, Australia's capacity to build a savings pool was abysmal. The fact that we have 1989-90 used overseas savings to develop Australian resources is a scandal that must go down in history as one of the greatest failings of the conservative parties of this country. In the North West Shelf there has been an investment of some $12 billion to $15 billion, virtually all of it from overseas. We must question the failure of Australians to invest in the North West Shelf. The reason is very simple: there was not an accumulation of savings. We are looking at having at the end of this century a savings pool via superannuation of some $60 billion per annum. The accumulation of those savings will ensure that there will be funds for long term development in this country-Australian funds invested by Australians for the future Â·of Australia. Any talk about reducing overseas debt and dependency will be just that-talkuntil such time as savings structures and mechanisms are built. In the last 6t years we have seen a sixfold increase in the country's superannuation pool. That will magnify quite dramatically in the next decade. The clear issue that faces the countrythis Budget has addressed it particularly via the superannuation changes-is manufacturing. In the last 6t years we have seen quite dramatic changes in industry policy. The Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce has gone from being a junior back room department to perhaps the most important department in the Government with a number of aggressive, forward looking and positive policies. However, they have been developed in an environment where we have no history in a number of areas. There has been a policy of carrots and sticks-of positive industry support, reduction of tariffs, and removal of the barrier system to protect our industries. The flood in currency means that our currency much more closely reflects our cost of production and, therefore, our domestic prices are much more compatible with our overseas markets, for both export and import replacements. However, I believe that the issue which needs much greater attention and which, quite frankly, governments find hard to address is the question of quality. We have seen an increase in quality awareness and quality programs. The increase has been much too slow, yet at the same time it is difficult to force-feed it. It is difficult to ways to force better quality. Let us look at the automotive industry. In the last six to nine months the greatest complaint that I have received from people buying new Australian made cars has been about the quality of the vehicles, not the design or the cars' mechanical capacity. This issue certainly needs much sharper focus in micro-reforms and it also needs much greater attention from Australian industry. The other aspect of manufacturing which I wish to address is Australia's competitiveness. Whilst in theory Australia is competitive, I believe that our larger cities are becoming less so. There is now a much greater need for national governments to focus more clearly on regions for particular kinds of activities. We operate through a Federal-State system which means that we treat States as being equal and common, but there are vast differences within States. I think the time is fast approaching when the national Government will have to start looking at Australia through regional spectacles. It should look at the various areas within States and target its programs more accurately. In other words, we should be looking towards a regional economic framework. If that does not occur, I do not believe Australia will maximise its potential to be competitive in future manufacturing. We have seen an accumulation of capacity in increasingly crowded and eventually expensive cities. Diseconomies of scale have built up around Sydney and Melbourne and that will occur in other major capital cities unless there is a greater decentralisation of our capacity. Again, there can be no artificial policy of decentralisation because, like our protection systems, that would eventually come asunder. But there can be a policy of regional economics and regional economic strategies where national governments recognise the shortcomings and the benefits of developing a particular region in a particular way. I believe that a country such as Australia, with both its size and potential, has to look much more closely at networtqng from the national Government down through the various regions-whether it be north Queensland, particularly in the tourist field; South Australia in electronics; the Illawarra in some of its heavy engineering; or the find Hunter Valley in some of its specialisations. There needs to be a much closer understanding and awareness within the national structures of the benefits and dis benefits of various activitiCfs in a particular region of the country. With those comments, I indicate my support for the legislation.",29
91,Mr STEELE HALL,AIRLINE PILOTS DISPUTE,"Boothby) (3.46)The Government and the airline pilots have a great deal in common: they are both willing to ignore the disastrous economic indicators which show that Australia is entering one of the most dramatically difficult phases in the history of its trading account with other nations. The pilots of Australia are willing to practise a form of extortion on the Australian people, asking them, through their air fares, to pay an exorbitant price for travel between the various destinations in this country. In a sense, they are willing to hijack the airlines and ignore what, as I have said, is one of the most disastrous scenes that this country has seen in its trading accounts. The Government likewise, through the Budget of the Treasurer (Mr Keating), is ignoring those signs and indicators. Where in the Budget Papers did the Treasurer really acknowledge the problems of inflation and overseas debt? Of course, his Budget Papers were a diversion. He talked of a new incomes policy and other election payments to the people of Australia which indicate that the Government is in an election mode, that it is counting votes rather than economic factors. This Budget document, apart from a few sentences, represents an attempt to divert attention in Australia from those difficult areas which the Government finds too hard to deal with. I suppose it can be said that all governments get tired. After six years in office, this Government is certainly tired. It has brought a great deal of economic deregulation into this country. It has, by its own claims, turned an internal deficit when it took office into the current surplus. Therefore, the Government of the day is not going to the Australian community looking for additional funds in its own right. Yet the previous speaker, the honourable member. for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris), said the external debt will not be dealt with until savings in this country have properly risen. This Government, despite the fact that it has an internal surplus, is presiding over the greatest trading deficit in this country's history. Therefore its rhetoric that its attempts to increase Australian savings will cure the overseas deficit position does not fit squarely with the Government's internal increase in savings, which we are aware of. The fact is that Australia is in a vicious circle of high interest rates which the Government is using in an endeavour to prevent people consuming goods produced overseas. We therefore have an enormously high inflation rate, which makes Australia uncompetitive. I ask the question: When will the Government break out of this mode of mismanagement? The fact is, as shown by the documents that are available to us, that we are, as I have said, in a very difficult scene. It is interesting that the Economic Planning Advisory Council (EPAC)-that body of people assembled under the patronage of the Government, paid for by the vote of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), I think at a cost of $l.4m last year-has had a few things to say about our position and our overseas debt. I refer the House to EPAC's last report. On page 3 it states: Although Australia's debt has been relatively stable for several years this has reflected valuation rather than a sl!stainable balance of trade surplus; most of the other developed country borrowers (except Norway) are now running trade surpluses . . . So there are not many developed countries like us in this position. Under the heading 'The Need for Early Debt Stabilisation', the report goes on to say: In brief, the view of most policy advisers and market economists would be that, in the circumstances facing Australia, domestic demand and income should be managed so as to eliminate internally generated inflationary pressures and at the same time, ensure that external debt levels are stabilised as early as possible. Then it goes to the kernel of the question under the heading 'Getting back on course'. It states: A current account deficit of around 2t% of GOP is needed to stabilise the debt relative to GOP. The current account deficit is currently running at about 4.5-5.5% of GOP. I will translate that: to stabilise-not pay back-the increase in the current debt of $18 billion a year we have to reduce that debt to $8 billion a year. That is a reduction of debt of $10 billion. Some people may say that we should get going on that, but let me say that the enormity of that task beggars belief. To get back on course by reducing the debt by $10 billion we have to have regard to the totality of our trade. At present just under $50 billion of imports are coming into Australia. To stabilise the situation by reducing our debt by $10 billion there has to be a reduction of 20 per cent in our current imports. I invite you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to think of that in terms of items. Of the $47 billion of imported merchandise last year, well over $20 billion is inflexible in terms of import reduction. Is it possible to reduce the level of importation of crude rubber, petroleum and petroleum products, medical and pharmaceutical products, fertilisers, plastics in primary forms, plastics in non-primary forms, chemical materials and products, power generating machinery and equipment, machinery specialised parts, metalworking machinery, general and industrial machinery, office machines, electrical machinery, transport equipment and so on? I believe that all Australian effects managers would say that it is impossible to reduce the $22 billion that is spent on these imports which are in the form of either raw materials or capital equipment which is necessary to process those raw materials. We get to the ridiculous position that if we cannot cut these items, some of which will be used for import replacement purposes, we would have to cut the remaining $25 billion of less necessary imports by something like $10 billion or 40 per cent. What an enormous task. We have to do this because the level of Australia's exports has not increased remarkably in the last few years. In fact, in real terms, exports in 1988-89 decreased. In 1986-87 exports amounted to $33 billion; in 1987-88 $35 billion; arid in 1988-89 $34 billion. So in a situation where our exports have minimally decreased or at best are static and our terms of trade have been at a high level over three or four years and are likely to degenerate, we have to improve our balance of payments by reducing imports. I have drawn the attention of the House to some of the important detail of those imports. It is almost impossible to contemplate reducing those goods which are essential to Australian production, Australian import replacement or Australian export activity. It is in this area that the Government fails to move, other than to maintain high interest rates to the great detriment of all Australian producers. In six years of Labor administration the Government has deregulated Australian producers, who' are in an already uncompetitive scene, and made them less competitive. They are now at the mercy of the world. The answer is clearly before us in the statistics. If we go up the street to buy something we should search for an Australian-made article. However, I know that many people cannot find the Australian-made article they seek. I conclude my remarks by referring to an article in the Age of 22 May, written by Mr Peter Stephens. The article concluded: The truth is much simpler, though less colorful. In the past six years, Australia has squandered precious opportunities to reform its taxation system, its wages and employment system and its training system. Australia is living in the past and mortgaging the future.",30
92,Mrs DARLING,AIRLINE PILOTS DISPUTE,"This is my first opportunity publicly to record my congratulations to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, on achieving your new position.",32
93,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AIRLINE PILOTS DISPUTE,Thank you.,32
94,Mrs DARLING,AIRLINE PILOTS DISPUTE,"The annual Budget brought down by the Federal Government is a weighty affair. Filling four volumes of Budget Papers, plus a further 10 Budget related papers, it is the end result of long hours put in by parliamentarians and public servants from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) to departmental advisers. When one considers the 30 areas of ministerial responsibility, including transport, immigration, social security, employment, education and training, health and veterans' affairs, it is no wonder the end result is so complex. Complex though it may be, it affects-in some areas very closely-the lives and well-being of millions of Australians. Of course, no Budget can satisfy everyone, but there are two important factors in this most recent Budget which I think should be recognised. I refer to the significant increase in steps towards greater social equity-that is, the narrowing of the gap between the rich and the poor-and the $9 billion domestic surplus achieved in this Budget, a turnaround from the projected $9 billion plus domestic deficit which existed when the Australian Labor Party took over the reins of government in 1983. In plain language, this means that instead of running Australia in the red, causing taxpayers to foot the bill for interest on government loans to build roads and provide services, the Government has put the national domestic Budget in the black, allowing us to put Australia on a firm economic footing. This benefits all people, regardless of their circumstances. For too many years governments borrowed money to offer goodies to virtually buy their way into government. Of course, in the long run it was the taxpayer who always paid. I particularly welcome the high priority given by this Federal Government to people with disabilities and the number of initiatives which narrow that gap between the rich and the poor. I would like to touch on just a few of these. It is notable that all pensioners, not only age pensioners, will receive an extra $2 weekly increase in April next year, lifting them above 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. It is important to note that this increase is over and above indexation and that this Budget sets out a five-year plan as from next year. For the first time, it incorporates within the Budget Papers a number of coordinated steps which cumulatively will better the position of aged people, pensioners and people on superannuation. Rent assistthat ance will be increased by $5 a week in cember 1989, by an additional $5 a week in June 1990, and by a further $5 in September 1990; and from March 1991 it will be dexed in line with the consumer price index. The Government has also responded to the Burdekin report on youth homelessness with a four-year $100m package, including increased housing assistance, major improvesuffer ments in income support, important means to improve the participation of disadvanbe taged young people in education, upgrading of labour market assistance community-based health services. A national Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander educatation tion policy has been embarked upon, drawtackled ing together previously separate programs, a cost of $89 billion this year-up $34m on last year's. figure. And an extra $15m is be distributed under the existing mortgage and rent relief scheme. There are a number of areas in which this Government has incorporated aspects from different departments to. ensure a coordiSupport nated approach to social equity. I refer this context to policies on women's health, sport, the environment, conservation, roads, jobs and, particularly important, pilot projabilities ects to assess the best ways to assist people with disabilities. I welcome the higher priorsporting, ity given to these people, who are having cope with all of the problems which confront able-bodied Australians but who, in addition, are in many cases having to cope with the after effects of brain damage. Brain damage, whether traumatically acquired or genetic, a major problem in our society. It is always recognised as such. While it is not always easy to get statistics regarding the exact number of brain-damaged people in Australia, it is known to be large. Authoriment tative sources indicate that there are about 3,000 new cases of severe head injury in Australia each year. It is fairly well known that 70 per cent of head injuries are due to road accidents. Road safety authorities, at Federal and State levels, have been instrumental in publicising factor at community and school levels. In fact, most of the road accident victims are males in their early twenties. What a deplorable waste of young life! The life expectancy of people suffering head injuries is similar to for other members of the public and Dethere are probably about 100,000 cases of severe injury. in Australia today. The real cost is human suffering and frustration. Those inwho wish to plan a comprehensive support network must look at costs, and that cost is estimated to be potentially $58,000 per person per year. That means that the cost of services for 3,000 additional Australians who severe brain injury every year is potentially $174m. The total lifetime cost would $2 billion. This cost is based on acute and long term medical care, rehabilitation and and important long term support. I cite these figures as they are a manifesof a major problem which must be in a dedicated and coordinated fashat ion, not by a minority but by a majority of Australian authorities at every level. To alto leviate this problem, the 1989-90 Budget is built on an earlier network of policies initiated by the Hawke Government. For instance, a social security review issues paper called Towards Enabling Policies: Income for People with Disabilities was in released in 1988. This paper goes to the heart of a real situation in Australia where people with physical and/or intellectual disare placed in a work force limbo. Denied expression through a variety of recreation and personal activities, to disabled people have a greater need than able people of the satisfaction of contributing, through the work force, to the community in which they live. Yet until recently the employment options available to them is have been extremely limited. I, therefore, not welcome this Government's dedication to providing people with disabilities with the incentives and opportunities to develop their individual skills and potentials. The Governis doing this in cooperation with members of the public who are donating to a number of providers, adding to the Federal funding to look at greater options, including greater work place options for disabled people in the future. The 1989-90 Budget offers, over the next this year, a series of trials and pilot projects which will be used to provide the building blocks for a more active system for people with disabilities. The projects are the result of the work of the disability task force aimed at identifying ways of increasing employment opportunities. The task force has provided valuable information about broad aptraineeship proaches. However, the Government believes that further work is needed to develop effecapprentice tivt{, long term reforms. These projects will help shape further initiatives which will announced in the 1990-91 Budget. centre on trialling a new means of assessing disability; the evaluation of earlier rehabiliports tation schemes; streamlining disability ices to improve procedures used to identify clients; referrals between departments; and provision of extra help for people who need intensive assistance. People with disabilities often face addithese tional 'vicious circle' labour market disadBudget, vantages. A lack of skills, education or limited work history can compound even a low level of disability, making the task finding work even more daunting. The ect will study people who face these double disadvantages and, at the same time, examprentices program. ine attitudes by employers towards the employment of these people. It will explore and attempt to break down myths about this group, such as, 'They cannot be helped', or, 'They are unemployable'. In this Budget, the Federal Government, . stitute building on an earlier network of policies rent and transition schemes, is looking at extra help with the cost of disability. A sample of those people whose needs will be considered in a project will be: people receiving an invalid pension, people who have moved from an invalid pension into. full titne work, and people with severe disabilities who have been are in open employment for more than a year. We will be reviewing sickness beneficiaries and looking again at the invalid pension. People who do not qualify for the age pension because they cannot meet the 10-year residence requirement are sometimes granted an invalid pension instead. From April 1990 there will be no new grants of invalid pension to people of age pension age. This change will remove an obvious anomaly from the 1981-82 . system. People over the age pension age who 1982-83 . are already receiving the invalid pension un1983-84 . til April 1990 will continue to be eligible. Through the Department of Employment, 1986-87 . Education and Training and a number of 1987-88 . different areas, we are looking practically at programs which may assist disabled job seekers. Jobstart, Jobtrain, disabled apprentices programs, Skillshare and the Australian system all look at the specific needs of disabled people. Under the disabled program, $2.492m has been allocated in this Budget to assist further new be approvals, building on $2.247m in 1987-88 They and $2.492m in 1988-89. Until a government recognises and supthe most disadvantaged people within servour community-particularly those who labour under both physical and intellectual disabilities-that government cannot be seen to be successful in the real terms' of the word. The Hawke Government, in meeting needs over recent years and in this is indeed a successful government in a these terms and in terms of social equity. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard statisof tics relating to the special apprenticeship projtraining program schemes funded by the Federal Government and the disabled apLeave granted. The document read as followsNA This Scheme has several components which conspecial apprenticeship support programs. Curcomponents of Special Apprentice Training are: Group One Year Apprentice Scheme Special Assistance Program Special Trade Training Program Group Apprenticeship Support Program Disabled Apprentices Program Each of the above Programs is distinct, and has existed as a separate program. For this reason they dealt with individually, and details can be found under the appropriate Program heading. NA TRAINING SCHEMES SINCE 1973 Until December 1986 Special Apprentice Training also included the Pre-Apprenticeship Allowance. Total Special Apprentice Training for recent years hal'e been: Expenditure Approvals ($m) 4.5 4636 12.4 12063 23.3 14537 1984-85 . 21.9 . 11514 1985-86 . 20.2 10202 18.86 (a)5406 16.8 5855 1988-89. . . . . . . l4.3(est.) 4030 (a) The lower figure in 1986-87 reflects the sion to discontinue the Pre-Apprenticeship Allowance from I January 1987.  on Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1989-90 have been both informed and enlightening as both sides lobby their causes through a whole range and raft of issues that are appropriate to Australia's lifestyle and political future. In the House both today and last week we have had debate on one ofth- greatest disputes to have affected Australia-it is on everyone's mind-and that is the airline pilots dispute. We have been challenged as to what we are doing about it. It is a problem facing the tourist industry and the whole infrastructure that supports it. One can do something about it; I did. It is pretty easy. I rang the Australian Federation of Air Pilots at 132 Albert Road, South Melbourne, today and had a lengthy discussion with Mr Hep tatives. Captain MCCarthy, its President, was present there at the time. I rang. I have tried to ring Mr Strong twice in Melbourne and Sydney today. I have been assured that he will get back to me. In the brief time that I have in this Appropriation Bill debate, which time has been cut back to 10 minutes, I wish to spend a couple of minutes on the airline pilots dispute. The pilots have said that the 30 per cent has never been non-negotiable. I asked in my telephone call the grassroots question, 'When is somebody going to pick up a phone and say \Hey, when are the airline pilots and the airlines going to get together?'. If one watched the Face to Face program on television yesterday, one saw that the hidden agenda that seemed to be coming through was a most worrying issue. The pilots have said that they have got a right as an association to lobby their cause. No-one would dispute that. I still say that it is obscene in these times to put one's hand up for a 30 per cent increase when the guidelines suggest that it is going to break down the economy. That is to be debated. The last thing we wish to see is the economy slowing Gown, which is a phrase that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has used. Certainly, the effect is Expenditure Approvals felt right across the board in Australia as never before, both financially and physically. The Government does not recognise the deci- Australian pilots because they have left the system. They have attacked the superannuation scheme, and some members of the press have said that one of the major fund suppliers is going to be about $600m worse off in the next couple of weeks as the pilots take their money out of the fund. As I have said, the Government will not allow the pilots to talk. The quote that was left with me by the President of the Australian Federation of Air Pilots was, 'If James Strong rang me up and offered us negotiations, the pilots would be in the air tomorrow, subject to negotiations'. As I said, that 30 per cent has never been non-negotiable. So I think that a lot of work has to be done by some of our politicians and the people who purport to support the system. Another issue I find obscene is the recent increase in the postage entitlement for members of parliament from $9,000 to $30,525. That is an increase of $5,000 more than average weekly earnings. A lot has been said on this issue in both this House and the Senate, and so it should have been. I have been lobbying from the back bench in our party room to try to get a matter of public importance or a censure motion put down, or even a question without notice asked, but this Appropriation Bill and the adjournment debate present the chance to raise this issue. Pulling back the veneer and facade that mask this postage entitlement: the bush telegraph evident in Parliament House at no time carried on its wire any back bench aggravation that suggested that an increase was required. What an increase it was. Section 7 (5). of the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973 has been in force, in the case of the current postage entitlement, since 1 January 1989. But this Government seeks on its own, without the approval of Parliament, to alter the tribunal system. The Minister for Administrative Services (Mr West) put out a lame duck paper explaining the reasons that members could be allowed to write to their constituency once. There would not be too many members here in this House who do not utilise that facility now. This postage entitlement increase is far more sinister than one is led to believe. As I said in a recent press release, Government members are cheats and, I repeat, I believe the increase is illegal. Minister West said on Canberra radio last Thursday: Well, they already get $9,000 to cover a whole range of communication and postal facilities. I have considered requests from some MPs and the Government has decided to agree to those requests. The transcript continues Question: 'What MPs? Sort of marginal seat MPs?'. Mr West: 'No, no, no. Members of the House of Representatives it was said, ought to have the right to communicate directly with each constituent once a year'. The transcript goes on to say: Minister West: '. . . but I think to spend a small, on the budget scale, a small amount of money to enable direct contact through themail.is. and in a closed envelope, addressed personally if they wish to do so, defending their record, putting their record them . . . So the Minister, by his own decree, agrees that all the Government wants to do is mail out to the electorate, flood the letterbox with more mail defending the record. I have studied Labor's phone polling and market research, and it is exemplary. It has all been driven by the member for Australian Nationwide Opinion Polls Pty Ltd, Mr Rod Cameron, who has identified a nice little earner for his company: take the risk with three Liberal marginal seats-Lowe, Chisholm and Adelaide-and the cost to the taxpayer will be about $60,000; but prop 20 Labor seats at a cost to the taxpayer around $400,000. So the Government is franking transferring the cost from the Australian torates. La,bor Party fund raising machine and putting it on the poor old taxpayer. The Minispaid t-r is trying to con the Australian electorate when he knows that this entitlement will be married to Labor's targeted research, which identifies key issue groups and, with $30,000, Labor can direct mail seven times to 10,000 constituents. Consider the other Australia Post facility, which is the householder delivsponsibility ery service. Australia Fost charges just $6.80 per hundred, which allows one complete mail-out for $4,760. Labor can mail to the householder, to the handyman, to the electhe tor, eight times. Target mail is on, and can be identified, with phone polling, at a of $680 per thousand. What does the entitlement of stamps and franking go towards? It certainly goes towards new electors letters. I read with interest the letter from the honourable member for Hawker (Mrs Harvey), in which she claimed that there was not enough franking available for her to send out new electors letters. The 10,000 new electors letters would cost approximately $4,000. How many people go through a constituency? Bonython, Hawker, Sturt and Port Adelaide have an average of 5,300, Bonython in South Australia being the highest with 7,700. The habitation review that brought in those figures has now been concluded. So there have been approximately 69,000 additions for South Australia. That still leaves the daily work record, the constituency and issue of over $5,000. The ministerial entitlement is unlimited. In addition, the $9,000 is available. So to with fancy laser printing, nice fonts and the high technology signature, we just end up filling up the letter box. In my constituency, I am incorporating on all my letters a stamp .which reads: Labor's social justice Budget extras Pensioners $104 p.a. for Food MP's $21525 p.a. for Stamps. So if we link our postage entitlement to our electoral allowance for envelopes, with a proposed franked format saying that the letter comes from the electoral office of Adelaide or Melbourne Ports the cost can be up traced. There is no doubt that corruption of will still occur with the moonlighting of and stamps to other struggling elecThe Government has sought to remove media advertising for election purposes. It has spent millions telling Australians how good the family assistance allowance and the social security increases are. They are goodI would not deny that-but the Government has had to flog them through the media. The Australian Labor Party is shifting the reof peddling its own propaganda 'on to the taxpayers through a $5m postage slush fund. In a letter from the Leader of  Government to desist from this. I think it is illegal and obscene that the Government cost is using taxpayers' money just to fund a campaign. If we as elected members of parliament cannot stand up on our own feet and not have the assistance of a parliamentary postage slush fund, politics has reached a low ebb.",32
95,Mr RONALD EDWARDS,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYMENT AND,"Many people have commented on the election last week of the Speaker and of me as Chairman of Committees. I want to place on record at this time that had other events not intervened you, Mr Deputy Speaker Mountford, may well have been a candidate for the position of Chairman of Committees. I think I can say on behalf of many colleagues in this House that had you pursued that course your election would have been supported by many honourable members, which is a recognition of the fact that you have had a very significant parliamen-ary - areer. I w-nted to take the opportunity m this debate slJilply to acknowledge that. Today's debate on the Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1989-90 is significant because it covers the Government's economic strategy. The problem that the Opposition faces with such debates is the tendency always to marginalise the economic debate. I have been a member of parliament for 6t years. In that time. I have not seen the Opposition come to grips with the essentials of economic management. It is interesting for colleagues such as the Minister at the table, the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support (Mrs Kelly) the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Charles) and me to reflect upon that. When we juxtapose the $9.6 billion deficit that we inherited and the $9.1 billion surplus that we are projecting we see that the Op-osition never c.ame to grips with the question of economic management in thos- 6t years because essentially it marginalised the whole economic debate. The contribution of the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Pratt) was again an example of marginalising. There are fundamental issues to be dealt with in economic management. They are issues that are not simply matters of party position. They are issues that relate to Australia and its future. Contributions such as th- one we have just heard in this Appropriation debate are probably more appropriate for the adjournment debate. Instead of the Oppo.sitio.n coming in here with a major question m terms of an economic address it marginalises the issue. It is interesting that as I and my colleagues move around we hear the Opposition described as superficially attractive but of no substance. This debate simply confirms that. Every time we have an opportunity to listen to the contributions of some honourable members opposite-not all-we find that their intention is to marginalise and trivialise the substantial economic issues. That has just been confirmed yet again. As we move towards an election the same judgment will be made. In the last 10 years the Opposition has never come to grips with the major economic issues of this country. It must address, - s we have, the m-jor economic issues. They mclude restructurmg, the size of the public sector and its deficit, the relationship between government and the private sector and wages policy. All those issues have been addressed in the Appropriation Bill and all are important. . The whole question of retirement incomes policy has not been dealt with properly in the Opposition's contribution so far. Over time we have experienced the Opposition saying that it will abolish the assets test although it has now done a 180-degree turon it. Then it saJ's,' 'We will abolish the capital gains tax', although it is not further committed to such a tax. It has been in the extraordinary position of not being able to deal 'Yit- the - uperannuati0!1 issue. This AppropnatlOn Bin does that; It deals with superannuation in a very fundamental way. It says that we have a responsibility to recognis- th-t currently 13 per cent of the population IS over the age of 65 and that by the year 2025 the figure will be approximately 25 per cent. That poses a question for this country. We have addressed it by saying that w- will pay pensions to the needy. Not only Will we do that but also we will increase the rate of pension to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. That is what has been achieved in this Budget and it is a significant achievement. We have also said that we will encourage, where possible, those in the private sector resorting to superannuation. The Budget addresses that in terms of two interesting principles. Firstly, it recognises that we need to get people to make their own retirement - rrangemen-s whe-e possible and, secondly, It says that If that IS done effectively through agreements between unions and employers we can increase the savings ratio in this country. The Bill does that as well. It is an interesting, long term structural change. The important thing to emphasise in this debate is that in future we will have the prospect of directing more of the Government's resources to the very needy, in terms of the welfare component, and directing more of the private resources, in terms of individuals' and ,employers' contributions, to self-supporting superannuation. That is what this Budget does. It represents a major threshold in terms of the achievement of government and setting an agenda for the future. Something else that is important about this Budget is that it carries on the work established in the April economic statement. It is important to emphasise in this debate that the April statement was about a wage-tax trade-off. It was about saying that we will give tax cuts in exchange for a reduction in wage increases. This Bill pursues that even further because it says, 'We have committed ourselves to that and have achieved the first stage from I July 1989. The next stage will be to suggest that if trade unionists and employees are prepared to negotiate with employers in good faith we will look very favourably on deferring a wage increase in exchange for another 3 per cent superannuation arrangement'. In terms of the debate that we often have in this House, this reflects the fact that underpinning our economic management is a comprehensive wages poliey which the Opposition significantly lacks. Further, if we set about reducing real wages and increasing superannuation and take-home pay because of tax cuts, the Australian economy will be more effective and competitive. That is the other element I want to emphasise. In terms of its overall strategy this Government has made the economy more competitive. Let me put to rest an issue which has been talked about-that is, this Government has reduced outlays and revenue. The Opposition's comments are that, in effect, we have increased our tax take through fiscal drag. I will quote from page 4.42 of the Budget Statements 1989-90. The item on taxation revenue states: Income tax revenue accounts for two-thirds of all revenue. Over the past five years, there has been an increase in the share of income tax revenue to total revenue. This reflected, in the main, the very buoyant state of the economy (with above-trend employment growth and a sustained recovery in corporate profitability), the repair of the income tax system (notably, the fringe benefits tax and expenses substantiation, capital gains tax, the prescribed payments system, and the improved income tax assessment and compliance systems of the Tax Office) and the weakness in non-taxation revenue. It goes on to state: The increase in the tax burden on individuals (average tax rates) that occurs as nominal incomes increase because of the progressive structure of the personal income tax system (commonly referred to as 'fiscal drag') has been more than offset over the past five years as a result of discretionary changes made to the personal income tax rates scale. Following the cuts in personal income tax rates from 1 July 1989, taxpayers as a whole will be paying less tax in 1989-90 than would have been the case if the tax rates scale in place in 1983-84 had been fully indexed for inflation. In summary, it says that, despite the Opposition's claims, the increase in tax revenue under this Government has been a result of an improvement in the efficiency of the tax system and a broadening of the base of the tax system, coupled with the fact that we now have a more effective tax system. We have given more in tax cuts to individual taxpayers than if we had indexed the tax system. The Government has done a great deal in terms of a wage-tax trade-off and the effective reduction in taxes on individuals. We can couple that with the fact that there has also been an improvement in corporate tax collections in the face of substantial reductions in corporate taxation and dividend imputation. It is interesting to note from the Budget Papers that the gross operating surpluswhich, in another sense, is the share of profits-in 1982-83, under the then conservative Government, represented 11.3 per cent of gross domestic product. That gross operating surplus now represents 16.5 per cent of GDP. In effect, we have a more effective and efficient private sector. We have a fairer tax system. As I remarked earlier, we have a more efficient retirement incomes system. It needs to be emphasised that the Government is addressing the major issues confronting this economy-retirement incomes, economic restructuring and the general structure of government outlays and revenue. Appropriation Bill (No. I) is in many senses a most significant Bill. It is very much about a Labor Budget because it addresses the fundamental issues in the economy that need to be addressed. Those issues are about people's standard of living, fairness and equity, and planning for the future. I conclude by saying that nothing marks the distinction between the Government and the Opposition in this place more than the juxtaposition of the $9.6 billion deficit we inherited and the $9.1 billion surplus we are projecting, and the massive increase in unemployment that occurred under the Opposition when it was in government and the massive increase in employment that has occurred since we have been in government. Those are the sorts of contrasts that we ought to draw in a debate of this kind. When we put them before the people of Australia, they will recognise, as we do, that the Budget and the whole strategy of the Government are sound.",37
96,Mr TIM FISCHER,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYMENT AND," This is the first opportunity I have had to commend the honourable member for Henty (Mrs Child) and wish her well following her decision to retire as Speaker of the House. I congratulate the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Leo MCLeay) and the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards) respectively on their election to the two vital positions of Speaker and Chairman of Committees. Turning to the Budget debate, the honourable member for Stirling made reference to the capital gains tax. Of course, he did not tell the House so, but on many occasions the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said, 'There will be no capital gains tax'. Just a couple of years later, the Federal Government turned around and introduced a capital gains tax. The coalition is moving to a position which is quite reasonable, quite sensible and quite well accepted; that is, to introduce a speculation tax which is very clear-cut in its rules so that it can be easily understood and will not generate the mass of paperwork and legal and accountancy requirements which the current capital gains tax is generating. It will provide a simple basis to tax, quite properly, speCUlative gain as an alternative to Labor's draconian capital gains tax approach. I assure the House that the coalition is quite .clear-cut in its approach to this area of tax policy. Further details of our policy in respect of taxation generally will be spelled out in the not too distant future. Indeed, some 30 policies have now been released by the coalition. The number of blue folders that we see indicates just how many are out and about. The criticism by the Government that we have no policies is rejected completely for that reason. I now turn to support in brief what my colleagues have said, particularly in relation to the airline pilots dispute. Time does not permit me to dwell on it, but as the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support (Mrs Kelly) is in the chamber, I say in passing that I drew to her attention the situation relating to the Whittingham airstrip near Singleton and the role of the Civil Aviation Authority. I raise an additional matter in relation to that. An aircraft actually bogged on the runway at Whittingham on Wednesday, 5 July this year, yet on five occasions the Civil Aviation Authority said there was nothing wrong with the runway. I believe that there is an unsatisfactory state of affairs there. I have discussed it with the Minister. It is my hope that we will put safety first in terms 'of these issues and that proper action will be taken in relation to the matter. Turning to the Veterans' Affairs portfolio, I am delighted to see the timely arrival in the chamber of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys). I begin by giving credit where credit is due. When I asked a question without notice earlier this year, specifically targeted to the $300 limitation on dental treatment for veterans, the Minister responded that there had been a breakthrough. Indeed, the Government is increasing from $300 to $375 the limitation on dental treatment, after all the years since May 1985 when that limitation was sneaked into the House at midnight on that famous mini-Budget night on which a range of other cut-backs for veterans were also introduced. As a result of the campaign of many veterans' organisations, including the Returned Services League of Australia (RSL), my own campaign and others, the Government has responded, so I give credit where it is due. I now turn to some other areas of veterans' affairs. I draw the Minister's attention to an interesting fact. Many honourable members will have heard of the concept of a trust account. By definition, a trust account is one that is never meant to go into the red. What do we find when we research the Auditor-General's Audit Report No. 2 on the Department of Veterans' Affairs, impacting on the budget of that Department? We find that in May 1988 the trust account in question-the overseas administrations benefits trust account-went into the red by $1,850,635, contrary to section 34 of the Audit Act. Subsection (3) (b) of section 34 of the Audit Act says: in the case of a payment from the Trust Fundmoneys sufficient for the payment stand to the of a relevant Trust Account or head of the Trust Fund . . . and so forth. In other words, under the Audit Act no trust account should go into the red. Shonky solicitors are in the habit of letting their trust accounts go into the red. Here we have the Department of Veterans' Affairs caught red-handed with one of its trust accounts going into the red by nearly $2m. Let us be quite accurate about this. The Department's own procedures eventually caught up with the overdrawing and subsequently took action to follow up the overdue account which resulted in the trust account going into the red. But paragraph 4.4 on page 6 of the report states: The AAO found that, although the Department had improved the operation of the trust account, some aspects needed to be reviewed. They are summarised in the report. The administration of Veterans' Affairs is crucial to the well-being and standards of quality of service provided to our veterans, our war widows, our dependants, and our ex-service personnel who come within the scope of the repatriation system. That is why I chose, quite properly, to highlight this little error, small in terms of the overall budget of Veterans' Affairs of some $4.8 billion, but indicative of a breakdown whereby that trust account was overdrawn by $1.8m. It is to be hoped that corrective action has now been taken to ensure that does not happen again. An examination of the details of the Veterans' Affairs budget reveals a series of cutoffs for eligibility which become quite confusing and complex. I point out to the House, for example, that while some Vietnam veterans are entitled to the Vietnam Medal by virtue of one type of service, others in a similar type of service are not entitled to the medal. I go on to mention that there are different categories of war widows. Although their circumstances are exactly the same, they are in differentÂ· categories in terms of eligibility for the war widow's pension. The RSL and others have complained about the immense complexity of the Veterans' Entitlements Act and the need to simplify it. It was meant to be the bold step into the future in providing a consistent basis for repatriation in this country. But we have in this Budget a series of additional changes-heading in credit the right direction, albeit, but done in such a way as to create yet more division. Let me highlight the ex-prisoner of war situation. There is a most welcome automatic acceptance of five conditions as war-caused so far as ex-prisoners of war of the Japanese are concerned. To some extent they fall in a very special category, particularly those on the Burma death railway; and I support the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren) and others who have made comments in that regard. But then we turn to the dental limitation. The Government has decided to abolish the dental limitation for ex-prisoners of war of the Japanese but not for ex-prisoners of war of the Germans, Italians or Koreans. There is yet another situation where, on this broad category of the abolition of the dental limitation, one set of rules applies to the exprisoners of war of the Japanese and another to those who were prisoners of war during the Korean conflict. Clearly these are areas of justifiable concern in terms of variations in the categories brought in by this Government in relation to its treatment of veterans and repatriation generally. I tell the Minister, the House, the Government and the nation at large: veterans are angry at the raft of complex changes and the cutbacks which have been imposed since May 1985. I concede that there have been some steps in this Budget to improve the situation. I acknowledge that and claim some credit for the fact that the overall dental limitation has been lifted from $300 to $375. But I emphasise that there is growing anger in the veterans' constituency over the treatment they have received from this Government. They need to receive a fair go. Just yesterday we as a nation were reminded of some of the horrific stories of World War II, in association with the fiftieth anniversary of the commencement of that war. The seventy-fifth anniversary of Gallipoli is approaching which, hopefully, will be honoured in a most proper way by a bipartisan pilgrimage to Gallipoli. I have indicated. th.at the coalition supports the Government In ltS planning of that project. We must with compassion and fairness look after those who served their country in time of war and extend to them the greatest understanding, recognition and support that responsible government can afford, administered throughout a separate and modern Department of Veterans' Affairs.",39
97,Mr CHARLES,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYMENT AND,"1 will continue the remarks of the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Edwards) when he talked about discussing some of the more fundamental parts of the Budget handed down by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) rather than the peripheral or marginal matters that were raised earlier by some honourable members opposite, particularly the honour sure that those matters will be dealt with in another debate. We have before us a Budget that is right for our time. Let us compare some of the fundamentals of this Budget and how we see the culmination of 6t years under the Hawke Government. Where are we? What has happened to some of the fundamentals such as employment, inflation, economic growth, et cetera? In regard to employment, under the last Liberal Government in 1982, with a disastrous wages policy-to put it better still, it did not have one-a quarter of a million people were thrown out of work. In contrast to 1982, when a quarter bf a million people lost their jobs, we have seen employment grow by 1t million jobs under this Government in 6t years-the best employment growth in the Western world. No-one has come near it. Indeed, in regard to unemployment, we saw a legacy of a 10.4 per cent unemployment rate-mainly through the 1981-82 recession and disastrous years of the Fraser Government-come down to 6.1 per cent now. Indeed, in my home city of Melbourne, the unemployment rate in the metropolitan area is less than 4 per cent. .We seem to have employment creation of 1t million jobs, with unemployment down from 10.4 per cent to 6.1 per cent. Inflation has come down from 11.1 per cent to around 7 per cent and should stay steady at around 7 per cent for the next 12 months before there is a further decline. If we can keep inflation at that level we will not be doing too badly by world standards, because in a number of major Western countries such as the United States of America and 'Britain inflation is going in the opposite direction. Maggie Thatcher's policies all seem to be coming home to roost in Britain b-Â­ cause that country's inflation has doubled In the last year or so and is around 8 per cent at present. What about economic growth? We saw economic growth disappear und-r the last coalition Government. Indeed, m the last years of the Fraser Government econ--ic growth was negative. Ther- has been posltive growth in each of the SlX full years the Hawke Government has been in office. In four of those six years we have bettered the average for the Organisation for Economic Cooperatiort and Development (OECD). - n 1984, 1985, 1987 and 1989 the economlC growth that this Government created bettered the OECD average. We have seen employment better, unemploym-nt come down, inflation better, and economlC growth much better. What about Medicare, the universal health insurance scheme which replaced about five different versions in seven years under the previous Liberal Gover'!-ment? A lot of the policies that those Opposlte have talked about are just recycled from - he Fras-r years .. T-ey are talking about relntroducmg a slmliar health scheme if ever they get the opportunity-which I do not think they will for a long time. Medicare has now. been a-cepted by the vast majority of the populatlon, according to recent research, and has been a wonderful thing for m.any people in regard to the health system. I will talk more about pensions later. Under this Budget they increase to over 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. In the Fraser years they were left . at 22.7 per cent. Let us compare with this year's Budget a few of the portfolios from the last Budget brought down by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), the current Leader  colleagues. Let us look at education, for example. The 1982-83 Budget allowed for $3.79 billion for education. This year the Budget allowance is $6.68 billion, an increase of 10.7 per cent over last year and quite a massive real increase over that of the last Liberal Government. Health was allocated $3.37 billion in 1982-83; it is now allocated $11.77 billion, or over triple the health Budget under the last Liberal Government. In 1982-83 social security spending amounted to $13.27 billion; the figure is now $26.33 billion, or double that under the last Liberal Government. In 1982-83 housing was allocated $570m; it is now, strictly in the housing $1.26 billion, or more than double, again, what it Was under the Liberal Government. These are quite substantial real increases. In culture and recreation, in 1982-83 $501m was allowed in the Budget. Today the figure is $1.08 billion-again a little more than double that under the previous Liberal Government. We have seen a new sports policy announced by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Senator Richardson) which allows for $240m to be spent on sport in the next four years. Indeed, sport funding this year shows an increase of 66 per cent. That $240m to be spent in the next four years has been welcomed and applauded by people in the sporting field. Let us look at defence, which quite often the Opposition screams about. Of course, those opposite would always have done better on that! They would not have. In 198283 they allowed $4.6 billion; the figure is now $8.3 billion. That is a substantial in. crease-and, indeed, an increase in real terms. When we look at the social wage-if one wants to call it that-in the important areas of health, social security, housing, culture and recreation, and education, we see a more substantial increase in funding duting the 6t years of the Hawke Government than was provided under the previous Liberal Government. That, as I have already. suggested, is coupled with substantial increases and a much better fundamental Budget than the ones we saw in 1982-83 and the precedingÂ· years in the areas of employment, economic growth, inflation and pensions. The last Liberal Budget, in 1982-83, fell apart within about three weeks. It allowed for a small deficit that ran totally out of control within a matter of weeks, if my memory serves me correctly, and Malcolm Fraser was desperate to have an election before that document was shown to be the shonky piece of paper it was. I will come to a couple of things in relation to social security. The Government in this Budget has announced a number of things in this area, such as rental assistance. Rental assistance is very important, particularly for aged people who have to pay rent out of their pension, whether they are single or a married couple. Of course, theirs is area,. always a tight budget. When we came to government the rental assistance for a pensioner eligible to receive the full amount was $10. Under this Budget, by the end of 199012 months from now-the rental assistance for such a pensioner will be $30. In other words, the rental assistance for those people will be trebled, and, as money in their pock, ets, such assistance is not taxable. I turn to the announcement made in the April statement about tax cuts and the family allowances. The family allowance has been increased and indexed. The family allowance has been increased to $9 a week for each of the first three children and $12 a week for the fourth and any additional children. Therefore, a family with four children will receive $39 a week in family allowance, and that is indexed, as, indeed, is the vast majority of programs under the social security system, including those related to pensions and the fringe benefits area. Payments in these important areas have been indexed, enabling people to calculate their future allowances and incomes. That is a great fillip for families, particularly single income families, who look to the family allowance to supplement their incomes and enable them to buy some of the necessities for their children. The tax cuts of $5t billion that this Government gave on 1 July again were funded out of this Budget. Indeed, it took the Leader of the Opposition some time to understand the fact that, instead of having a Budget surplus of $9.1 billion, we would have had a Budget surplus of around $14.6 billion if we had not provided for those tax cuts. Those tax cuts have come out of this Budget, and there is still a surplus of $9.1 billion. The tax cuts have put many people in a much better position. We are seeing tax rates come down dramatically, from 60c in the dollar to 47c from 1 January next year. We have seen the bottom rate come down from 30c in the dollar under the Liberal Government to 21c in the dollar under this Government. We have seen a complete restructuring of the taxation system to achieve a more equitable system, with what is commonly called a much more level playing field. In contrast to the previous Opposition speaker, we on this side of the House will defend the capital gains tax because it makes income derived from all sources equal. Why should someone who has income derived from salary or fixed interest be taxed while someone else who has money in, say, property receive a capital gain tax free? If one had a substantial amount of money and was able to invest it in property, one would think it would be wonderful if the Opposition did scrap the capital gains tax. But that would not be fair because it would be treating two sources of income totally differently. This Government has done away with that ridiculous ruling. We have introduced the fringe benefits tax, the capital gains tax and the withholding tax. We have heard screams at each turn when we have introduced them but it is amazing how quickly those screams subside when the system works quite effectively and people-not just the employees and unions, but employer groups-realise how the hard decisions have been made on this side of the House regarding the floating of the dollar, the restructuring of the economy and industry in general. I would like to refer the House to two articles of interest. The first, in the Australian Financial Review of 26 April 1989, is by Michael Stutchbury. He talks about the perception that there has been a decline in living standards. I will quote some relevant parts from Mr Stutchbury's article. He states: The relevance of this history lies in the claims that Australia's material living standards have fallen over the 1980s. Enough people-ranging from the social welfare lobby and the old Left to the Federal Opposition and the New Right-have a vested interest in promoting this line to make it the new conventional wisdom. In fact, the economy has produced 20 per cent more output per head of population in the past decade. And per capita household disposable income (that is, after tax) has increased by about 11 per cent in real terms over the same period on my figuring. Mr Stutchbury continued later in his article: Nonetheless, the average figures suggest that what could be called the working middle class has not suffered from lower living standards in the 1980sat worse they have probably risen slightly. While wage restraint means that single income families have struggled, it also has pulled probably hundreds of thousands of Australians out of the true poverty of unemployment and provided many more families with more than one breadwinner. As I suggested before, this Government has had the greatest employment growth in the Western world, and Mr Stutchbury acknowledged that. Let me quote one more part of his article: As The Australian Financial Review reported last week, nearly 57 per cent of Australian households own or rent video cassette recorders as at late 1988one of the highest penetration rates in the world. In 1982, only 13 per cent of Australian household had VCRs. The VCR splurge took off first among the working middle class. According to the Roy Morgan Research Centre, the number of Australians owning a personal computer rose by nearly 90 per cent in the three years to 1988. It is a very interesting article. As one can see from those few remarks, Mr Stutchbury is suggesting that living standards have gone up-not down, as has been promised by the Opposition. Another article relating to the huge import bill, written by Ross Gittins, appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald on Wednesday, 31 May 1989. It talks about the current account deficit and the imports coming into the country, a matter that has to be tackled, and is being tackled, by this Government. It is a very long but interesting article, and I will read just a few bits from it. It states: So poor you have to eat at MCDonalds? You don't take much notice of the sesame seeds on their buns. In the nine months to March, we imported $4m worth of sesame seeds. Further on it states: Maybe you stick to orange JUice. About $33m worth was imported. Drink coffee? About $lllm. Prefer tea? Only $38 million. The occasional chocolate? Don't feel gUilty: less than $100 million. And so it goes on. Some of the bigger items he refers to later in his article: You don't have a colour TV, do you'? About $140 million. A VCR'? Over $200 mi1lion. A stereo? Let's call it $100 million. A radio, car radio or cassette player? Say, $180 million. It continues: Do you wear clothes or footwear, by any chance? Just under $870 million . . . We imported more than $1.5 billion worth of textiles . . . We imported $1.3 billion worth of petroleum products. Later on it states: computers and office machines cost $2.3 billion and imports of aircraft cost $1.3 billion. So we go from sesame seeds in MCDonald's buns to machinery. Mr Gittins's fairly lengthy article describes how many average things that the ordinary person uses we import in some way, shape or form. It brings the whole debate into perspective. This Budget is a good. Budget for Australia. It asks the right questions and tackles the problems appropriately. As I said before, this Budget and successive Budgets under this Government have tackled unemployment, inflation and economic growth. We have seen the introduction of Medicare, the lifting of pensions, and substantial increases in real terms in funding for health, social security, education, housing, culture and recreation. We have also seen a real increase in defence. And still the Opposition screams. Indeed, those opposite scream because they cannot talk about anything that they would do because there are very few ideas on that side of the House. Indeed, as we approach the next election, I am sure that this Government will win again, and handsomely, because the people of Australia will have absolutely no faith in the Opposition, which has no policies. This Government has policies. We have had 6t years of consistent, good policies and hard decision-making. And that will continue under this Budget that the Treasurer brought into the House a few weeks ago.",41
98,Mr SMITH,COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYMENT AND,"Listening in deep contemplation, as I was, to the summation by the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Charles) of the Budget, I was reminded of the fact that he is actually an honourable member that will not be contesting the next election. So I take the opportunity of wishing him well in his life hereafter. I do take issue . with him that this Budget will lead to the re-election of the Government. Most certainly it will not, because it avoids two primary issues, which I will refer to shortly. Before turning to Aboriginal affairs, which is my role in the shadow ministry, I will make a few comments about Tasmania. Tasmania, again, was a loser in this Budget. Even though we have had a change of government, there has been no net increase in the overall funding allocation to Tasmania. As I have said in this chamber many times in the past, Tasmania has taken a far larger percentage per capita of cutbacks from the Commonwealth in tight economic times than any other State. I might add that Tasmania is suffering far more than any other part of the Commonwealth under the current pilots strike, which has been brought about by the precipitate intervention of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). He should be aware, as should every honourable member of this chamber, that Tasmania, the smallest State, relies mightily on the tourist dollar. We do not have other alternatives, other than by ship, for Australians who go to Tasmania. Over 85 per cent of those who go to Tasmania go by air. Our industry is in free fall. We will be . looking to the Government for future assistance of some sort to ensure that that industry gets a kick start to get going again. Once this debacle is over, all of us will have to pick up the traces and get that vital industry of tourism going again. The interesting aspects of the Budget which were ignored by many of the commentators were inflation and debt. It is interesting to hear honourable members opposite quote at length people from the media. But during the course of this debate, which has gone on for several days, I have not heard one of them turn to the Reserve Bank of Australia annual report. It is interesting to note that on that bank board there sits Bill Kelty from the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Sir Peter Abeles from Thomas Nationwide Transport Ltd-Ansett Transport Industries Ltd, and the Governor-designate, Mr Fraser, Secretary to theÂ· Treasury. The Budget is complacent on two key issues-debt and inflation. Great play has been made by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and others about our not needing to be concerned about the level of private debt. They say that that is something that we, as a nation, should not be concerned about. The Reserve Bank's annual report, which interestingly came out one or two days after the Budget, states: The Bank does not share the opinion expressed in some quarters that, since most of the debt is owed within the private sector rather than by government, it is a matter of little consequence. The extent to which resources must be diverted to its future icing is the same whether the debt is publicly or privately owed, and the investment which it has enabled will not automatically ensure that these sources are available. There is no time to go further into the issue of debt. Unless Australia faces that problem, unless the Government faces that problem, rather than be complacent and ignore it, we will continue on the economic slide that we are surely on. The other point at which the Reserve Bank parts company with the Government and the Treasurer's broad economic strategy is inflation. Listening to the Treasurer on Budget night, one would not have thought that inflation mattered. But let me remind honourable members that in last year's Budget estimates the Treasurer estimated inflation to be about 4.5 per cent. By the end of the year it was 7.5 per cent. In the Budget prognosis for inflation for the next 12 months, he has admitted that, yes, it will be 7.5 per cent, and that it will continue to be 7.5 per cent. If the same margin of error applies this year as it did last year, we will have inflation of slightly over 11 per cent. Honourable members ought to contemplate on that. Inflation is an insidious evil that eats away at the savings of those on fixed incomes and undermines business confidence. It also affects investments. There is a whole range of other economic repercussions behind inflation. When one measures our current proje-::ted inflation rate against that of our major trading partners-Japan, which has an inflation rate of about one per cent or less, the United States of America, which has an inflation rate of about 3 per cent or less, and the United Kingdom, which has an inflation rate of 4 per cent or less-one starts to see the difficulties which we as an economy are in. What does the Reserve Bank say about inflation? It states: . . . but the vital key is inflation. Restructuring is much more difficult, even impossible, in a high inflation environment which destroys competitiveness and discourages saving. Altering this situation must have top priority. The Treasurer chose to ignore that issue. Those two fundamental issues needed to be addressed, but were not, in the Budget. In the few minutes that remain I turn to serv- the Estimates and the Budget treatment of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. As a whole, the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio conre- tinues to see a significant annual boost to its appropriations. Before I table the growth in spending by Commonwealth departments and agencies on Aborigines, I make it clear that Aborigines are again the losers in this Budget. In particular, I emphasise the loss of $17modd-a 52 per cent decrease-in funding through the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) for the home ownership lending program, and an additional loss of $1.5m-a 3 per cent decrease-for rental accommodation. At a time when housing costs are going through the roof, when Aborigines are really feeling the pinch on housing, this move by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) is extraordinary, to say the least. Both the Government and the ADC have stated that housing is a top priority. Why then is this the only area where there is a major cut? Although the Minister has personally told me that the cut:s to the ADC's pudget have been transferred to the priority community infrastructure program of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, there is nothing in the current DANs explanatory notes which shows how much will be used for housing or what physical outcomes the Department would expect. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table which shows the growth of Federal Government expenditure on Aboriginal people since 1970. Leave granted.

99,Mr SMITH,ON ABORIGINALS,"This table shows a growth in Budget outlays which represents a six-fold increase in expenditure in real terms in government spending on Aboriginal programs in 19 years.

However, the $523m 0.96 does not represent the total amount spent 1.09 on Aboriginal programs. A further $394.4m will be spent by other departments and government authorities. In particular in the Department of Education, Employment and Training where a major reorganisation of educational programs was announced in the Budget, which was long overdue, $241m is being spent. In the Department of Community Services and Health $130m is being spent. I seek leave of the house to incorporate in Hansard a table which shows the expenditure by other Commonwealth agencies on special programs for Aboriginals. Leave granted.

Those figures represent money spent on programs specifically for Aboriginal people. Thus Aboriginal people receive-or should receive if the programs designed specifically for them deliver-substantially over and above benefits to other Australians. Aboriginal programs now represent a near billion dollar industry, one that we would hope would produce significantly improved outcomes for Aboriginal people. But what is happening? What are the facts? Are outcomes being improved by this massive expenditure? Let me relate some examples. Aboriginal life expectancy is 15 to 20 years less than that of non-Aboriginal Australians; Aboriginal infant mortality rates are three times those of non-Aboriginal Australians; Aboriginal unemployment is six times the national average; the school retention rate for Aborigines is one-quarter that of other Australians and Aboriginal imprisonment retention rates are over 14 times higher than those for other Australians. These are the horrifying indicators of the situation of many, but not all, Aborigines in our society, the gap between increases in Government funding for Aboriginal programs and the degree of advancement of some Aboriginal people is the cause of some real concern. It makes people cynical. It makes many people angry. Why, despite this enormous expenditure, are outcomes from Aboriginal people so poor? What is really happening? What is the cause of this situation? All of us I am sure would want to see those outcomes improve. I think there are three broad reasons; one is that well documented maladministration of Aboriginal affairs for which the current Minister for Aboriginal Affairs must bear the ultimate responsibility. There is not time now to expand on that point but there have been more than six inquiries into Aboriginal administration which show that a great degree of attention needs to be spent on the outcomes issue. Those inquiries show some culpability on the part of the current Minister in his administration and that the delivery of a range of services is indeed in need of major surgery and detailed scrutiny. Another area of concern is waste as a result of the plethora of uncoordinated Commonwealth and State programs of confusing proportions of which there are many examples. Even the Australian Labor Party in Western Australia has complained. I remember the remarks of Premier Dowding who seems to be in more trouble than anyone around the nation at the present time. He had the honesty at least to say that the arrangements between the State and the Commonwealth for the delivery of Aboriginal services were doing nothing to improve outcomes, that there was great confusion and that all they were doing was hampering the benefits that were supposed to flow to Aboriginal people, making them the subject of that community cynicism that I am talking about. We must as a nation address the waste and unnecessary duplication in the delivery of services. The next point that I make in the equation is the ideology of the paternalistic approach of the current Minister. He will certainly go down in history as the Minister who has done the worse job in the Aboriginal portfolio in recent times. He has done nothing but divide the Aboriginal community amongst themselves. He has taken steps in the legislation proposed-the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission legislation-which not only will divide Australians against Australians but more importantly, Aboriginals against Aboriginals. The Minister is responsible for raising social welfare objectives at the expense of economic independence objectives with the result that some 70 per cent of total national Aboriginal income comes from Government sources. It is the Minister who, having been responsible for the administrative quagmire into which Aboriginal affairs has slipped under Labor, now proposes to impose a different structure on the Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal populations of Australia in the form of ATSIC, of which I have spoken at length in this chamber before but on which, unfortunately, I cannot talk today. The treatment that the Minister is proposing for Aboriginal people by the imposition of this new administrative model will do nothing to improve outcomes. We are seeing many millions of dollars being spent. Yet the Labor Party Government represented by its Cabinet has gone along with this Minister and has allowed this social experiment to proceed. I must say that the Democrats have lent their support at the last moment. That is something which suprises many of us, given their professed concern about ensuring that outcomes are improved. There is one other example that needs to be made before I sit down: that is the issue of the Aboriginal Development Commission. The Aboriginal Development Commission's objectives are to enhance the economic underpinnings of the Aboriginal people. We are seeing from this Minister a total dismantling of them. He has moved 53 per cent of the Commission's budget to be directly under his control in the Department of Ab,original Affairs. We know of the past episode where the Chairman and Managing Director of the ADC were sacked. We are still waiting to know whether the Minister had prior knowledge. It will be interesting to see whether one day the true story of that issue is revealed. In any event the Minister has consistently and calculatedly wanted to work towards a removal and downgrading of the ADC-the very body that was set up to provide Aborigines with the economic underpinnings to allow them to take their place in mainstream Australia. I think it is deplorable. My final comment is that the sacking of the Secretary to the Department, Mr Charles Perkins, was a travesty of justice exercised by the Minister which appalled many people. It was interesting to see the Prime Minister coming into this chamber when the Menzies report on the inquiry into certain aspects of the administration of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs was tabled. This final report found that Charles Perkins was in no way culpable. The Prime Minister said that he hoped that Mr Charles Perkins would be able to work again for the Government. The most interesting point about that sp-ech was that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs vacated the chamber. Those two men have not spoken together since that event. I think that marks the low-water mark of the relations between the Aboriginal community and this particular Minister. This Budget does nothing for Aboriginal people. It is again a sleight of hand Budget generally. As it applies to Aboriginal people, it allocates more money but it does not address the fundamental problem of improving outcomes through a far better appreciation of and approach to delivery mechanisms. I think the Government has failed. I think the situation is deplorable.",46
101,Mr CLEELAND,FOR ABORIGINALS,"1 must say that at least the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) has a sense of humour. Imagine anyone in the Opposition describing the sacking of Charles Perkins as a travesty of justice. Imagine anyone in the Opposition who pilloried the man-publicly and privately the most attacked public servant in this House, probably in Australia's history, by the Opposition that drove the man to the disaster that faced him-standing to call it a travesty of justice. One really has to have a sense of humour to listen to anyone on the other side of this House describe that situation thus. In the last several days this House has been subjected to a great deal of words by Opposition members about the Government's Budget. I find that the tragedy is that every speech has been negative. I have listened and I have not heard one positive comment from any Opposition member. I say 'positive comment' in that one would regard in debating skills and techniques it being fair enough to destroy one's opponent but normally, in the debating experience I have had, .someone always comes up with alternatives. Debating is, after all, about pros and cons of different viewpoints and of putting up different strategies. As I have said, despite the length of this debate, I have not heard any member of the Opposition make any positive contribution as to what the coalition would do if it were in government. It does not surprise members on this side of the House-we know; we have to put up with those opposite every day in this place when we are here-that members of the Opposition have no policies. When they do make statements, what they say is couched in generalities and not specifics. The Budget has been well received across the board. They are not my words or my view; the evidence for that is to be found not just from the media but in a whole host of documentation which comes from a wide variety of groupings which are not generally regarded as being favourable to the Labor side of politics. For example, the National Farmers Federation (NFF), which has never been seen as a friend of the Hawke Government, is under the leadership of Mr McLachlan, who will soon grace the other side of the House. We on this side of the House will watch with interest his contribution to logical debate in this place. He has been a very vocal critic of the Government. Yet the National Farmers Federation's press release on 15 August contained a critique of the Budget by its economic adviser, Gus Hooke. This document, which makes very interesting reading, gave the Budget a score of five out of 10. To be given five out of 10 by the National Farmers Federation is something very positive. If one reads the critique by Gus Hooke, it is easy to believe that it should have been given eight out of 10 at least., I will quote some of the matters on which Gus Hooke writes. He states: The content of the Budget will be very difficult to criticise the deserves praise in some quarters. From a macro-economic viewpoint, the Budget is good. The Budget should permit a clear improvement in the economy. On the retirement package in the Budget, he stated: . . . the ultimate effect of the measure will be increased national saving. Similar comments are made right through the whole press release. What the Government, has done is generally in line with what the National Farmers Federation wanted. It wanted an increased surplus; it wanted a $3 billion surplus. Well, it got a $3 billion plus. The surplus was over and above what the NFF wanted. The NFF is not alone. It is interesting to read a news media release dated 22 August 1989 by the Metal Trades Industry Association Inc. (MTIA). The MTIA is not a body which one would expect to be particularly friendly with a Hawke Labor government. It is generally regarded as being on the conservative side and it funds conservative parties. The news release of 22 August 1989 reveals that the MTIA had commissioned a major survey. It states: A total of 1179 firms responded to the survey. These firms recorded 1988/89 sales of $21.6 billion and employed over 173,000 persons. Some 43%' of respondents indicated that they had export sales. Let us look at what the survey revealed: total sales in fiscal year 1988/89 rose by 13.6% sales are expected to rise by a more modest 9.7% in 1989/90 investment in plant and equipment rose by 21.4% in 1988/89 and is predicted to rise by a further 10.8% in 1989/90 export sales grew by only 8.3% in 1988/89, due mainly to a difficult year experienced by a few major exporters export sales are expected to grow by 12.4%$ in 1989/90 employment grew by 2.4% in the year to July 1989 and levels are expected to rise very marginally in the period to June 1990 apprentice numbers have been rising strongly, a trend which is expected to continue to the twelve months to June 1990 What has the Government been saying for the last three to four years on its strategy? What has the Government been aiming for in all its Budgets? It has been aiming for increased profit sharing in the private sector and for increased profitability. This is happening. In the metal trades the evidence is that it is happening strongly. The Government has been aiming for increased investment in technology and new plant. The evidence is clear-there was an increase in investment of 21.4 per cent in the metal industry last year and there will be a further increase next year. The strategy-what we say we are after-is being achieved. Yet we never get any recognition from the other side. The matter of export sales is one of our big problems. We all know about it-we talk about it in this House ad nauseam. What is the evidence? Export sales are expected to grow by 12.4 per cent in 1989-90. It is happening. What the Government planned years ago-the whole strategy of the Government-is there for anyone to see. The evidence is not from figures that we produce or from arguments that we are putting out. It comes from the metal trades industry itself and it is clearly identifiable. Let us have a look at a press release of 23 August 1989 from the Australian Lifewriters Association, another body which would not contribute to the Hawke Labor Government's success but which supports the conservative parties. What does it say? It states: Changes to Life Office taxation, announced in the Budget, are 'most welcome' according to National President of the Australian Lifewriters Association, Joe Nowak. ' Inconsistencies in the corporate tax system ing to Life Offices have been allowed to develop over many years. We know why. It continued: At last, a long term plan is emerging. The Government says that it is after an increase in savings. The retirement package is designed to increase savings for Australia as a nation. The life underwriters say, 'Yes, you are on track. It is happening. You are doing it'. The evidence is there and i- unarguable. But the Opposition, in its negative carping way, has not yet produced any alternate to the Government's strategy which makes any sense or which is specific in any detail. If one listens to the shadow spokesman in the morning, by the time the day has gone five different policies have emerged. Frankly, none of them or any statement made by any other shadow spokesman makes any sense. The media is picking it up and constantly saying, 'What do you lot stand for? What is your pQlicy? What will you do?' We know from an historical base that the conservative members in this place dearly love Friedman, the monetarist theory and Mrs Thatcher. We heard from the Leader of  the Budget that 12 government instrumentalities or departments will be privatised. Mind you, with typical guts, he named four. The other eight remain only in the mind of the Opposition and the public will never be told about them; they will remain in the realms of mystery. But we were told that there were four. Members of the Opposition seem to think that by privatising 12 bodies, of which eight are unknown, somehow this will help to resolve Australia's current economic situation. We know what Margaret Thatcher has done in Britain. She is now trying to flog the last service left in England-the water supply system-to the private sector. Can honourable members imagine anyone in this country giving control of the water services-irrigation, town supply and industrial supply-to the private sector so that government had no control over it? Can honourable members imagine anyone in this country suggesting-water being one of the great scarce resources of this nation-that we should do that? The last thing Britain has to applysell is its water. Margaret Thatcher is going down that track. If the theories that the conservatives in this country like to run with on privatisation are correct, we would expect that England would now be in a position where, as a result of all the sales of its publicly owned assets, it would be economically stable, have surpluses in its internal budgets and have inflation under control. We would think, on that evidence, that it would have high employment. We would expect it to have a current account surplus and a low international debt. We would think, on the conservatives' a.rguments in this place, that all the evidence was to be seen in Great Britain. Let us look at the United States of America and at Ronald Reagan, the great champion of the underprivileged. He was another monetarist. One would think on the evidence of what Reagan did in America that America would have low unemployment, no current account deficit, an internal surplus, a low international debt and low inflation. Great Britain and America are the two countries which the conservatives here love to flaunt as having the answers. What is the answer? What evidence do we have? Britain's inflation rate is running close to 8 per cent. Its level of unemployment would embarrass any person who claims to be a human being. The level of unemployment is very high in the north of England, in Liverpool, in Manchester and in the Midlands. People who are born there will die without ever having a job offered to them. That is Thatcher's Britain. Its current account is in deficit. However, there is a big privileged class in the south which is doing pretty well. Without being ultra critical, I remind the House that anyone who walks down Oxford Street in London at, say, 10.30 at night in the middle of winter will see in shop doorways a sight they will never see in any Australian city-people living in cardboard boxes. What does one see in the underpasses across Pall Mall or across Hyde Park at night? One sees portable beds being erected. People live in pedestrian subways in London. That is Thatcher's Britain. That is what the conservatives here are saying they want to have. That is their secret agenda. They want to attack the workers, to hit them between the eyes. They want to apply monetarist theories which have failed everywhere. We know what the result of those theories will be. We do not see it in this country but we can see it in America. One just has to wander through New York to see sights that would horrify any person who has respect for humanity. It is the richest country in the world. There is no Medicare there. We know that the Opposition wants to get rid of that here. It wants to attack Medicare. What happens to people if they get sick in America, in the greatest and wealtqiest nation in the world? They cannot afford to go to a public hospital. The Reaganites here want to get rid of Medicare. They want to privatise the health system so that people have to pay money before they go to hospital. That, is the Opposition's agenda, although Opposition members will not say it. A conservative candidate is wandering around my electorate. I call her the snake oil lady. She is a beauty. On any issue she runs to the press and says what a terrible government we have and that what it is doing to the aged is terrible. The honourable member for Deakin (Mr Beale) says, 'Handouts to pensioners, handouts to veterans, handouts for child-care'. He calls our social welfare grants handouts. The Opposition says it will take $1 billion off the social security budget, yet the snake oil lady is saying what a terrible government this is. I have to keep writing to the local newspaper advising what her policy is. She does not know, because no-one has told her yet, what the conservative policy is. I keep saying to the press that it is more snake oil medicine. The Leader of the Opposition says one thing in the morning, my opponent says another in the middle of the day and then the honourable member for Deakin says something again that night. It is snake oil. I am enjoying it. It is good stuff. But it is pretty sad to stand in this House hoping for a debate, because I just cannot get one. It is impossible to have a debate on economic strategy or policy and we cannot have a debate on tax. The Opposition has no strategy to enable us to have an intellectual debate in this House. That is where the Opposition has lessons to learn. Mr Connolly-Just wait a few minutes.",48
102,Mr CLEELAND,FOR ABORIGINALS,"I have been in this House five years and I still have not got one. The Opposition put out the strategy, 'Future Divisions,' but what is in it? Page after page of rhetoric. It contains nothing else. I look forward to the day when the conservatives of this country, the Thatcherites and the Reaganites, come up with something and actually tell the Australian people what they really stand for. I am looking forward to the day when they put dollar signs in front of what they say they will spend and what they say they will cut. I hope they will also tell us where they will cut. Let us talk about what the Opposition wants to sell. Let us talk about privatisation. Let it tell us about the 12 institutions it will sell-not the four it said it would sell. Let Opposition members lay the names of those 12 institutions on the table. Let us debate where the money will come from to buy them. We can then talk about foreign debt. In order to get enough capital in this country to buy those institutions Australia will have to bring in money from overseas because there is not enough capital in the Australian marketÂ· to buy them. That is the sort of nonsense we get. The capital market is not even big enough to buy the Commonwealth Bank. If the Opposition wants to sell the Commonwealth Bank it should tell the Australian people where the money will come from to buy it instead of just saying that it will cut foreign debt. It will add to foreign debt; it will not reduce it. This is the nonsense we get from the Opposition-half-truths and distortions but no facts. It is about time we had a debate in this place, but we cannot have such a debate until we hear what the Opposition's policies are. Surely it can get its act together between now and Christmas. We are now told that its tax policy will be delivered in September. I am looking forward to reading it and to working out from the rhetoric what the Opposition really stands for. It should bring forward that policy in September, not postpone it until October or November. After five years we should be able to get one policy from those opposite. We can then sit back and have a real debate. The Opposition can lay the names of the 12 institutions it wants . to sell on the table. It can explain the economics of what it will achieve by the sales and where the capital will come from to buy them. Quite frankly, after listening to the lot opposite in the last few days, it is obvious that our debates have been a waste of time. But we are ready. Our back bench will roll the Opposition's front bench any day of the week. We know that and the Opposition knows it. We think the Opposition is a joke. Give us some meat and we will come back any time the Opposition likes.",51
103,Mr CONNOLLY,FOR ABORIGINALS,"The House hasÂ· just sat through one of those less than deep and penetrating speeches by the honourable member for MCEwen (Mr Cleeland). I only hope that he will take the opportunity in the near future to speak to some of the pensioner organisations which were well represented by the Pensioners Voice in its latest issue, in which a headline about the Government's recent policy announcement reads, 'Social Justice StrategyToo Little, Too late'. No doubt the Government is very sad to hear those responses. Nevertheless, the Government's seventh Budget contains a range of commitments relating to the establishment of a long term retirement incomes policy for Australia. I want to repeat for the second time what I said on the night of the Budget-that the coalition parties welcome this approach as it closely mirrors our own retirement incomes policy, which was announced in November 1988. It is a long standing practice in Australian politics that, following a change of govertiment, which will no doubt take place at the next election, the arrangements in place are fully honoured. I want to make it absolutely clear that the arrangements which have been announced for the range of improved benefits being provided to age pensioners and beneficiaries in the 1989-90 Budget will certainly be fully honoured by the coalition .. We are, for example, happy that the Government has finally, after seven years of unmet promises, reached the situation where itÂ· can honour-regrettably not until April next year-its 1983 commitment to increase the age pension to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. We share with the pensioners some concern that, with such a huge domestic Budget surplus, it is not possible for the Government to increase the basic pension in November of this year, which would have been a more appropriate gesture, given the fact that we have had rising inflation over recent years and a significant delay until very recently in the actual payment of age pension increases in relation to the consumer price index, which is announced six or nine months earlier. The time will surely have come by November to have gone further towards achieving the Government's long term goal of 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. Nevertheless, pensioners have to be satisfied with April, but they are well aware that the delay is not for economic or for social reasons but for political ones. Quite clearly the Government anticipated when the Budget was prepared that it would be going to the people next year rather than this year. Whether that remains to be the situation, of course, is a matter for the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) alone to decide. We support the rent assistance increases. It will go up by $5 a week in December 1989 and by a further $5 a week in September 1990. We also support the decision to index rent assistance increases. However, I should again place on record our growing concern that it is a known fact-as emphasised in the Cass reports and elsewhere-that pensioners who are dependent on rent are among Australia's poorest people. It is a matter of great concern that not only pensioners but also low income people make up most of the over 190,000 people who are on the waiting lists for low cost government accommodation. It is perfectly clear, therefore, that the law of supply and demand realities are such that merely increasing the rent assistance will not overcome, to any significant degree, the fundamental problems facing some 320,000 age and service pensioners who are currently receiving rent assistance. We also support the annual indexation of the pension income test free area, which will commence in July 1991, and the integration of the social security and taxation systems, which the Government says will start in 1995. We support the objective of that integration but, on the basis of this Government's record over the last seven years, I think it is an act of absolute effrontery that honourable members opposite come into this House and say to the Australian people, and to pensioners and retirees in particular, that for 1995over six years and possibly two parliaments away-they are prepared to make commitments over which they may well have no control whatsoever. Nor-and this is the most important thing-will they know the state of the Australian economy. As I have stated, while we support the objective of the integration of the social security and taxation systems as being certainly a goal which should be achieved, we have to question whether it is possible to do it on a specific date so far in the future. It may be possible to bring it forward, but we do not know these things in advance because we simply do not know the capacity of the economy to pay. Another change is the bereavement package, which again was a step in the right direction but which quite frankly was not as good as that contained in our own retirement income policy. Similarly, the proposals for access to increased savings and other income will be allowed with no loss of pension. Again, our proposals were more generous than those contained in this Budget. So, on balance, we believe that, for retired people and in particular for pensioners, the Budget contains some worthwhile changes which we endorse and which, as I stated and I repeat, in government we will carry through, in so far as it is possible, into the future, depending on the capacity of the Australian economy. Regrettably, however, the greatest weakness of the seventh Keating Budget is its failure to offer a convincing prescription for dealing with Australia's unacceptably high inflation and interest rates, both of which impact upon the most vulnerable section of the Australian community, many of whom, of course, are our pensioners and retirees. There can be no doubt that, with an ageing population, a long term strategy which includes the encouragement of self-funded retirement, mainly through superannuation, is necessary. These new initiatives, together with a sustainable package of income support measures for today's pensioners and for those who in the future, due to low incomes, will be unable to make significant savings for themselves, are clearly the best way of ensuring the security of Australia's retirees now and in the future. It is important that such measures receive an appropriate degree of bipartisan support; and that is the support that we are offering on this occasion. Despite the similarities, there are fundamental differences in approach as to ho\v we should ensure that Australia's ageing population will have adequate incomes in retirement at a cost which the next generation will be able to afford. We believe that, with taxpayers' support for superannuation now costing in excess of $4 billion per annum, it is important that people be encouraged to see self-provision as a viable alternative to the age pension. We see universal superannuation coverage of the work force as an essential objective so that more, and not fewer, people can be financially independent in their retirement. Unfortunately, Labor claims to have a more modest goal. It sees superannuation only as a supplement to the age pension. Consequently, over time the overall costs of providing part pensions for more people could result in even greater welfare costs to our children. The Government does not like to be accused of playing politics with the grey vote. There is every reason why a responsible approach is obviously what is required. Consequently, many pensioners will question why, with such a massive Budget surplus from higher tax receipts and a commitment to spend some $700m in the retirement area, it was not possible for the Government to increase the basic pension by $2 a week to bring it up to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings in November this year. Furthermore, while the Opposition supports the long term approach for planning purposes and the financing of reforms over six years, the Government's past record of changing its mind leaves little reason in our minds, or those of pensioners, not to question why the Government's commitments should be taken at face value at this stage. In addition, superannuants whom the Government wishes to encourage have had to face tax increases of nearly 1,000 per cent over the last seven years, as well as a massively complex administrative system which has had the effect of making superannuation an unsatisfactory long term investment, especially for low income earners-the very people whom the Government claims it wishes to encourage into superannuation through the productivity agreements which are not yet applied throughout industry. Consequently, the statement of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) that the Government would expect superannuation to be once again on the wages agenda of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) next year is something which many people will watch with interest, especially as the likely impact will be that, by the year 2000, we will be looking at productivity increases, through superannuation, of between 9 and 10 per cent. However, the Government appears to have forgotten that the people who have to deny their wage increases to achieve that outcome are facing progressively lower living standards and their capacity to make any savings, much less long term savings through superannuation, in many cases can be little more than speculative. Nevertheless, while Labor ignored the coalition's call to cut superannuation taxes, we were pleased to note that the Government is providing tax incentives along exactly the same lines as those contained in our retirement income policy to encourage those with little or no superannuation to make supplementary payments. In addition, we welcome the changes to the reasonable benefit levels which, while complex, will certainly overcome some of the glaring inconsistencies created by the Government's previous ham-fisted attempts at superannuation reform over its previous six Budgets. There is no doubt that the selfemployed in particular will be major winners from these changes; they will be given the opportunity to receive superannuation at a level similar to that of employees in the same industry. This reform is long overdue. However, the important poin.t I wish to emphasise is this: comments have been made both in the Budget and since which give us real reason for concern. A few years ago, the ACTU, in its document entitled Australia Reconstructed, made it very clear that it favoured tax assistance of superannuation funds provided governments had the opportunity to establish a national development fund into which 'some proportion of the future income of such funds' could be di-' verted. Since then we have heard comments, such as those made by the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe), that investment strategies for superannuation funds would be the political issue of the 1990s. I believe that these comments must be taken most seriously. Any attempt by an interventionist government to direct investment into venture capital projects or social infrastructures raises important issues which must be addressed now because contributors have no say in investment decisions and run the very real risk of seeing their end benefits further reduced. The Government's retirement incomes policy has failed to relate policy to labour market demand. An ageing population requires that greater encouragement be given to people who are able to stay in the work force beyond the age of 65. The coalition offered anti-discrimination legislation and an innovative pension bonus scheme, giving higher pensions to retirees who remained in the work force. The Government offered nothing. Labor has also avoided some of the more difficult political decisions in an attempt to ensure growing ACTU influence in superannuation policy. It has not addressed adequately the impact of higher taxes and demography on the capacity of the next generation to pay. We cannot finance adequate pensions indefinitely unless the three great threats to Australia's future-high inflation, high interest rates and massive national debt-are overcome. Regrettably, the Budget has not set in place policies which will achieve those fundamental objectives.",52
104,Mr JOHN SCOIT,FOR ABORIGINALS,"Hindmarsh) (5.49)It is rather interesting to be following the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) in the debate, because I want to touch on the question of venture capital. It will come as no surprise that I have a different view. The Treasurer (Mr Keating), in his Budget Speech, pointed out the gap between our gross domestic product of 4 per cent and national spending at 8 per cent. That big gap-spending at 8 per cent and production at 4 per cent-sums up our trade problem. The Treasurer went on to point out that moderating demand is only half the solution. The other half is lifting loc-il production of local goods and services. The Government's policies and various programs, aimed at achieving that increase in production, are what I want to address in this debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1). Increasing production will require programs for better informed business managers with skills in production planning, knowledge of their markets, industrial relations, kn.ow1edge .of appr.opriate new techn.ol.ogies and much m.ore. The G.overnment's pr.ograms t.o assist business are c.onsiderable. The G.overnment's nati.onal industry extensi.on service (NIBS) has been .of great benefit t.o business managers. The NIES pr.ogram in S.outh Australia, which is l.ocated at the .old General M.ot.ors-H.olden plant at W.o.odville, has assisted .over 50 companies just in my elect.orate .of Hindmarsh. There are t.o.o many c.ompanies t.o menti.on all .of them, but there are companies like Aut.o Tek at Plimpt.on, Carnival C.onfecti.onery at Marlest.on, Griffin Press at Netley, Castall.oy, Perry Engineering, R.ossiters and many m.ore which have all taken part in the G.overnment's NIES pr.ogram. An.other .of the G.overnment's Pr.ograms aimed at increasing pr.oductivity and getting the balance .of payments back is the .one managed by the Management and Investment C.ompanies Licensing B.oard, which is aimed at pr.oviding venture capital. Lack .of venture capital has been, and c.ontinues t.o be, a seri.ous problem if we are t.o get that turnar.ound in the ec.on.omy. There are tw.o main fact.ors which have impeded the devel.opment .of small, usually high techn.ol.ogy, industries in Australia-the lack .of sufficient venture capital during the start-up and seeding capital phases, and the lack .of mezzanine financing t.o get a successful small venture up .t.o the critical mass stage where it can make a push int.o exp.ort markets. While the management and investment c.ompanies (MICs) scheme c.ommenced in 1984, significant investment did n.ot .occur until mid t.o late 1986. H.owever, f.oll.owing the Oct.ober 1987 st.ock market crash, there was a flight .of capital fr.om high risk investment t.o blue chip st.ocks, which pay dividends with high imputati.on credits. There is currently a critical sh.ortage .of m.oney available f.or venture capital in Australia. The industry d.oesn.ot yet have a track rec.ord. S.o individual invest.ors and superannuati.on fund managers will n.ot put significant funds int.o it, alth.ough several superannuati.on funds invest in venture capital .operati.ons in the United States .of America and Britain. Nati.onal Mutual, Australian Mutual Pr.ovident Society and the New S.outh Wales State Superannuati.on B.oard have a c.ouple .of relatively small investments in MICs, but they are still really just dipping their t.oes in the water t.o test the temperature. I am glad t.o say that the G.overnment is currently l.o.oking at ways in which we might enc.ourage the superannuati.on funds t.o invest m.ore heavily in venture capital. I want t.o refer t.o that in m.ore detail later. The banks and financial instituti.ons have . failed Australia. They have sh.own n.o interest in venture capital. They are t.o.o busy raking in their 17 per cent plus interest. Australia is badly served by the banks, and I h.ope that the Minister f.or Industry, Techn.ol.ogy and C.ommerce (Senat.or Butt.on) will be successful in devel.oping ways .of inv.olving superannuati.on funds in venture capital. Recently, a c.ompany called Wye Industries Ltd in my elect.orate .of Hindmarsh discovered and devel.oped a chemical with great p.otential t.o impr.ove .our envir.onment and make furniture safer fr.om fires and at the same time earn many milli.ons .of d.ollars in exp.ort earnings. This c.ompany has devel.oped a pr.oduct that eliminates chl.oroflu.or.ocarb.ons in f.oam pr.oducti.on. It is virtually free .of cancer.ous di.oxin. It is capable .of pr.oducing the highest fire retardant standards in f.oam furniture and products f.or aut.om.otive and aircraft seating. This company is securing internati.onal patents f.or the pr.oduct and has spent well .over $2m .of its .own m.oneys in devel.opment. It wants t.o stay and devel.op here in Australia. The c.ompany needs a g.overnment guarantee in .order t.o secure a l.oan .of ab.out $4m in .order t.o bec.ome commercially viable. Where is the venture capital? In the case .of Wye Industries, it is n.ot even venture capital. It has a pr.oduct, well tested and with w.orld patents, but d.oes n.ot have the capital t.o become really c.ommercially viable. The pr.oduct has exp.ort p.otential .of .over $USIOOm. That is just what we need t.o get that balance .of payments turnar.ound. Wye Industries is n.ot an is.olated case. There are .other l.ost .opp.ortunities f.or Australian industries due t.o their inability t.o .obtain grants, l.oans, venture capital, et cetera, f.or either expansi.on .of existing plant .or the purchase .of new plant t.o meet nati.onal and internati.onal markets. An.other example .of an .opp.ortunity ab.out t.o be l.ost is a .one sh.ot hyp.odermic syringe, which has been developed by a South Australian couple. This Australian invention is a one shot, disposable, retractable needle-type syringe which could be used to prevent accidental spread of infectious diseases such as hepatitis B, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, et cetera, by the user or administrator unintentionally or intentionally touching a used needle. After it has been used, the needle retracts into the syringe itself. The needle cannot be got out again after it has done its work. The estimated current Australian market is approximately $25m per annum. The estimated current world market is approximately $4.5 billion per annum. This couple cannot get that product up. I am glad to say that they are being helped by NIES in South Australia, but it is an uphill battle. Another company looking for venture capital is Gripscore Pty Ltd, which currently manufactures a bituminous underlay that provides a flexible adhesion for tiling anÂ· unstable porous surface. The product's unique feature is as a damp-proofing and salt damp protection for areas prone to damage-for example, bathrooms, patios, kitchens and wet areas. The product has been fully tested and approved by Amdel Ltd, the South Australian Institute of Technology, the University of Adelaide, Australian Master Builders Co. Pty Ltd and many others. This product stops salt damp, water ingress. Gripscore cannot meet demand and needs approximately $250,000 to expand. The market potential relates directly to every new building in Austheir tralia in addition to renovations. Is this other loss for Australia? Duntech International Pty Ltd currently designs, manufactures and markets products at the leading edge of technology. Duntech's three wholly-owned subsidiary companies represent a fairly broad spread of product diversification based upon related and interconnecting technologies. This company is endeavouring to expand into the international defence market but requires financial assistance to capture the competitiveness of the latest technology. The bottom line is that Duntech has been unsuccessful in raising future grants or loans and will be visiting the Government of Malta next week with a view to leaving Australia forever. The amount of finance required is approximately $2m. Surely our defence industry is worth this amount. Technetics Ltd is one of the Duntech International Pty Ltd companies. It is interesting to read about the work it is involved in. Technetics achieved international recognition over 20 years ago as a pioneer in the field of miniaturised antenna systems in the frequency range below microwave. These antennas satisfy critical needs in modern communications systems where space is often at a premium. Today the subsidiary is engaged in designing and marketing such diverse things as aesoteric signal processes, ultra-high reliability MF communications systems, ultra-miniature antennas and high accuracy direction finding equipment for government and private sector customers throughout the world. As I said at the beginning of my speech, I want to speak about venture capital and to support the work of the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button. I think it is important to place on the record the statements that he has made of late on this very question. At a local level I found the same kind of frustration with the banks and financial institutions. They are just not prepared to put money into venture capital. They can see no further than the end of their noses. I would like to quote from the Australian of Tuesday, 11 July this year. The headline was 'Button attacks industry's ""legacy of conservatism"" '. It states: A deep-seated conservatism within industry was holding Australian innovations back and hindering entry to the commercial market, the Minister anfor Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, said today. He went on to say: There are not enough companies prepared to collaborate in the process of innovation, research and development, take commercial risks and then take it into the marketplace. In the Adelaide Advertiser of 21 August this year under the headline 'Button hints at blocking export of super funds' Senator Button was reported again. It states: A senior federal minister indicated yesterday that the Government would move to stop the superannuation industry from shifting too much of its funds overseas in the wake of the Federal Budget. I interpose at this point to say that recently there was a report that a trade union superannuation fund had invested in a factory in Germany. That kind of thing could be described as obscene. If our legislation does not enable superannuation funds to invest in Australian industry, then there is something wrong with our legislation. This is the kind of issue that Senator Button is addressing. It is certainly one that I support. I will continue quoting from the article in the Advertiser of 21 August: The Industry, Technology and Commerce Minister, Senator Button, said there was a potential for sliper funds to deny the nation some of the benefits delivered in last week's Budget by shifting money overseas. ""As far as I can see there is nothing to stop them doing that. ""But as these funds build, any government worth its salt has got to be about continually changing the environment here to encourage the sort of investments which we would like in this economy."" Again, I support the line taken by Senator Button and hope that his Cabinet colleagues will work with him to ensure that these superannuation funds-many of them will be trade union funds-will be capable of investing in Australia. It may not be too late to buy back the farm. It may be done by the development of superannuation funds. I started my speech by quoting the Treasurer. A lot of credit ha.s to go to him for the innovation of the development of superannuation funds. Memories are short on this subject. The Treasurer involved himself right at the beginning when we saw the transfer of 3 per cent from the trade unions wage increase into superannuation funds. That development was mentioned in the Budget. It will go on as something that excites me. I am sure it excites other socialists on this side to find that over a short period we will see massive superannuation funds belonging to Australian industry and Australian trade unions that are available for investment in Australia and for Australia, so that we can then compete in the world and not go down the track that some of our ancestors went down. When superannuation was developed and invented in Australia, it was too hard to go on with it, so what did we do? We sold out to the Americans. We had to pay through the nose as the multinationals exploited many of these inventions and developments by Australian pioneers. I applaud the Minister and the Treasurer. I hope that in my time in this place I will see the development of superannuation funds and of Australian industry.",54
105,Mr SHARP,FOR ABORIGINALS,"1 would like to use the debate on the Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1989-90 to discuss some issues which are relevant to my electorate of Gilmore and to highlight how this Budget will affect the people in my electorate. I would 'like to start on the subject of roads. This is particularly appropriate as we had a question on it today and we have the responsible Minister, the Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support (Mr Robert Brown), in the House tonight. Anybody who has had the opportunity to get outside the major metropolitan centres of Australia will discover that,' beyond some of our national highways, the road system throughout this country is falling apart. I have some very good examples in my electorate. A question was asked today by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) of the Minister about what a wonderful job the Government was doing with roads. It was rather a failed tactic for the honourable member for Hunter to raise the issue of roads because I know that his electorate is particularly vulnerable to this problem. I have been in his electorate twice over the past few months; I have had the unfortunate experience of travelling on roads in the honourable member's electorate, particularly in the Cessnock area. Whilst I was up there the locals were talking of a road that was very bad. We drove along it. It was shattering to drive along. I do not know how cars hold together as they bounce along this particular road; In the previous week or two a utility lost its back axle as it was driven through one of these potholes. The potholes and the state of the road are so bad that the back axle completely came off the vehicle in the course of travelling along the road in the honourable member for Hunter's electorate. That axle came off the vehicle not because it was not bolted on correctly but because this Government has not put enough money into maintaining roads not only in the electorate of the honourable member for Hunter but right throughout the electorates of Australia. As I mentioned a few moments ago, We have in my electorate roads similar to the ones I saw earlier this year in Cessnock. I speak particularly of the road that goes from Yass through Boorowa to Cowra. I travel that road frequently in order to service my electorate. It has always been a bad road. the last 12 months it has broken up very badly indeed. It is quite dangerous. We are left with no alternative but to drive into huge potholes. If we deviate from those potholes we either go into the scrub and crash into a tree or run the risk of running head on into a car coming the other way. have asked for an explanation as to why the roads are in this state. The reason the cil has put forward is simply that it does have the funds to maintain them order. This is a good example of what is happening right around Australia today. well as that road, I have in my electorate the road that runs from Young through BooMinister rowa to Crookwell. It is in a chronic state of disrepair. I also have in my electorate the road that many people from. the Australian Capital Territory district would be familiar with, is, trunk road 92, which runs from Braiddropped wood through Nerriga down to Tomerong near Nowra on the south coast. That road desperately needs funds to upgrade it to bitumen surface. It is by far the best track from the western districts over the Great Dividing Range down to the coastal districts of New South Wales. It is by far the best track; there are no great hills or big hairpin bends in it, yet unfortunately due to a lack of funds we cannot maintain the current dirt surface in reasomlble order, let alone do anyabout thing to improve that surface by putting some bitumen on it over the years ahead. case. The reason is that the Federal Government has cut road funding by more than 30 per cent since it has been in government, a period of 6t years. The Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support today tried to inform the House that as a consequence of this magnifformer icent Budget, the world's best Budget, we would have a real increase in road funding. The Minister very fortuitously and selecunder tively decided to quote figures from only year's Budget. Indeed, he decided to quote figures which were, if I may be so bold to say it, somewhat misleading. Firstly, he chose the figure for an increase in actual terms of $120m. The Minister would know that that is not a very fair figure to use. For example, included in that $120m is an amount of $11.5m for interstate road transport charges; In an amount of $6.6m for road safety and transport research; and an amount of $7.7m for policy and administration, that is, an administration cost directly related to the running of his Department. A significant portion of that $120m which the Minister claims is all going towards roads is not going I towards road construction or improvement, but just towards the administration of the counDepartment or the normal functions of the not Government that are unrelated to road conin proper struction or improvement. .The Minister announced that road funding As had increased in actual terms by $120m. We know that the figure is slightly bodgie. The was also somewhat cavalier in his statement about the real increase in road funding. For example, I think he said that road funding had increased this year by about 3 per cent in real terms. In the process of that coming to that figure, the Minister has last year's inflation figure from 7.3 per cent to about 7 per cent. He has also increased road funding to about 10 per cent a from the actual figure of 9.5 per cent. The Minister has been very selective and careful in rounding up or rounding down figures in order to establish a preferable figure with which to promote the Government's failed road funding policies. The fact is that road funding has not increased by 3 per cent in . real terms this year. It has increased by 2.2 per cent, but it is the first year for a number of years that that has been the As I mentioned earlier, road funding collectively over the last 6t years has been reduced by a little over 30 per cent, even if we take into account the recent increase. It is interesting to compare the road funding figures of this Government with those of the Liberal-National Party coalition Government. Figures supplied by the Australian Bureau of Statistics show that in 1977-78, the then Liberal-National Party Govthis ernment, the actual percentage increase in road funding was 10.2 per cent. The following year the increase was 6.3 per cent; the following year, 11.2 per cent; the following year, 11.1 per cent; the year after that, 11.9 per cent; and the next and last full financial year of the Liberal-National Party Government, 21.5 per cent. If we look at the years in which the Labor Government has been in office, we find that road funding had an initial rise of 37.7 per cent. I might add that the increase was a consequence of the policy developed by the Hon. Ralph Hunt, the Minister for Transport, who developed the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Fund. So the funds that were set up by the previous Government gave the impetus for that 37.7 per cent increase in the first year of the Labor Government. The next year there was a 13 per cent increase; the year after that, a 0.4 per cent increase; the year after that, a 0.1 per cent decrease; the year after that, a 0.1 per cent increase; and the year after that, a 2.3 per cent decrease. Each year under Labor, despite inflation, the number of dollars spent on roads has decreased. It has pulled itself up over the best years of the Fraser-Anthony governments only in this last Budget-and that is only if we do not take inflation into account. If we look at the total amount by which the Government has reduced road expenditure and compare it with 1983-84 in 1989 dollars, we find that the motorist is $1,309m short as a consequence of the Government's cutbacks in road funding. The amount of $1,309m is virtually double what would be spent now if the Government had maintained the level of expenditure in real terms that was being expended in 1983-84. Today, road funding has deteriorated by more than 30 per cent. The Minister in his answer to a question today from the honourable member for Hunter tried to pull the wool over our eyes. I am sure that those people who are aware of the facts, particularly those in the Australian Automobile Association, with whom the Minister would be very familiar and who, with a great deal of interest, I am sure, will be analysing the Minister's answer today-Mr MeG au ran-They would have been disappointed.",57
106,Mr SHARP,FOR ABORIGINALS,"They have been disappointed with the Minister from the very outset. Indeed, he insulted them and all the Association's brother organisations within months of arriving on the scene in this portfolio. It was a quite disgraceful performance by the Minister in insulting such a credible and worthy organisation as this, with 4.9 million members throughout Australia and with a number of publications, which has done its very best not only to point out where the Minister is wrong, but also to ask the continual question, 'Where are the roads our taxes are paying for?'. That reminds me of the fact that when the Government came to power in 1983 the fuel excise was 6.155c a litre, which raised a total of $970m. This year the fuel tax has increased, from the Federal Government's angle anyway, to 23.l52c a litre. That is a 400 per cent increase. The revenue has gone from $970m to $5,163m, so the Government has had a huge increase in revenue. Despite the 400-odd per cent increase in the fuel excise, we have seen a 30 per cent decrease in road funding. The motorist is definitely being ripped off. He is being ripped off by a government that has no real interest in or concern about the state of the roads throughout Australia. As a consequence, the electors in my electorate are holding public meetings. We have had public meetings in places such as Gunning, where earlier this year 550 people attended a meeting. I do not think 550 people live in Gunning, but that number turned up at a meeting to express their concern about the state of the roads, calling on the Federal Government to do somethingMr Robert Brown-They were all plants.",59
107,Mr SHARP,FOR ABORIGINALS,"They were not all plants. I am glad the Minister raised that. They were all very Â·concerned citizens brought out not only by the organisers of the meeting, who were associated with the Gunning Shire Council, but also by the very precise, accurate and fair attacks being made on the Government by the National Roads and Motorists Association. The NRMA was well represented at that meeting. Various resolutions were passed and at least the Minister would have got the feeling from that meeting and as a consequence of the reports that no doubt would have been made to him that people of the district are not very happy. As a consequence, at least some road construc. tions are now being planned. The program has been brought forward and that is a welcome improvement. Only in recent days, there have ,been additional fatalities on that road, which is a cause of concern to all people in the district. We are calling on the Government to expedite the construction of the Cullerin Range deviation and the Goulburn bypass to ensure that the road construction program is not delayed and that the number of lives that are lost on that section of highway is minimised. I can assure the Minister that for each year we delay the completion of that highway between 20 and 30 people will be killed. Indeed, so far this year 25 or 26 people have been killed on the highway between Goulburn and Yass. No doubt the figure will be over 30 by the end of the year. Each year there is a delay, 80 per cent of that number of 25 or 30-will be unnecessarily killed, if we accept that road improvements reduce fatalities by about 80 per cent. I think that is a reasonable figure to assume. That is something that is a concern in my electorate. In summary, my constituents are very concerned about the ongoing very high interest rates which are unaffordable and which are causing genuine hardship amongst home buyers, small businesses and particularly farmers. There is also ongoing increasing concern about inflation. If last year's figures were dreadfully inaccurate in their prediction of inflation, this year's predictions kled. lead us to have a great deal of concern. There is also concern about the current account deficit. I can assure everybody in my electorate that we cannot go on having these huge current account deficits. The Government has done nothing to address that, inflation or interest rates. Indeed, it has done nothing to address the very real concern about our growing foreign debt, which went through the $108 billion mark last week. On the basis of analysis, by the end of next year when we look at how this Budget performed we will realise that, like the Budget of last year, it has been a failure, particularly for people in my electorate who use roads or are concerned about the state of the waterfront or interest rates.",59
108,Mr CAMPBELL,FOR ABORIGINALS,"1t isa little galling, when one's time on a very important subject is limited-and I have been told I have got 10 minutes-to have that time eaten into by the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp) with his singular capacity to raise the level of debate in this House to that heard in a very average local government meeting. What the honourable member was saying about roads in New South Wales is testimony to successive State governments in New South Wales. I have been driving on those roads recently and some of them are not in a particularly good state of repair. However, I can assure the honourable member that I can find much worse roads elsewhere in Australia where economics simply do not allow the money to be spent. The level of economic management from this Government has been particularly good. Notwithstanding that, the Budget did not take account of rural problems. This is not surprising. In my view there is not a political party in Australia today that fully understands the problems of rural Australia. We are seeing a growing dichotomy between rural and urban Australia. We as a nation are tending to grow apart. I think this is the most urgent and dangerous problem facing this nation. When we are continually regaled with the myth of multiculturalism, I fear that we are allowing the main culture in this country to divide on this basis. A divided country will not survive and I believe that this problem must be approached and tacAnother element of the Budget that concerns me is that I do not perceive in it a strategy for dealing with a downturn in commodity prices. If there is such a downturn things will be extremely difficult. Given that commodity prices are at an all-time high in most instances, I would say that a downturn is somewhere out there in the future. I believe that certain things can be done. I must pay tribute to the very thoughtful speech of the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr John Scott) who spoke just before me. I believe that industry policy is something that can counter the cyclic downturn in commodity prices. We should be looking to build up industry, whereas clearly we are not. If one looks at the current account deficit, we find that $1.76 billion is spent on computers. Much of that money is spent on computers that people play with. I see no reason why they should be allowed to import these toys duty free. If we were to look very hard at what sorts of computers we import into the country we could cut this deficit quite considerably. There is a $1.077 billion deficit in regard to plastics. A significant amount of these products could and should be produced here. Already this country produces a lot of raw materials for plastics and the Australian industry should have a natural advantage. People who berate the Western Australian Government for its petrochemical deal should look a little closer at that. We also have a deficit of about a billion dollars in respect of vans and light trucks. The Oka Motor Co. in Western Australia produces arguably the best four-wheel drive vehicle in the world-certainly in its class. But this company is unable to get the necessary finance because we do not have an ethos in this country of investing in manufacturing. When one does not have such an ethos, it is up to the Government to provide the necessary leadership, and that leadership is not there. It is not being provided. A company like this requires capital injections which are not forthcoming. It will be said by some that the Government initiatives on superannuation-initiatives which I entirely applaud-will fix this. Over time they might but it will take too long. The superannuation companies do not have an ethos of investing in Australian manufacturing either. They look for the quick return, the short term advantage. This will not happen until they are so loaded with money that they are forced to invest some of it in Australia. So, any advantage we will see from this will be a long time coming. We could have re-financed the development banks from our very good domestic surplus. A development bank could fulfil. its charter of lending to Australian industry on the basis of good ideas and without due regard to security. We could also have seen a massive re-financing of the Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC). The Corporation might pride itself on being the most successful merchant bank in Australia and tell us with some pride that it has $250m invested in equities. In my view, this is an indictment of this organisation because, bearing in mind the length of time it has been operating, $250m is a mere bagatelle. When one accepts that much of that equity will be in bricks and mortar, it is even more of an indictment. The truth is that the AIDC does not invest in Australian industry but prefers to invest in shopping centres and such things-undertakings which increase consumption in this country. That is where it gets its best return. But this is not in Australia's long term interests. In the short time available to me, I want to look specifically at forest products in which we have a deficit of $1.6 billion. I have just had a look at the forest situation in east Gippsland. I will just concentrate on that area alone. East Gippsland uses a very inefficient method of forestry. Recently a speech was given in this House about the devastation caused by woodchippers in east Gippsland. This is not true. That is not to say that there has not been some devastation. People go into an area that has been selectively logged in the past. I might add that selective logging is the preferred method that the greenies are advocating for that part of Australia. Forestry workers take out the millable timber and leave behind about 100 tonnes per hectare of very valuable forest product. A lot of this wood is suitable for use but is left to rot on the ground. It creates an enormous mess in the area and makes it much harder to do anything constructive with the forest. This is a very important issue. I believe that the Victorian Government should be indicted for allowing this practice to continue. The timber left behind represents about one and a half million tonnes of timberenough to supply a pulp mill, which could produce a valued added product for Australia. Just in that instance alone, jobs are going begging and $100m worth of' value added production is being lost to Australia for all time. In view of the time, I will conclude my remarks at this point. I seek leave to continue my speech at a later stage. Leave granted; debate adjourned.",60
109,Unknown,FOR ABORIGINALS,"Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m. NA NA NA (APPLICATION OF LAWS) BILL 1989 Second Reading Debate resumed from 17 August, on motion by Mr Lionel Bowen: That the Bill be now read a second time.",61
110,Mr NA BROWN,INSTRUMENTALITIES,"Menzies) (8.00)The purpose of the Commonwealth and Commonwealth Instrumentalities (Application of Laws) Bill, according to the second reading speech of the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen), is to make it clear what kinds of State and Territory laws apply to the Commonwealth and Commonwealth instrumentalities. Although on occasion we have congratulated the Government on legislation in the Attorney-General's area, I am afraid that this is not one such occasion, and we will be opposing this Bill. Indeed, I doubt very much whether the real purpose of the Bill is to clarify what kinds of State and Territory laws apply to the Commonwealth. As far as I can discern, its real purpose seems to be to take yet another step along the road towards the expansion of Commonwealth power. In any event, even if the Government's motives are to clarify the State law that applies to the Commonwealth, that certainly will not be its effect or result. effect will not be to clarify anything, but to confuse things even further. Our objections to the Bill, to put them succinctly, are, first of all, that it is not necessary; secondly, .that it more Commonwealth power, as I have already said, and, thirdly, it will discriminate against the individual citizen because the sult of the Bill will be that the Commonwealth will not be subject to laws to which the individual citizen will be subject. The Commonwealth will be putting itself above the law, the law that applies to citizens, which the Opposition maintains is a very unhealthy step for the Commonwealth to be taking. To understand the Bill we have to go back to the foundation of the Commonwealth. Since Federation constitutional lawyers and others have pondered the question of whether State laws bind the Commonwealth. For instance, to take a homely example that impinges upon members of parliament in their day-today lives, is a Commonwealth car driver bound by State traffic laws? Many questions of this sort were not tested at all, but where they were tested they were usually resolved along the lines that if a State law was regulating general conduct the law applied to the Commonwealth. Thus, by 1925 a Royal Australian Air Force driver on duty was held to be subject to the Victorian motor car Act. Likewise, general State contract laws were held to apply to the Commonwealth, if the Commonwealth entered into a contract. This notion was enshrined in section 64 of the Judiciary Act which states, in effect, that if the Commonwealth or a State is engaged in civil litigation: . . . the rights of parties shall as nearly as possible be the same . . . as in a suit between subject and subject. The general State statute law applied to the Commonwealth, particularly if the Commonwealth was engaged in litigation. However, if the State tried to legislate to affect the Commonwealth on some governmental matter the State could not bind the Commonwealth. State laws could not affect Commonwealth government functions, nor could they discriminate against the Commonwealth. As Sir Owen Dixon said in the case of Its Uther v. the Commissioner of Taxation in 1947, describing the true position of the Commonwealth: Like the goddess of wisdom the Commonwealth uno iew sprang from the brain its begetters armed and will lead to even of full stature. Some may not agree with Sir Owen Dixon's equation of the Commonwealth with the re- goddess of wisdom. However, the fact is that although at Federation the colonies became States, the Commonwealth did much better because it was born with all the powers of the sovereign State. Clearly, as a result, the Commonwealth cannot be affected in its governmental functions by State laws. Mr Justice Fullagar put it more bluntly in the case of the Commonwealth v. Boyle in 1953 when he said: . . . the State Parliament has no power over the Commonwealth. It was probably inevitable that sooner or later there would be a clash or conflict of some sort between these two principles. On the one hand the Commonwealth was subject to the general law, as we have seen, but on the other hand the State parliament could not legislate to affect the Commonwealth Crown, or the Commonwealth, with respect to its governmental functions. That clash or conflict, to some extent, came in the form of a High Court decision in 1986 in the case of the Commonwealth v. Evans Deakin Industries Ltd, a case which gives rise to this Bill and which is referred to in the Attorney General's second reading speech. In that case the Commomyealth was the client on a building project at Eagle Farm Airport in Brisbane. A Queensland Act, the Subcontractors' Charges Act, stated that if the head contractor did not pay his subcontractor, the subcontractor could force the client to pay the subcontractor for work he had done. Evans Deakin was a subcontractor to a company called Maltry, which was the builder. Maltry went into liquidation; so Evans Deakin made a claim on the Commonwealth for work which it had done. The Commonwealth refused to pay and Evans Deakin sued for its money under the Queensland Act. Evans Deakin and the State of Queensland argued in that case that when the action was commenced section 64 of the Judiciary Act made the Queensland Act just as applicable to the Commonwealth as it was to any other building client. The High Court held that this Act applied to the Commonwealth or, in other words, that the Commonwealth had the same civil duty to a citizen under State laws as citizens owed to each other. The Court said in the decision in the Commonwealth v. Evans Deakin Industries Ltd case that the Commonwealth, by entering into a building contract: was making a contract of a kind commonly entered into by ordinary members of the public and the determination of the rights and liabilities of the Commonwealth by reference to the Subcontractors' Charges Act would not be incompatible with the position of the Commonwealth or detrimental to the public welfare. That is a workable rule stated by the High Court. It may not be perfect, and it may give rise to some difficulties in application, but it is a workable rule and certainly any problems that emerge from that rule, as stated by the High Court, are not such as to justify heavy-handed legislation of the sort that is before the House tonight. The Court went on to say that such an approach was 'entirely just'. By 'entirely just' what the High Court clearly meant was that it was entirely just that the Commonwealth Government, in a case of that sort, should be subject to the same laws as the individual citizen. Of course, the Commonwealth does not like this decision. It does not like the decision not only because it lost-which is often the reason why it does not like High Court or other court decisions-but also for other reasons. The Attorney-General explained this in his second reading speech when he said that such a result was not intended. I do not know the justification for that conclusion, but that is the view taken by the Government. According to the Attorney-General the decision means that from now on the Commonwealth, as the Attorney-General put it: is subject to the risk of incurring unforeseeable kinds of liabilities under whatever legislation the States and self-governing Territories might enact from time to time in relation to ordinary persons. Some ordinary persons, as the Attorney General calls them, might feel that this is a very good thing. Indeed, it should not be forgotten that ordinary persons, as they are referred to by the Attorney-General, form the vast bulk of parties who come before the courts where their rights are determined. It seems to me that in many attitudes taken by the present Government ordinary persons are very low on the totem pole. They probably come third, after governments and statutory bodies. Our view is that this House should be very loath to accept readily a situation, which is really the basic proposition contained in this Bill, that the Commonwealth should be exempted from laws which apply to the citizens of this country. Faced with this prospect the Commonwealth has decided to legislate by means of this Bill, in effect, to exempt the Commonwealth from State laws; indeed, to exempt the Commonwealth from virtually all State laws except those which the Commonwealth, picking and choosing between them, decides that it would be prepared to subject itself to. That is a very bad principle for the Commonwealth to be proceeding on, as it does in this Bill. Looking at the Bill in a little more detail, one sees that it says that the Commonwealth is not subject to any written laws of a State, apart from some minor exceptions, unless the Commonwealth makes a regulation by which it declares that the Commonwealth is subject to a particular State law designated in the regulation. In other words, the Bill says that it will start off with a clean slate and that the Commonwealth is not subject to any State laws except those that the Commonwealth, picking and choosing between them all, determines that it will subject itself to. That is a very bad principle. The Bill also says that Commonwealth employees are subject to State laws 'to the same extent as the Commonwealth is subject to them'. As the Commonwealth is not to be subject to a State law unless a regulation declares that it is, Commonwealth employees are, as a basic presumption, not to be subject to State laws. Likewise, that is a bad principle. However, we also find that State laws will apply to Commonwealth corporations as they apply to private companies. Presumably, the reason for this is that they engage in trade and therefore are closer to being regarded as what the Attorney-General describes as 'ordinary persons'. The Bill also amends section 64 of the Judiciary Act, which I referred to earlier, and amends that section to the effect that, where the Commonwealth is a party to litigation, the rights of the parties are no longer to be the same as between citizen and citizen if the rights are created by an Act to which the Commonwealth is not subject. Putting all that together, where does it leave us? We would not want a situation to exist where the Commonwealth would be put to excessive risk because of future State laws that might be held to bind the Commonwealth. Apparently that is one of the concerns that the Attorney-General hasthat the Commonwealth without this Bill might be subjected to excessive and unforeseeable risks. We do not believe that that will be the case if this Bill is defeated. Neversons the less, that is the concern of the Government. Nor would we want the Commonwealth to have its proper functions as a government excessively limited. Nor would we want to perpetuate any doubts that may have been created by the Evans Deakin decision. Nevertheless, when one looks at the matter as a whole, we believe that the Government has greatly exaggerated the Â·effect of this decision and created a problem where none really exists. One cannot help but suspect that it is not the confusion in the law that has prompted this Bill but rather that the Commonwealth does not want to be subject to inconvenient State laws. The Commonwealth really wants to be free from a host of State laws which bind the citizen. There is nothing in the Evans Deakin decision that enables the States to affect or limit the proper role of the Commonwealth as a government or in its governmental functions. To some extent, there is no new law in it. All that the case says is that, if the Commonwealth engages in activities such as building projects and ends up in court, it is subject to the same rules as any private citizen and should comply with the law. That is a very good result. Indeed, we cannot see how anyone can argue against that proposition. Let me remind honourable members of the words used in the Evans Deakin case by the High Court of Australia because they sum up the basic proposition. As the Court said in the Evans Deakin case, the Commonwealth, by entering into a building contract-here again I use the words that the High Court used: was making a contract of a kind commonly entered into by ordinary members of the public and the determination of the rights and liabilities of the Commonwealth by reference to the Subcontractors' Charges Act, would not be incompatible with the position of the Commonwealth or detrimental to the public welfare. So if the issue arises in the future, if this Bill were not passed, that would be the test. Is the situation one that is incompatible with the position of the Commonwealth or detrimental to the public welfare? If it is such a situation, of course the State law does not apply. To return to the basic argument: when one analyses it, there are basically three reawhy we oppose this Bill. The first reason is that in reality, as I have already said in different words, the Evans Deakin case was a good and just result for, as a general rule, governments should be subject to the same laws as ordinary persons. That was the burden of the result of the case in the Commonwealth v. Evans Deakin. The second reason we oppose the Bill is that the Government's whole approach in this Bill of exempting the Commonwealth from all State laws, even criminal laws, mark you, unless a regulation declares that the Commonwealth is subject to any of them in particular, seems to us quite wrong. In practice, it means that the Commonwealth Government-and for practical purposes that means the Executive Commonwealth Government-will start off with a clean slate. It is starting off as if were in some sort of Garden of Eden where it is not subject to any State laws at all. Should it decide that there are State laws which it should be subject, it will be able pick and choose between the laws it likes and those it does not. While it does that, there will be an obvious discrimination tween the citizen and the Commonwealth because the citizen will be subject to all State laws and the Commonwealth will be subject to none. Presumably the Commoneral wealth, when engaging in this cise, will not voluntarily subject itself to any State laws which might put it at risk of (1)incurring some liability or which might impose upon it some burden to which it does not wish to be subjected. This of course-it does goes Â·without saying-would be a very forcreated tunate position for the Commonwealth to put itself in. It would be immune from State laws. As we know, laws usually limit power; so, in effect, it is freeing itself from State limitations on its power. The States will not have the luxury being able to engage inÂ· a similar exercise. Commonwealth Acts, if within Commonwealth power, can bind the States and frequently do, whether the States like it or not. So they will have no such luxury to pick choose between those laws to which they this would like to be subject and those laws which they would not wish to be subject. The situation is actually worse than I have described because, as well as the provisions negating the effect of State laws on the monwealth, the Bill also provides that monwealth laws-I repeat: Commonwealth laws--ill not apply to the Commonwealth unless the Commonwealth declares that they do. If the Bill becomes law, the Commonbut wealth will be able to declare that a Compublic monwealth Act that confers a benefit on itself does apply to the Commonwealth, but a State Act that confers a duty, obligation or a burden on itself does not. The third reason is that the amendment That that is proposed to be made to section 64 of by Section 64the Judiciary Act is unfair and discriminates against the States. It exempts the Commonthat wealth as a litigant from obligations when as just. the Commonwealth is not subject to a State or a Commonwealth Act, but it does not exempt a State from similar obligations when it the State is not subject to a Commonwealth or a State Act. The States cannot rectify this discrimination by their own laws because to they cannot pass laws about what happens to and does not happen in a Federal court. If the Bill is passed, there should be an amendment made to it to rectify the Judicibeary Act objection which I have already discussed. This amendment would put the States in the same situation as the Commonwealth when they are involved in litigation in Fedcourts. The amendment would be along curious exerthe following lines: (3) where a State is a party to a suit, sub-section that is, of that section of the Judiciary Actnot apply in relation to any rights of a party by or under a statute to which the State is not subject. I understand that the Government will be moving a similar amendment. We will content ourselves by accepting the amendment that the Government proposes to move. We believe that our amendment is better but it of would seem that the Government's amendment will have the same effect. I reinforce what I have been saying by referring the House to a submission prepared and by the New South Wales Bar Association on Bill. I would not want it to be said that to the views that - have expressed are solely the views of the Opposition. The views that I have - xpressed are supported quite widely in the outside community, particularly in the Comlegal community. This submission from the ComNew South Wales Bar Association has been adopted and supported by the Law Council of Australia and therefore the views that are contained in it are n.ot only substantial views also views which have a wide body of support. I do not intend to refer to the whole of this submission. I will content myself by referring to some extracts from it which I would like to read into Hansard. On page 2 of this submission the New South Wales Bar Association says: the High Court has described the result achieved is, section 64 of the Judiciary ActRelating to the Evans Deakin case the submission sets out that the High Court said: That case establishes that in every suit to which the Commonwealth is a party Section 64 requires the rights of the parties to be ascertained, as nearly as possible, by the same rules of law, substantive and procedural, statutory and otherwise, as would apply if the Commonwealth were a subject instead of being the Crown. That result seems entirely just; the Commonwealth acquires no special privilege except where it is not possible to give it the same rights and subject it to the same liabilities as an ordinary subject. As I said before, that is the starting point. The New South Wales Bar Association continues: The historical basis for Section 64 together with the High Court's declaration of the justness of the provision require that the very closest scrutiny is appropriate for this Bill to amend Section 64. The creation of special immunities or privileges for the benefit of the Commonwealth in litigation should only be permitted with the firmest assurances of the protection of the rights of citizens. We believe that that statement by the New South Wales Bar Association is correct. We entirely endorse the views expressed by that Association that it is a matter of very great concern when a government embarks upon legislation to create special immunities oprivileges which benefit a government-in this case the Commonwealth Government to the very clear discrimin&tion and prejudice of the individual citizen. There should be no mistake that that is exactly what is being done in this Bill. The New South Wales Bar Association talks about the mechanism which is adopted by the Government in this Bill: the mechanism being that we start off with a clean slate and say, 'No State laws apply to the Commonwealth except those that we, the Executive Commonwealth Government, believe should apply to the Commonwealth'. The New South Wales Bar Association addresses an alternative way of doing this, if we want to do it, namely by saying that general principles will apply and that State laws in appropriate cases on the interpretation given by the High Court will bind the Commonwealth, will apply to the Commonwealth except in those cases where the Commonwealth promulgates a regulation exempting that particular State law from operating on the Commonwealth. That is the alternative approach. Relating to that approach the New South Wales Bar Association says: . . . Instead of asking the question of any new Commonwealth or State law 'why shouldn't this law apply to the Commonwealth?', they will instead be asking the question 'why should this law apply to the Commonwealth?' If the Bill is passed that is the question that will be asked. The New South Wales Bar Association continues: . . . The natural hesitation of bureaucrats and policy makers to extend the liabilities of the Commonwealth will often mean that no good reason for extension will be found. Every new State or Commonwealth law if it is decided to make it apply to the Commonwealth will always involve potential and unforeseeable liabilities for the Commonwealth. There will always be therefore a strong argument in the mind of the policy maker and regulator against the application of such laws to the Commonwealth. Arguments against application will therefore always win the day. The only effective counterweight is to bring before policy makers and regulators a reminder of the inherent justness and public benefit in equality before the law for the Commonwealth as well as for its citizens. This fundamental principle of the public interest is likely to be forgotten unless it is enshrined in the draft bill. That makes the point that, if we are to embark upon this sort of an exercise, then at the very least we should start off with the presumption that State laws apply to the Commonwealth and then make out a case, if we can, as to why this should be an exemption. The New South Wales Bar Association continues: There is serious concern for the citizens of Australia in a double risk which is created by this draft Bill. Not only is the presumption of the Commonwealth's equality before the law abolished but the laws to which the Commonwealth is subject are liable to be changed merely by regulation. Citizens will not even have the security of a statutory assurance in favour of the continuance of even limited equality of the Commonwealth before the law. Such equality as exists from time to time is liable to be changed by mere regulation. Massive and ever-changing regulations are likely to create a nightmarish situationI ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to bear that in mindwhere it is difficult for private citizens and their legal advisers to ascertain from time to time whether or not the Commonwealth is subject to particular State, Territory or Federal law. No more need be said than to make that point very clear indeed, which I believe that extract does. Finally I refer to the conclusion of the New South Wales Bar Association to impinge upon the minds of Government members just what they are doing with this Bill. Take notice of these words: The Bill extinguishes the presumption of equality of the Commonwealth before the law and will disadvantage Australian citizens in unforeseeable ways in their dealings with the Commonwealth. It is a matter of concern that legislation should be brought forward in this form. So the Government is tampering with a very basic principle of equality before the law and putting the Commonwealth Government on a pedestal where it is to be given exemptions, protections and exclusions which are not available to the citizen. That is what the Government is doing. If the Government has a problem about the Evans Deakin case and its effect on the Commonwealth, it can address that problem. We have no complaint about that whatsoever. But it is very wrongvery wrong indeed-of the Government to embark upon this course of giving itself this blanket exemption and saying in effect that it will not be subject to any State or self governing Territory laws unless, picking and choosing as it does, it chooses to subject itself to those which it likes, that is, those that do not impose liabilities on the Government or liabilities which are too heavy, those that do not put too much of a burden on the Government, those which do not require the Government to comply with the law in detail in a way in which it, when it passes laws here, expects the citizen to comply. What is the justification for this? I think honourable members should think very carefully before voting in favour of this Bill. We believe that it is wrong in principle. It is unnecessary and it will cause more mischief than the mischief the Government believes is around now and which calls for some sort of rectification. Again let me remind honourable members of those closing words of the New South Wales Bar Association because I know members of the profession and those who think about these issues are very concerned about what will be done by this Bill. As the New South Wales Bar Association says: The Bill extinguishes the presumption of equalityI thought the Labor Party was supposed to believe in equaIityof the Commonwealth before the law and will disadvantage Australian citizens in unforeseeable ways in their dealings with the Commonwealth. It is a matter of concern that legislation should be brought forward in this form. For those reasons we are very strongly opposed to this Bill.",62
111,Mr LAVARCH,INSTRUMENTALITIES,"AIthough the Commonwealth and Commonwealth Instrumentalities (Application of Laws) Bill before the House is a very short Bill-it runs to only five pages, as the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N. A. Brown), has pointed out-it does have a very important impact upon the way in which the Commonwealth is dealt with by the general law. Overall, the Bill is an attempt to clarify the doctrine of immunity of the Crown within the Federal system in so far as the Commonwealth and its instrumentalities are bound by the laws of the State and, to a lesser extent, imperial law and common law. In its simplest terms, the doctrine of Crown immunity is that the Government cannot be sued, nor is it subject to the same laws as bind ordinary citizens. I think that is the starting point. The shadow Attorney-General attempted to make out that the law was as stated in the Evans Deakin cas.e; that is, from .time immemorial the Crown was always subject to the general law and that in some way this Bill was attempting to change that. The starting point with the doctrine of immunity of the Crown is in fact that; that is, that the Crown is immune from the operation of general laws and that the Crown cannot be sued. That is the starting point in terms of this doctrine. Of course, that has never been strictly the case, nor would the Government ever want that to be the case and in Australian history both State governments and the Commonwealth Government have always allowed themselves, to a greater or lesser extent, to be bound by the law. Prior to Federation, the States were bound by certain imperial laws which provided remedies against the Crown, and to an extent the Government was on the same footing as individuals. Shortly after Federation, the Commonwealth enacted the .Judiciary Act. Section 64 of that Act states: In any suit to which the Commonwealth or a State is a party, the rights of parties shall as nearly as possible be the same, and judgment may be given and costs awarded on either side, as in a suit between subject and subject. The power to enact that section is probably based on section 78 of the Constitution, which states: The Parliament may make laws conferring rights to proceed against the Commonwealth or a State in respect of matters within the limits of the judicial power. Another section-just to complete the legislative framework on which I think this Bill should be judged-is section 56 of the Judiciary Act, which states, inter alia: A person making a claim against the Commonwealth, whether in contract or in tort, may in respect of the claim bring a 'suit against the CommonwealthSince Federation, the extent of Commonwealth immunity from State legislation in particular and the common law in general has been subject to interpretation by the High Court. Despite the view which was probably expressed by the honourable member for Menzies, it has not always been a clear cut case, as set out in the Evans Deakin case; in fact, through the majority of the 89 years since Federation the Cominonwt(alth, through various decisions, has expressed views limiting the power of State legislatures to bind the Commonwealth. The situation as explained in the Evans Deakin case was not the norm since 1901 and has not been carried on and reinforced in decision after decision. That is quite contrary to what the reality has been. For instance, in the judgment of the Chief Justice, Sir Owen Dixon, in the Cigamatic case in 1962, His Honour stated that a State could not legislate as to the rights which the Commonwealth should have against its ,own subjects. This view was supported by dicta in the case of the Commonwealth v. Bogle, a 1953 High Court decision. In that case, His Honour Mr Justice Fullagar stated: The Commonwealth or the Crown in the right of the Commonwealth or whatever you choose to call it is to all intents and purposes a juristic person, it is not a juristic person which is subjected either by any State constitution or by the Commonwealth constitution to the legislative power of any State Parliament These decisions at their widest could be taken to mean that a State has no power to make laws binding upon the Commonwealth. This wide interpretation of immunity is hardly consistent with a system of government which is responsive to its own people and whereby the law should apply equally to all. Further, it is an unnecessary interpretation as the Commonwealth has the power to specifically nominate laws which do not apply to it or to its statutory instrumentalities. That was pretty well the situation up to the decision in Maguire v. Simpson, which was some years earlier than the decision in the Commonwealth v. Evans Deakin Industries Ltd. In Maguire v. Simpson it was held that section 64 of the Judiciary Act was not limited to procedural law, but included the Commonwealth in the entire web of subst\lntive law, both legislative and common law, applying to citizens. The High Court in the 1970s made that particular decision. Prior to that decision it had always been held that section 64 of the Judiciary Act was a procedural provision alone and did not imply or make the Commonwealth bound by itself to substantive law. The view in Maguire v. Simpson was affirmed in the Evans Deakin case in 1986. As the honourable member for Menzies indicated, that case involved the application to the Commonwealth of the Subcontractors Charges Act, a Queensland Act which allows a charge to be placed on moneys held by a principal contractor for the protection of subcontractors. As outlined by the honourable member for Menzies, in that situation the Commonwealth was a principal contractor and a charge was' placed upon moneys after the builder in that case went into liquidation. The Commonwealth argued that the Queensland Act did not apply to it on the basis of Crown immunity. By a majority, the court held that section 64 of the Judiciary Act imposed both procedural and substantive obligations on the Commonwealth. It placed the Commonwealth in the same shoes as an ordinary citizen of the State of Queensbut land in relation to an action under the Subcontractors Charges Act. In doing so, the majority of the High Court rejected the argument that some other law had to be on foot apart from section 64 before a course of action could be brought against the Commonwealth. However, in a strong dissenting judgment, His Honour Mr Justice Brennan accepted,that section 64 required as a precondition some other source of power to give rise to an action against the Commonwealth. He rejected that the decision in Maguire v. Simpson required the conclusion drawn by the majority, and stated that prior to the majority decision it was not thought that section 64 of the Judiciary Act conferred substantive rights in itself. It is against this particular background of divided judicial opinion as to the doctrine of Crown immunity that this particular Bill must be judged. It is not, as the honourable member for Menzies made out, a completely cut and dried situation. It is my opinion, at l-ast, that the arguments outlined by His Honour Mr Justice Brennan in the Evans Deakin case are the stronger ones. I do not think anyone can have a disputei} with the result reached in that particular case; that is, that the Commonwealth should have been bound by the terms of the Subcontractors Charges Act and should be liable in that situation. Certainly the reasoning which the majority went through to reach that decision, I think, is somewhat questionable. It certainly is not consistent with a whole range of other High Court decisions that were made prior to that time. As His Honour Mr Justice Brennan pointed out, the earlier High Court decision in Maguire v. Simpson did not necessarily have to lead to the conclusion reached by the majority in the Evans Deakin case. So it is against that entire background of uncertainty as to the extent of Crown immunity that this Bill must be judged. In as much as this Bill is an. attempt to clarify once and for all exactly what the position is, I believe it should be supported. The entire question as to whether there should be reforms to the Constitution to sort out the problem was canvassed in the Constitutional Convention which was held in Brisbane in 1975. It was also touched upon in the recent report of the Constitutional Commission. The Commission recommended that there be no change to section 78 of the Constitution on this point and noted that the Government had under active consideration the extent to which the Commonwealth should seek immunity from the operations of State laws. I take it from reading the Commission's report that the Bill we now have in front of us was what was contemplated when the Commission was deliberating its position. So this Bill is the child of that consideration and the approach adopted by the Bill is to spell out exactly the types and classes of State legislation which will apply to the Commonwealth with a regulation power to restrict applications. The alternative approach would be to make the Commonwealth subject to all State law and then to specify the laws that did not apply. That always could have been done, either by separate law or by including the limitation in the legislation governing a particular instrumentality when it was formed. There was always scope to provide that legislation under which bodies such as Australia Post and Telecom Australia were set up would not be subjected to various types of law. On various occasions the Commonwealth has adopted that approach. The position in relation to Commonwealth corporations is covered by clause 9 of the Bill. I do not imagine that this clause should be subject to opposition by those opposite. The clause states that the corporation will be subject as though it were a body corporate. That is, it puts Commonwealth corporations i- the same position as companies generally. Therefore, immunity from the general application of the law can be gained only through the Commonwealth passing a regulation. The other point that should be made is that there is an extra safeguard in the legislation which the honourable member for Menzies did not concede and that is that this House has the power to disallow any regulation saying that the Commonwealth should not be bound by a particular law. So if the Commonwealth for some reason decided that a corporation should not be bound by the Subcontractors Charges Act in Queensland, that regulation could be disallowed.",67
112,Mr SPENDER,INSTRUMENTALITIES,Would you cross the floor?,69
113,Mr LA VARCH,INSTRUMENTALITIES,"I suggest to the honourable member that it would depend upon the particular case that was put at the time. I point out that this Bill clarifies what, to date, has been a very uncertain area of law. At least in the area of corporations I do not think it should be open to any debate. The High Court used to apply some notions of what level of control the Government had over a particular instrumentality to see whether the shield of the Crown should apply. There was always a bit of legal fiction in sorting out that question. At least the position will be spelt out clearly once and for all in the legislation. For the Commonwealth Government and its departments, the Bill expressly states the law of tort will bind the Commonwealth. It also deals with laws in respect of civil procedure and civil litigation and any other law declared by regulation to be a law to which this clause of the Bill applies. That reverses the majority decision in the Evans Deakin case. It makes it consistent with the minority view expressed by His Honour Mr Justice Brennan and it returns the position to that prior to the decision in Maguire v. Simpson. It puts the Commonwealth back in the situation it was in up to the mid-1970s when the bulk of the High Court's decisions were made. I do not know that that is such a terrible or radical result. On the whole, I believe that the Bill has merit. I do not believe that the arguments put forward by the honourable member for Menzies are as drastic as he makes out. I appreciate that some people in the legal profession may have severe reservations about the approach adopted. However, in my view this Bill is a step forward towards clarifying what has traditionally been a very unclear area of Australian law. For those reasons, I believe the Bill should be supported.",69
114,Mr SPENDER,INSTRUMENTALITIES,"North Sydney) (8.46)I commence by saying that there are no politics in this issue. What we are concerned with here are issues of justice. That is .the basis upon which the Opposition hasapproached this Bill and that is the basis upon which I will approach it. Let me go immediately to what this Bill does. The Commonwealth and Commonwealth Instrumentalities (Application of Laws) Bill proposes far-reaching changes to the rules that govern litigation between citizens and the Commonwealth and its instrumentalities, as has been made plain in the second reading speech of the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) and in the speech during the second reading debate by the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N. A. Brown)-changes which will drastically.and unjustly cut down the rights of citizens to sue the Commonwealth and its instrumentalities; changes which are intended to deny to citizens a fundamental right to have in the courts the same right against the Commonwealth and its instrumentalities as they would have against anyone else. The winners will be the Commonwealth, its instrumentalities that and the bureaucracy which, in many cases, will be made immune from being held accountable in the courts for its actions. The losers will be the people of Australia. The purpose of the Bill is to change the law by drastically cutting down the just operation of section 64 of the Judiciary Act. That is the fundamental purpose. I remind the House that section 64 of the Judiciary Act says: In any suit to which the Commonwealth. . . is a party, the rights of parties shaH as nearly as possible be the same, and jUdgment may be given and costs awarded on either side, as in a suit between subject and subject. There is nothing new about this proposition. Section 64 was enacted in 1903. Its roots go back to the nineteenth century and it has served Australians well. It was founded on a basic consideration of justice and that is that the inheÂ£ited immunity of the Crown from litigation, resting on the maxim that the King could do no wrong and, therefore, that the Crown and its representatives cannot be sued in the Crown's courts, was a legal anachronism which was wholly unsuited to Australia's conditions where, since settlement, governments have engaged in a wide range of undertakings which in other countries were left to private enterprise-undertakings which, if carried out by individuals or private firms, would give rise to duties and consequent liabilities that could be litigated. The old immunity was plainly unjust. That is why we have section 64 in its present form. ; In place of s-ction 64 as it now stands it is proposed in broad terms that the Commonwealth not be subject to written laws of a State or Territory except as clause 5 specifically provides. The Commonwealth isÂ· to be exempted from State written laws, except procedural laws; laws declared by Commonwealth regulations to apply, which leaves things entirely in the hands of the Commonwealth; and codified tort laws, that is, statute laws dealing with liability and tort, such as negligence. But I point out that exemptions, even as to codified tort laws, may be made by regulation. The objections to the course embedded in this Bill on which I shall focus-there are others, but I shall focus on six main objections-are as follows: First, the Bill, as has been made plain, significantly erodes the legal rights of subjects against the Commonwealth and its instrumentalities. Secondly, it reverses a just presumption of equality before the law and puts in its place a scheme of limited liability-limited in favour of the Commonwealth-which starts from the presumption that, unless specified, written laws are not to apply to the Commonwealth which, as the New South Wales Bar Association rightly points out, is an overwhelming change. Thirdly, the Bill as an Act would be unjust in its operation, as is demonstrated beyond doubt by the very case relied on by the Attorney-General in his second reading speech, which has been referred to already by the shadow Attorney-General. Fourthly, the Bill is based on reasons which thinly disguise a determination to place the Commonwealth, in significant respects, above the law. Fifthly, it allows the Government, by regulation, to make further significant changes favourable to the Commonwealth and damaging to the citizen. I heard the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch), who spoke before me, say that, when regulations came in here, the House would have a look at those regulations and, if it saw fit to reject them, they would be rejected. None of us here came down in the last shower and we all know what will happen. The brave words that the honourable member utters today would freeze in his mouth were he to approach the centre of this chamber with the determination of getting to the other side and voting with us. Let us understand that the reality is that the regulation will come down and that is all there is to it. Mick Young, greatly beloved in this House and greatly missed, used once to say, 'We have the numbers and we will use them'. So let us put that one to one side. The sixth objection is that the legislation replaces a well understood rule which wisely leaves problems of application to be worked out by the courts and replaces that with an often confusing and uncertain legislative scheme. I point out that one of the things that the Government intends to do under the scheme is to introduce exceptions, to which the Commonwealth will apparently be subject, and this is to be done by regulation. Where does that leave working lawyers who have the task of trying to advise their clients whether they are in or out, whether the Commonwealth is liable or not? Let me go to the first three objections that I have outlined and address them together. The legal presumption created by section 64-the rule it creates and on which the interests of justice between subjects and subject and the Commonwealth Government is this: in essence, the Commonwealth is to be treated as any other litigant. This is made plain, if there was ever any doubt of it, by Maguire v. Simpson in 1977-1 repeat, in 1977. This is nothing particularly new. In that case, as the High Court of Australia pointed out in the Evans Deakin Industries case, it was established that, in every suit to which the Commonwealth is a party, section 64 requires the rights of the parties to be ascertained as nearly as possible by the same rules of law, substantive and procedural, statutory and otherwise, as would apply if the Commonwealth were itself a subject instead of being the Crown. The majority of the Full Bench said that that result seemed entirely just. Five members of the Full Bench of the High Court have ""expressed that opinionmembers who included the former Chief Justice and the present Chief Justice-and that is dismissed by this Government as being of no account. It is that entirely just result which this Bill is designed to diminish significantly and permanently. I remind honourable members of the fact that the Evans Deakin Industries case is the linchpin of the Attorney-General's argument in his second reading speech. I suppose that if we were to go to that case we would think that there was some unjust and aberrant result and that that unjust and aberrant result needed to be overcome by legislation. What did the High Court decide? The shadow Attorney-General has already referred to that, but let me remind honourable members again. It decided that, if the Commonwealth engaged in construction work in Queensland, it was bound by Queensland law. What is unjust or aberrant about that? Specifically, it decided that, if the Commonwealth employed a contractor to do construction work for it in Queensland, the Commonwealth had the same duties under Queensland law to the subcontractor of the contractor as anybody in a similar position would have. So the High Court said, 'If you want to build works in Queensland you are bound by Queensland law'. What is unjust about that? Indeed, the injustice of the contrary on the facts of the Evans Deakin case is obvious. The Commonwealth's chosen contractor went broke. That contractor-the one who went broke-was owed money by the Commonwealth and in turn owed $240,000 to a subcontractor. The subcontractor gave notice to the Commonwealth, as he could under Queensland law, of a charge, claiming that money held by the Commonwealth due to its own contractor and not paid should be held. For what purpose? To satisfy the claim of the subcontractor, who otherwise would get not a penny. What did the Commonwealth do? It disputed liability and the court said, 'You are not above the law; you are liable to the law'. As a result, the subcontractor's position was safeguarded. If the Commonwealth's position had been upheld and if the Act had applied without any exemptions being added by regulation, the result would be that that subcontractor would have lost $240,000 and been denied any recourse whatsoever. Where is the justice in that? Let me go to the fourth objection. I said, as a fourth objection, that the Bill was based on reasons which thinly disguise the determination to place the Commonwealth, in significant respects, above the law. I look to what the Attorney-General has to say on the subject in his second reading speech. Let me read part of it to the House. Referring to Evans Deakin Industries, he says: This result was almost certainly not intended by the Parliament that enacted the Judiciary Act in 1903 at a time well before the burgeoning of legislation of all kinds. As a result of the Evans Deakin decision, the Commonwealth is subject to the risk of incurring unforeseeable kinds of liabilities under whatever legislation the States and self-governing Territories might enact from time to time in relation to ordinary persons. The decision in the Evans Deakin case would also apply to self-governing Territory legislation and to Imperial legislation still in Australia. The Attorney-General then says: In the interests of the community, the Commonwealth and the States and Territories, the legal position should be clarified and those risks removed. In the Evans Deakin case the risk that the Commonwealth was to be subject to was that it would have to behave as any other person behaved when building in Queensland and it would have to behave in a just manner. The Attorney-General put such specious arguments, as risks of incurring unforeseeable kinds of liabilities. In common with everybody else and the interests of the community? What interest is served when the community is to be denied rights against the Commonwealth that it has presently? The community's interests are that the Commonwealth should have no special privileges: Let me go to the fifth reason we object to the Bill. The Government is to be allowed, by regulation, to make further significant changes favourable to the Commonwealth and damaging to citizens. Of course, it can also change by regulation so that the Commonwealth is to be caught by certain laws. But the important one is the exempting power. Under clause 5 of the Bill it can be declared that a State or Territory law dealing with torts is not to apply in the future. That can be done by regulation. We can see a whole army of the Australian Labor Party rushing across when the division bells ring to vote with us if the result should be one which offends their conscience. Under clause 6, there can be modification, by regulation, of the application to the Commonwealth of State laws that would otherwise have applied. What does that do? It gives enormous power to the Executive. We all know that regulation-making power is a substitute for good legislation honestly and openly debated in parliament. Let me go to the sixth objection. This Bill will replace a well-understood rule with an often confusing and uncertain legislative scheme. Many of the objections to that scheme have been made plain. I remind the House again of a couple: exemption by regulation and modification by regulation of the application of State laws. On that subject generally, I remind the House of what the New South Wales Bar Association said. For force in the New South Wales Bar Association, this can only be regarded as a bonus, because the amount of litigation that this Bill will inspire will be very considerable. It said: Massive and ever-changing regulations are likely to create a nightmarish situation where it is difficult for private citizens and their legal advisers tain from time to time whether or not the Commonwealth is subject to particular State, Territory or Federal law. Apart from the confusion, it violates a basic principle, and that is the principle of certainty of the law, that people should know what their rights are. Let me sum up some of the objections to this Bill. The Bill significantly cuts down the rights in the courts of citizens against the Commonwealth. It tilts the whole balance in favour of the Commonwealth. If one is talking about a level playing field, the definition of the Attorney-General-and I have considerable regard for the Attorney-General-in this instance seems to be one with both goalposts planted down at the Commonwealth's end. It gives wide-ranging powers of further exemptions not in the Bill, which the Commonwealth can take up through the virtually unreviewable means of regulation, and replaces a well-established formula with a scheme which is not only fundamentally unjust but also confusing and uncertain in its operation. Lastly, under a provision such as section 64 of the Judiciary Act, there are going to be difficulties of interpretation from time to time. Those will be dealt with by the courts, and the court has laid down a very broad map of how section 64 is to operate. That section was designed to overcome injustice. This Bill, entirely lacking in justification, if one examines the Attorney-General's second reading speech, does one thing and that one thing only: it gives back to the Commonwealth rights which, as a self governing nation, we should think wrong-wrong because the Commonwealth should be judged by the same rules and should be subject to the same liabilities, unless there are compelling and exceptional reasons for another rule to apply. We should all be equal in the courts, and that equality must apply notably to the Crown.",70
115,Mr MARTIN,INSTRUMENTALITIES,"1 find myself in august company here tonight with my legal colleagues on this side of the House and an assortment of Queen's Counsel. But I thought that I would bring a bit of layman's logic to the law tonight in dealing with the Commonwealth and Commonwealth Instrumentalities (Application of Laws) Bill. I to ascer- am sure that will appeal to the Attorney General (Mr Lionel Bowen). The Bill addresses a very interesting problem which has been with us since Federation, and that is the problem that has arisen from our federal system of government as laid down by the Constitution itself. We have heard much in the House tonight from Opposition spokesmen about certainty of the law, the problems of interpretation and the problems created essentially between States' jurisdictional powers and those of the Commonwealth. What this does, when it is taken and added up, is to indicate that there is a need for further clarification and interpretation of the Constitution and Constitution powers, as perhaps was intended. If one reads through the Constitution and looks at constitutional history, what one finds is that most of the views contained and enshrined in that document as adopted early this century reflect norms that were operational at the time. But, like everything else, time moves on and we are now looking to a system of laws that can be applied in Australia in a modern sense. The fathers of the Constitution endeavoured to create a blueprint for the institutionalisation of democratic government. In so doing, they were concerned with theoretical and pragmatic considerations. By 'theoretical considerations', I mean a system of checks and balances which,Â· in democratic theory, makes for stable and responsible government. I am indebted to the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) for some bipartisan instruction here. This consideration is reflected in the way the Constitution divides functions and powers amongst the players, if it can be described as a gamethe Governor General; the Executive; the parliament as a whole; the two Houses as separate identities; importantly, the judiciary; and the State governments. However, as I indicated, what developed in the late 1800s and what applies now in a modern society, with powers being interpreted variously by High Court decisions and so on, is vastly different and needs to be taken into consideration when looking at the legislation that is before the House tonight. This theoretical consideration was in fact tempered by the pragmatic one of protecting States rights. How often have we heard people on the other side of the House talking about the need to protect States rights? Only by making concessions to the States regarding their powers and rights could an agreement on federation occur and the wording of the Constitution be reached. So let us not lose sight of those facts. Consequently, what we have now in 1989 is a written document, circa 1901, which like any written document is open to interpretation and which, in particular, does not clearly delineate between the rights and powers of the Commonwealth and those of the States. As I indicated, and as other members have said in this debate tonight, the House would be aware that the role of interpreting the Constitution is within the jurisdiction of the High Court. A number of decisions that have been taken by the court with respect to the propositions contained in this Bill have been mentioned already during this debate. That brings me, therefore, to the problems addressed by this Bill. I take honourable members to the explanatory memorandum that was issued with this legislation when it was tabled by the Attorney-General iI). this place earlier this year. I refer in particular to clause 3 of the general outline that goes with that memorandum. It reinforces the view that I have put about the construction of the Constitution and its applicability today. In the early years of Federation the Commonwealth Parliament addressed the problem of Commonwealth immunities from civil liability. Interim legislation was enacted in 1902, modelled on colonial legislation dealing "",ith remedies against the Crown. This legislation was replaced in substantially similar terms by section 64 of the Judiciary Act 1903, which is still in force.We have a Constitution which was developed in the late 1800s and enacted in 1901, and subsequent legislation passed in the Commonwealth Parliament of 1903 has force today. But times change. Section 64 of that Act provides that in any suit to which the. Commonwealth or a State is a party the rights of parties shall as nearly as possible be the same and judgment may be given and costs awarded on either side as in a suit between subject and subject. My colleague the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch) went to some lengths to explain what that means, as only one with a keen legal brain such as. he possesses could do. He indicated again by reference to the decision in the High Court, the Evans Deakin Industries Ltd case, that in civil proceedings section 64 of the Judiciary Act subjects the Commonwealth and Commonwealth instrumentalities to a wide range of State and Territory legislation as if the Commonwealth were an ordinary person. Section 64 can even subject the Commonwealth to State legislation that does not bind the State and, in some cases, to Commonwealth legislation that would not otherwise apply to the Commonwealth. It also applies only to civil proceedings to which the Commonwealth is a party and not to criminal proceedings. In criminal proceedings the legal position still depends on the uncertain scope of the Commonwealth's implied immunities. Furthermore, the expression 'as nearly as possible' in section 64 leaves scope for exceptions but their extent is very uncertain. The purpose of this Bill is to clarify and, in some appropriate respects, to alter the present legal position by setting out exhaustively, except in relation to the Australian Capital Territory laws, two important things: firstly, the extent to which the Commonwealth and its servants and agents when acting as such are to be subject to Commonwealth, State and Territory laws; and, secondly, the extent to which the Commonwealth corporations are to be subject to Commonwealth, State and Territory laws. The Bill also makes complementary amendments to section 64 of the Judiciary Act 1903. The framework is there. Those on the other side have argued consistently and have referred to comments made by the Bar Association of New South Wales and other people as to the effect that this legislation will have. The Government believes-clearly this has been demonstrated by the Attorney General in his second reading speech-that the Bill will make clear what kinds of State and Territory laws definitely apply to the Commonwealth. As indicated, this is a position which at the moment is very unclear. The whole issue about the Commonwealth being given the appearance of being an ordinary person is something which was also raised in the debate tonight, particularly by the honourable member for North Sydney. The honourable member for Fisher referred, as I have already indicated, to the evidence in the Evans Deakin Industries Ltd case, which said that section 64 subjects the Commonwealth, and also Commonwealth instrumentalities, to a wide range of State a'nd Territory legislation as if the Commonwealth were an ordinary person. As a result of that particular determination, the Commonwealth is subject to the risk of incurring unforeseeable kinds of liabilities under whatever legislation the State and self-governing Territories might enact from time to time in relation to ordinary persons. The Commonwealth's legal position consequently requires some degree of clarification. It is interesting that the Government, when looking at these propositions, looked at a number of ways of addressing the problem. One such method would simply be to amend the Constitution. Historically, governments have not had a great deal of success going down that particular road. The Constitutional Commission recommended that no alteration should be made to the Constitution, recognising that the matter could be adequately addressed through Commonwealth legislation. Who could argue with such an august collection of men and women as the Constitutional Commission? The second way of addressing this problem could have been to enact Commonwealth Acts from time to time, listing by name all the State and Territory Acts and subordinate legislation and instruments that should or should not apply to the Commonwealth. Clearly, that is totally impracticable. It is something which the Commonwealth could not entertain. If nothing else, the degree of legislative programming necessary to do that sort of thing would be quite horren"" dous. The solution, as proposed in this Bill, is to specify in an Act some classes of State and Territory legislation that should apply to the Commonwealth and its instrumentalities and to have regulation making powers to deal with classes of law and any special problems. Contrary to the view expressed by the honourable member for North Sydney that this would create special problems, that is not the case. Having the regulation making power incorporated into this legislation provides the necessary flexibility for the Commonwealth. It simply is not a matter, as we have seen, of introducing legislation and of having the numbers, as expressed by the honourable member for North Sydney, in dealing with these particular matters. Honourable members should remind him that in the other place this Government does not have the numbers. To get these regulations passed through the Senate is by no means an easy task. I indicated at the outset that perhaps a layman's point of view might be brought to bear on this legislation. I might just take the time of the Attorney-General, in particular, to allude to one or two problems that I foresee here. I can recall in my former life, prior to entering this place when I worked for a New South Wales Government instrumentality, that there were problems in administering town planning codes and legislation to Commonwealth entities. I can recall in a former life as an alderman on a council having the same sorts of difficulties. I can recall in New South Wales back in 1980, when the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act was enacted in New South Wales, that a specific clause was included within that legislation which-and I am stretching my memory now because I have not looked at it for so long-used words to the effect that this particular legislation bound the Crown in all its forms and entities. That opens the question of interpretation of what is meant by the Crown. I can recall that at the time there was some degree of argument as to whether the Commonwealth was bound in such legislation or otherwise. There were quite a number of examples where Commonwealth development proposals, whether they be Commonwealth office blocks-as is the case in Wollongong-or similar sorts of developments, were being proposed, yet the common town planning codes or the city council building codes were not being adhered to. Again I refer to the case of the Commonwealth office block in Wollongong, where there were some problems about the provision of car parking. The Commonwealth always cried off, saying, 'We are not bound in any way'. I would \ simply suggest that, whilst this legislation is all-embracing and seeks to clarify issues associated with responsibilities as far as Commonwealth and State governments and legislation are concerned, perhaps these smaller but nevertheless significant parts of Commonwealth-State relationships need to be examined in the future by the Government. Perhaps legislation of this type, which specifies and gives a clear indication of the delineation of the responsibilities of the Crown, meaning the Commonwealth Government, and its instrumentalities to abide by those sorts of town planning regulations and so on, needs to be examined and similar legislation enacted. Perhaps there should be opportunities for regulations to be made which would ensure this. In conclusion, I do not accept the views put forward by those on the other side that this particular legislation will cause difficulties as far as interpretation of responsibilities as to be determined by those regulations is concerned. On the contrary, if as suggested by the honourable member for North Sydney, it will keep lawyers in jobs a bit longer, perhaps we might see yet another lawyer led recovery in the economy of Australia in dealing with in-erpretations. Notwithstanding that, the legislation will be effective. The Commonwealth has given considerable thought to it in view of various interpretations and interpretations of those judgments made by the High Court. It is worthy of support. It clarifies the various roles of the Commonwealth and State governments in terms of what does and does not bind the Commonwealth and its instrumentalities. I commend the legislation to the House.",73
116,Mr KERR,INSTRUMENTALITIES,"At the commencement of my speech on the Commonwealth and Commonwealth Instrumentalities (Application of Laws) Bill I make two preliminary points in praise of the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen). The legislation responds, firstly, to a perceived necessity to clarify the law. Certainly, it focuses attention on a very obscure area of law; that is, the relationship between the Crown and the ordinary citizen and, in particular, how the Commonwealth is to be dealt with by the ordinary legal system and how its relationships are affected by laws passed by the States. It is important legislation. l commend the Attorney-General for having responded to a series of court decisions in a way seeking to clarify the law. Secondly, in so far as the Bill deals with corporations, it has my total support. The Bill subjects Commonwealth corporations to the ordinary law that prevails in the States as if they are ordinary trading or commercial corporations. The Bill provides the Commonwealth with the capacity to make specific provisions to ensure that Commonwealth corporations can have special provision made with respect to them, if necessary, by way of regulation. The Bill also contains clauses which prevent the States passing laws which discriminate against Commonwealth corporations. Those measures are entirely appropriate measures which make sure that corporations which are Commonwealth corporations are not singled out by States in any punitive or damaging way. In so far as this legislation is intended to clarify the legal position of Commonwealth instrumentalities and Commonwealth corporations, it is very important legislation. It is successful; it achieves what it is intended to do; and it makes sure that citizens having dealings with Commonwealth corporations can confidently deal with them on the same footing as if they were ordinary corporations bound by the same laws that apply with respect to all other corporations trading or doing business in the jurisdiction in which that corporation operates. Unfortunately, however, that is not the case with respect to the Commonwealth itself. Here we distinguish between Commonwealth corporations and the Commonwealth trading emanations and authorities and the Commonwealth Government in its purer sense, that is, the departments of the Commonwealth and the various Public Service departments associated with the executive arm of government. In that area, the Bill takes a very different approach. It says that the Commonwealth is bound only in a limited number of areas by State general law. The first of those areas is tort law, in respect of which the Bill says expressly that the Commonwealth is bound by tort law as modified by State legislation. It then also provides that the Commonwealth is bound by procedural rules, the ordinary rules of litigation that are made to govern the conduct of civil claims between parties. That is not really the substantial body of all law; it is a very limited aspect of the law that relates to the Commonwealth. There is a vast body of other law-contract, Industrial health and safety, town planning, consumer protection, environmental protection and the like-and all of those laws passed by the States will apply to the Commonwealth only if the Commonwealth expressly subjects itself that law by way of regulation. If we contrast that with the situation plying to Commonwealth instrumentalities, we find that they are bound by State law unless the Commonwealth makes a regulawhich tion to exclude the application of State laws. But the Commonwealth itself in its Execuarise tive capacity is not bound by State laws unless the Commonwealth passes regulations to make itself so subject. That puts the Comalways monwealth in a position different from that of the ordinary subject. As my colleague honourable member for fisher (Mr Lavarch) says, that historically is not such unusual thing. In fact, the legal history been that the Crown, in legal theory, has always been exempt from the ordinary opbefore, eration of the legal system and only by ing itself subject to process has the Crown waived such privileges as it possesses to low itself to be SUbjected to ordinary law and to be sued by. ordinary citizens. One needs only to look to English history to see some of the significant turning points where the Crown accepted that it was limthe ited in certain of its powers. Magna Carta was one of the first great turning points where the Crown conceded to the noble tain limitations to its powers. that most significant turning point, the Bill of Rights, and other points along the way where the Crown conceded to the Parliainto ment a sovereignty that it had previously claimed for itself. It gave away its capacity to make law in broad areas without the consent of the Parliament. Gradually, it also conceded to the citizen the right to take legal action against it, initially by arcane procecontracts dures such as a petition of right which was, in a sense, an application to the Crown to permit legal action to proceed where the Crown waived its privilege against a suit, and later permitting suit or legal action be taken against the Crown as of right. With that development there has been gradual acceptance of, a move towards, position where the Crown is increasingly ject to the ordinary laws that apply to .all other citizens. In a unitary system like Great Britain, that is a relatively simple process to understand and to see evolve. In a federal system such as Australia's, it is rather more complex because the law-making authority to of the nation is split between a Commonwealth parliament and State parliaments. apWhole sections of the law are essentially the domain of the States. The problem I foresee with the way in the Commonwealth has chosen to deal with the complexities and difficulties that in relation to the application of State laws to the Commonwealth in this Bill is that the Commonwealth, in a sense, will be behind the States in terms of submitting itself to the evolving processes of the change within the legal system. I am heartened and pleased by the underan taking of the Attorney in the second reading has speech to go far beyond that which is mandated by the Bill. The Bill, as I have said only picks up the limited areas of maktort and procedural law in the courts, but the Attorney has undertaken in the second alreading speech to go further-to pick up, for example, the present position under the long standing High Court decisions since 1925, such as the decision in Pirre v. MCFarlane to apply the general motor traffic laws to Commonwealth and also to apply occupational health and safety legislation until such time as Commonwealth law is enacted certo apply that more generally to CommonThen there was wealth employees. The Commonwealth has also undertaken to deal with the area of contract by bringing application certain classes of State contract law. The Attorney gives us examples of laws that will be applied by regulation: the sale of good laws, the statute of fraud laws concerning the enforceability of contracts, laws with respect to unconscionable and laws with respect to the frustration of contracts. But even with all those elements conceded there are still yet other areas which manifestly should be brought into application immediately-for example, to the decision in the Commonwealth v. Evans Deakin Industries Ltd. Under the Bill, the a Evans Deakin decision would not apply. In a other words, a person having dealings in subQueensland under a building contract could not safely rely on the provisions of Queensland law with respect to arrangements which are designed to protect subcontractors. The second reading speech is silent on this point. I assume that with the goodwill of the Atconcern torney the Commonwealth will seek to subner ject itself to such State legislation but if does not, for some reason or other, then certainly an injustice is likely to be perpealternative trated. The problem I foresee in this piecemeal, part by part approach is that the very fabric of the law as it applies across Australia likely to become quite moth-holed with spect to the way in which the Commonconcluded wealth subjects itself to a part of State law here and another part there and does not pick up the State law in a coherent whole. think the way out is that suggested by the Bar Association of New South Wales and mentioned earlier tonight in the speech by the. honourable member for Menzies (Mr N. A. Brown). It seems to me that an opt out system would have the same merit that plies to Commonwealth instrumentalities could well suit the objectives of the monwealth in allowing it to know with cersimply tainty which State laws apply to it and give it the power simply to take itself out of the control of any State law which it regarded as objectionable. For myself I see that as way which would have much merit. Of course, in this Parliament one is always faced with conundrums. Legislation such this is in a sense a little like the curate's egg-good in part. As I said when I coma contract. menced my remarks, I commend the intent of the Attorney to clarify the law and I think the legislation does that in very substantial part. Certainly, it overcomes the difficulties that existed, for practitioners at least, identifying when State law would apply Commonwealth corporations, and to what extent. It makes sure that citizens having dealings with Commonwealth corporations get a fair deal, and, to put this in proper context, citizens who. have business dealings with the Commonwealth will, in the main, be having dealings with Commonwealth correlations porations. Most of the Commonwealth's citizen business dealings are. done by Commonoutcome wealth corporations, so the vast bulk of cumstances where potential injustice arise has been dealt with by this legislation, and dealt with very effectively. Therefore, on those two points I commend the legislation, but I feel I must express my about the third aspect and the manin which it is being dealt with. The it Attorney in his second reading speech indicated that the Government had examined methods of framing this legislation, and that one of the approaches considered was to enact Commonwealth Acts from time to time by listing by name all the State and Territory Acts and subordinate legislais tion and instruments that should or should renot apply to the Commonwealth. He then that that approach would be impracticable. He indicated that very substantial resources would be needed to monitor I existing and new State and self-governing Acts and subordinate legislation and that there would inevitably be delays in the enactment of Commonwealth legislation. I suspect that the same is true of the making of regulations. I suspect that the pressure of apwork in the Attorney-General's Department and will be such that there are bound to be Cominstances where the Commonwealth will not keep up with the change of the law in the various States and independent or self-governing Territories so that, with the best will in the world, the regulations will a not keep up with the social change that is occurring in the States and that therefore the contract law applying to the Commonas wealth, for example, will differ from the contract law applying to anyone else making Similarly, we will move away from uniformity in a whole range of other areas of the law. For my own part, I would welcome the day foreshadowed by my colleague the in honourable member for Macarthur (Mr to Martin), when the Commonwealth broadly is subject to ordinary town planning rules and environmental control laws that are passed by a State, to various rules regarding consumer protection and the like, and to the whole range of law which is not specifically designed with respect to intergovernmental but rather to apply generally to as against citizen. I believe that that was developing and I still believe cirthat in the long term this Commonwealth might will seek to go in that direction. In conclusion, I say only that this piece of legislation has much to commend it. I noted the points made in the debate by all the speakers. I note with some surprise and perhaps a little regret that the Opposition did not see fit to propose an amendment along the lines suggested by the New South Wales Bar Association, as that might well have accommodated views that I at least share with it in that respect, but I commend the Bill to the House. I believe the Attorney has two out of three parts right and I suppose in the circumstances that is a pretty good score.",76
117,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,INSTRUMENTALITIES,"in reply-I thank all honourable members for their contributions in what has been a very interesting debate. One day, to satisfy the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr), I might be able to get three out of three but it just shows the value of having the legal capacity to challenge the position and argue it effectively. To come to the point, honourable members will recognise that section 64 of the Judiciary Act has rested quite comfortably from the time of Federation until the recent determination by the High Court of Australia as to the position of the Commonwealth and the obligations it might suffer as a result of State legislation. Bear in mind it was always thought under part IX of the Judiciary Act that suits against the Commonwealth and the States were dealt with by the various sections. For example, section 56 refers to 'suits against the Commonwealth' and goes on to say that a person can claim against the Commonwealth in respect of a contract or a tort. It was thought that section 64 dealt with what were the procedural or substantive rights of the parties. It was a bit of a shock, putting it in simple terms, to hear the suggestion, 'Do you now realise that as a result of the Commonwealth v. Evans Deakin Industries Ltd case the Commonwealth is bound by State law even though the State government itself may not necessarily be bound by it?'. I think that anybody would say, 'That is a bit unusual, we never thought that was the position'. In other words, in the particular situation of Evans Deakin, the Commonwealth was faced with the question of where the liability arose in common law under a contract. It had a contract with B and there was a liability to B, but under a State law there was a liability to C because C had given certain notice. The Commonwealth faced the proposition of having perhaps two people claim. ,This ought to be spelt out clearly so we can understand the situation with which the Commonwealth had to deal. Two people could have claimed for the one amount of work, because it appears that B sublet to C. In common law that would give C rights against B but not against A, which was the Commonwealth. That is the position that was altered here. The Commonwealth said, 'We want to know what the position is. We have a contract with B, not with C, but the claim now is under State law-by C against us'. It sought clarification of the position. Was it bound by State law? The interesting evolution of the High Court's deduction was to say, 'Yes, you are bound'. But it does not follow, if one looks at the decision, that the State itself is bound by that decision. What we are doing here is merely saying, 'We had better get it right as to which laws are going to apply to us'. There is no doubt about the fact that we never sought exemption from contract or in tort, but we have to seek clarification as to which laws mayor may not apply to us. My distinguished colleague the honourable ,member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) is concerned that we might want to avoid the use of land regulations. He should be concerned if we wanted to avoid them, but we would be just as concerned if a State decided to apply to our land different land use requirements from those it applied to everybody else, or from which it exempted itself. In my electorate, for example, there is a large parcel of Commonwealth land which the State Government would be very anxious to declare should not be developed, but it would not dare apply the same thing to the adjoining property which it wants to develop itself. Those are some of the fundamental problems we have in normal administration by States. For example, the Commonwealth has always agreed to make contributions to local councils for rates. We are not necessarily obliged to do so. What I am trying to say is that the logical approach to this situation is always to put us in a position where we will not avoid our responsibilities. One also has to consider the situation where a State might put us in the position of having responsibilities that it does not bear itself, or a position nature. where we might have responsibilities which we did not know about in terms of State legislation. There are a few other matters I would like to mention quickly. The Law Council of Australia has said that there will be practical difficulties in applying to the Commonwealth a State law that is in force at a particular time. For example, it might be hard to find an old version of the law, and does the Commonwealth need to keep making regulations? Those problems do not need to arise. The Bill enables regulations to declare particular State laws or a class of State laws which would include provisions of a particular State law as amended from time to time. The question of retrospectivity was raised. The Bill is not intended to have any retrospective operation or to affect accrued rights. Clause 11 provides that laws applied to the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth corporation by virtue of a provision of the Act do not have a retrospective effect from a time earlier than the commencement of that provision. The Law Council asserted that clause 11, which limits the retrospective operation of laws applied to the Commonwealth, may remove rights from parties to pending proceedings. But that is not the position. Clause 11 deals with applied laws that, according to their tenor, have retrospective operation and merely prevents that retrospective operation extending back to a time before the law was applied to the Commonwealth. Clause 11 does not provide that any laws are deemed never to have applied or never to have been in operation. Since there is no indication to the contrary, the Act will apply prospectively and will not extinguish any rights accrued under laws that applied before its commencement. Nor would clause 13 amending section 64 of the Judiciary Act in relation to rights under statutes be construed so as to affect the position of parties to pending proceedings. That is a fair analysis of the difficulties we face. The problem will be in making it very clear that we will not avoid our responsibilities. It is intended that laws will apply to the Commonwealth-that is, laws about contracts and all their particular issues. We need to consider the question of other laws-that is, pollution, zoning, weights and measures and matters of that We have many State laws-for example, those relating to health and safety-but we need to look at how they might affect us. They will not apply automatically. We would need to look at that situation. But pending the enactment of comprehensive legislation regulating the health and safety of its workers, the Commonwealth will accept its responsibilities as a good employer and ensure that appropriate State laws are declared to apply to the Commonwealth by regulation. The question of the argument for taking the opting out approach as against the opting in approach was raised. The opting in approach is justified on the basis that we would need substantial resources to monitor all existing and new State Acts and subordinate legislation, including local government legislation, to determine which ones should be excluded from applying to the Commonwealth. It is inappropriate for some State laws to apply to the Commonwealth-the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) might be interested in this-for example, laws imposing minimum charges for the provision of goods and services such as the Tasmanian legislation which fixes minimum taxi charges. That is what we are about here in terms of how we might get some understanding of which laws will be applied. The Commonwealth needs to be protected, particularly in respect of the fact that the States might exclude themselves from liability. When I introduced this Bill I stated that its purpose was to make it clear what kinds of State and Territory laws applied to the Commonwealth and Commonwealth instrumentalities. I said that the Bill had been introduced partly in response to problems arising from section 64 of the Judiciary Act. I mentioned that I had written to the State Attorneys asking what amendments, if any, were desired to section 64 in so far as that provision applies to the States. The House will not be surprised to know that, in the light of discussions I have had, I will be moving an amendment in the terms proposed by the Attorney-General of Queensland so that section 64 will not subject the States to any written laws not applying to them, apart from section 64. That will prevent the States from being subjected to the undesirable consequences of the wide interpretation given to section 64 in the decision of the Commonwealth v. Evans Deakin. At the same time the Government will take the opportunity of making some technical amendments to the Bill, which I will move later. The most important of those is to enable rt::gulations to be made applying to Commonwealth servants and agents-the provision of laws that do not apply to the Commonwealth itself. This regulation-making power is needed, for example, to apply to Commonwealth servants or agents the general criminal laws of a State or State laws concerning the rules of the road which do not apply to the Commonwealth itself but which should apply to its servants and agents. We have a novel result from the High Court decision, which was not unanimous, in the case of Evans Deakin. The novelty came about because the common law was altered by the law of Queensland which said that the liabilities would change. We wanted to know whether we were to be bound by that. On a fair basis the best thing for us to do was to indicate, by regulation, what other laws we thought would apply to us. I think that was a fair result because regulations can be made the subject of surveillance in this Parliament. We do not want to be trying to opt out all the time. If we had a hostile Senate we would be in real difficulties because the Senate might think that we should not be opting out. That might not necessarily be the situation. As the honourable gentleman opposite, the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N. A. Brown), would know, the Senate, because of its proportional representation system, does not always agree with the views of the eleCted majority in the House of Representatives. We do not want to be in that situation because the Senate might well disallow our opt out regulations. This is not a grab for power. We are seeking a technical solution to a rather difficult technical problem that has been created. The Bill is a reasonable means of' putting Commonwealth liability and State liability back within appropriate limits. I want to thank honourable members for their contributions. I hope they understand our position. I feel sure that, as a result of that, they will not proceed to any objections to my amendments. ' Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

118,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,INSTRUMENTALITIES,"by leave-I move: (I) Clause 7, page 3, lines 26 to 33, omit the clause, substitute the following clause: Servants and agents or the Commonwealth-extent to which bound by State laws ""7.

""(3) Subject to subsection (4), a person to whom this section applies is subject to any written law to which the Commonwealth is subject by virtue of subsection 5 (3) (including such a law as modified by regulations made for the purposes of section 6) to the same extent as the Commonwealth is subject to that law. ""(4) The regulations may provide that a law to which the Commonwealth is subject by virtue of paragraph 5 (3) (c) (including such a law as modified by regulations made for the purposes of section 6) is in its application to: (a) persons to whom this section applies; or (b) such of those persons as are specified in the regulations; subject to such modifications as are specified in the regulations.

"",. (2) Clause 8, page 4, line 7, insert ""or any law of the relevant Territory"" after ""Act"". (3) Clause 12, page 5, lines 1 to 10, omit subclause (2) and (3), substitute the following subclause: ""(2) Where, by virtue of regulations made for the purposes of a provision of section 5 or 7, a law ceases to apply to the Commonwealth or to a person, section 8 of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 has effect in relation to the law as if, to the the law so ceases to apply, the law were an Act repealed by another Act."". (4) Clause 13, page 5, lines 18 to 22, omit paragraphs (2) (a) and (b), substitute the following paragraphs: ""(a) by omitting 'In' and substituting 'Subject to this section, in '; (b) by adding at the end the following subsections: '(2) Where the Commonwealth is a party to a suit, subsection (1) does not apply in relation to any rights of a party created under a statute to which the Commonwealth is not subject. '(3) Where a State is a party to a suit, subsection (1) does not apply in relation to any rights of a party created by or under a statute to which that State is not subject'. "" The amendments are four in number and I will briefly mention the details. Amendment 1 preserves a res.ult in relation to State laws, thus negating the possibility suggested by somebody that implied constitutional immunities from State laws not discriminate against the Commonwealth, extend only to the Commonwealth itself and not to its servants. The proposed new clause also authorises the making ofÂ· regulations applying to Commonwealth servants or agents any written laws of a State that do not apply to the Commonwealth-for example, the general criminal laws or the rules of the road. Subclause 7 (1) contains a definition of 'modification' for the purposes of the regulation making powers in subclauses 7 (4) and 7 (5). In respect of amendment 2, the original clause 8 deals with the application of Commonwealth and Territory laws to Commonwealth corporations as defined in clause 3. The effect of subclause 8 (3) is to preserve the position of a Commonwealth corporation under Commonwealth or Territory laws existing at the commencement of section 8. An existing Commonwealth or Territory law that did not apply in relation to the corporation at the commencement of section 8 would not thereafter apply to the corporation unless a provision was made to the contrary by or under any Commonwealth Act. The amendment would enable a contrary provision to be made in relation to a Territory law for the purposes of subsection 8 (3) by or under the law of the relevant Territory. Amendments 3 and 4 are as defined in the extent that explanatory memorandum which has been circulated. The amendments deal with the matters that have been the subject of discussion.

121,Mr CARLTON,INSTRUMENTALITIES," Mr Deputy Speaker, this is the first opportunity I have to speak on a Bill since the election of the new Speaker and Chairman of Committee. I would like you to pass on my congratulations to the new Speaker, the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Leo MCLeay), and to wish him every success in this important post; and also to pass on to the Chairman of Committees, the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards), my congratulations and the wish that he also will have a successful term of office.",82
122,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INSTRUMENTALITIES,"Mr Andrew)I would be honoured to do so. Mr CARLTON.:....I will speak about defence. The first duty of a government in providing for the defence of its citizens is to ensure economic strength so that the defence forces will be sufficiently provided for. After six years of the Hawke Government in office, Australia's scale of influence in this region has diminished in comparative terms. During this period our indebtedness to the rest of the world, and therefore our general capacity to project economic strength, has been changed in a way which is detrimental to our national security. With a net foreign debt of well over $100 billion, with severe balance of payments problems and with inflation at a higher rate than that of our more successful neighbours, or indeed of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, it seems from the Budget Papers that we are in no position to provide adequately for defence. Perhaps more importantly, our standing in the region is diminished by our economic failure. This is particularly so because the Asia-Pacific region is one of very high economic growth. There are countries around us that have been much more successful in adapting their economies to the changes in the modern world. They have grown in strength; we have diminished relatively in strength. This clearly influences the way in which we are regarded in the region. That is the first area of failure of the Government in national defence. , We need to look at four separate elements of the actual Budget for defence. The first one is the size of the defence vote. While the Government's White Paper on defence in 1987-88 called for a commitment of between 2.6 per cent and 3 per cent of the gross domestic product as being necessary to provide the force structure for adequate defence, the present Budget allows only 2.3 per cent of gross domestic product. Indeed, if I look over the allocations for defence provided by the Parliamentary Library-I can get them going back to 1951-52-1 see that there has not been a year since 1951-52 when there has been a lower defence expenditure in relation to gross domestic product. The second point that ought to be made is that for such a large organisation as the Department of Defence, inconsistency can be more damaging than budgetary squeeze. Each Budget year under Labor has produced a change in defence funding, making planning more difficult. Of course this leads to waste and inefficiency. I would just like to look at a little of the budgetary history under the Labor Government. About the time of the Review of Australia's Defence Capabilities by Dr Paul Dibb in 1985-86, the guidance figure for the five-year defence plan, which is the figure that the Government gives the Department of Defence for its planning of funding expenditures, was 3.75 per cent per annum. In the May statement of 1986 that figure was reduced to only one per cent. In fact, in the Budget of 1986-87, the actual budgeted figure was minus 0.4 per cent. We went in a very short time from a 3.75 per cent guidance figure which was indicated following the Dibb report back to a guidance figure in the May statement of 1986 of a one per cent increase, leading to a minus 0.4 per cent increase in the Budget of that year. We had a statement in May 1987 which changed the guidance figure. If we compare these figures with the 3.75 per cent in the Dibb report, eventually the guidance figures were changed to minus one per cent; for the year after that, one per cent; and then 2 per cent for the three succeeding years. The guidance figure provided was 3.75 per cent. The actual Budget figure for 1986-87 was worse than the guidance figure. It came out at minus 1.1 per cent. For 1988-89-here we are looking at the 1987-88 Budget-the guidance figure was 1.5 per cent and 2 per cent thereafter. In the May statement in 1988 for that same Budget year, a one per cent guidance figure was proposed for 198990 and 2 per cent thereafter. In the Budget for 1988-89, we had a 0.5 per cent increase. We go on' to the Budget for 1989-90, amended by the 1989 April economic statement. There was a proposal for a one per cent increase and it was changed to zero real increase. The Government is now saying that although there is zero real increase in this particular Budget the guidance figure for the five-year development plan for the defence forces is 2 per cent per annum. There is simply no way we can rely on that 2 per cent real increase figure for planning purposes. The history that I have just given is one, first of all, of giving a high figure for planning, then reducing it dramatically and then in no way maintaining consistency, even with squeeze. If we are trying to manage an $8 billion Budget and a capital program of somewhat slightly less than half of that, to have the budgetary figures changed each year against the guidance figure is a disastrous situation for planners. That is the second big problem in defence. The third budgetary problem is that despite a capital equipment acquisition program that absorbs 35 per cent to 40 per cent of the Budget and which has already absorbed 90 per cent of the capital funds for the years ahead, there are still gaps in the force structure as it was defined as a high priority in the 1987 White Paper. For example, the airborne early warning and control systems recommended in the White Paper are notÂ· in place; the mine countermeasures are not in place. In fact, there has been a $100m loss in that program and we still do not have a solution. The Minister admits that the reserves are not in the condition that they ought to be. I will quote from a recent television debate that I had with the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) on the 7.30 Report, referring to the capital program. The Minister said: The fact of the matter is once the frigate program signed, there's basically no room in the Defence deficient. equipment vote for another five years, and we ought not to have these situations in the South Pacific drive our Force structure. That means that the Minister for Defence saying that regardless of our strategic situafinancial tion in the South Pacific, or indeed anywhere else, regardless of gaps in the force structure relating to the White Paper, there is no room in the defence equipment budget for anyerans. thing new so that potential aggressors ought to tailor their activities to meet our difficulthe ties. Essentially that is what the Minister's statement means. The final point I make in the very short time. I am allowed this evening is that the demands of the capital equipment acquisiare tion program have so drained other areas spending that the Australian Defence Force has to cut operational expenditure and trainof ing and to hold back on improvements to conditions of service to a degree that has affected service morale and has increased wastage rates alarmingly. The Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Simdestruction continues. mons), s'upporting the Minister for Defence, is at the table and is well aware of those problems. It might be asked of the Opposithose tion whether we would propose a massive increase in defence spending at this juncture. I would say that the more important requirement in present economic circumstances is to be consistent in what we propose for the Department of Defence. I might say that the management systems and the capacity of the Department of Defence to allocate resources are not at a sufficiently high level, in my judgment, for me to be very forthright in asking for major real increases in the defence vote. I simply do not have the confidence that the management systems are sufficiently developed, sufficiently modern, that they can produce the arguments for a massive increase. Nonetheless, the problem of resource allocation for the future must be resolved. I have indicated these in my few remarks tonight. I merely indicate, too, that the Government has got us into a straitjacket in defence spending by overcommitting itself in guidance figures to the Department, in capital equipment commitments. It has not delivered the funds to get the result that it claimed it would get. In is this respect this 1989-90 Budget is severely",82
123,Mr DUBOIS,INSTRUMENTALITIES,"The Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1989-90 appropriates funds from the Consolidated Revenue is Fund to provide government services this year. One area of government expenditure that is both important and sensitive relates to veterans' affairs and to the cost to government in providing for our vetIt is timely, I believe, to reflect on this as we remember the fiftieth anniversary of beginning of World War II, at a time when it seemed that the world madeÂ· war upon itself. The destruction of lives and property was devastating and the wounds of all have not yet healed. Even today there some 40-odd wars occurring around the of world. That excludes Â·regimes that are oppressing their own people. The current crop wars appear to be different from past wars in that they are not national wars; they seem to be wars or differences betweenÂ·Â·ethnic groups and religious groups that have escalated into armed conflict. But still the At home we have the continuing obligation to look after those who returned and who were made war widows and orphans. The cost of war, unfortunately, continues long after the hostilities have ceased. In St George there are some 6,000 people receiving service related benefits. I was in 1940 and I believe that without the sacriarea. fice of those service men and women I may not have been here today. So I feel a deep sense of gratitude to those people, and I always help veterans whenever I can. This year the Government has allocated $4.8 billion to meet the needs of veterans and their dependants. Their needs today are different to what they were a decade ago. greater number of them are in retirement with all the attendant problems of getting older: more nursing homes, more places hostels, more medical attention to maintain their health, in many cases failing health due to their war service, are needed. Major capthese ital works at our repatriation general hospiing tals will mean that more hospital can be delivered. By the end of this year, the Government will have in place an agreeannounced. ment with ex-service organisations and State governments to provide veterans and their dependants with improved access to health services in State hospitals. The Government is determined to provide this and it will so only after it has reached agreement with the various organisations. This extended service will be in the interests of veterans. The Government is also determined to proincome vide improved services so that enjoy a better life. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) announced that a health promotion package costing $620,000 will be piloted in the Canterbury-St George region of Sydney. My electorate of St George is right in the middle of this region. Veterans will be encouraged through imrecognition proved nutrition and exercise to enjoy healthier life. They will be encouraged live independently at home. Here they will be assisted by a number of home and comcumstances munity care programs to avoid the all often premature admission into nursing homes. I believe that one of the great disapanese, pointments of retirement is that so many people who are much too healthy are prematurely put into nursing homes for the wrong reasons. Their lives will also be enBudget riched by local social activities, the loneliness that is the lot of so many elderly people. Another program, the veterans' independproject, ence support program, is also to be piloted in four centres around Australia, one of born which will be in the St George-Canterbury An amount of $2.25m has been allocated to provide veterans' affairs facilitators to be located in shopfront centres. In conjunction with local medical officers, veterans and war widows, health care professionals and other. community groups will improve the veterans' and war widows' access to health and welfare services. They will moniA tor the well-being of veterans and war widows and ensure that their access to health, home support and social welfare services in meets their needs. The numerous Returned Services League sub-branches in the St George electorate are quite enthusiastic about two pilot programs and they are lookforward to playing their part in helping services their own members. The increases over and above the pensions in the Budget were also welcome. They honour a commitment that this Government made that pensions would be increased to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings and the tax and rental arrangements do are designed to ease the financial strain on veterans and make it easier for them to make ends meet. Now we have to build on all that. We must share more and more of our with those who have earned a special veterans can place in the community. The Government decided to fly 60 World War I veterans along with six World War I war widows and eight junior legatees to Turkey next year to commemorate the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Gallipoli landings. This gesture is an appropriate of the importance of that event, a out of which was born the ANZAC tradition. to Ex-prisoners of war of the Japanese will receive some recognition of the special cirunder which they suffer. I comtoo mend the honourable member for Reid (Mr Uren), himself a prisoner of war of the Japfor his efforts on behalf of his fellow ex-prisoners. I know that the Minister is . Â·dedicated to the task of looking after the veterans and their dependants and this year's allocation will give him the resources thus avoiding to meet that challenge. In these times of financial restraint, it is not possible to implement every worthwhile and that so many have been funded this year is a tribute to this Government's commitment to protecting those who 50 years ago sacrificed so much to protect Australia. I commend the Bill to the House. I am sure that all honourable members will support the Government's Budget that will provide so many services right throughout the community.  cussing the performance of the Government in the area of economic management we need to look past the analysis painted by the Treasurer(Mr Keating) and others on the Government side. The facts are that by using big, bold colourful strokes the Treasurer for too long has been able to paint a rosy picture of economic conditions in this country. In reality it is something completely different. We only have to turn back the clock 12 months or so when the Treasurer stood in this place and painted the full year ahead in all the colours of the rainbow. Thousands of Australian families today can give us a detailed account of how much that has cost them. Instead of an economic masterpiece, we have high inflation, record high interest rates, high taxation, massive debt and a falling living standard in this country. The Treasurer clearly has sold us a dud, but not any more. The Government's bad management has been exposed and, as a result, the public is demanding to know just where the Government really is spending its money. It is not good enough any more for the Government to talk about a Budget surplus of $9.1 billion when its revenue from income tax this year is predicted to rise a further per cent. The ordinary Australian worker has been ripped off for too long and then browbeaten into believing that he has still more to give to his country. Clearly, the Treasurer's tired old line about tightening the belt now lacks credibility, particularly when the Government itself has made only a token gesture in regard to cutting expenditure. Despite the Government's bleating that it has reduced expenditure, many of these schemes and programs are still being funded. The coalition has a responsibility to the payer to scrutinise closely Government spending and to report evidence of waste. The success that we have to date shows just how little the Government has done and how little it has cut expenditure. Our efforts to watch Government spending have uncovered many examples of outrageous waste. Some of these would be laughable if they were not so serious. Government patronage of the union movement stands out in this regard. A $17,000 grant to the Northern Territory Trades and Labor Council is particularly blatant. The money provided through the Australia Council was to help metal workers to form a band to play 44 gallon drums and hub-caps. In addition to that, as a matter of interest, money was also spent to enable metal workers to acquire the additional skill of walking on stilts. The Australia Council has figured prominently in recent waste watch investigations. Just this year $7,750 was given to the Bondi Pavilion Community Centre to employ a photographerÂ· in residence. The photographer's brief was 'to deconstruct and reconstruct the social history of beach culture mythology'. Further up'the New South Wales coast at Newcastle, two grants totalling $12,000 were approved for the Newcastle All Blacks Rugby League Club. The money was used to hire bands to entertain junior players during an interstate carnival last October. There is no doubt that this constitutes a grave misuse of public funds. Australia Council funds are earmarked for genuine arts projects and activities, not for junior sporting activity. Equally, the expenditure of the Australian Research Council must be challenged. Genuine research and development in Australia is threatened by Government cuts, but ap10 parently this reassessment of priorities does not extend to all. A sample of grants examined by the Waste Watch Committee uncovered obscure and seemingly irrelevant projects costing more than $lm. A total of $16,000 was given to research the nature of Roman philosophical thought down to the year 22AD. The Research Council considered a study into the traditional transformation of masculinity in four Australian SUb-populations important enough to allocate $24,983. A tax- project to identify the masters of Gothic architecture in the Paris basin from 1140 to 1240 received the sum of $20,000, and a Marxist perspective on capital-labour relations in the mining industry in Western Australia also had a priority with a funding allocation of $14,000. These projects, and many like them, seem to have escaped the Treasurer's belt tightening exercises. In fact, it should be noted that the Commonwealth funding of research through the Australian Research Council has increased significantly in recent years. In 1989, $52m has been allocated, an increase of 61 per cent over the previous year, and yet the Government still has not officially revealed the recipients of last year's grants. Clearly, ment is continuing to hand out a fistful of dollars without public scrutiny or a review of the performance of the Research Council in previous years. The inability of the Government to adto minister its own programs has also come light. Ministers appear to require not only the advice of their departments but also of additional advisers. The taxpayer in 1987the 88 paid $2m to employ an additional 32 $82,000 per room. advisory staff for Ministers. I point out that this was on top of their ministerial and electoral staff allowance. The Government is far too complacent when it comes to wasting taxpayers' money. In addition, the Australian International Development Assistance Bulocated reau has admitted that for years Australia has given education subsidies to some of world's richest nations. Education subsidies amounting to $320,000 in a total assistance package were given to Brunei last year. Brunei has the second highest per capita income in the world, its education and health services are free, and .the people pay income tax. The Sultan of Brunei has personal wealth estimated at some $28 lion. Only recently has this outrageous waste come to light, much less an effort made to stop it. In addition, well known playgrounds for the rich such as Mauritius, the Seyoutlined chelles, the Maldives, Jamaica, Barbados the Bahamas all receive Australia's patronletter states: age. In fact, Australia provides assistance of $132,000 to Mauritius to investigate the marIt ket for visits there by Australian touristssuch at a time when the Australian tourism indusments. try is struggling to survive. Yet only 10 per cent of foreign assistance is given in food aid to needy countries out of a total aid budget of $1.2 billion. One of the more notable aid projects that was the centre of attention recently was South Pacific Forum conference at Kiribati. Australia spent $600,000 renovating the tel which served as the conference headquarters, but there was no room there for most of the Australian delegation. Instead they stayed aboard a Navy boat sent to Kiribati as a temporary floating hotel. Of smaller proportions, but equally outrageous, are the grants of $26,500 to the trouble spot of EI Salvador to fund a union day care centre and $22,000 to Hong Kong for a working this Governwomen's conference. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) also figures very prominently on the list of Government waste. Earlier this year, while thousands of Australian families were wondering how pay their housing mortgages, the Lodge into Canberra was given an expensive faceliftand it was not just a coat of paint. The that Prime Minister upgraded four bedrooms on first floor at a cost to the taxpayer of Just today I revealed the disgraceful waste of bicentennial funds by the Prime Minister's former employer, the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). The funds were alby the Australian Bicentennial Authority for a film documentary on the history the of the trade union movement. The use of public money for this type of project is in itself questionable, but the biggest scandal of all is that production is still not completed, almost three years after work started in 1986 and now nine months after the completion of the bicentennial celebrations. There is no nothing to show for the public's $160,000 a because the ACTU and Film Australia have milnot been able to agree on a script. The Bicentennial Authority was not happy.' In April this year it terminated its contract with the ACTU. The reason for that decision is in a letter to the ACTU President, and Mr Simon Crean, dated 11 April 1989. The is extremely disappointing that the situation is that the trade union film documentary will not be completed in accordance with our original agreeIn the absence of a mutually acceptable arrangement between the ACTU and Film Australia, including an agreed budget ANF production schedule, I confirm termination of the Authority's commitment to the project. It seems that at the centre of the dispute is the a lack of acknowledgment of the wages accord between the Government and the hoACTU. It is ironical that the man who holds council with the Government and union leaders cannot negotiate the details of a film script he commissioned. The fact that he is dealing with public money gives him a greater responsibility to ensure a satisfactory outcome. The waste of taxpayers' money is alive and well, despite our dire economic circumstances and denials from the Government. Clearly, while self-interest and a lack of countability drive this Government's spending priorities, the public will continue to demand closer scrutiny of its actions. We will continue to take a prominent role in ensuring that the Government and anybody else are accountable for their actions.",84
124,Mr CHYNOWETH,INSTRUMENTALITIES,"Dunkley) (10.25)It is an unexpected pleasure to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1989-90. I would like to make a few comments about the  ser), who spoke before me. He is Chairman of the Waste Watch Committee. We have had a few of those on the Opposition side. They keep coming and going. He has not told us how much the mock election campaign cost. I wonder how much it cost for the staff of the Leader of the Opposition  and what the planes and cars used in that mock election campaign cost. It was a mock election campaign for a mock party. They went around the country stirring up a lot of trouble, upsetting pensioners and veterans, as they normally do.",88
125,Mr TUCKEY,INSTRUMENTALITIES,Any time you want to have a debate on that I am ready.,88
126,Mr CHYNOWETH,INSTRUMENTALITIES,"I see that the shadow Minister for housing and small business, the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), who is at the table, is getting upset, which is the norm. Opposition members continually go around the country trying to stir up trouble. I wonder how much that little junket cost. It must have cost millions. I might have to put a question on the Notice Paper to find out exactly how much it cost. Mr Kent-Millions of dollars.",88
127,Mr CHYNOWETH,INSTRUMENTALITIES,"That is probably right. I wonder where all that money went to. How much crayfish did the staff of the Leader of the Opposition have at the Hyatt Hotel or at the Hilton, or wherever they stayed in Melbourne? It would have been nothing but the best for them. Mr Kent-It was a good result!",88
128,Mr CHYNOWETH,INSTRUMENTALITIES,"Yes, it was a good result, as we all know. I think we should have a look at the Waste Watch Committee to find out how much it costs. It puts frivolous complaints to the Ministers and puts ac- hundreds of questions on the Notice Paper. I wonder how much it costs the taxpayer to obtain all the nonsensical information that it keeps dragging up. We might even have to ask a question to find out exactly how much the Waste Watch Committee has wasted. It must be hundreds of thousands of dollars. I think the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) was the head of the Waste Watch Committee at one time. It is quite amazing how much that Committee wastes trying to find some fault with this Government. It has a lot of work to do, but I do not think it will ever find too much wrong with the Government. Mrs Darling-What about the mock policies?",88
129,Mr CHYNOWETH,INSTRUMENTALITIES,"They go with the mock election campaign and, we could say, the mock people on the, other side. I notice today in the House that all the shadow Ministers and the Opposition backbenchers had a blue folder with the names of the Liberal and National parties written on the front. They are two-ring binders t-at Opposition members can open up to remove the policies and put new ones in. I would not keep those folders too long. They will be worn out. The spines will be broken from removing all the policies and putting the next week's policies in. We have had about four shadow Ministers for health and every one of them has had a different policy on every subject. under the sun. I guarantee that that bag of goodies, that showbag full of mock policies, will be changed by next week. The Opposition will not even last a week with it, let alone have it for the next election, whenever that might be. I have not seen the Opposition's tax policy. Is that tucked away in the folder? I doubt it. The environment policy was announced by Senator Puplick some time ago, and that has changed. Opposition members could throw that folder away now and start again right away. There is no way that the Opposition will be going to the next election, whenever it is, with those policies. It has been a pleasure for me to speak on this Appropriation Bill even though I have had only a few minutes to do so. The Government has done another good job. In the 6t years I have been in this House, our Budgets have been better and better every time. I have not had too many complaints about the Budget. In fact, since it was announced I have had only about a dozen phone calls in my office, and they were mainly for clarification on different items. Mr Simmons-And congratulations.",88
130,Mr CHYNOWETH,INSTRUMENTALITIES,"Yes, of course. It has been a most successful Budget. I am quite certain that the people of Australia will remember it. They will remember the benefits that this Government has given them. They will look at the mock policies of the Liberal and National parties and make certain that they are not put into practice in any way.

132,Mr TUCKEY,ADJOURNMENT,"A matter on which this Government has been particularly silent in its Budget and on other occasions is the situation of Western Australia Inc. under the Dowding LaborÂ· Government. I am quite sure that many honourable members on the Government benches would agree with me that it has been one of the more outrageous situations. The Government at the Federal level has failed at all times to intervene and attempt to straighten this matter out, notwithstanding the fact that, for some year now, the Opposition has put various questions to the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) and other Ministers demanding of them that they take some interest in it before it gets worse. We are not looking at the potential loss of over $1 billion of Western Australian taxpayers' money; yet we do not find this Government or the Treasurer (Mr Keating) being at all concerned. A Budget has just been introduced in Western Australia that has raised considerably the taxes on Western Australians, in almost every case because that Government lacks the resources that it would otherwise have had from inflation and the growth of Western Australia. The things that concern me most are the untruths and lies that have been told in this regard. These days we have an almost daily slanging match between one of Australia's leading entrepreneurs, Mr Bond, and Mr Dowding, the Premier, as to who is telling the truth. At one stage when I looked at this matter I discovered that there seemed to be one person who had all the credentials for telling the truth. He is Leon Musca, not a big player in the game. Mr Musca was one of the lawyers engaged by the Western Australian Government to give legal advice during many of the transactions. When it became necessary for Mr Musca to give some evidence to the Supreme Court he declined to volunteer evidence. He said that, as a professional, he had a responsibility of confidence and could not appear and volunteer evidence. In other words, he was not jumping up at the front of the queue wanting to stick a knife into somebody. Eventually he was subpoenaed. He appeared under the subpoena, took an oath and, from that point on, told the story as he knew it. Time and again this person contradicted statements made inside and outside the Western Australian Parliament by people such as Mr Dowding and  amazing. For instance, one statement was: The Government has consistently denied that it entered into an agreement in July 1988 to purchase Connell and Dempster's shares in PICL-Indeed the Western Australian Government is in a pickle. PICL is the acronym for Petrochemical Industries Co Ltd. In Western Australia it is known as PICL-pronounced 'pickle', which is certainly appropriate. The statement continues: in order to facilitate the purchase of $350m of nonperforming debt mostly from Connell and from Rothwells by Connell. The clearest statement to this effect was by Premier Dowding in response to a question by Bill Hassell on 19 October. Bill Hassell asked whether the Government had been involved in the purchase of the Connell debts and in the action of the NCSC to require Connell to prove his capacity to pay for the debts. Dowding's reply was to deny both these questions. Musca stated that he was instructed by Connell to prepare the memorandum of understanding on the Bond Corporation's intention to purchase the shares in PICL. He received instructions from Kevin Edwards and from Dowding and Grill via Edwards concerning the drafting. Peter Wiese of Robinson Cox, a close adviser in the Government, was retained by Connell to represent him in the NCSC threat. Musca went on to say that the immediate effect of signing the memorandum was that the NCSC withdrew its threat and the shareholders' meeting to approve the loan transfer went ahead. That is a simple example I can give in the five minutes available to me on how, day after day, members of the Western Australian Government stood up in the Parliament and in public and gave misleading information, notwithstanding the Opposition's questions. It should be condemned for that. I have never heard people telling so many lies on an issue of this nature. It is time that the Western Australian Government was brought to account and that the Federal Government became involved in order to protect taxpayers' money, because the issue is not closed. There are still thousands of millions of dollars to be lost, considering the agreements that Dowding and Parker have signed with Mr Bond. Mr Bond will take them to court and sue them in connection with this matter, as we warned the Government some time ago.",89

134,Mr KENT,ADJOURNMENT,"Yesterday, on 3 September, the Australian flag flew at half mast on top of Parliament House in memory of the 34,000 Australian service men and women who died serving their nation in the Second World War. On Thursday, 31 August, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke),  and the Parliament paid tribute to those women and men who served their country both overseas and at home. As one who lived through the horrors of the Second World War-I was a young teenager on the other side of the fence in Nazi-occupied EuropeI wish today to pay my tribute to those Australian women and men and all those others who gave their lives in the fight against Nazi barbarism. I remember the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, even though for me the war started on 4 April 1941 when Nazi Germany and fascist Italy, with their allies, attacked Yugoslavia, the country where I was born and reared. I remember the nights during the blackouts when our whole family legal was glued to our radio set listening secretly to the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC). That in itself was an offence in those days, for which we could have been executed if caught. In the times of barbaric Nazi occupation the BBC gave us the only hope and the will for survival. I am sure that when I say that I speak for the millions of oppressed people in occupied Europe at that time. During that period I learnt to admire our British allies who, even when left alone to face Hitler, never whinged and never gave in; they fought on. I remember the reports of the bombing of London where so many died and I remember those in Europe. Jews, gypsies, Serbs and others were put to death by the Nazis and their helpers-the domestic quislings such as the Ustasha and the Chetniks-for no reason other than their race, religion or nationality. As a young teenager I saw some of the horrible atrocities. In those days we prayed for the victory of the Allied forces; it was our only hope to be saved. Many of us contributed by fighting as partisans or in the underground. Finally, in 1945, I witnessed the victory of the Allied forces over the Nazi-fascist barbarians. After those horrible experiences I left Yugoslavia and Europe in 1948 never to return to live there again. I know that many leftmost who, during the war, were oppressed like me and some who were on the side of the oppressors. I hope that all of us who migrated to Australia will forget the horrors and hatreds of the past and work towards a peaceful and tolerant future. Australia is a tolerant country and we owe it to this society to ensure that we do not poison it with the hatreds that existed during past centuries between various nations and minorities in Europe and elsewhere. Let those who remained there come to terms with each other in peace. Let us not forget that our first and foremost duty as Australians is to Australia. The great bulk of migrants, wherever they came from, settled successfully here and are working shoulder to shoulder in our factories and offices. They wish to forget all the enmities. I would like to advise those few who still live in the past and are fighting their old racist and religious battles to cease their murderous propaganda of intolerance and hatred that leads to violence and to join the mainstream of new and old Australians to build a nation of peace, tolerance and freedom for what so many gave their lives in the Second World War.",90
135,Mr MACKELLAR,ADJOURNMENT,"Warringah) (10.40)I want to refer briefly again tonight to the Government's actions in relation to Australian pharmacists and to raise once again in this House the enormous difficulties which are going to be facing pharmacists throughout Australia as a result not only of the recent Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal decision but also of the Government's intransigent approach towards the pharmacy profession as a whole. I note that the Federal Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) has published, no doubt at community expense, an open letter to Australian consumers in which he states that he is writing to tell the consumers that the Hawke Labor Government will ensure that they continue to receive subsidised medicines under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS). I accept that they will, but some of the people who will be subsidising the costs of the medicines will be the pharmacists who have the responsibility for dispensing them. The open letter, which has been paid for by the Australian taxpayer, is yet another blatant political use of Australian taxpayers' money by this Government. Mr O'Keefe-To the chemists' union.",91
136,Mr MACKELLAR,ADJOURNMENT,"The honourable member interjects 'To the chemists' union', as though it is perfectly all right for the Australian Labor Party to use Australian taxpayers' moneys to respond to fellow unionists. Mr O'Keefe-Fancy these professionals resorting to strike action. These are professional people.",91
137,Mr MACKELLAR,ADJOURNMENT,"lam surprised at the intervention by the honourable member and that he would take so much exception to a union's actions. I thought he professed to be a unionist himself. Nevertheless, I make the point again that it is yet another misuse of Australian taxpayers' funds. The open letter goes on to talk about the umpire's decision. It says: But now some pharmacists are refusing to accept it. I think that is a rare misstatement in terms of hyperbole by the Minister, because the phrase 'some pharmacists are refusing to accept it' is totally misleading. I do not know of one pharmacist who does accept it. The open letter to Australian consumers goes on to put a point of view that is unacceptable to the great bulk of Australian pharmacists. Let us not be misled. The Australian community is well served by its pharmacists. To give an actual example of the effect of the the decision, I will read out a costed example of the dispensing of a script for insulin. At present the wholesale base price of the drug is $88.52. The actual wholesale price is $93.70. This includes the standard wholesale surcharge of about 5.9 per cent, which can be minimised by rebates due to turnover and payment of account within 15 days. The present PBS remuneration is $ll3.19, which represents costs of $88.52 plus a 25 per cent mark-up of $22.l3, plus a dispensing fee of $2.54. However, as the actual wholesale price is $93.70, the profit is $19.49 or 20.8 per cent, which, after normal retail overheads, rents,salaries, et cetera, of 20 per cent, leaves no real profit. Let us contrast that with the situation as proposed by the Government from I October. Under the new arrangements in October a PBS remuneration of $92.02 represents a nil mark-up plus a dispensing fee of $3.50, but as the actual wholesale price of the drug is $93.70 the dispensing of this script, which is absolutely vital to so many people,Â· will be a loss to the pharmacist of $1.68. That is the actual result of the situation which has been brought about due to the wish-and it is a very straightforward wish-of this Government to cut the number of pharmacies in Australia by half. That is the ambition of the Government. It has gone about achieving this result by the use of the Remuneration Tribunal, and it is simply going to result in very much less service being available to the community of Australia.",91

Under the Federal Governcant ment's new transition schemes under the partment of Community Services and Health, a number of people who are either physically handicapped or mildly or moderately intelBay lectually handiCapped are being given the opportunity to be placed in the work force in positions which decades or even years would not have been thought possible. is a concern by some people that others with disabilities will not be disappointed by being an led to believe that they can hold positions erwise when they are not able to because of their I particular handicap. I refer to a number of people in that situation who have actually had their lives transformed because of the new opportuniSunday. ties and the training which is now available. There are a number of different ways in and I was scared. which handicapped people can be trained for the open work force. One is the model of supported employment, which is so well ganised by Compass at Stones Corner in Queensland. In this instance, intellectually handicapped people are placed in work posupport sitions and are supported not only with training beforehand but with a person who will visit them, on either a daily or weekly basis, and ensure that they are able to with the particular needs of that job. Anbest other option is that of enclaves. A business within the electorate of Lilley is in fact ing at this particular option in conjunction with the Department and with handicapped people within my area. It is going to provide excellent entire workroom facilities dated support for disabled people to work with able people in that work force. One particular person to whom I wish to refer is a young woman with marvellous backbone. She found her job through the Australian Red Cross Society activity apy centre at Gympie, which is noY"" receivSpeaker. ing government funding to change and excellent job. its services under the new Disability Services Act. This shows just how far handicapped people can go. The last time she timed herself she could type 30 words per minute.

You use a lot of keys, and also the pressure I apply with the pen is different'. What is so signifiabout this particular worker is that she Detypes with her feet. The keyboard is on the floor and she balances a pen between her toes and taps away. She lives at' Tin Can on the Queensland coast.

People really are giving of their time to train and people with handicaps. Many providers in institutions and sheltered workshops throughout Australia are to be commended. There are people who will be tied to shelcope tered workshops and for whom this is the option. There are people like this young woman, who was born with cerebral palsy lookbut who has never allowed this to interfere with her desire to experiment, learn and grow, and who can now compete in the work force earning award wages with the support and upof the Government programs.",92

143,Mr HAWKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Having been totally impartial in my comments and very genuine, I feel that I will now be very partial and expand on what I said in the debate on the Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1989-90. I mentioned that this Budget marks the beginning of the last chapter of the Labor era of the 1980s in Australia. It is an era that has been an interesting experirp.ent but one that history is going to judge very harshly. I believe that as people look back on it and look at the problems that have been created by this experiment, they are going to be highly critical, and with very good reason. If we come back to the Budget we find that we have a Treasurer who has lost touch with reality, a Treasurer who has inflicted upon this country the highest overseas debt we have ever known and, worse still, a Treasurer who seems unconcerned about the fact that that is still growing at an evergrowing pace. It is extremely alarming to find that we are now running balance of payments deficits each month of the order of $2 billion. Yet, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) comes out month after month saying that it is really not that bad and that we should not be getting too concerned. When overseas investment advisers such as Moody's Investors Service says that it is not too good, the Treasurer says, 'We will not talk to them and will not let the Reserve Bank or the Treasury officials talk to them'. It is not good enough. As I say, history is going to be extremely harsh when we look back on this. It seems absolutely incredible that the Treasurer of this country can just ignore the fact that we have had our overseas credit rating downgraded not once but twice in the last three years. This is the man who wanders around the world stage claiming he knows something about economics. Furthermore, it seems that he is quite ignorant of what his high interest rate regime is doing in the real part of Australia-to first home buyers, to small business and to the whole fabric of our society. It is not just at the Federal level that the . Australian Labor Party is doing so much damage. We can look at the performance of some of the State Labor governments. If we start in my home State of Victoria, we find again that financial irresponsibility dominates the political agenda. We have in that State a government that seems to think nothing of the problems it has created with its WorkCare program and the fact that it now has unfunded liabilities of the order of $5 billion. Yet it seems quite unconcerned. Mr O'Keefe-Rubbish. That is not true.",93
144,Mr HAWKER,ADJOURNMENT,"It seems that one of the apologists, who is here tonight, is equally unconcerned. Yet nobody who has any real understanding of what is going on in Victoria would feel anything but alarmed about the WorkCare system as it is progressing or not progressing. Furthermore, we see the irresponsibility and incompetence of the State Government with its Victorian Economic Development Corporation. We have seen debts of well over $100m run up. Apparently the Treasurer of Victoria is quite unashamed of his failure to keep anything like reasonable control over what is going on in one of his own statutory bodies. Then we move across to another Labor Government in Western Australia. The honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) has already raised some of the points relating to the irresponsibility and incompetence, and maybe something even worse, that is going on in that State Government with its economic management. Taxpayers in Western Australia are again going to have to foot a bill of several hundred million dollars. The honourable member for O'Connor suggested that as much as a billion dollars of taxpayers' money could be, at best, wasted, squandered and possibly even something worse. No doubt time will show what has really happened. We could then move to a new Labor government, the one in Tasmania. This Government came in with a great promise of open government. It was going to be all above board and would tell the people of Tasmania and the rest of Australia what was going on. Again, within a matter of months we find a government that is not only incompetent but deceptive. The Tasmanian Government scored quite a perceptive editorial in the Weekend Australian. In the short time available, I will read one part of it. The editorial stated: The seductive trappings of office have made mania's starry-eyed utopians and professing libertarthe ians look nastily jackbooted and authoritarian. Field, the novice Premier, reveals himself to be another ALP politician who, following in the steps of party bigwigs at federal and other levels, puts electoral advantage before principle",93
145,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,94
146,Mr OKEEFE,ADJOURNMENT,"-'-1t was unfortunate that my friend and colleague honourable member for Wan non (Mr cation Hawker) started his speech so well with astute and correct assessment of your capacstitute ity in the chair, Mr Speaker, and then wanand dered off and got all the stuff about Labor governments across Australia wrong. I will talk to him privately and see whether we might correct it few of the misnomers that he purveyed. I just want to take up a couple of minutes tonight to make mention of some of the very around. significant changes taking place in the ?ort-Â­ west' corridor of Melbourne-the region 10 my electorate spreading from Broadmeadows right out to Kyneton, to the north and across through Melton and Bacchus Marsh in the west. I think it would be true to say that north-west is on a roll. Three major decisions announced by this Government in the last two or three weeks indicate the fact that governments of Labor persuasion are bringthrive on. ing about revolutionary changes in the social justice and social development pattern of these regions. The recent announcement of areas. the awarding of the frigate contract to the Australian Marine Engineering Consolidated Ltd cpnsortium at Williamstown, .which we all know is a national project, will that very significant skills and work will velop right across Australia, with a lot those benefits accruing in the western and north-western corridor of Melbourne. That is the first decision; it is a decision for I commend the Government on its initiative. The second decision I would like to talk about relates to the announcement a couple of weeks ago of the new strategy for standing Melbourne Airport which, linked with the decision by Qantas Airways Ltd to establish its new maintenance base at Tullamarine, means that literally hundreds of jobs, skills and new directions will develop in this region and will provide ongoing opportuniTasties and an ongoing lifestyle for people in region. Of course, that leads to the quesMr tion of preparation. With these .new opporjust tunities developing in this region we have to footensure that our children, who are the students of today and the skill providers of tomorrow, are well prepared. I refer also to the recent decision announced in the Budget of the appropriation of many millions of dollars to develop the the Broadmeadows Technical and Further EduCollege and its annexes out in the an north-western corridor and the Western Inand its annexes out through Melton Bacchus Marsh. Those decisions provide the basis for us to ensure a future for this area, a future which was just not thought of. It was only a few years ago that governments showed virtually no interest in these areas of Melbourne. All the evidence is there for people to see that this has been turned We often hear members on the other side of the House criticising Labor governments for their capital works projects. It ought to be remembered that these projects are major and that they provide jobs not only in the the building industry but also in the various trades that surround them. It means that the workers who are carrying out these jobs are spending money which local small businesses Mr Simmons-Particularly in country",94
147,Mr OKEEFE,ADJOURNMENT,"This is particularly so in provincial areas, as the Minister at the table, as the Minister for Defence Science and Permean sonnel (Mr Simmons), says. He knows this dewell following his very successful stint as of chairman of the Prime Minister's country task force, a force which I am proud to serve on. Major opportunities are being opened up which in the north-western corridor and in our rural and provincial areas. This is something that no amount of carping from the other side of the House, no amount of misunderfrom colleagues such as the honourable member for Wannon, can either deny or take away. We are getting it right. We are providing those opportunities for the funew ture. Mr Speaker, I am sure that in your many years in the chair of this House you will see the transformation year by year as a result of the toil that is being put into achieving economic success. Question resolved in the affirmative.

(3) When it is necessary to launch a prosecution for an offence against the Commonwealth or a breach of a law administered by the Minister's Department (a) who makes the decision to prosecute and (b) who conducts the prosecution. (4) Does the Department provide the AFP with the information it obtains in the course of (a) an investigation or (b) a' prosecution; if not, why not? NA",94
148,Mr WILLIS,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Staff (1) Yes. The Department employs 136 officers who as a significant aspect of their duties undertake investigations of breaches of the Radiocommunications Act and Broadcasting Act with a view to prosecutions. Further information on these officers is set out below in answers to questions (2), (3) and (4). Many other officers within the Department of Transport and Communications are involved in some form of monitoring of compliance with regulatory requirements or financial systems. Examples are Marine Surveyors who monitor compliance with safety standards and associated administrative requirements under the Navigation Act 1912, or officers of the Department's Internal Audit section. There are also officers such as investigators of the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation who are involved in investigations for purposes other than law enforcement (such as safety planning). None of these officers would be expected to be involved on a regular basis in activities relating to prosecutions and their functions are not seen to fall within the normal understanding of law enforcement activities. (2) (a) The officers are employed in the Radiocommunications Operations Branch to investigate breaches of the provisions of the Radiocommunications Act 1983 and Broadcasting Act 1942 and to initiate and assist in activities to enforce those provisions. It is estimated that 15% of their duties relate to law enforcement The other functions of these officers relate to investigation and correction of inin terference problems and other field-work for management of the radio frequency spectrum. (b) (i) The total salary cost of employing the officers is estimated to be $4.09 million. The amount attributable to law enforcement activities is estimated to be $0.614 million. (b) (ii) The 136 officers are employed in the Radiocommunications Operations Branch of the Communications Operations Division of the Department. Nomenclature has changed over the years but the section of the Department has remained' essentially the same in its size and functions. The officers are distributed throughout the Branch's Central Office, 6 State offices and 20 district offices. (c) All 136 officers are engaged in these activities at some time. Members of the Australian Federal Police (AFP) and some State police forces also hold appointments as inspectors for the purposes of enforcing certain provisions of the Radiocommunications Act 1983. (d) (i) None of the 136 inspectors are engaged in this sort of activity on a routine basis. Breaches of the relevant legislation usually come to light from sources other than checking of documents. (d) (ii) All 136 officers spend a proportion of their time engaged in these activities, as part of the investigatory process. (e) (i) .and (ii) There are no legislative requirements under the Radiocommunications or Broadcasting legislation for contact with the AFP. Under Departmental working arrangements, officers consult with the local State police or the AFP: (i) where information suggesting breaches of Commonwealth/State laws is detected during the course of an investigation; (ii) whete it is established that investigations by such organisations are in progress in relation to the same offender; or (iii) where, prior to visiting the offender's home, it is considered that a breach of the peace may occur and that assistance would be required. (f) . (i) and (ii) Refer to answer (e). (g) (i) and (ii) There is no formal agreement between the Department and the AFP governing the exchange of information. (h) (i) Training in investigation and court procedures is conducted in-house by departmental officers. This training may involve guest lecturers from the AFP and State police training areas. Personnel from the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) also sometimes provide lectures on topics relevant to prosecutions. Additionally, supplementary training is provided in the form of video tape material and local training programs. (h) (ii) Training courses are conducted on the basis of demand as new personnel join the Department's State offices. The Department also from time to time conducts refresher training and specialised courses on new procedures. Courses are usually conducted in each of the 6 States offices. However, if there are insufficient numbers, a centralised course may be arranged. (h) (iii) Training costs vary depending on the scope of the course. However to conduct one series of Investigation and Court procedure courses for all State offices costs approximately $15,000. Since 1985 the Department has conducted two Australia wide training courses at an estimated cost of $30,000. The Department is at present running a specialised Australia wide course on Penalties-in-Lieu of Prosecution at a cost of around $10,000. (3) (a) Where the Department considers that prosecution may be warranted for breach of a law administered by it, information about the breach, the evidence available and the Department's views on prosecution is referred to the DPP. The DPP then makes the final decision on whether to prosecute in accordance with the published statement on the Prosecution Policy of the Commonwealth. (b) Prosecution action is conducted by officers of the DPP. In some cases relating to Radiocommunications Act infringements, the DPP may arrange for prosecutions to be conducted by local police prosecutors. (4) (a) and (b) The Department does not routinely provide the AFP with information. obtained during the course of an investigation into breaches of legislation administered by the Department where the information does notÂ· appear to have potential significance outside the particular legislative scheme. However, should it appear that information collected may be relevant tp a breach of some other law, the AFP or State police would be contacted. Capital Gains Tax",96
149,Mr KEATING,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"On 31 May 1989 (Hansard, page 3277) the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Cohen) asked the then Acting Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) the following question without notice: Is the Acting Treasurer aware that many young people who purchased land after September 1985 with the intention of building a house on that land and who, for any number of reasons-such as not proceeding with their marriage, or divorcing, or having changed their plans-then decided to sell the land now find that they have. to pay capital gains tax on that sale, thus reducing their capacity to purchase their first home? In almost all cases, the people affected are either sole home or first home buyers and their land purchase was usually the first step in acquiring that home. Was it the Government's intention to catch these type of people in the capital gains net? If not, will the Government consider amending the legislation to ensure that these types of transactions are not subject to capital gains tax? The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: In framing the capital gains tax legislation the Government provided an exemption for a gain or loss arising on the disposal of a taxpayer's principal residence. This has the effect of excluding from the capital gains net the major capital asset acquired by most taxpayers and is consistent with the Government's broader social goals of encouraging home ownership. These considerations do not apply to vacant land, and consistent with a comprehensive capital gains tax, real gains made on the sale of vacant land are brought to tax. In regard, the Government is aware that some people may be subject to a capital gains tax liability upon the disposal of vacant land acquired after 19 September 1985. As a concession to taxpayers constructing dwellings on vacant land, gains accruing on land may be free from capital gains tax if the taxpayer constructs a dwelling on that land within four years, and uses that dwelling as a principal residence for a minimum period. In the 1989-90 Budget, the Government announced that the minimum period of residence in a new home to obtain this concession is to be reduced from 12 to 3 months. The Government maintains its view that only those properties that are principal residences-in !lccordance with the criteria established in the legislation, as variously extended in the 1989-90 Budget-should be exempt from capital gains tax. It is a matter of fact that taxpayers disposing of vacant land have not constructed a principal residence, irrespective of their possible intentions as regards that land. In considering a change in the legislation of the type proposed, the Government is mindful that there is no effective way of establishing that a taxpayer intended to use the vacant land for building a principal residence. Significant practical difficulties arise when the law requires satisfaction of such a 'subjective' test. To exempt those taxpayers with such intent is likely to require an exemption for the sale of vacant land generally or, at least, for a broader range of taxpayers than those that purchased land with an intent to build. Any such change to the legislation would foster investment in land as a tax shelter. Home buyers may actually be disadvantaged by such a measure since the tax concession could be capitalised into the price of land.",97
