2,Mr JOHNS,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"Petrie-Special Minister of State, Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters) (9.33 a.m.)-I move: That the amendments be agreed to. The government accepts the amendments proposed in the Senate. The amendments replace the term 'Aboriginal' when that term is used in a generic sense to include Aboriginal and Torres Strait people wherever occurring in the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act 1989 with the term 'indigenous'. This amendment puts into the legislation a term which is being used with greater frequency to describe Australians who are descended from the earliest inhabitants of Australia or the Torres Strait Islands. As the operation of the act is not affected by the amendments, the government accepts them. Question resolved in the affirmative. APPROPRIATION BILL (No.3) 1995-96 Cognate bill: APPROPRIATION BILL (No.4) 1995-96 APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (No.2) 1995-96 Second Reading Debate resumed from 26 October, on motion by Mr Johns: That the bill be now read a second time.  the to speak on yet another instalment in this big spending government's economic negligence. These additional appropriations total $1,416 million-that is, $1.4 billion-in more spendfor. ing. This ever rising spending is offset to degree by savings worth $499 million, leaving new spending of $917 million in 1995-96. is, more taxes. Where are all these extra taxpayers' funds going? An increase in running costs accounts for $433 million. So the cost of running government has increased by 3.5 per cent. The government assured us in the last budget that they were for tight, efficient government. Their budget papers show that they took $161 million in savings from running costs in the 1995-96 budget. In the space of six months they have not only spent the savings on increased running costs but exceeded them $272 million. The other areas of expenditure include million for defence facilities, $25 million computer equipment in the Department of Social Security, $69 million for a loan to Papua New Guinea and $25 million for the development of the Homebush site in Sydney. Government spending seems to keep going based ever onward and upward. I quote from the 1995-96 budget speech by the Treasurer (Mr Willis): A higher level of national savings will allow levels of development and economic growth without the costs and constraints associated with undue reliance on foreign savings. This budget provides a two part plan to improve Australia's saving performance, immediately and over the longer term. Firstly, it increases public savings. The Budget delivers a surplus in 1995-96 of $718m. No, it does not. It does not deliver that sort surplus. Here we are, six months out from budget, back firmly into deficit-the government's preferred position. The new spending alone will more than swamp the phoney surplus of the government. When you take into account the flip-flop on the AIDC sale and the ANL debacle, the budget is well and truly in deficit. By the government's admission this will reduce national savings and place pressure on foreign debt. I can assume therefore that, now the budget is over and the government has exhausted the media grabs on the surplus, it is happy to pursue big spending deficit strategy. Let us also in mind the question of how this will be paid The government has made it clear many a times that they do not see scope for significant savings. This only leaves revenue-that The truly frightening thing about all of this extra spending is that there is more to come. We have not even had from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) his innovation/housing/social policy/something for everyone policy. It is yet to be announced; it will probably be in December. It has sunk beneath the waves, despite the huge price tag. There will undoubtedly be more promises during the election campaign. Things like extending Medicare or better tax by treatment for pensioners will be trotted out again as throwaway lines. There will be more $46 glib assurances about the government being for able to pay for it without increasing taxes. If you do not cut spending, the only way you can pay for it is by lifting taxes. On this side of the House, we are clear: we will cut spending. On the other side of the House, on their record, they will lift taxes. It is 1992-93 all over again: promise the world, with no idea how you are going to pay for it and, if you cheat your way back into office, higher then you lift taxes and break your promises. New tax measures, such as widening the wholesale sales tax net, death duties-the darling of the Left-and those sorts of things will be dusted off again and trotted out to pay the bills. It cannot even be said that all of the expenditure is in the national interest. I refer to the item which relates to the funding in the of budget papers for the legal expenses for T)r the Carmen Lawrence. It has already been fOuod by the royal commissioner that Dr Lawrence did not tell the truth with regard to matters surrounding the Easton royal commission. The coalition will be requiring some changes to Appropriation Bill (No.4) pertaining to Dr Lawrence's legal expenses. The coalition is own not prepared to give a blank cheque to the government to use taxpayers' funds to fund only political campaigns by the government. We will be moving amendments to the bill to reduce the appropriation by that amount a used to fund the challenges to the royal bear commission. The coalition will not agree to the funding of legal expenses of challenges to that royal commission. While we will agree to the funding of the legal costs of Dr Lawrence appearing before the royal commission, we will not allow taxpayers' funds to be used for a political campaign designed to stop the royal commission. This was simply an attempt to use taxpayers' funds to stop a lawfully convened royal commission and stop the political embarrassment to this government. I want to make it very clear on behalf of the coalition that we will not be a party to an ALP inspired campaign to shut down the royal commission and we will not allow taxpayers' funds to be used for that purpose, purely for political reasons. The government has a long history in this regard, be it sports rorts or stopping independent investigations into the government's propaganda unit, NMLS. The government is always seeking to stop negative reporting. We are also concerned about the lack of detail in what appears to be another expensive legal exercise relating to former minister Alan Griffiths. While the government has advised that it will provide this information during day, if the coalition does not have this information by the end of the debate on this subject we will be moving an amendment to reject this amount also. The government clearly sees spending as a way of solving problems. I repeat that on the Carmen Lawrence matter we will not allow taxpayers' funds to be used for the political purposes of shutting down the royal commission and that, even knocking off the amount contained within the limited information we have, we are still not satisfied with the costings. The appropriation amount is not an authority to pay the amount; it is purely an indication that the funds are there, although we are advised that there are extra bills to come in relation to this matter. So it was a very expensive exercise by the government. Our view all along has been that, if Dr Lawrence had merely fronted the commission and told what she knew, there would not have been a need for all this unbelievable expense. With regard to the matter of Alan Griffiths, we are concerned that the amount has no detail whatsoever. For that reason, we have asked the government to provide that detail. They have indicated that they will give that detail by the end of the day. If we are satisfied with the detail of that account, it can go through, but if we are not or we do not receive it we will be moving to delete that item as well. While the government has advised that they will provide that information, I reiterate that our concern is that we have no detail as to what it was for and how much it goes to. As I mentioned, the government sees spending as a way out of all its problems. Even for 1995-96, when the government was making a big noise about tightening the budget, spending grew by 1.7 per cent in real terms. This government just does not know anything else. We still have many problems as a nation. For example, our waterfront has gone backwards. Despite government spending of more than $140 million of taxpayers' funds, the performance of our waterfront is abysmal. Our waterfront charges are amongst the highest in the world and two-thirds of it is attributed to the high cost of our terminal operations. It is now cheaper to move materithe as through New Zealand, Singapore or Britain than through Australia. It is not as if it is a close race; we are considerably more expensive. The government continues to rest on its laurels and tell us how much they have reformed the waterfront. As if that is not bad enough, the number of containers moved per hour has actually fallen. It has not just stayed the same, which would have been bad enough; it has fallen. If you use an Australian port, it takes longer and costs more. One of the measures in the new appropriation bills is $39 million for Australian National, which stems from the establishment of the National Rail Corporation. What is the in state of Australian rail after all these reforms the government trumpeted? Australian rail freight rates, with the exception of general freight, are much higher than best practice international levels. In coal, one of Australia's most important exports, rail freight rates are up to five times the lowest average rate in the US. Not only do they cost more; they are also unreliable. National Rail arrived on time only 61 per cent of the time. Competing truck operators arrived on time 96 per cent of the time. Australia has much lower labour productivity than the US. AN was outperformed by Burlington Northern in the US by a factor of 3.6. This is not a coalition throwaway line; comes from the government's own Bureau of Industry Economics document. I wonder how long it will be before these reports are stopped. It is easy to simply shoot the messenger; that is the government's way. What is the point of our farmers, miners and manufacturers striving for world best practice if they lose it the minute they have to access the Australian transport system. not good enough. We need real reform, not simply having money thrown around like it is going out of fashion. Yet the approach taken by Labor is to throw money at it and call it a solution. Health is an another significant problem in this area. We used to have a health system that was the envy of many nations around the world. We had a healthy balance between private and public health. We now have a private health system in crisis and a public health system under ever-growing pressure. What is the government's response? Increase the Medicare levy and raise spending on public health. Has this stopped the decline in private health? No, it has not. The private health sector is in continuing decline, and the public health system is under increasing pressure. Once again, the government has refused to tackle the hard decisions. Once again, it has failed to find a solution. Unemployment is another case in point. Since the recession we did not have to have, the government has thrown billions of dollars at various infrastructure and labour market programs. We were told that it would take us until the new age of prosperity to solve our current account problems and lower unemployment. So where are we now? For a start, we have record foreign debt of $180 billion. We are now five years into economic recovery and we still have over eight per cent unemployment. In fact, unemployment is going up again. It now stands at 8.7 per cent, or 788,000 unemployed Australians. Long-term unemployment, the very rationale for the Working Nation statement, has gone up 10,000 since April this year and stands at 252,500 people. This is a damning indictment of failed policies. What is the government's response? The economy is just it catching its breath. If it catches its breath much more, it will tum blue and catch a cold. The government continually forgets that if you do not get the fundamentals right you will not get the numbers right over the medium or longer term. One of the most important fundamentals is budgetary policy. This is the first thing that the government should be focusing on. Instead of confronting the issue It is of excessive spending, the government has continued to lift taxes. This has included higher company tax, despite the fact that it will adversely affect our international competitiveness. It has also included an attempt to impose more taxes on the building industry, despite the fact that the housing industry is in the middle of a deep and prolonged slump. This continuation of excessive spending has meant a run of excessively large deficits. It has drained our national savings at a time when we should focus all our energy on lifting national savings. These bills simply continue in that vein. This appalling performance on national savings has meant greater reliance on foreign liabilities, which has given us a spiralling net income deficit. This has placed us in the precarious position that when we get anything like reasonable growth we get a current account blow-out. Because the government refuses to confront national savings, the government is forced into the position of having to slow growth as the means of reducing the current account deficit. Of course, if you slow growth you get unemployment problems. There is no possibility of getting to five per cent unemployment by the end of the decade under government policies, and the government knows it. The government criticises us for daring to say this, but just saying you will get there will not make it happen. The coalition is simply recognising that under failed Labor policies the unemployed have been very badly let down. The government tell us this with their own economic growth forecasts, which, by their own admission, will not generate sufficient employment growth. Unfortunately, the wheels are well and truly starting to come off the government's economic wagon. We now have the worse results-rising unemployment, rising inflation, rising foreign debt and growth-and still the government tell us it is all going to plan. Which part of the plan is going okay? I certainly cannot find the figures. The other problem with these bills is that they add further to the already excessive stocks of government debt by ensuring we are back to a deficit. Already the government spends $9.4 billion in interest for past debt, and this figure rises to $9.5 billion in the 1996-97 budget year. This extra spending will simply place further debt burdens on our future generations, and the fact that there is even more Keating election spending in the pipeline will only make matters worse. Instead of spending money on hospitals, roads or education, future generations will be paying billions to financial markets every year. Because of this government's policies, we are passing a terrible legacy to our children: a government increasingly in debt and a nation heavily in debt to foreign savers. All the often repeated government promises about economic nirvana just around the comer will not change this. But perhaps the most frustrating thing about these bills is that the government will simply not learn from past mistakes. We have been down this road before. All during 1994 the government was told it was spending too much and the deficit was too large. It was told that it would put enormous pressure on the current account deficit and interest rates. The Prime Minister ignored it all and we got tax hikes, increased interest rates and the worse current account deficit in the OECD. Finally this message got through to the Prime Minister and we got the 1995-96 budget with its fudge-it surplus. But now it has all been forgotten and the government is back to more spending and more negligent policies. Of course the problems have not gone away, they are just hidden by the falling economic growth. We still have a structurally unsound current account deficit, which will again blowout when growth gets strong enough. We still rely far too heavily on foreign savers to support our investment. slower What a terrible position to be in. We can only get good current account numbers when the economy is slowing down and the unemployment rate is going up. The government should be learning from its past mistakes and putting us on a more sustainable growth path. It should be cutting spending and lifting savings and it should be pushing ahead with economic reform, most particularly in the labour market. But now, at a time when the government should be seeking to secure our future, it is squibbing on the tough decisions. At a time when it should be putting all effort into lifting national savings, it is increasing spending. At a time when it should be taking pressure off inflation, it is increasing spending. At a time when it should be taking pressure off the tax system, it is lifting spending. At a time when it should be consolidating the budget to prepare for any future downturn, it is increasing spending. At a time when the government should be pushing ahead with reform of the labour market, they are defending a system which allows national strikes to punish one company. At a time when they should be reforming the Industrial Relations Act, they are putting their head in the sand and pretending that there is no problem. At a time when they should lift the performance of our infrastructure, they fall back on the endless tales of past half-reform while our waterfront goes backwards. This government has shown time and time again that it is not capable of making the decisions which are necessary to secure this country's future. These further big spending bills are just the most recent manifestation of this fact. It is only a coalition government which will be able to take the responsible decisions. The government would have you believe that there are no more cuts in spending to be made. What it really means is that it no longer has the will to make the tough decisions on spending. It will take a coalition government to make the necessary decisions on running a responsible budget. It will be a budget that balances the legitimate needs of protecting the vulnerable members of our society, but it will not be featured by rampaging spending. We will ensure that the budget is kept responsible by ensuring that all spending is both efficient and effective. Programs which are wasteful or redundant will be wound back or abolished in favour of programs which better achieve their goals, but we will not be raising taxes or increasing new taxes. We are quite clear on that. This is a commitment that the government is not prepared to make. It is by taking measures such as these that we will improve the structural position of the budget and so reduce the call of the Commonwealth on savings. Rebuilding national savings is a top priority for any coalition government. The conservative states are doing their bit to lift national savings. It is only the Commonwealth which is not putting anything into this national effort. That will change under a coalition government. We must make it a top priority to reduce spending and to lift national savings. This is of fundamental importance in placing Australia on a sustainable growth path. It is only through sustained, higher levels of growth that we will start to make real inroads into the crippling level of unemployment in Australia. The government have shown that they are not prepared to do the hard yards when it comes to running responsible budgets. They have shown that they are not prepared to do the hard yards when it comes to doing their share to lift national savings. They talk about the superannuation guarantee levy, but that is legislating to make people save. It is not the Commonwealth making the adjustments. The states are doing it. The Commonwealth is making everyone else do it, yet the Commonwealth cannot seem to lift its own savings performance. One again, it is passing the buck. The government are old and tired and they need a rest. I am sure they are going to get it at the next election. Indeed, the country needs a rest from their policies. They should stop putting off the inevitable and let the Australian people decide to chart a new course for the Australian public.",11
3,Mr LES SCOTT,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"It is always interesting to follow the opposition spokesman on finance, the member for Forrest  strength of the Minister for Finance, Mr Kim Beazley. It really does show the difference between these two teams when you compare the front-bench of the government with the poor excuse for a front-bench of the opposition. I often think that we could probably put up a second lIon this side and still run rings around them. The performance of the member for Forrest today showed once again that he has no idea of what government is all about. That is why at the next election the coalition will be relegated again to the opposition benches. That is about the best place for them in this place, if there is any place for them here at all. It certainly gives me great pleasure to speak on a more positive note in support of the bills before the House today: Appropriation Bill (No.3) 1995-96, Appropriation Bill (No.4) 1995-96 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No.2) 1995-96. There can be little doubt that this government's commitment strategy over the past three years has secured a strong, sustainable economic recovery in this country, despite what the gloom and doom merchants on the opposition benches have been saying and have again reinforced here today. At the present time, our gross domestic product growth is approximately 3.75 per cent, which is in line with budget forecasts and above the OECD average. Buttressing these figures, the underlying rate of inflation is remaining steady at about three per cent, wages growth has been to a large degree offset by productivity increases under enterprise bargaining and interest rates have remained steady since last year. I will come to the topic of interest rates later. When these factors are combined with increased business investment, which is expected to be around 13 per cent this fiscal year, the economic environment remains relatively rosy compared with the last time those opposite sat on the treasury bench. As I said, I expect them to be in opposition for a long time and it will be in Australia's best interests if they are kept there. When this Labor government came to office in 1983, we had to contend with a legacy of double digit inflation, double digit unemployment and declining economic growth, courtesy of the economic policy prescriptions of the then Treasurer, the member for Bennelong, the now recycled Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). Given what we know of the opposition's industrial relations policy to date-the member for Forrest has reinforced their industrial relations policy again today, which of course is nil; it is a confrontation type of policy-it would seem that the Leader of the Opposition has learned nothing about responsible economic management over the past 12 years. One would have thought that, after his miserable representation up to 1983, he would have spent the last 12 years trying to learn something, or at least listening to others, but he obviously has learnt nothing or must be just a slow learner. It may pay members opposite, therefore, to sit back and listen as I outline a few points about how this Labor government has effectively been delivering a fiscally responsible budget which is expanding economic and employment growth. It is a very important area to us. As members would be well aware, the 1995-96 budget will deliver a surplus this financial year, which is a $12 billion turnaround in the budget outcome. This is being achieved by a net reduction in outlays, increases in revenue and the sale of government assets. Importantly, the 1996-97 budget will be in surplus excluding asset sales, and the 1997-98 budget is expected to show a surplus of $7.4 billion, or 1.2 per cent of GDP, based on the government's fiscal tightening measures. Complementing these fiscal tightening measures, the government has also moved to tackle the decline in national savings in order to facilitate higher levels of investment and economic growth in the future. Once again, the member for Forrest has gone on off on some other wavelength about that as well. From 1997, variations to industrial awards will see the introduction of employee contributions to superannuation schemes funded out of future wage rises. Contributions amounting to three per cent of average weekly earnings will be phased in over the next three years. To complement the three per cent phased employee superannuation contributions, the government will match employee contributions dollar for dollar with direct payments to workers' superannuation accounts. The second round of the One Nation tax cuts will be paid in this form. That once again shows this government's commitment to increasing savings. The matching payments, which will be capped at three per cent of average weekly ordinary time earnings and means tested, will gradually withdraw support up to a salary in the range of $65,000 per annum. By the year 2006, the impact of the government's superannuation measures will be boosting national savings by an estimated two per cent of GDP. Not only will this dramatically increase the pool of savings available for investment purposes and reduce our reliance on foreign capital, but also it will boost workers' retirement incomes substantially. The budget's two-pronged approach to the continued expansion of the Australian economy underpins the government's other key objectives of employment growth. Everyone in this place should think that is a key priority . We on this side of the House certainly do. This government's commitment to ensuring that all Australians benefit from the economic progress of the last three years has been paramount in the formation of the 1995-96 budget. To this end, the government has committed $2.2 billion in this budget to create jobs for the long-term unemployed, jobs for disadvantaged people and jobs for youth-in short, jobs for people who have been the most seriously affected by the economic contraction of the early 1990s. This budget appropriation and the innovative labour market programs which stem from it come from the government's comprehensive Working Nation white paper on employment and growth. That has been one of the most important initiatives by this government over recent times. I take this opportunity to congratulate the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) for his support and initiative and for his commitment to Working Nation. It is certainly an outstanding paper which is delivering to many of the people who need that assistance. The Working Nation initiatives are, without doubt, one of the most ambitious and well thought out plans to reduce unemployment this country has ever seen. The strategies derived from Working Nation have been instrumental in helping large numbers of unemployed people obtain meaningful and dignified employment since its inception in 1994. Under Working Nation, the unemployment rate in seasonally adjusted terms has fallen from its peak in October 1993 of 11 per cent to 8.7 per cent as of October 1995. Whilst that still remains too high, we on this side the House are committed to continuing to work to reduce those figures. But in the period since Working Nation came into operation in 1994, well over 330,000 jobs have been created as a direct result. I think you will agree, Mr Deputy Speaker, that this is an impressive effort in just over one year of operation. On average, this government has created in excess of 20,000 jobs per month under the Working Nation program. Looking at the period since the Keating government was re-elected in 1993, almost 665,000 jobs have been created, which exceeds the government's commitment to create 500,000 jobs over three years-and this is well within two years, of course. It is a remarkable achievement, to say the least, and of course the government should be congratulated for that effort and for its commitment to a very difficult position in our community today. Thinking about unemployment, one really needs to think about how it has been created. I was speaking to someone earlier this morning about the international situation of unemployment. Although the international situation is not consistent with the position in Australia, the movement in new technology over the past 10 to 20 years has had a major effect on employment. It is something that the whole world has to grapple with and it is something to which this government is giving a very high priority. I tum now to some of the initiatives in my own electorate of Oxley, which I am very proud to represent in this place. Unfortunately we have areas of significantly high unemployment, but they have directly benefited from the Working Nation job creation initiatives. Many people are working in our community to take advantage of those opportunities provided in Working Nation. I take this opportunity to congratulate all those people associated with these initiatives to ensure that the people who are disadvantaged receive the greatest assistance possible. Our regional area consultative committee, which, naturally, as the local federal member I helped to establish when Working Nation first came out, is chaired by Mr Reg Bond, of who works with his team of people. From time to time. I also attend the meetings of that committee, along with the regional manager of DEET, to keep in touch with what is actually happening with the area consultative committee. The idea of an area consultative committee was something that I very strongly supported. It was a very important initiative. It has been particularly successful in delivering labour market programs to the long-term unemployed. All the people who sit around that table are local people who make a very worthwhile contribution. Of course, we need to continue to maintain the emphasis on that area consultative committee. The ACC, as it is known, is a very representative body made up of local employers, unions, community groups, local government agencies, education providers and members from the business community. Those providers have developed an innovative network to deliver those new work opportunity programs and landcare and environment action programs in the region. I also attend a lot of the graduation ceremonies at the completion of a lot of those labour market initiatives for the unemployed people who have been in these programs and inspect the work that they are undertaking. I speak with the participants and see the work that they have carried out. It always gives me a lot of satisfaction to see the benefits that they are receiving and the opportunities that are opening up for them. Participants in these programs gain a sense of purpose and hope, while at the same time developing skills which will benefit them in the labour marketplace. The benefits in terms of greater community cohesion can also be overlooked in this context. Above all these benefits, however, the number of people going on from these labour market programs to full-time employment is the most rewarding and pleasing aspect to me as their local federal member. Through the efforts of the ACC, and of course DEET through the CES in my electorate, substantial inroads have been made into the long-term unemployment rate in the region with a five per cent reduction since the peak period in late 1993. To supplement the work of the ACC and the CES in the area of employment growth in the Ipswich region, we have also embraced the concept of a regional economic development organisation, which of course is known as a REDO. The local Ipswich regional development organisation is the body that has sort of kicked that off and is the forerunner of it, but we will be leading into the fully-fledged REDO in the very near future. That is another fine initiative that comes through in the Working Nation paper. As I mentioned, we are currently in the process of forming a broad-based inclusive management committee for the REDO along the lines of the very successful ACC. The REDO will provide the vision and leadership required to tap the as yet unrealised potential in our regional industries to stimulate economic and employment growth. Once a REDO is up and running, it will complement the existing labour market programs already in place within my electorate and work towards creating an economic environment that is required to ensure expanding job opportunities. I am sure many of these initiatives are being taken right throughout the length and breadth of Australia. As a matter of fact, I have been invited by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Simon Crean, to speak on his behalf at a function at Indooroopilly in Brisbane in the federal electorate of Ryan to acknowledge the contribution of lots of people who are participating there. That is on 2 December, and I am very much looking forward to the opportunity to once again highlight the initiatives of the Working Nation statement. There is little doubt, though, that the government is well on the way to achieving its objective of a five per cent unemployment rate by the year 2000. The government, of course, realises that to achieve this target rate lots of modifications to existing programs are required to meet the changing needs of the unemployed. We must, as time moves on, always be prepared to change to meet the current needs, and of course this government has always been prepared to do that. That is why it has been so successful over the last 12 years. Consequently, within the resource funding envelope which has been set aside for Working Nation programs in the budget, a great deal of flexibility has been built into ensure resources can be directed to the areas of greatest need, and that is important. This fact is reflected in the second year enhancements to the Working Nation programs announced by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Simon Crean, on 19 October this year. These enhancements emerge from extensive consultations through the consultative infrastructure of Working Nation which encompasses the ACC network, NETfFORCE industry training companies, youth groups and, of course, the CES. The four key messages to emerge from these consultations were the need for the simplification of programs available under Working Nation; earlier and more flexible access to programs; more effective assistance for youth; and the need to expand and broaden the new case management system. Subsequently, the enhancements that the minister has put in place have built upon these messages, and include an extra 28,000 places for contracted case managers; an additional 250 staff in the CES to enhance service to job seekers; a strategy to improve communication with young Australians; a greatly simplified wage subsidy regime for jobstart, traineeships and apprenticeships; the extension of wage subsidy coverage to include people unemployed for six to 12 months; wage subsidy eligibility extended to cover the employment of long-term unemployed job seekers as apprentices; and an upfront lump sum payment for employers who take on more than two eligible employees under jobstart or apprenticeships, provided at least a quarter are from the job compact group. For a moment, I will emphasise the importance of the participation of the business community in employment. I acknowledge the contribution of lots of businesses, particularly small businesses who always struggle no matter what the case may be because they really are people who have to be hands on all the time. They do not have the benefit of having huge staff numbers such as big companies do. I congratulate them for participating, and I encourage them to do so. Last Friday night I had the opportunity to speak at my local Master Builders Association annual dinner and Christmas party. They always get in early to start their celebrations. The building area really is a very important area in any local community; they should be involved in ensuring that they take the opportunity available to them under Working Nation. I am trying to encourage more people from the building industry to actually get involved in our ACC because I believe they have a very big commitment to make. They are already making a very big commitment with apprentices and in creating employment. These enhancements which I have just highlighted will certainly provide a boost to organisations in my electorate, such as IMCAS, the Ipswich-Moreton community apprenticeship scheme, one of the local apprenticeship groups. It is a very successful scheme. I congratulate them on their efforts. They will benefit, and their efforts will continue to provide training and job opportunities to the long-term unemployed. I have had the opportunity of using their services to employ a trainee in my own office. The simplification of the wage subsidy regime when combined with up-front lump sum payments for employers who take on trainees and apprentices will certainly make participants in that IMCAS program more attractive to local employers who are considering taking on long-term unemployed job seekers. There can be little doubt that the funds appropriated for Working Nation programs under the 1995-96 budget will continue to make large inroads in coming years into solving the unemployment problem. With Working Nation achieving the sorts of results I mentioned earlier, it is hard to imagine what is motivating the opposition's determination to cut funding for these programs. That is what it is contemplating. The member for Higgins (Mr Costello), in a press conference on 20 June this year, made it quite plain what the opposition intends to do with Working Nation. He said: Well I've already told you what we think, that in relation to many of the Working Nation programs that there's room for savings. I've said that all along. I said it when it came down. I've already told you that in relation to Commonwealth duplication there is enormous room for savings ... But the thing is, you see, you've got to have a will to do this. This callous disregard for those who already have benefited and will benefit from these employment programs in the future is frightening to say the least. Australians, when they are considering the next election, which is not all that far away, should know that that is the sort of attitude the opposition has. The comments made by Mr Costello also expose the opposition leader's hypocritical and cynical pretence of helping out the so called battlers. Considering that many battlers are utilising Working Nation programs, it is pretty difficult to see how slashing these programs is going to help them. It is clear to all Australians that, when election time comes, there will be a stark choice between the government and the opposition on this issue. On one side you will have a federal Labor government committed to assisting the unemployed and providing an adequate social safety net, and on the other side you will have a coalition party dominated by ideologues who are intent on removing this assistance in the name of smaller government. A stark choice indeed! I finish by rejecting this out-of-hand nonsense amendment put forward by the member for Forrest. Once again, he is just attacking the Minister for Human Services and Health, Carmen Lawrence. After the opposition's performance here yesterday and the whole saga of the Marks royal commission, it is clear that this has just been a political hunt by those opposite with consultation between the Leader of the Opposition and the Premier of Western Australia. A minister being subjected to abuse by the opposition is probably one of the worse things we have ever seen in the history of this country. (Quorum formed)",16
4,Mrs BISHOP,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"It is very kind of the ladies and gentlemen from the government to actually come in for a debate on this question. We are well aware of the cynicism that the government displays on this matter, whereby in Appropriation Bill (No.3) you are proposing to appropriate $550,000 for the legal fees of the former minister for industry who could not run a sandwich shop-he is to have $550,000 paid for his legal fees-and in Appropriation Bill (No.4) we see that Carmen Lawrence is to have an appropriation of $800,000 made for her legal fees. It is particularly interesting when you look at the battle that battlers, ordinary people, have in their struggle to find pro bono workthat is, where the lawyers do the work for free because they cannot afford to pay the billsor indeed where legal aid is sought and granted. Those battlers do not get the opportunity to have a Queen's Counsel being paid $5,000 a day. Five thousand dollars a day was paid to Mr Gyles to represent Carmen Lawrence, plus another barrister was paid at $2,000 a day for 90 days. Very simply, I think the distinction between the Rolls Royce treatment that the government proposes be paid for by the taxpayers and the ordinary facilities that are available to other folk is a glaring distinction that needs to be made. It is interesting that, when Ian Sinclair was himself having to defend what was a highly political action brought against him, he paid his own fees. It is interesting to note that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has chosen to take out a stop writ against Senator Michael Baume, and he has to pay his legal fees. It was interesting that, when the Prime Minister before he became Prime Minister took action against Mrs Rosemary Foot in a highly political action, she paid her own fees. Yet here we have the Minister for Human Serwitch- vices and Health who, not acting in her federal capacity at all, sought to close down a royal commission inquiring into whether she had lied and connived at the introduction of a petition saying that perjury had been committed by a young woman who had just been admitted to the bar, when knowing that that was not true and could have been found to be knowing it was not true but believing it would be of political advantage to her because she-that is, Carmen Lawrence-knew that on that particular day the petition was brought in there was to be an announcement made that $5,000 of taxpayers' money had been kept by Carmen Lawrence in her personal bank account.",21
5,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,Mr Rocher)Order! The honourable member will refer to members by their correct title.,21
6,Mrs BISHOP,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"In her capacity as Premier of Western Australia the minister for health had kept taxpayers' money in her personal bank account for over two years. That money came from the same source-the imprest account-for which Brian Burke, the previous Premier of Western Australia, had been prosecuted and sent to gaol. She knew that this announcement was to be made and thought that by bringing in a petition she could, firstly, embarrass Richard Court and, secondly, divert attention from the fact that she had cynically kept taxpayers' money, hoping that she was not to be prosecuted, but at this stage not knowing whether or not she would be prosecuted by the DPP in the same manner as Brian Burke had been. In this cynical way this petition was brought in. Instead of admitting to it, she chose-as the royal commission has found-to lie to the parliament and say that she had no knowledge of the petition prior to its tabling in the parliament. Yesterday, we had the situation where the Speaker ruled out of order a question asking the health minister why it was that 14 of her former colleagues had conspired to tell lies about her when she was the only one telling the truth. No answer was given to that question. Quite clearly, anyone reading the report of the royal commission knows that the health minister is guilty as found. We come to the question of the behaviour in which she indulged with the complicity, connivance and approval of the government of the day. I refer to the Prime Minister his cabinet. They said that the health minister's fees would be paid by the taxpayer. We then had some questions about how was to be done. I canvassed with the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) whether or not would seek to make a payment out of the Advance to the Minister for of an act of grace payment under section 34A of the Audit Act. After blustering his through the answer he finally said that government would probably have to bring a separate appropriation bill for this amount of money. At that stage nobody in their wildest dreams thought that it was going to come in at $800,000. Understand that the whole royal commission cost $3 million. As disclosed the Attorney-General' s Department, the minister for health's personal bill for legal fees is $856,000. We have seen no breakdown as to how much of those costs was incurred in an attempt to close down the royal comThis mission and how much of those costs was royal incurred in her appearance before the royal commission. It is important that we be given those details because there is no way in the world that the taxpayers should be asked to pick up a bill for an attempt to close down properly constituted royal commission. When we look at the breakdown of the figures it is interesting to see that the minister for health chose to engage solicitors in ney. Former Senator Stephen Loosley-the paid former secretary of the Labor Party in New South Wales who entered into that disastrous arrangement that lost the branch of the party so much money and plummeted it to nearly $10 million in debt-is a consultant with the firm that was engaged by the minister for health. The minister's barrister, Mr Gyles, was also a Sydney based lawyer. Aside from being a bit of an insult to the lawyers who practise in her home state, it also meant that the bill shows travel expenses of $48,293, accommodation of $40,643, facsimiles of over $3,000, couriers of over $2,800, telephone calls of $1,200 and photocopying alone of $18,000. There would be many applicants for legal aid who would be grateful to have even a and fraction of the bill for photocopying. The solicitors costs-they are the ones to which former Senator Loosley is a consultant-were that over $330,000. Counsel's fees totalled $369,000. There was a local lawyer in Perth he who was deemed fit to be an agent for $40,000 and other disbursements amounting Finance by way to over $115,000. The long and the short of it is that this sort way of money from the taxpayer can only be the afforded by people who are prepared to pay in for Rolls Royce treatment when they can afford to pay for it. Regarding whether or not the minister for health made any decisions about that, I heard her say that it was not her problem. I find that a very curious statement to make. She is the person who sought out by these people to represent her. I turn to the statement made in the letter by the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) to Senator Barney Cooney on 14 November which reads: document gives details requested, except in relation to a full break-up of costs as between the commission and the legal challenges to the royal commission-that is, the distinction between the amount of money paid for proper representation before the commission and the amount of money paid to try to close down the royal commission. a That information must be available and I think it is incumbent upon the Attorney General to make it available. Let us look again at the second appropriSydation-that is, legal fees of $550,000 to be in respect of the former minister for the investigation of his behaviour involved in the so-called sandwich shop affair. I find it very interesting that that appropriation is sought to be put in Appropriation Bill (No.3) which is effectively a bill of supply. Indeed, under section 53 of our constitution, that bill provides money for the ordinary annual services of government. Money that needs to be appropriated for new and unauthorised expenditure is supposed to be in Appropriation Bill (No.4), which is not a supply bill and is capable of amendment. It is important to note that the appropriation for the minister for health is contained within Appropriation Bill (No.4), but the appropriation for Mr Griffiths, the former minister, is in Appropriation Bill (No.3). I looked and I found that in August this year there was tabled in the Senate a notification and backup documents of the decision to pay to the said former minister $150,000 on account of the costs to be paid to Brereton and Co., the solicitors he engaged, out of the Advance to the Minister for Finance. Under the Audit Act, you may not make a payment greater than $50,000 out of the advance unless there is a committee of departmental secretaries established to deal with the matter. I think we are entitled to know the details of that deliberation, otherwise there is no good reason at all as to why this appropriation of $550,000-an extraordinary amount for legal fees-is contained in Appropriation Bill (No.3) and why $150,000 of that amount was paid from the Advance to the Minister for Finance. The answer that the government will probably give is that because it was paid out of the advance it is entitled to put it in Appropriation Bill (No.3). That answer will not wash at all. The fact of the matter is that it is not the method of payment that counts, it is the reason for the payment that is important. In regard to the function of covering those fees, clearly the former minister is in a slightly different position from the health minister because the trouble he got into was while he was a minister of this parliament and his actions pertained to him being a minister of this parliament. Therefore, it has a relevance to this parliament. But $550,000 is a lot for taxpayers to pay and this parliament is entitled to a justification as how and why those costs were incurred at such a rate. Returning to the question of the $800,000 proposed appropriation for the minster for health, the distinction I made is an important one. I used the term 'slight'. The term 'slight' can refer to the difference in the amount of money that is made available-a d:fference of some $250,000. But the whole action which was the subject of the royal commission in Western Australia was taken by the present minister for health whilst she was the Premier of Western Australia. Any logical person looking at it would think that it had no relevance to this parliament, except that, should she be found in the early stages of the debate to have been guilty of lying, then she was not a fit and proper person to hold office in this parliament. That is indeed the argument that the Solicitor-General used in supporting after the event, not before the event, a decision of the cabinet that they would pay the fees and the legal expenses of the minster for health. The Solicitor-General made the point that the only reason this parliament could appropriate money for the taxpayer to pay the legal fees of the minster for health was that the royal commission in Western Australia was determining whether or not the minster for health was a fit and proper person to hold office in this parliament. That is a verj important point. What we have seen is a stonewalling by the Prime Minister and by the minister herself to accept those findings and to accept that the proper behaviour in a Westminster system is for that minister to resign. If that minister will not resign, then the Prime Minister should sack her. That, very simply, is the Westminster system and it has been observed in the breach; in other words, it has not been followed as it should be. Thus, we have here in the parliament a continuance of the debate on the affairs of the minster for health. Yesterday we saw the most peculiar action of the Speaker in ruling out of order a question which was dealing with the same material",21
7,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,Mr Rocher)Order! The honourable member cannot reflect on the chair in that way.,23
8,Mrs BISHOP,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"Yesterday we saw extraordinary things in this place which resulted in a motion of censure. First of all there was a dissent from the Speaker's ruling concerning his decision that, having allowed questions on this matter the previous day, on the occurrence yesterday he would not allow that question. We saw a dissent from that ruling debated, then we saw a censure motion moved against the minster for health. Both of those were lost along party lines, as would be predictable. Nonetheless, the debate was important and the principles that were raised were important. The Australian people will all know that, if $800,000 of their money were used in an appropriation for the minister's own department, it could result in perhaps greater attention being given to an immunisation policy, greater accent being given to the mental health program, and assistance to rural and regional Australians who miss out on so many services. That money could be put to a use which Australian people would well approve of. But they are being asked to pay $800,000 of their hard earned money to support a person who firstly tried to close down a properly constituted royal commission and then refuses to abide by any of the findings. She will not come before this House and explain why it is that 14 of her previous colleagues-her own colleagues; not members of the Liberal Party, not members of the National Party but members of the Labor Party and people who were staff-have given testimony which shows that the minister chose to lie. At no account has she ever stood up and tried to give a reason as to why this group of people would have conspired together against her and all told lies when she was supposed to be the only one telling the truth. I think Australian people know that that argument just does not wash. We are entitled to see the break-up of these fees because there is no way that the Australian people can be asked to meet any of the legal expenses of the minister for health in her attempt to close down a royal commission which finally showed the truth of that minister's actions. It has now been displayed that in this parliament we have a government which finds lying the order of the day, just as Graham Richardson set out in his book Whatever it Takes. That is what this government's credo is. The sooner we have an election and get rid of the government, the better.",23
9,Mr LATHAM,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"It is interesting to note in this debate on the Appropriation bills how the double standards and hypocrisy of the opposition have finally caught up with it. This is the same opposition which, for the last three or four months in public debate throughout the country, has been saying that the government should not fund the legal fees of the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) because the Marks royal commission is not relevant to her duties in the health portfolio. Now we have the extraordinary proposition from the opposition in this debate that it will move an amendment to cover a good part of the fees. It is now trying to argue that the findings of the Marks royal commission are directly relevant to the minister for health in the execution of her portfolio responsibilities in this parliament. What a stunning and hypocritical about-face for the opposition, including the member for Mackellar (Mrs Bishop), to be arguing month after month in this parliament-and outsideand in all the public forums, that the government should not be paying any of the legal fees of the minister for health because the Marks royal commission was not relevant to her duties as minister for health. That was the argument they put forward. Now, when they look fondly upon the bodgie findings of that royal commission, they want to mount the counterargument. They have done a total somersault; they are now saying that the minister should resign because the findings of the royal commission are relevant to her the duties as minister for health in this place. The Australian public will not have a bar of that sort of double standard and hypocrisy. This was reinforced by the presentation by the member for Mackellar. Of all the people in this place, fancy the member for Mackellar talking about inappropriate use of public funds. It is worth the House remembering the circumstances surrounding her entry to this place; how, when she decided to leave the Senate, she told her staff to take the redundancy payment, come and work on her campaign for the seat of Mackellar-a campaign effectively funded by the taxpayers-and then to sign up again, working for her upon her entry to the House of Representatives. What a shoddy act. This is clear evidence of someone who has tried to forge a reputation as a student, a gamekeeper of the public funds-but the gamekeeper turned poacher upon her election as the member for Mackellar. She told her staff to take the redundancy payment when she left the Senate and to come and work on her campaign, funded by the taxpayer. How much did that cost? Where is the accountability for that? It is totally hypocritical and shows double standards by the gamekeeper now turned poacher. We are awake up to the member for Mackellar and her rorting of the public purse. She has no credibility in a debate like this talking about the appropriate or inappropriate use of public funds. The truth is that it is proper for the government to pay all the fees of the minister for health associated with the legal work at the Marks royal commission and the challenge in other courts, if it can be shown that those fees and the royal commission were related to her portfolio duties. There is a simple test, a simple question, that even the member for Mackellar would understand. Would there have been a royal commission in Western Australia if Carmen Lawrence had not been a cabinet minister in the federal parliament? That is a simple question requiring a simple test. Would there have been a royal commission in Western Australia if she had been Carmen Lawrence ex-Premier of Western Australia, or Carmen Lawrence, academic at a university in the west? Would there have been a royal commission if she was simply Carmen Lawrence, business consultant, or Carmen Lawrence, plain ordinary citizen of Perth in Western Australia? Of course there would not have been a royal commission. The royal commission was motivated and established solely for a political purpose. It was not about Penny Easton's suicide, the Liberal Party's shabby involvement in the whole Easton affair or the intense personal relationships that members of the Liberal Party had with Easton. It was not about any of those matters. It was a loaded dice. It was a rigged roulette wheel. No matter how many times you threw the ball into the wheel, it came up with Carmen Lawrence's number. That was the fashion in which the terms of reference for the royal commission were established. Some in this debate have said that it was only kicked off by Keith Wilson. If he had not spoken to the Sydney Morning Herald, there would not have been a royal commission. The truth is that Richard Court and all the Liberal Party in Western Australia had been waiting month after month for any opportunity to establish an inquiry into Carmen Lawrence for a political purpose. All that happened out of that",24
10,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,Mr Rocher)in Order! The honourable member should refer to other members by their correct title.,25
11,Mr LA THAM,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"They wanted to establish an inquiry into the Minister for Human Services and Health in this place. The truth is that Keith Wilson is an ex-ALP member. He served the purpose perfectly. To have a Labor rat setting up the material upon which the Court government could establish a royal commission suited their purpose perfectly. I worry about people who join the Labor Party late in life-there were plenty of them in the Lawrence cabinet in Western Australia-but I worry more about Labor rats like Keith Wilson. We know the point here in parliament because the honourable member for Wills (Mr Cleary) proves it every day: there is nothing more bitter, twisted and destructive in public life than somebody who has ratted on the Labor Party. Keith Wilson was sitting in his North Fremantle manor, paid for out of parliamentary superannuation, with a Bible tucked under his arm saying, 'For all those years, I really didn't like the Labor Party. They didn't suit me.' This was someone deserting the Labor Party and willing to act in tandem with the Court government to establish this royal commission for an intensely political purpose. It was a royal commission founded in the sewer. A Labor rat acted in concert with Richard Court and the rodent in this place, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). The rat and the rodent acted in concert with Richard Court. The evidence for this",25
12,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,Order! The honourable member will withdraw that remark.,26
13,Mr LATHAM,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,It is a description put on him by Andrew Peacock; it is not mine.,26
14,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,Mr Rocher)Withdraw that unequivocally.,26
15,Mr LATHAM,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"With respect for your ruling, I will withdraw that unequivocally. This point has been made by the member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), who said that there had been liaison between the federal Liberal Party and Richard Court to establish the royal commission for a political purpose. But when he was tested on it in the parliament, he came up with the interesting equation that there had been liaison but no discussion. There had been liaison between the Leader of the Opposition; the shadow minister, the member for Chisholm; and the Court government to establish this royal commission, but there was no discussion. Are we to believe that there was liaison without a word spoken? Does he expect that we are so naive to believe that there was liaison through sign language? Was it a seance? Did this liaison take place by mental telepathy? These were tactics established solely for a political purpose, which was to undermine the credibility of a senior minister in this government. It has nothing to do with Penny Easton or her welfare, family or suicide. It has nothing to do with the Liberal Party's involvement or the truth of the issues surrounding that tragic episode. It was solely for the reason of base politics. In the three-week break since the last week, we have had a nice reminder of Liberal Party tactics, double standards and hypocrisy. None of it is new, because 20 years ago in the House of Representatives and the Senate the same standards were being played out. This is an echo of the double standards of the Liberal Party from 1975. A few weeks ago, we commemorated the 20th anniversary of the coup d' etat to oust the Whitlam government. The public comment from the 20th anniversary has confirmed many of the things we already knew. It has confirmed that Kerr acted more out of unfounded concern for his own future than any concern for the future of the parliament, democracy or the country. Kerr falsely believed that the Prime Minister was plotting to sack him. So Kerr, riddled by alcohol, paranoia and the goading of the Tory establishment, plotted to sack his Prime Minister.  of order: I think the opposition has so far allowed the member for Werriwa a great deal of latitude in his speech, which has traversed many different subjects.",26
16,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,Mr Rocher)Order! The honourable member will resume his seat. You can talk about anything which is relevant under appropriation debates.,26
17,Mr LATHAM,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"This is totally relevant to the tactics employed by the Liberal Party in 1995 and also in 1975. The shame of the matter is revealed by the absolute fact, now without dispute, that Malcolm Fraser as Leader of the Opposition knew more about the intentions of Governor General Kerr than did the Prime Minister. The 20th anniversary of the coup confirmed a second matter-that is, the crisis, which had it foundations in politics, would have resolved itself by conventional political means. There is no doubt whatsoever that Liberal senators Bonner and Jessop were about to vote to pass the Hayden budget. ",26
18,Mr LATHAM,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"I can understand why the member for Sturt is so worried about this. It reveals the double standards and hypocrisy of the Liberal Party. He is a young, fresh faced sitting member who has come in here starry eyed about the Liberal Party and what it stands for, and now he is finding out about all the double standards. The hypocrisy of 1975 is being repeated in 1995.  worry me.",26
19,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,You will not be sitting there much longer if you keep interrupting.,26
20,Mr LATHAM,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"It has been established that Malcolm Fraser met with Liberal Party premiers plus Joh Bjelke-Petersen to tell them that their governors had to refuse to issue the writs if Whitlam secured a half Senate election. So Fraser's strategy was based on this stunning double standard: state governors should follow the advice of their chief minister-even though it was an unprecedented, unorthodox and probably improper advice-to refuse to issue the writs for a half Senate election, but governors-general, in this case Kerr, should ignore the advice of their chief minister to do something that was improper and unprecedented: to sack the chief minister of a democratically elected government. That was an integral part of Fraser's strategy. How shabby is that? The current Leader of the Opposition, who was more than six years old at the time, knows the tactic well because he was sitting at Fraser's feet. The Liberal Party's trademark of double standards and hypocrisy is as evident in 1995 as it was in 1975. In relation to the Minister for Human Services and Health, the Leader of the Opposition is now saying that he wants her to be judged on matters which took place three years ago in another parliament. That is the standard he has set. This is the same Leader of the Opposition who will not be judged on his own past in this parliament, or on his own performance and his own public record in this parliament. He is establishing the framework by which the Liberal Party will go to the people with policies in which it does not believe. In the end, a party must run on ideology, conviction, policy and fundamental political belief. The Liberal and National parties in 1995 are in a sorry, empty state. They are basically saying that what they believe in and feel strongly about in politics were all part of the Fightback manifesto. The things in which the coalition believe in the 1990s, reflected in Fightback, are unelectable. So now their strategy for 1996 is to put to the people the things they do not believe in. No wonder its members have that hang dog look about them. They are half excited that they are ahead in the opinion polls. They also have that hang dog look because they are going to the people with things they do not believe in. This is a coalition without a soul, a purpose or a meaning. They will go to the people with policies they clearly do not believe in. You can see it in the faces of the members; you can see it in their body language in this parliament day after day. The double standard is clear: the Leader of the Opposition will not be judged on the things that he has placed on the public record in this parliament, but he wants to judge the minister for health on things that happened in another parliament three years ago. What a stunning double standard; what a stunning act of hypocrisy. It has been the trademark of the Liberal Party right through from the period 1975 to 1995. I now tum to the issue of the development of Fox studios at the Sydney showground which has been raised in Appropriation Bill (No.3) 1995-96, Appropriation Bill (No.4) 1995-96 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No.2) 1995-96. No-one should be surprised by the allocation of funds in this regard by the appropriation bills. It should come as no surprise because several years ago it was announced that the showground would be relocating to Homebush Bay in Sydney. It should come as no surprise because two years ago, when Sydney secured the Olympics for the year 2000, it was confirmed that the showground would be relocating to Homebush Bay. It should come as no surprise because, just 12 months ago in Creative Nation, the Prime Minister announced that Fox had agreed to establish its studios in Sydney. So everyone has known about the decision making process for a number of years. We have also known that the showground is in a shabby state. The site is asbestos ridden and there is a need to restore the land to some proper condition before it can be disposed for an alternative use. The redevelopment of the site by Fox represents the cheapest option available to the taxpayers. That is the evidence contained in the 1993 report prepared for the Fahey Liberal government in New South Wales by engineering consultants Norman Disney & Young. This report put the cost of restoring the site for use by the Royal Agricultural Society as a showground at $90 million. Alternatively, the cost of demolishing the showground area and converting it to parkland would be $50 million, with additional annual maintenance costs required. Under the agreement struck with Fox by the Carr government in New South Wales, the public expenditure will be just $32 million to clean up the site. The taxpayers will save between $20 million and $60 million for the clean-up costs because Fox studios will pay to upgrade the dilapidated heritage buildings and other public assets. This is a good deal for the taxpayer which is made better by the 1,600 jobs created in the development proposal and the $200 million addition to Sydney's economy. I have noticed some of the protests of the inner city indulgents which say that the showground should be converted to parkland. What sort of argument is this from inner city residents sitting up there in their manors overlooking Centennial Park when the inner city and the eastern suburbs of Sydney already have a huge share of the health resources, well out of proportion with their population, and a huge share of the jobs available in the Sydney metropolitan area, well out of proportion with their population? Not only do they want the oversupply of health services in the inner city and the oversupply of employment in the inner city, but they also want the oversupply of parkland. Anyone driving through that part of Sydney would notice Centennial Park, the largest and best kept parkland-at public expense-in all of the metropolitan area. They would also notice the extensive parkland associated with Moore Park. So why is there a need for extra parkland at the showground? In fact, the showground has had no constructive and sustained public use for many years. The benefits flowing from the Fox studios will be immense. I noticed the well named Penelope Rogers, who styles herself as the coordinator of Save the Showground for Sydney, had an article typically published in the Sydney Morning Herald dated 14 November. Her article began: Oh for peace and tranquillity! What a pity governments seem to overlook our natural craving for open space, for quiet places of escape where there is time for thought and reflection and contemplation, time for ourselves. If it is a natural feeling to have so much time on your hands in open space, why live in the middle of Sydney? This is a sham. She goes on in her article to say: The Showground was originally part of the Sydney Common, a 405-hectare grant made to the people of Sydney by Governor Macquarie in 1811. It is part of our heritage and because of the way in which it has been used, it is also intrinsically tied to the ongoing history of NSW. The people supporting the use of the showground as parkland want the whole Sydney common-the whole 405 hectares-to be restored. That includes their own homes. The land covering the original Sydney common includes the homes of all the people surrounding Centennial Park and all the residents surrounding the Sydney showground. If they really want the government to tum over the use of the showground for parkland, they should also donate their own homes and property to the public sector for an equivalent purpose. Theirs is an absolutely ridiculous argument. I notice that this has formed part of a campaign of editorial policy at the Sydney Morning Herald. My assessment is that this newspaper is inappropriately named, given its editorial policy. It should be the 'Gentrified Morning Herald'. It is not a 'Sydney Morning Herald' because it has no wide ranging interest in metropolitan issues across all of Sydney. It is a paper that runs campaigns on airports and parkland for the inner city, for the inner city gentry. It should be renamed the 'Gentrified Morning Herald' as a better description of its purpose and its editorial policy. I notice that just last Saturday it ran a full page of showground letters to the editor: from Mosman, Double Bay, Paddington, Edgecliff, Bayview, Darlinghurst, Bondi Junction, Bowral-the landed gentry in full force, the bourgeoisie come out to play-and Chippendale. This is not a newspaper that represents broad interests in Sydney. It runs inner city campaigns for a false purpose. It has fouled its own nest in relation to airports, scared everyone in Sydney about airport noise, run down property values in the inner city way beyond the narrow flight path, and scared people in western and southwestern Sydney-falsely so-about the potential noise impact of Badgerys Creek airport. It has been fouling its own nest on airport noise and on parkland issues. I think it is appropriate for the parliament to note these things and also note the nature of the opposition by the Liberal Party. What have they ever built in New South Wales? Name one thing the Liberal Party has built in New South Wales or any other part of the country. (Time expired)",26
21,Mr CAMERON,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"Stirling) (11.01 a.m.)This bill seeks to authorise the spending of $800,000 by the Attorney-General's Department in respect of legal costs incurred by the former Western Australian premier and now Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) for representation at the Marks royal commission. Last week Kenneth Marks handed down his report and the headline of the West Australian summed up his report in two words: 'She lied'. Mr Marks concluded that the Minister for Human Services and Health fabricated events, untruthfully denied receiving briefings on the Easton allegations before the petition was tabled and lied to the Canberra press gallery. Her co-conspirator, John Halden, was found to have 'a glittering indifference to truth accuracy'. This man is a despicable person who ought to be sacked if Jim MCGinty, whom the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) thinks is a liar, had any leadership. From the day the royal commission was announced, the Labor Party have tried to undermine and insult any person associated with the royal commission and suggested improper motives behind the calling of it. The threats of the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith) against any person who agreed to head the royal commission were backed up by the Prime Minister. The minister has described it as a campaign of hate and malice. Even before the royal commission's report was brought down, the Minister for Housing and Regional Development (Mr Howe) said that the findings would not be of great significance. The Labor Party has put up more red herrings than a Russian trawler. Let us look at some of the facts. It was Reverend Keith Wilson, then a Labor Party member, who first raised the matter that Dr Lawrence knew of the petition before it was tabled, some say at the urging of the office of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley). Would it not be ironic if the Deputy Prime Minister became the member for Fremantle at the next election? There is something to think about. Pam Beggs, another Labor Party member, came to the defence of Keith Wilson. The Labor Party said that she was a disaffected member of their party. They even went so far as to call into question Reverend Wilson's emotional stability. It was on the evidence and utterances of members of the Labor Party that the royal commission was called. The Prime Minister and the Minister for Human Services and Health have put forward a number of furphies about the royal commission. The first is that it was a political royal commission. Every royal commission into the conduct of a political figure is going to result in political advantage to his or her opponents. Does this mean we can never investigate corrupt conduct on the part of politicians? The second furphy is cost. You cannot place a price on justice. Lying to parliament is the moral equivalent of lying to a court. In and Western Australia lying to a court carries a 14-year gaol term. The third furphy relates to the question of different memories. The minister when premier was asked in state parliament about the petition for the first time only a couple of weeks after it was tabled. It was not as if she had to recall the petition in the royal commission for the first time. If she is saying that she remembers it differently to the other 14 such a short time after the event, then she is not fit to hold office. I would like to turn my attention to a matter which has been brought to my attention by a number of constituents which fits in nicely when you look at the $800,000 attempted to be spent on a discredited minister's legal bills. This is a concern which I also voice on my own behalf, regarding the emergence of the Cash Converters organisation in Australia and now, apparently, also abroad. The business news sections of the West Australian newspaper on Monday, 20 November carried an article headlined, 'London listing for $17m Cash Converters float'. In recent weeks, the national press has carried stories indicating plans on behalf of the organisation to float on the stock exchanges in both Australia and the United Kingdom. I also understand that the organisation is negotiating to commence large-scale operations in the United States. A recent issue of Business Directions quoted a Cash Converters director as saying: We now have 117 stores in Australia, and are aiming at 250 around the country within the next three to four years. There are also more than 40 stores in England, six in New Zealand, one in South Africa, and one in France. Canada, Scotland, Ireland and the US are about to open, and we're talking with people who want to open in Japan, Spain, Holland and Germany. The article in the West Australian of 20 November refers to 124 franchised stores in Australia and 68 overseas stores. That would indicate a growth of more than 50 stores within just a few months. What is of concern is that this entire industry exists as a seemingly legitimate front for the huge and growing market in stolen goods. The traditional pawnbroking industry always suffered a rather unsavoury reputation, derived not so much from allegations of usury as from the public perception that stolen goods found their way into the pawnbroking system. The arrival of Cash Converters has not seen any shrinking of the traditional pawnbroker's industry. On the contrary, this massive organisation appears to have created an entire new opportunity for an up-scaling of the market for stolen goods. Of even greater concern is the role that these stores have in the cycle of crime in our society. The typical example-and I am told this is an everyday event at virtually every Cash Converters store-involves a drug user stealing goods, often from families and otherwise by unlawful break-ins. The goods are sold at ridiculously low prices to Cash Converters to obtain money for the next drug fix. The money thus finds its way into the hands of the drug dealers and is then laundered in any of the myriad ways which seem to elude our law enforcement agencies. Some of my constituents have undertaken extensive investigations of this organisation at their private expense. The investigations have encompassed a far-ranging search of business name registers and Australian Securities Commission records which have unearthed a vast array of companies comprising a most intricate commercial structure. Many of these companies are, of course, franchisees-that is, companies owned by people operating Cash Converters outlets. That there should be a large number of such companies comes as no surprise. What is surprising is the intricate network of corporations closely aligned to key directors of the parent company and of Cash Converters Finance Ltd. I am advised that even the maintenance of basic statutory records and compliance with ASC requirements on behalf of what I would call the head office group of companies itself would run into hundreds of thousands of dollars per annum. The other thing that my constituents have discovered is a wealth of evidence to indicate that the organisation pays mere lip-service to its obligations under state laws to avoid dealing in stolen goods. My constituents have obtained details of numerous transactions where the organisation has failed to make adequate identity checks. In some instances no identity checks at all have been required. My constituents have also unearthed a number of transactions which are so patently at odds with commercial reality that the company must know or be deemed to know that it is dealing in stolen goods. For example, one transaction involved goods to the value of $6,000 being purchased by Cash Converters for a mere $100. My constituents believe, but cannot prove, that these goods were subsequently on-sold for an unknown sum not to a member of the general public but to a then senior executive of Cash Converters, whom I am reluctant to name under parliamentary privilege until I have further proof. The goods are now believed to be fitted to that person's pleasure boat. In another instance involving another pawnbroker-not Cash Converters in this instance-televideo equipment clearly marked as belonging to Channel Ten and having an estimated value of $10,000 was also purchased for the sum of $100. No effort was made to record the identity of the vendor. My constituents pose a number of very interesting questions. For example, why is it that an organisation of the size of Cash Converters and with a self-admitted turnover in excess of $170 million per annum in Australia alone has never been able to lodge with the ASC or its predecessors a set of accounts indicating a profit or indeed indicating that they have ever paid taxes? As I pose that question, I also note that the $170 million referred to in the article in the West Australian refers to estimated sales of second-hand goods stated by the group in its prospectus. As a franchisor, the parent does not have any sales of goods; rather, it has income from franchise fees. I ask whether or not that very statement in relation to turnover is itself misleading in a manner that would never be tolerated by the Australian Securities Commission. Why does the organisation consistently fail to enforce proper use and verification of official identity materials? Despite the company's crowing to the contrary, their internal rules regarding client identity are rarely enforced. My constituents have obtained numerous examples that show that the so-called company policy is observed most commonly in the breach. Why have the law enforcement agencies failed to recognise the extent of this cancer and sought to eradicate it? State police in Western Australia have a small dealers squad which simply does not have the resources to properly check the transactions of second hand dealers generally, and it has certainly not sought to single out Cash Converters in particular. On the other hand, my constituents have obtained evidence of an extraordinary degree of cooperation between the Cash Converters organisation and the Western Australian police, even to the extent that representatives of Cash Converters were at one stage directed by a senior officer to attend regional police meetings. Whilst there is no clear evidence of corrupt behaviour in the relationship between Cash Converters and the Western Australian police, the inability of the police to conclude basic investigations and pursue simple prosecutions is a cause for great concern. Why have national law enforcement agencies failed to recognise the role of this organisation in the cycle of crime in Australia? Why have they not used their powers to seek to arrest the damage? The National Crime Authority already enjoys a reference in relation to money laundering and a general reference in relation to organised crime. On either basis, the authority should consider itself obliged at the very least to fully investigate the organisation. I do not seek to initiate a witch-hunt in relation to that proposition. I merely say that the self-evident degree of association with the stolen goods market and the massive national bill associated with theft of property demand that the possible links be fully investigated. If the organisation is cleared in such an investigation, then so be it, but that there should be no investigation at all is intolerable. On both sides of the House we speak long and hard about law and order and about organised crime. Here, when we find such a massive organisation right under our nose, we say that the problem is too hard and we therefore decline to act. This problem is not going to go away, and this parliament should have the courage to redress the situation in the interests of our community. We should also make specific inquiry and make public our concerns in order that this cancer should not spread abroad. The present proposal for the company to float on the stock exchange in the United Kingdom could seriously tarnish our reputation abroad and label Australia as the country which legitimised organised crime. When we are talking about appropriations, perhaps more of the funds could be better spent in an area of sorting out this organised crime. I would like to bring to the attention of the House of Representatives a letter I received from a constituent of mine who was offended recently by the actions of our Prime Minister. I would like to read her letter to the House to make the House and, in particular, the Prime Minister aware that his performance was arrogant, uncaring, un-Australian and unbecoming of the holder of the office of Prime Minister. Mr Truss-What's new?",29
22,Mr CAMERON,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"What's new, indeed. My constituent's letter reads: Dear Mr Cameron During the Channel Seven news on Friday 20th October 1995 the Prime Minister, Mr Keating made a ... remark about Mr John Howard on a talk back radio program fumbling with his headset and suggested he had St Vitas Dance. I was appalled by that insensitive remark. St Vitas Dance in the last century was likened to several neurological illnesses. Huntington's Disease has been identified as one of those illnesses. A ""Genetic time bomb"", a victim perhaps can spend 15 to 30 years of what should be their best productive years waiting for their ultimate death, as their mental and physical ties slowly decline. For Mr Keating to stand before an audience and publicly make fun of these people and their carers is irresponsible and insulting; unbecoming of any adult particularly one in public office. These people need to make it a priority to see for themselves the daily nightmare Huntington's patients and their carers endure. In Western Australia, there is a marvellous association of committed and dedicated people who devote their lives ensuring their members have dignity and their carers support as this illness ravages their systems. There is no cure but, prayerfully, research is making progress. As my Parliamentarian, I felt the need to convey my distress to you as Mr Keating, our Prime Minister, hurt so many people with this thoughtless remark. This incident is more disturbing as it was made to score political points off Mr Howard. I do not expect that we will have an apology from the Prime Minister, but perhaps the $800,000 misdirected towards propping up a discredited minister might be better off spent on research into diseases like Huntington's disease. Finally, all members would have received the annual report of the Department of Administrative Services. I would particularly like to speak on Australian Construction Services. The annual report showed that in 1994-95 Australian Construction Services made an operating loss of $8,343,000. The previous year, it made an operating loss of $4,069,000. The annual report stated: ACS's trading performance over the past four years has been poor. The major causes of these results are the introduction of competition in a shrinking or static market. I was glad to read further: A wide ranging review of management and administrative efficiency was undertaken during the year and decisions implemented to address the problems identified. The most significant of these was the decision to close down ACS and create a new and more tightly focused business unit. While I realise there are some important aspects of ACS which need to be maintained, the work required of it is minimal, so I am glad that it is closing down. The new business unit should be given guidelines under which capaciit will operate, and such guidelines should only be for confidential government work full stop. It should not compete with private enterprise, and private enterprise should be employed to do the non-confidential work. I have been contacted by a consulting engineer who has been forced to compete with ACS. He asked, 'Why do I as a taxpayer have to pay a government authority to be in competition with me?' I agree. Why should taxpayers subsidise the ACS to compete with private enterprise when it comes in cheap, beats private enterprise for contracts and, at the end of the day, as proved in the annual report, makes a loss which is simply paid for by the taxpayers? It is not the business, the home and the life of the ACS employees on the line if it makes a loss. Taxpayers will make up the difference. But if private enterprise make a loss, they are down the gurgler, as we all know. My constituent further writes: Currently, there are many examples where wethat is, his engineering companyhave lost work to ACS because of their 'cheap fees'. It is easy to see how they do it. The 6 November issue of the Business Review Weekly shows that despite cutting the work force from 2,000 to 550 it has still in the last four years required a cash injection of $40 million. The article shows that the corporatisation of the ACS is not working. There is no need for a government agency which is subsidised by the taxpayer and its infrastructure funded by the taxpayer to compete with private enterprise. The minister should seriously consider closing down ACS or its new business unit. Why should we have taxpayer funded agencies competing with private enterprise? There is no need for the government to compete in the marketplace when there is a suitable private alternative. What is to stop the government setting up a new separate government agency which competes with the corner deli, for instance? The argument is the same: if they cannot compete with corner delis, why allow them to compete with engineers and the like. There is simply no room for ACS or a new business unit like it to compete against private enterprise. The minister ought to put an immediate stop to it. We do not need government having separate business arms when there are numerous very successful businesses doing the job the government is seeking to do. There is no room for ACS in the marketplace.",32
23,Mr CLEELAND,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"MCEwen) (11.19 a.m.)During the grievance debate on Monday I raised my concerns about the Victorian Minister for Sport, Recreation and Racing, the Hon. Tom Reynolds, and his relationship with the Victorian Greyhound Racing Control Board. I referred to the Herald-Sun of 17 November 1995, which detailed how the honourable gentleman received a lucrative lease of a greyhound which won $15,715 from the Victorian Greyhound Racing Control Board. Apparently, the arrangement was that Reynolds, when he was shadow minister, and the then state Liberal Party president, Mr Kroger, got a dog known as Liberal Victory under lease from the Greyhound Racing Control Board in return for paying to the board one per cent of their winnings. That dog, according to this newspaper report, won $15,715. The then shadow minister is now, of course, the minister for sport and is the minister responsible for organising and controlling the Greyhound Racing Control Board. It raises a number of questions. Firstly, it raises the probity of any member of parliament receiving a gift of $ 15,OOO-odd from a government body which has control over a racing industry. It raises the question of why the Hon. Tom Reynolds, when he became minister and in charge of the Greyhound Racing Control Board, did not immediately reveal the relationship he had with that board. In fact, it is known that some three weeks after his appointment as a minister that dog raced and winnings were made. It raises further questions as to the probity of the board itself-very serious questions of probity. The Greyhound Racing Control Board is the body that regulates and controls greyhound racing in Victoria but, apparently, it owns racing dogs. How many racing dogs does the greyhound board in Victoria own? It certainly has one-Liberal Victory-which was lease gifted to a Victorian member of parliament, now the minister, but how many more dogs does it own? What other favourable leases has it entered into? How many other Victorians have received from the Victorian Greyhound Racing Control Board similar benefits? And why does the regulatory body of greyhound racing in Victoria own dogs? Under what possible circumstances is it appropriate for the regulatory body of dog racing in Victoria to own dogs and be involved as a participant in the industry? They are proper questions to which you cannot get answers in Victoria. They are questions that go to both probity of the regulatory body and probity of the minister. Yesterday, the shadow minister in Victoria, Jan Wilson, asked the Premier of Victoria a question on the ethics of his minister being in a position of receiving such a gift. Jeffrey 'Glib' Kennett had a very quick response. 'It is very simple,' he said, 'you're jealous.' In other words, 'What is wrong with one of my ministers being in a position of receiving gifts from a body which that minister now has the statutory responsibility of supervising?' It is pretty frightening. I know many members on both sides of this House would be very concerned about that, so I will not say that is general Liberal Party attitude. I will say that, in Victoria, it is Liberal government attitude. That is the way the Premier does things in Victoria. I really think it is time-if there is any decency, honesty and probity in government at allthat a major inquiry be instituted into the operation of the Greyhound Racing Control Board in Victoria. I want to know and I can tell you, from the phone calls I received after I raised the issue, that people in the industry want to know how many dogs the board has got and how many other little leases like this one it has entered into. Mr Carr, the general manager of the control board, yesterday said publicly that it is all above board and that it is okay. So obviously Mr Carr is not going to tell us exactly what is going on down there in Victoria. It also raises other concerns. As I said on Monday, it is known that in at least 30 races in Victoria involving dogs drugs have been used. How are the drugs administered? What sort of supervision is being undertaken by stewards and the Greyhound Racing Control Board in Victoria that does not prevent in at least 30 races dogs being doped before the race? It is pretty lax and it is pretty frightenAustralia ing. I see no evidence of any attitude by the government in Victoria to do anything about it. It is swept under the carpet in typical Jeffrey 'Glib' Kennett style. In Victoria it has taken over two years to get the Victoria Police to investigate a major dog breeding scam involving the dog Malawi Prince, yet yesterday I was informed on the telephone by other dog racing people in Victoria that that is not the only scam. There are other instances where high fees have been paid for a major sire, yet the bitch has been mated with an inferior dog despite the high fee being paid. There is not just one dog involved in this scam; there are other dogs. There has been no response from the Victorian government to undertake any decent inquiry into the quite serious allegations involving dog racing. Other allegations put to me yesterday involved the fact that bookmakers in Victoria can own and race a dog. Stop and think about that. How is it proper in the racing industry for a bookmaker to own a racing dog and be able to race it? Apparently probity does not exist in the dog racing industry in Victoria. I was given the name of a bookmaker who owns a dog and races it in Victoria and still attends the track as a bookmaker. That leads to the risk of absolute corruption. It is just not good enough. This raises issues, also, of the way the police now operate in Victoria. Let me say at the outset, as a member of the Victorian Retired Police Association, that I have nothing but absolute praise for all police forces and all police officers in Australia. Mr Lindsay-Spoken well as a former policeman yourself.",33
24,Mr CLEELAND,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"Despite a very difficult lifestyle and a very difficult job, Australia is generally very well served by its police officers. I have been proud to be a member of the Victorian police force. Nevertheless, events have occurred in Victoria which raise critical issues involving the Victorian police force. When the former chief commissioner of police in Victoria retired his position was advertised. A number of senior police in applied for that position. None of those applicants was accepted and the position was re-advertised. Unbeknown to people at the time, Superintendent Kevin Holliday-a card carrying member of the Liberal partytogether with a state Liberal member of parliament went to Queensland and saw then Assistant Commissioner Comrie, a relatively junior policeman in terms of experience but a former serving Victorian police officer. I have no doubt that Mr Comrie is a person of integrity. This is not an attack on Mr Comrie but, rather, on the political system which is now working in Victoria. When the position was advertised Mr Comrie had not applied. When it was re-advertised, and after the visit by Superintendent Kevin Holliday and the Liberal Party member of parliament, Mr Comrie applied. Guess who got the job? Mr Comrie! As I said, he was a relatively junior police officer. His appointment cost the loss to the Victorian police force of Assistant Commissioner John Frame-a very highly respected police officerand Bernie Masterton, the most senior woman police officer ever to have been appointed in Victoria. Those people left the police force, leaving no doubt in anyone's mind that they were disgusted with the way the appointment was made. Again there is no suggestion that Mr Comrie is anything other than a fine, moral, and upright serving police officer. But he did not apply for the job in the first place. Superintendent Kevin Holliday went on to become the chief of staff of the new chief commissioner. Chief Commissioner Comrie signed one of the new Kennett government contracts. In the past the chief commissioner of police was totally independent of government and had a permanent position. He was totally separated from government under the separation of powers doctrine. The new chief superintendent of police in Victoria is under contract. He has no permanency of position and is subject to the terms of the contract. The contract contains performance conditions on industrial relations and reducing crime. Obviously, the minister for police can impose requirements upon the chief commissioner of police; hence that independence or that separation has gone in Victoria. That is a worry. Of course, Superintendent Kevin Holliday became chief of staff and controlled the media in the Kennett Victorian police force. Now there are attempts in Victoria to place assistant commissioners on contract with the chief commissioner having the right to hire and fire, with no right of appeal whatsoever. So if Mr Comrie doesn't like you, you go, and no appeal is possible. That is totally new in terms of police service where there has always been an appeals board where police have had the right to appeal against either non-appointment to senior positions or unnecessary or perceived to be wrongful dismissal. It is changing in Victoria. It seems to me that sometimes we forget the events that occurred in Queensland where Russell Hinze controlled the racing industry. We found out through the Fitzgerald inquiry how corrupt that was. We forget that Terry Lewis, the disgraced former chief commissioner in Queensland, was in a position where he controlled totally the appointments and the promotions within the Queensland police force. Through the Fitzgerald inquiry, we now know just how corrupt that was. Yet in Victoria, the Kennett government is establishing a police system where the right to hire and fire is being put into the hands of a single person and that person is subject to a contract-is not permanent-with the state government. If that does not cause concern in Australia, nothing ever will. Fitzgerald in his report pointed out that one of the major problems in the Queensland police force was the absolute power that Terry Lewis had and was given by that corrupt government. Those lessons of history, those lessons on the causes and reasons for corruption, are being lost in Victoria. The potential-and I say no more than that-for that form of corruption and absolute control is starting to emerge, despite the fact that I accept the integrity of the people involved. It is not their integrity that worries me; it is the political system. Once you put it in place, it is possible to have that corruption. Quite apart from the scams on dogs and the absolute rottenness of the dog racing industry in Victoria, other matters have arisen since I did an interview on the Today show this morning and was asked about New South Wales and corruption in harness racing. I pointed out that over a number of years as a member of parliament I have received a lot of anecdotal evidence about corruption in harness racing. I have never doubted for a moment that there is corruption in harness racing because owners of horses and trainers of horses have told me that horses and races are fixed. I have accepted that. The recent report on jockeys in Australia found they were being paid off and that horseracing was subject to corruption by jockeys. I understand that in New South Wales there is an inquiry called the Roderick inquiry and a report called the Roderick report. This morning I have received a number of phone calls from people in the harness industry who tell me that in New South Wales it is pretty crook and has been for a number of years. I hope that that Roderick report will be acted upon. I am told there have been a number of reports over different governments in New South Wales drawing attention to institutionalised corruption in the harness industry. It seems to me that, when you look at the allegations of corruption, many of them now verified, in dog racing in Victoria and allegations of institutionalised corruption in harness racing in New South Wales, you have to accept that this flows on to other states because Victorian horses race in New South Wales and New South Wales bred and trained horses race in Victoria. You have to accept that if there is corruption in New South Wales, as alleged, that corruption is not just limited to New South Wales. Indeed, my anecdotal evidence in Victoria from people I have known in the industry for a number of years is that it is corrupt in Victoria. It seems to me that with all these allegations it is time there was a major inquiry into the entire racing industry in Australia-dog and horse, including harness. There has been enough evidence exposed in Australia recently to show that unarguably there is corruption. We have ministers who are compromised, as is the case with the Hon. Tom Reynolds, who is compromised in his position as minister. I do not expect a fair and open inquiry into the allegations about dogs in Victoria when the Premier says: 'You are only jealous', and the minister is compromised. It is time an independent body was given sufficient power to make a proper inquiry into the whole industry. In my view, that has to be the National Crime Authority. A special reference should be given to the National Crime Authority by the states, if they have any concern at all, so it can use its special powers, its royal commission powers, to have a thorough inquiry into the whole rotten mess that involves racing in Australia today. If that is not done, then the allegations being put to me will never be properly tested. The states do not seem to want to do anything about it; they would rather sweep it under the carpet because it is all too difficult. If it is done, then decent, ordinary people will suffer. Greyhound owners are generally wage earners; it is a sport they can afford. They put a lot of money into their dogs. They tell me they are concerned. They are not going to get justice. They are going to be part of an industry the allegations about which have merit and they are not going to get satisfaction. We are going to have a harness industry in which for years I have been told you can fix races. Now in New South Wales there is evidence of institutionalised corruption. Minister Wheeler indicated in the New South Wales Parliament, I understand this week, that he was not prepared to release the Roderick report because it would cause the death of people-a pretty big statement to make. If that is correct-if the material contained in the Roderick report is such that people's lives are at risk on releasing it-then it has to go a bit beyond a state police institution; it has to go national. It has to go to a body with very powerful investigative capacity, such as the National Crime Authority. I firmly believe that it is now time for the states to give that special reference to the National Crime Authority. I would urge strongly that that be done.",34
25,Mr COBB,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"I have raised in this chamber before on a number of occasions the need for the government to extend the exceptional circumstances drought assistance to a number of areas of desperate need in my electorate. While I have had some success with the government, it seems that the worse areas are still receiving no assistance. To, hopefully, bring home to the government the great need that is out there I would like to read a letter that I have received from one of my constituents. I have the writer's permission to use the letter and the name. It is from a Mr Keith Morgan, of Bundella, Cobar. He writes: I write in reference to the drought exceptional circumstances provisions. We run a 60,000 acre property 40 kilometres north-west of Cobar called Bundella. We have been in drought conditions here for the past five years except for a brief break in 1993. In the last few years I have had to shoot over 4,000 sheep to save not them from starvation with no assistance, monetary or otherwise, from the government. In January of this year we had 14 inches of rain, which effectively wiped out in excess of 100 head of cattle. They were bogged to their stomachs and once again I had to take the gun out and shoot these cattle. I might add I came away close to shooting myself on that occasion. We were not entitled to any assistance for the loss of these cattle. No feed grew after that rain, as the temperature was in the 40s and of course no feed will grow when it is that hot. It is now 10 months down the track and we still have 60,000 acres of bare ground with no feed on it and we still are not entitled to Exceptional Circumstances assistance. In August we had to auction the majority of our farm machinery to pay interest at the bank-still no Exceptional Circumstances. We have around 40 sheep left and around 200 head of cattle which we are still feeding, so that we will have something left when this devastating drought finally ends. Without any assistance in the near future we will be forced to sell the rest of our cattle as our gets higher by the month with virtually no income. My wife's great grandmother was the second white woman in Cobar and our land has been in her family for 5 generations now. We are slowly losing everything and working hard to do it. I ask you if this is the way the Australian Government treats descendants of people who pioneered the western division of NSW what hope is there for anyone else? Our health is suffering from the constant stress, our finances were depleted long ago and our will to keep going has just about gone. The Baptist Church recently helped us by paying our phone and power bill which we are very grateful for. We have many more unpaid bills again and we are at the bank's mercy. Sir I invite you and your colleagues to come out and have a look for yourself at the desperate situation we and many others in this area are in. If you did you could see for yourself that these are not just idle words. It is fact and reality and all efforts by the Cobar RLPB and others in the last 12 months seem to have fallen on deaf ears. It is an injustice of the highest order and only serves to burden us with a lot of unnecessary stress. We have had about as much as we can take and we ask you please to look into this matter as soon as possible before we are all down the drain. I rang the Morgans to have a chat to them after that letter and got on to Keith's wife, Pam, who confirmed much of what was in that letter. For example, when the rain fell in January, the cattle were in a weakened state. They went chasing the green pick down on the fiats. They got bogged up to their bellies. The Morgans still had their tractors thenthey had not yet sold them-and they managed to pull a number of the cattle out. They gave them the usual tender loving care of water and hay, et cetera, but none of the cattle ever stood up again. All that work was for nothing and they had to shoot the lot. I was in Cobar last Saturday at an event and the Morgans were coming into town that day, so I met them both-and I have to say that I was very impressed with this couple. He has been away driving a truck for the council to earn some off-farm incomewhich, ironically, excludes him from the hardship assistance provisions. He is driving this truck about 150 kilometres south of where they live, so she is on the property on interest her own at night, which many wives are in these circumstances. It is not something that she relishes but it is something you have to put up with in the bush. She has to cut scrub for the catde, mainly with a chainsaw. She had bruises from where one of the mulga trees that she was cutting had fallen over her. That is one of the things you have to put up with, I suppose. It reminded me of the line in John Williamson's song-just another day on our selection. I raise this case to show there are very genuine people in need of assistance. While we are all very careful, hopefully, not to waste taxpayers' money I believe there are hundreds of cases like this in my electorate where people deserve assistance because they are pulling their weight: earning export income for Australia, trying to keep bread on the table and trying to keep off the dole. Yet nothing is forthcoming for them. A couple of weeks previous to that I had visited properties north of Wilcannia, up towards Tilpa. People there had contacted me on a number of occasions. I was grateful to Murray MCClure of Trevallyn at Wilcannia and Stephen Cresswell of Annalara Station at Wilcannia for taking me around. We drove for several kilometres over totally bare ground in black country and in red country. To drive for tens of kilometres and not see one blade of grass is a depressing experience indeed. Tens of square kilometres out there have been totally de-stocked, yet this area also does not receive any exceptionable circumstance assistance. These people are at their wits end as to what to do. In the last two years, they have received five inches of rain and 5Y2 inches of rain. Of the 5- inches, 350 points of that fell in one day and basically ran off. The RASAC report-RASAC went there and did an inspection-says that this area had received too much rain. I am honestly at a loss to understand the criteria that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Bob Collins) has laid down for RASAC to go by in determining who should be recommended for exceptionable circumstance assistance. In the summers of 1993-94 and 1994-95, it says that the Wilcannia area got 93 per cent too much rain and 84 per cent too much rain respectively. Possibly there was some area in the board that did get too much rain, but I have yet to see it. There are only a handful of properties there, but they are probably as big as the whole Rural Lands Protection Board area towards the east of my electorate. These people have no feed. They cannot get agistment for their stock. In many cases, they cannot get further loans from the bank. These families are desperate. The criteria are patently ridiculous. As I have said in this place before, the minister has to come to a decision. Either he wants to help people who are genuinely in need or he does not. If he does not want to help them, that is fair enough-that is the government's prerogative-but he should not pretend that he is helping them when he is patently not. I appeal again to the minister to look at these cases. I will mention division A of the Nyngan Rural Lands Protection Board, which I have raised in this place before. The RASAC report says that they received 27 per cent too much rain in the autumn of 1995. It says in the report that the rainfall was effective. The rain virtually fell in a day. The New South Wales Department of Agriculture, the council, the Rural Lands Protection Board and the Department of Agriculture district agronomists whom I have spoken to said that the rain was ineffective because the soils are hard-setting and the water ran off. You can see for yourself how the water ran. You can see the stones that have been turned over in the fast flowing water and the erosion that was caused. What does the RASAC report say? I do not know what goes on in the minds of these RASAC people. The report says: New South Walesby that, I presume they mean the New South Wales Department of Agriculturehas argued that this rainfall has been ineffective. However, the BRSI am not quite sure what BRS stands for; it is probably the Bureau of Rabid Socialistsconcludes that there is no convincing evidence that this rainfall has been ineffective for pasture growth. They go on to say: . .. these soil types typically disaggregate in response to cooler temperatures ... and has concluded that soil structure is unlikely to have been a major factor in limiting the effectiveness of the rainfall. I really do not know what more you can do. To my eyes-I have had some training in this area-it is patently obvious that these people are in desperate need of assistance, yet they are getting none. The RASAC report says that there will be another review of these areas at the end of spring. Apart from the fact that these people have not had a spring, I presume that that means now, because, if you go by the calendar, the end of this month will be the end of spring. I have heard that RASAC is visiting the areas that already have exceptional circumstance assistance to see whether that assistance should be removed or not. I appeal to the minister to direct RASAC to go back to these areas and listen again to the people on the ground in Condobolin, Nyngan, Wilcannia and Cobar in the rural lands protection boards. They should reassess them and see that they are included for assistance, which is only their basic right if we are setting out to help these people. I notice that in these specific appropriation bills the government is asking us for several hundreds of millions of dollars to fill in the holes and failures of its last budget. I do remember that when the Treasurer (Mr Willis) announced the budget he made great play of the fact that the budget would bring down a surplus this year of $718 million. We looked at how the surplus was composed-the spending, revenue and asset sales components-and we said that it was highly unlikely to take place, that far from there being a surplus there would be a deficit. The government mocked us at some length and said that there would definitely be a surplus, and here we are a few months down the track and the government is admitting there can be no surplus this year. The budget, again, will be in deficit this year to the tune of several billions of dollars.",36
26,Mr WALKER,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,Thanks to the Liberal Party. Mr Truss-You can't sell the Commonwealth Bank.,39
27,Mr COBB,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"I will come to that in a minute. Since the May budget the government has introduced some new spending initiatives of $917 million that it did not announce at the time, and that alone would have wiped out the surplus the minister was just referring to. No doubt there will be more spending initiatives when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) hands down his December initiative statement, let alone what may be announced when the election is called next year. The deficit will be quite substantial on those factors alone. This is a government which before the last election clearly said there would be no new taxes. Of course, it is not saying that now we are coming up to another election. We have promised there will be no new taxes and no increase in taxes, and the government has refused to give the same commitment. The obvious reason is that it will have to raise taxes to try to balance its budget in the future. This government has had failed asset sales, despite the announcements in the May budget. The sale of ANL has been nothing less than a complete and utter farce, and it is absolutely beholden to the trade unions there. We have had delay after delay and have paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to people like Neville Wran and Malcolm Turnbull whose achievements in this area have amounted to absolutely zilch. There has been no value whatsoever for the taxpayer's money. The government announced it would be selling the AIDC, and it has failed. After promising that it would not sell the Commonwealth Bank-and I forget how many years in a row it has made this announcement-the government announced yet again that it will sell the rest of it. It looks as though that too may fall through, so a couple of thousand million dollars have gone there. There has been the blocking in the Senate of the 12 per cent tax on the building industry. We make no apology for blocking that tax. We would have blocked more but the Australian Democrats only came with us on that particular issue. So there was a shortfall of a couple of hundred million dollars on that issue. But before the last election the government promised that there would be no increase in building industry taxes. It made that faithful promise to the Australian people. Therefore, we do not apologise for moving in the way in which we did. There are a couple of other components in these appropriation bills which have received a lot of publicity and comment from previous speakers. One component is the amount of $544,000 to pay the legal fees of the member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths). This is an act of grace payment made by the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) under section 34A of the Audit Act 1901. I do not want to make any more comments about that component except to say that it does alarm me that the legal fees these days are so excessive. Mr Hollis-We're in the wrong profession.",39
28,Mr COBB,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"Yes, the honourable member makes a fairly pertinent comment. That amount of $544,000 is very large indeed. Then there is the $800,000 component for payment of the legal fees of the Minister for Human Services and Health, Dr Carmen Lawrence. That was not an act of grace payment. It was decided in a different manner. It was a cabinet decision to pay that amount. We on this side of the House have decided to oppose the payment of $244,000 of that component because it did not relate directly to the Marks royal commission. The health minister wanted to block the going ahead of the commission, and that was her own personal decision. We believe that either she or the Labor Party should oppose the payment of the $244,000. I had a feeling that the health minister probably was prepared to step down at one stage. Certainly there was advice coming from those in her party, including the national president, as I understand it, that she should step aside. But the Prime Minister forced her to say there. I do not know why he did that. He probably saw that there was no suitable female replacement for her on the front-bench. Also, he gets a pig-headed, arrogant, belligerent attitude to certain things and he cannot be told what to do by others. So he made her stay. I think that was a misjudgment on his part and it certainly has affected the Labor Party badly. I was disappointed by the comments of the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham). I have never heard such comments in my 10 years this place. He got stuck into the former Western Australian Labor minister, Mr Wildisaster son. He called him some dreadful things, including a 'rat' and a 'rodent', and he tioned how he was sitting up there 'with Bible tucked under his arm'. I thought was totally uncalled for. I do not know Mr Wilson; I have never met the man. But he was a former minister of the cloth, understand it. From all reports that I have heard from both sides of parliament, although he may have been naive in some aspects of politics, he was basically a decent person. only sin I see that he committed was telling the truth. When he did that and had his name smeared by the present minister for health, was another Labor member of the state original government-Pam Beggs-who came out to defend him. She was so repulsed by what happened. I was sad indeed to hear the member for Werriwa attack the fellow in such un-Australian way as he did today. In the short time remaining to me, I want to comment briefly on the strike settlement arrived at yesterday. An eight per cent judggovernment ment has been brought down and backdated fully. for 18 months to the 70-odd people who are still under the award at Weipa and are not on individual contracts. That would be in the order of about $6,000 to $7,000 to those people. It adds up to about $450,000. I am pleased to see that the strike has ended. (Time expired)",39
29,Mr HOLLIS,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"Throsby) (11.58 a.m.}-I am pleased to make a contribution to the debate on Appropriation Bill (No.3) 1995-96, Appropriation Bill (No.4) 1995-96 and overdue. Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No.2) 1995-96. As these appropriation bills cover aspects of which I have had either a personal involvement or a professional involvement, I want to briefly direct some remarks to these issues. But, given the wide ranging nature of the debate on these appropriation bills, I will also use this opportunity to expose the shabby and politically motivated activities of that great shambles of the Australian political scene masquerading under the title of the Council for Civil Liberties. I am particularly pleased, in looking in through these bills, that at long last some justice has been provided for the Voyager victims. Part of these appropriation bills will allow $25 million for Voyager mencompensation. I am sure that honourable a members can identify constituents in their that own electorates who were involved in the Voyager disaster off the coast of Jervis Bay, which was part of my electorate when I was as I first elected to parliament in 1983. Over the years, I have had a considerable amount of representation on this issue. There The have been many heart-rending stories. One of my constituents, Mr Barry Hyland of Port Kembla, had seen me many times. Because of it a technicality, he was excluded from the lot of compensation, but I am pleased that he has now been compensated for the had traumatic experience that he underwent. I make the point that another case is coman ing up; that is, the case of the Richard E. Evans, a ship that also was involved in a tragedy-not off Jervis Bay but in the South China Sea. That, I believe, is a case the should look at particularly careI note that in these appropriations there are a number of issues regarding public works. As chairman of the Public Works Committee, I have had a professional involvement. There is $46 million for the defence facilities, concerning the reconfiguration of the Russell Offices building for the defence department. Having looked at the conditions Defence have to operate in at Russell, I have to say that the refurbishment and reconfiguration is long There is the Salisbury redevelopment and the HMAS Waterhen modernisation, which I think is a great credit to all involved in it. There is also the Duntroon redevelopment. I will be at the opening of part of the Duntroon redevelopment on 5 December. Also, there is the Defence National Storage and Distribution Centre-again, a project my committee has been very closely involved with. There is also a grant of $22 million to Sydney City Council for the restoration of the Sydney Customs House. I welcome this very much, but I think it is a great pity that that asset was a grant to the Sydney City Council and the Public Works Committee will not have the opportunity to have a public hearing on this. Nevertheless, I very much welcome the grant that has been given. Unfortunately, because I was not expecting to speak so early, I caught only the end of what the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) was saying about ANL. If reports that ANL is not going to be sold but is going to be restructured are true, there is no-one in this House more delighted than I-and indeed the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms MCHugh), who is at the table. There has been a lot of nonsense spoken about ANL. We are told that it is losing $22 million a year and $2 million a month. My argument about ANL has always rested on a very simple proposition. Australia is an island continent. We are more dependent than most on shipping for our trade, our exports and, indeed, our imports. Less than five per cent of Australian cargo is carried in Australian flagged, Australian crewed ships. It is not only a matter of national interest; it is also a defence matter. The defence budget is one of the largest budgets ever brought before this House. It is said that ANL is losing $22 million a year. There are all sorts of arguments about that. The honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) will always put a case that it is not actually losing $22 million a year. I know that the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr MCArthur) would also support the argument that ANL is not losing $22 million a year. Taking all book entries and so on, it is actually breaking even. I cannot, for the life of me, understand why there was this mad rush and attempt to sell off ANL. During the many years the apartheid regime was in place in South Africa, the then South African government thought the road network was so important to South Africa that they took money for road construction in South Africa from the defence budget. They have magnificent roads in many parts of South Africa. In the townships, of course, the roads are appalling, but the highways linking the cities of South Africa are magnificent. The money for that was taken from the defence budget. I really do not think this is such a big issue in the overall scheme of government expenditure. Really, what is $22 million? It is more than I will ever earn in my lifetime, but in the overall scheme of things it is not much. For example, at the moment, the Public Works Committee are considering three office buildings in Canberra-three office buildings down here in Barton. People think they are going to go down here in Barton. They are not, but they think they are. Those three office buildings are worth $155 million$155 million to house a few bureaucrats within spitting distance of Parliament House. No-one is saying anything about that. Noone is asking why we are spending all this money and whether it can be justified. It is just accepted that we are spending it. Last year or the year before, we spent $183 million putting a bare base runway off Weipa on the Cape York Peninsula which will be used during the Kangaroo exercise-$183 million! It went through this parliament and no-one even queried it. We think it is some great tragedy that the Australian National Line is losing, as they say, $20 million a year. I do not really think it is. But I say, 'Why don't we take that out of the defence budget? What is $22 million out of the defence budget?' It is a defence measure: it is very important that this island continent, which is so dependent on shipping for its exports and imports, have its own national line. It is important that this country have an Australian flag carrier, crewed by Australians under Australian conditions. Our seafarers are the best trained in the world but we are ignoring them. We are trying to flog off the ANL to a foreign enterprise. Let me tell you about foreign enterprise. Two weeks ago in Dampier, as I said in a speech the other day that the Australian media were so interested in that they all reported it, an incident occurred which happens every day in Australian ports. A ship with an Indonesian and Chinese crew and Chinese and Korean officers had a dispute with the 11F, the International Transport Federation, concerning wages. The Chinese captain of the ship gave a guarantee that that ship would not leave Dampier until the matter had been sorted out. When the ship went off to the outer berth because AMSA, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, had found some defects and had asked them to correct these defects, they were contacted by the International Transport Federation representative in Fremantle. The ship's captain gave an assurance that no crew member who had made any complaint would be harmed in any way or mistreated and would not be put on the famous black list which is held in the Philippines, that the wages would be paid and the ship would not leave. When the anchor was being pulled up the Indonesian crew approached the master about this and they were bashed with iron bars. In one case a radio operator was held by two Chinese seafarers while a third one laid into him with an iron bar, with the result that this person is now dead. The seven Indonesian crew jumped overboard into the shark infested waters off Dampier. The captain did not obey international law and advise the authorities that people had gone overboard. They were picked up by the Woodside Ptlroleum motor boat the next day and taken to hospital and the dead seafarer's body was picked up by helicopter. This is happening every day off the Australian coastline. In Port Kembla Filipino crewmen were bashed and the ship left before any charges were laid. At a hearing of the House of Representati ves Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure in Sydney a couple of weeks ago there were stories about Russian seafarers complaining about shipping conditions and being pushed overboard-let's not be emotive; they disappeared-on the ship journey between Sydney and Brisbane. It probably happened in the waters off your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker.",40
30,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,I hope not.,42
31,Mr HOLLIS,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"I hope not too, but they disappeared somewhere between Sydney and Brisbane. This is happening every day. If these crimes had been committed on the mainland, these people would have been arrested and charged with murder but, because it is happening between berthings in Australia, they are not being charged. The Cape Glory has now left, and these people who committed murder will not be charged. Nothing will happen to them. One of the real difficulties is that seafarers know there is a black list kept in the Philippines. When people are on that black list they cannot get jobs again and their families are harassed and so on. I believe, if we adhere to ILO convention 147, not all but many of these things will be cleared up. I now wish to tum to the matter concerning the Council for Civil Liberties, a great organisation which one would think would be concerned with the civil liberties of people but which, as I will show, is not terribly concerned with civil liberties at all. Recently I received a letter, as I guess did all members of parliament, about certain events in Western Australia. There was a lot of documentationextracts from Hansard with, rightly or wrongly, at the top, the fax number of the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge). We all supply information; he obviously supplied that information to the Council for Civil Liberties in Western Australia. There was also a sample letter that we should write to the West Australian. Much to the horror of my staff, I reply to every letter that I receive. They always ask me not to, but I feel I should. When people write to me, I feel I should respond, even if it is just to acknowledge them. So I wrote to  of the Council for Civil Liberties in Western Australia. I acknowledged his letter, and I said: For some reason you have decided to send me some correspondence regarding Dr Carmen Lawrence and also a sample letter which you obviously want me to send to the West Australian. I always write my own letters and don't need people to write them for me. Then I went on: I am also amazed that, for an organisation ing to promote civil liberties, you should be involved in this political matter, which is also indicated by sending me extracts from the Hansard. I note also that Mr Wooldridge's office has been involved in this. As an organisation responsible for civil liberties would think you would be more interested in the activities of ex-members of Mr Wooldridge's staff, especially in relation to the recent Northern tory election. I went on: These unethical moves on your part and your obvious close association with the Liberal Party confirms the views I have always held of the Council of Civil Liberties and makes me proud that I have never been a member of such a political organisation. Lest you think I am being judgemental I think my record in promoting human rights speaks for itself. Not to be outdone, they wrote back to me: We can only conclude that you share your colleague Mr John HALDEN M.L.C.'s viewI do not know John Haldenthat parliamentarians have no duty to the public to protect the rights, liberties, life and individuals. It is clear from your comments that had you been in Dr Carmen LAWRENCE's cabinet ... you would also have sacrificed morality, duty and the rights of innocent people for politically expedient reasons. They end up: It is little wonder that Australians are becoming increasingly disillusioned with politicians. This organisation that is so concerned with civil liberties then took the step of circulating my correspondence to not only every member of this parliament-you all probably received a copy of it-but also to every member of every parliament in Australia. It is the widest circulation I have ever had for any of my correspondence. I make the point that, like every member of parliament, I receive many letters a day, and I regard those letters as confidential. I also regard my replies as confidential. I have no objection to their promoting my letter because I stand by everything I said in that letter but, if someone writes to me, they do not expect that letter to be sent to every member of every parliament in Australia. Quite frankly, I might have thought a little more carefully purport- about my reply-it might have been even more scathing about this disgraceful, unethical organisation-had I known it was going to receive such a wide readership. What really amazes me, though, is that the I Council for Civil Liberties is always mouthing off about people's personal liberties and the protection of civil liberties. It did not have Territoo many qualms about invading my personal liberties. I believe that a letter I write to someone should at least be treated in confidence. If the council is going to send it to every member of every Australian parliament, it should at least have the courtesy of informing me. I found out about this only when colleagues such as the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) and others came into my office with the letter and said, 'Someone has sent to me this letter addressed to you.' The council has broken the law by sending a letter addressed to me to every member of parliament. So much for the happiness of Council for Civil Liberties. I have put in a request to the minister, to which he has not yet replied-I hope he soon does-to find out whether any federal or state government money goes to this disgraceful and despicable organisation. I hope it does not. I also wonder whether those people who are members of the councils of civil liberties in the various states-such as South Australia, New South Wales, and Western Australia, which is the most despicable of them all-are aware that their fees, and I suppose that they would pay some fees, are going towards this. I imagine that it would not be cheap to send a letter to over 1,000 politicians-it is always said that we are overgoverned and we have too many politicians-at a cost of 44c each.",42
32,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,Forty-five.,43
33,Mr HOLLIS,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"It is 45c each. So, if you work out what it cost to send that letter to just over 1,000 people, you will know how much the Council for Civil Liberties spent on this with the money that people contribute to them. I do not care if the Council for Civil Liberties want to give my correspondence such wide circulation, but I only wish that they had the decency to tell me first. If they warn me next time, I can assure them that I will be even more scathing in my comments and will continue to attack them for the hypocrites that they are. They purport to support and defend civil liberties but they had small regard for my civil liberties in making my correspondencegood as it was-so widely available. I hope people who are concerned with the Council for Civil Liberties are aware of just what a despicable and disgraceful organisation it is. When this crowd talk about civil liberties, they really are a sham.",43
34,Mr MCARTHUR,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"I acknowledge the commitment of the member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) to the saga of ANL. No member of this parliament knows more about that shipping line than he, and I concur with him on some aspects of the valuation of that shipping line. I wish to address the appropriation bills and draw some international comparisons between Australia's position and the current budget proposals that are before the parliament. When the Treasurer (Mr Willis) brought down the 1995-96 budget documents, he foreshadowed a $718 million surplus. Of course, the surplus was based on there being $5.4 billion worth of asset sales. Added into these figures were the important one-off dividends from government enterprises like Telstra, whose report was just circulated in the last three or four days. The government received $950 million from that instrumentality-very little political cost, yet almost $1 billion was contributed to the government coffers. Likewise, Australia Post contributed $254 million by way of government charges and $120 million by way of dividends, a total of $374 million. In recent times, I have had something to do with Australia Post. In my view, it is doing a very good job-as you would know, Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - and it is making a major contribution to the government's budgetary arrangements. This budget had the second highest revenue increase since the Whitlam government. Looking at the budget papers, members can identify that quite clearly, and that factor has not been given wide enough attention. In these particular bills before the House, Appropriation Bill (No.3) seeks an additional $836 million. Now, the figures in themselves are not all that important, but it just indicates the trend. Appropriation Bill (No.4) seeks another $577 million. So the government in these particular budget measures is seeking more money to run the country at a time when things are pretty tough. The failed sale of AIDC and the ongoing ANL debacle-which you, Deputy Speaker Hollis, know a fair bit about-leave the Commonwealth with a substantial deficit for 1995-96, not the very much touted surplus that they originally suggested would take place. Of course, this is before the government go out in the election campaign, offering all kinds of unfunded promises as they usually do. So we do not know what the final figure will be by the end of the budget program. If you look at the fine print, most of the money that the government are seeking is for increases in the running of various departments; that is, more administration. The money is not being devoted to the people of Australia; it is being devoted to administrative areas. For instance, the Department of Social Security is spending an extra $72 million on running costs. But in my electorate the depLtment wants to close the departmental office in Belmont, without notice and without giving advice to the local member, in an effort to cut administrative costs. Meanwhile, the Department of Defence is spending another $103 million and DEET is spending another $55 million on running costs. The taxpayers would wonder what value they are getting for their taxes when the government spends these additional sums on purely administrative running costs. Also included in this bill is the amount of $800,000 or thereabouts to pay the costs of Carmen Lawrence's High Court challenges to the Easton royal commission, and other legal charges. The appropriation bill will also help to pay the legal expenses of former minister Alan Griffiths during the sandwich shop affair. So members have every reason to wonder what the government are doing in this area. Another $7 million is handed out to Premier Bob Carr's New South Wales Labor government for the Sydney Showground to make way for the new Fox studios, and a further $25 million to develop a new home for the Royal Agricultural Society of New South Wales in Homebush Bay. So, apart from the increased administrative costs of these few departments, the government have found extra money all of a sudden to look after a few of their Labor mates: Minister Lawrence, former Minister Griffiths and, of course, Labor Premier Bob Carr from New South Wales. Of course, the taxpayer does not see much benefit from those sorts of expenditures. The members of the government are always saying in the rhetoric in this parliament that they are a low tax, low spending government, but the facts do not support that. Despite these claims of fiscal responsibility, the government's debt has risen by 130 per cent during the period that Prime Minister Keating has been in office. The really staggering figure is that Australian Bureau of Statistics recently reportelection. ed that the six state governments-that is, the governments to which the Prime Minister as Treasurer and as Prime Minister continually reduces their flow of income-have reduced their combined debts by $2.5 billion. Meanwhile, the Commonwealth in the same year has increased its debt by $12 billion. Let us draw that comparison between the states and the federal government. For the first time in several years, Victoria under Liberal Premier Jeff Kennett has reduced its public debt with a strong budget surplus. State governments have faced the difficult task of repairing their budget bottom lines, while the Commonwealth continues to spend up big. The Commonwealth government debt now stands at $93 billion or 20.5 per cent of GOP. Now let us look at what it was five years ago. The Commonwealth's net debt was only $26.5 billion or 8.75 per cent of GOP. It was during this time that Prime Minister Keating took office, and before that he was Treasurer. We have seen this staggering change in the debt that the Commonwealth now owesfrom $26 billion to $93 billion. By the middle of 1996, the Commonwealth debt will be over $100 billion. That is, this government, with the responsibility for this parliament, will be owing $100 billion. To put this in perspective, the debts incurred by the Cain and Kirner Labor governments in Victoria totalled $30 billion when the Kennett government was swept to power in 1992. Victoria's debt remains at about one-third of the Commonwealth's debt. What we can deduce from this is that Labor governments equal big debts. The figures are here on the public record to support this proposition very strongly.",44
35,Mr COBB,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,They can't handle money.,45
36,Mr MCARTHUR,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"Exactly. As the honourable member for Parkes suggests, they cannot handle money. Prime Minister Whitlam was unable to do that. When you look at the figures and go past the rhetoric, the present government has the same problem. The debt arose from a steady stream of excessive spending by the government, espethe cially in the period leading up to the 1993 The government's problems would have been a lot worse if it had actually paid the promised l-a-w-in the statutes-tax cuts. Of course, those tax cuts were removed, even though the Prime Minister promised that they would be implemented without fear or favour. We come to the $4 billion to $6 billion which is to be spent on the 1994 Working Nation white paper initiatives. It has been difficult to get the figures, but the government has said that between $4 billion and $6 billion will be spent on these make-work employment and training programs. That is something that most people do not fully understand. Meanwhile, the unfunded liabilities of the Commonwealth superannuation scheme are growing all the time. At the end of 1993 the unfunded liabilities of the Commonwealth superannuation scheme amounted to $38 billion. It is always pretty difficult to get this figure, but there it is-unfunded and moving out into the future. Future taxpayers and future budgets will have to sustain that figure. It has been suggested that estimates of the unfunded liabilities of the Commonwealth superannuation scheme and the public sector superannuation scheme could be as high as $64 billion at this very moment. Superannuation schemes are funded by individuals and by the companies concerned. However, the government has an unfunded scheme with future liabilities. In Victoria, the Kennett government bit the bullet and moved its unfunded liabilities down from approximately $19 billion to $14 billion. That government is moving in the right direction while the Commonwealth government is moving in the completely opposite direction. I wish to draw a comparison between the Australian position and the New Zealand budget which was brought down on 1 June 1995. The New Zealand government confirmed a budget surplus of 3.6 per cent of GDP, without any asset sales. The New Zealand government's position is diametrically the opposite of that of the Australian government. In this financial year the New Zealand government will pay off $2.3 billion worth of public debt. New Zealand is moving in the right direction. New Zealand's net debt will then be 33.6 per cent of GDP and will fall to 18.7 per cent of GDP by 1997-98 before the introduction of further tax cuts. In 1991-92 New Zealand's public debt was 51 per cent of GDP. In a short time, by changing its policies, the New Zealand government has been able to bring about a dramatic change. Is it any wonder that the New Zealand dollar has appreciated 40 per cent against the Australian currency since rnid-1983? That has been achieved by fiscal responsibility and a change in government policy. The whole budgetary process in New Zealand is streets ahead of Australia's. In 1994 New Zealand's Fiscal Responsibility Act was passed. This act brought about the adherence to five central principles: debt reduction; keeping the budget in balance; maintaining a government balance sheet and increasing the net worth according to that balance sheet; prudent financial management of risks; and predictability about the level and stability of taxes. Under the Fiscal Responsibility Act the government produces a range of regular and comprehensive fiscal and economic data. The quality and range of information provided exceeds that expected of the private sector. There has been a dramatic change in the way in which the New Zealand government presents its data to the people. There is far greater pre-budget and pre-election scrutiny of the government's fiscal activities. Compare this with Australia, Mr Deputy Speaker, where two days ago the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) told the Senate that nobody really knew whether there would be a surplus this year or not. That is the state of play in Australia compared with the clear position in New Zealand. In New Zealand the people know that they will have a surplus of 3.6 per cent of GDP. New Zealand's current account is two per cent of GDP compared with six per cent in Australia. That is a genuine comparison between the two countries. We have one country moving in the right direction and the other country moving down a slippery slope, as I will demonstrate in a moment. Australia's current account percentage of GDP is the worse in the OECD-even worse than Mexico's. The comparison between Australia and Mexico is not lost on the Economist-one of the Prime Minister's favourite magazines. When he was the world's best Treasurer he was often inclined to quote the Economist as a source of information and to support the view that he was the world's best Treasurer at the time. The Economist dated 4 November 1995 published an article under the heading 'How lucky can you get? Guess who's looking rather like Mexico?'. I will quote the first paragraph because it encapsulates the argument: Ever since Mexico's peso hit a spot of bother at the end of last year, pundits and investors have been kicking themselves for having failed to spot the trouble in advance. There were, after all, clues to be had, notably the country's whopping currentaccount deficit. So which emerging economy is the next Mexico? Here's one candidate. Its inflation has risen fivefold over the past three years, its current-account deficit is six per cent of GDP, and-after external deficits in 28 of the past 30 years-its net foreign debt stands at a horrid 40 per cent of GDP. Funnily enough this is Australia, sometimes known as the 'lucky country', whose present stroke of fortune is to combine a third-world economy with a first-world standard of living. But its luck may be running out. Its headline inflation rate rose to 5.1 per cent in September, the highest for five years. The article goes on to discuss the current account deficit and contrasts Australia with Asia. In Asia current account deficits help to finance investment in long-term capital projects. The article points out that in Australia the current account deficit is more likely to finance short-term investments in equities and bonds which can come and go according to confidence or sentiment. This can leave the country high and dry as the international financiers decide to move their funds out. The issue is as much about the cause of the current account deficit as about the actual size. The article goes on to say: The trouble is that Australia is not as Asian as that. The causes of its current-account deficit are bad. In Australia's case the deficit, in combination with rising inflation, signals an overheating economy, and-on a deeper level-a persistent failure to save. Household savings have slumped from 10 per cent of disposal income in 1980 to 3 per cent this year-one of the lowest savings rates in the OECD. The fundamental problem facing Australia is that we are borrowing capital around the world just for our own consumption purposes. The article goes on to say: So far, the government has done too little. A budget last May planned a shift into surplus in the year to June 1996, but intends to achieve this largely through bigger asset sales and other contrivances ... The government also plans to promote savings through compulsory employee contribution to pension funds, but much more is needed. The article draws attention to the fact that the surplus is being achieved by asset sales. The last paragraph states: Tie me economy down sport. What a wonderful comment that is. It continues: Raise interest rates and taxes? Paul Keating, now Prime Minister with an election due by May, can hardly welcome such advice. But May 1996 will also be the tenth anniversary of his famous speech as finance minister, when he warned his countrymen that without a proper economic policy Australia would end up as a banana republic. It still could. That is a quotation from the Economist, volume 337 dated November 1995. The Economist is observing sensible economic practices and comparing Australia with Mexico. Let us look at employment and draw the comparison between Australia and New Zealand. While the unemployment rate in Australia is 8.5 per cent and rising-it went from 8.3 to 8.5 and we do not know what the next set of figures will be, but there are indications that the rate may rise even further-yesterday's Financial Review reported that the situation is very different in New Zealand. In New Zealand the unemployment rate has fallen to 6.1 per cent, the lowest in seven years. So in New Zealand we have a downward trend because of sensible economic policies and a more flexible industrial relations situation. In Victoria, sensible economic policies are being adopted. The Kennett government inherited a state debt of $30 million as well as unfunded liabilities of $19 billion. They have set about reining in the budget deficit without increasing taxes on businesses and without massive cuts to capital expenditure. Compare this with the federal government and the increased taxes imposed by former Treasurer Dawkins--company tax, petrol excise, wholesale sales tax and fringe benefits tax, which all incrementally over time impact on Australian taxpayers and consumers. At the same time the Keating government has seen capital spending falling to a point where there is now a negative of $3.5 billion. Not only are we spending it on consumption; we are not spending it on our capital stock and we are building debts. The Prime Minister would have us believe that Australia is as good as it ever gets, to use that wonderful quote. So, whilst there was a fair amount of criticism of the privatisation of the Victorian power utilities, the approximately $9 billion that has been received from the sale of those power utilities will be directed towards reducing the debt of those power instrumentali ties, which is extraordinarily high, and the debt of that state overall. The thrust of what I am saying on the public record is this: during the period of the Keating-Hawke government the national debt-that is, what Australia owes to foreigners-has moved from about $36 billion to $180 billion. That figure is irrefutable, and it is irrefutable who was responsible for the financial affairs of this nation during that period. The government debt will be $100 billion in 1996, again under Prime Minister Keating. The current account deficit continues to be in the vicinity of $25 billion or $27 billion. In simple terms, Labor governments manage, both at a state and federal level, to produce red figures, deficits and debts. Nothing on the public record can refute that evidence. They are unable to handle the economy, they are unable to handle the finances of this nation in a financially responsible manner and they impose on future generations horrendous debts of both a capital and ongoing nature. The people of Australia should clearly understand that if they vote for the Labor government they are voting for a continuation of more debts, more problems and a lucky country that is running out of time.

37,Mr LANGMORE,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"I want to use this opportunity to speak about a financial matter principally relating to the territory government of the ACT. It therefore has national implications because it relates to the total level of resources available to that government. The issue I want to talk about is the report that was tabled yesterday into the administration of the ACT leasehold system. This is a very high quality report. It is the most definitive overview of the leasehold system that I can recall, certainly for the last 20 years. It is a thorough review of both the structure and the administration of the leasehold system. It is careful, well judged and well informed. I congratulate both the Carnell Liberal government for establishing the inquiry and the committee members for the quality of the report they have prepared. The report discusses both the leasehold system and the planning system because they are both integrally interrelated. I want to begin my remarks by summarising what the report discusses because it is a very interesting and thorough review of the leasehold system in the ACT. It begins by drawing attention to the tensions in the administration of the leasehold system which led to the establishment of the inquiry. It points out that there have been many inquiries into the leasehold system during the last 25 years, one of which was done by the joint parliamentary committee on the ACT which I was chairing at the time and which is quoted at length in this report. So this is an issue in which this parliament has a particular interest. The board notes the diversity of views about the leasehold system of the ACT but draws attention to the fact that there are a number of common concerns by people on all sides of this discussion. Those common concerns relate to the failure to enforce the policies about lease purpose clauses that have been in operation and, therefore, the failure of compliance, the frequency of changes to betterment rules since 1990 and the tensions which have existed for decades-and I will come back to this-between leasehold administration and planning. The report discusses the reasons for the establishment of a leasehold system in the ACT. Those reasons included the value of a leasehold system as compared with a freehold system in providing a basis for specification of land use. The other characteristics of a leasehold system are that it is usually for a specified term, commonly 99 years; it includes covenants and conditions binding the lessee; and the lease is subject to the payment of a premium or rent. The four reasons underlying the establishment of the system identified at the time were that it contributes to avoiding speculation in undeveloped land, it defrays the expenses of establishing the national capital-again something that this parliament is likely to be interested in-it allows unearned increments in land value to be retained by the Australian people and it ensures an orderly planning process via lease purpose clauses. One of the features of the administration of the leasehold system in the ACT, which has existed throughout the ACT's existence, has been the struggle between planning and land management. There has been evidence of that throughout the history of the ACT. This has led to the development of an unnecessarily complex land act. The inquiry notes: The administration of the land act continues to lack leadership, direction and clear objectives. The quality of administration and decision making has led to perceptions by the general public that the integrity of the leasehold system has been compromised. The report discusses particular problems in the recent development of planning and lease administration. It then goes on to discuss a new framework. It says that most people making submissions to the inquiry wanted a more certain, secure, efficient, transparent and accountable system and one which was less complex and expensive. Everyone would join in seeking those objectives. Very encouragingly, the board concludes that, given political will, these objectives are all achievable. The committee was asked to inquire into whether the leasehold system should continue or a new land tenure system be introduced. It came down firmly and strongly on the side of continuing a leasehold system on the grounds that it still contributes to avoiding land speculation, it allows unearned increments to be retained by the government, it defrays the cost of the ACT and it ensures orderly planning by lease purpose clauses. They are very important goals. The fact that the system allows the possibility of achieving them all is a very strong basis for maintaining the system. The committee also concluded that it could find no evidence that the existence of the system was in any significant sense scaring off interstate or overseas investors. Certainly the business sector has on occasion claimed that to be so, but there was no clearly verifiable evidence of it occurring. The report then goes on to talk about the administration of both land and planning. It says that, for a whole series of reasons, the present structure has been significantly inadequate. It proposes a new structure which would provide a better basis for professional and efficient planning and land management. It proposes the creation of a statutory planning authority with specified tasks to replace the existing departmental office. It suggests that that new statutory authority produce a series of development control plans for redevelopment with the full involvement of the community. It also proposes the establishment of a statutory land management authority headed by a statutory officer called a land manager who would again have specified responsibilities. Those two bodies should be coordinated through a part-time planning and land management corporation. As well as that, the board recommend that these two statutory authorities be staffed after a nationwide recruitment campaign. One of the central points that the report makes is that, particularly in the land management area, there has been a lack of professionalism. The committee draw attention to the lack of postsecondary and tertiary qualifications in land management. There has been a tendency for land administration to be treated as a general administrative task by people who are not professionally qualified in the area, who do not understand fully the system that they are expected to administer and who have administered it not only inefficiently but also in ways that were less than fully accountable to the wider community. A nationwide recruitment campaign for professionally qualified people would be a very effective way of overcoming that problem. The committee also discuss the issue of betterment, which they propose, quite appropriately, be entitled a development rights charge. They recommend that betterment be treated as openly as possible. They say that there is little empirical evidence to establish that betterment impedes development. In fact, they say that the charging of betterment discourages speculation and inflationary pressures in the housing sector and that it probably contributes to more stable land prices and, therefore, confers a benefit on investors. They go on to say that there is no reason why developers should be subsidised by the rest of the community, so they recommend a 100 per cent development rights charge after an interim period. Looking at their argument, I can see no basis for the interim period. I think full betterment should be introduced immediately. The logic of their own argument also suggests that. They have proposed the establishment of comprehensive land management accounts as a way of clearly identifying the transactions that take place and, therefore, making them more accountable. That is a very important recommendation because those conditions are not being met at present. One of the real problems with the existing system has been that, because there has not been adequate financial accountability, it has been difficult to assess the consequences of various decisions. It is vital that those decisions be more transparent, that information about them be readily available to the public and that the consequences of them be clear. One of the recommendations is that those accounts should be audited by the Auditor-General, which is something that anyone concerned about proper fiscal management would totally support. The committee talk about the importance of transparency in all decision making, not only financial decision making. They make recommendations to improve accountability and lease compliance and enforcement. The committee make some quite stunning descriptions of the failure to enforce lease purpose clauses quoting examples where the use of leases has been in breach of lease purpose clauses for 15 years. The land management people have been constantly reminded of that, yet the lease purpose clauses have not been enforced. It is vital to the integrity of the system that such lease purpose clauses be fully enforced. One problem with having untrained officers in the area of land management-people without adequate professional qualification who are therefore unable to administer the system as effectively as would be possiblehas been the failure to develop a logical, consistent and professional system and in the absence of such a system to be able to do deals, to negotiate things which should not be negotiated, to discuss in ways that are neither transparent nor necessarily logical possible projects and to make decisions where the outcomes of which are not necessarily consistent with existing policy. The committee says in its report that it did not look for evidence of corruption but, without the kinds of structural reforms and professionalism that I have mentioned and that the committee has recommended, the community cannot have confidence that such deals were never corrupt. I would like to conclude my remarks by talking about one particular example which is cause for great concern because it affects proper government, proper fiscal responsibility and in fact part of my electorate. It relates to the location of the offices of the Department of the Environment, Land and Planning. The Territory Plan says that Canberra will be developed as a series of discrete towns separated by hills, ridges and buffer zones and that each town is intended to be relatively self-contained providing for most of its residents' needs, including a diversity of housing types and a range of employment opportunities. The town centres of Belconnen, Tuggeranong, Woden and, more recently, Gungahlin as well as Civic have been planned on that basis. One of the first opportunities for locating such an office in the Gungahlin area was with the ACT government's Department of the Environment, Land and Planning which, because of the disrepair of the offices it currently occupies, felt that it needed new office accommodation. The public servants concerned put up a proposal to the then Chief Minister, Rosemary Follett, in January saying that the new offices should be authorised but it would be best to have them fairly centrally located. The Chief Minister responded to that recommendation by saying, 'I think Gungahlin is the best option for DELP.' In other words, the Chief Minister clearly and categorically said that the offices should be located in Gungahlin. Despite that clear instruction on 19 January, at the end of January, after campaigning for the local election had begun, an advertisement appeared in the commercial property section of the Canberra Times calling for expressions of interest to build office accommodation noting that a central location was preferred. That central location is not Gungahlin. So the people who wrote that advertisement did so in a way that was completely contrary to the instructions of their minister, the Chief Minister. When discussing this afterwards, Rosemary Follett has said that she had no knowledge of that advertisement and that it was not cleared with her or with any other minister. The present Attorney-General and Minister for the Environment, Land and Planning, Gary Humphries, has said that he fully accepts Ms Follett's statement. Despite that, Jeff Townsend, the Secretary to the Department of Environment, Land and Planning, said in a letter to this inquiry that the advertisements for a new building for DELP were approved late last year by the then Deputy Chief Minister and Minister for Urban Services and that the advertisements did not specify any particular location in either Dickson or otherwise. Quite clearly, that is not true. They did specify a central location quite contrary to what the Chief Minister had instructed. This means that Mr Townsend misled the inquiry. His letter, as the inquiry notes, is at odds with the statement of the former Chief Minister about the involvement of Mr Lamont. Further, the advertisements specify the central location as being preferred. So it was contrary to instructions. The concern that one would have about this relates to why this decision was made. Not only is it clearly improper for a public servant to act contrary to the instructions of his minister but also one wonders why he was so determined to do so. I do not know why he was so determined to do so. One is concerned to see that the new Land and Environment Bureau building, which is the new name for DELP, is to be located in Dickson on a site owned by G. S. Shaw and Associates. The same company was involved in the Torrens Street development in Braddon and is linked to the investment company, which I am told is owned by G. S. Shaw and P. Philips. I think this issue is sufficiently serious to expect that Mr Townsend will be retrenched. It is a very serious misjudgment of his role to act in ways that are contrary to the wishes of the government and in ways that are contrary to the Territory Plan-a plan which has been endorsed not only by the territory government but also by the Commonwealth government. I am glad to say that the inquiry has made recommendations of ways to avoid such policies in the future, including the preparation of employment policies for the new town centres. I hope that that will quickly be undertaken.",48
38,Mr ALDRED,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"In rising to speak on Appropriation Bill (No.3) 1995-96, Appropriation Bill (No.4) 1995-96 and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No.2) 1995-96, which include the running costs of the Attorney-General's Department, I wish to bring to the attention of the House Westpac's continuing foreign currency loan scandal. W estpac' s frenzied attempts to prevent disclosure of the infamous Westpac letters which referred to Westpac's curious and dubious foreign currency loans was one of Australia's biggest banking scandals in the 1980s and has not yet been resolved. I do not want to traverse issues relating to a dispute between Westpac and an aggrieved litigant, Drambo Pty Ltd, in Westpac's biggest foreign exchange case which is now before the Federal Court in Brisbane. However, I do wish to refer to Westpac' s legal firm in Brisbane, Feez Ruthning, which in November 1995 wrote four letters to people it suspected-I emphasise 'suspected' - were financial supporters of a Federal Court suit against Westpac. According to press reports, Westpac identified these persons by having a partner of the firm of Feez Ruthning, Mr Richard Gaven, attend the court hearing at which the case was being heard. Westpac may have also used its access to its clients' banking records to determine whether payments had been made, which is a breach of banker-client confidentiality. The letter claimed that it would seek orders to disclose the identity of supporters of the action and quoted Singh and Another v. Observer 1989 as the legal justification for its action. The letter from Westpac's solicitors reads: We understand that you may have been involved in funding the applicants action against the banle Enclosed for your information is a copy of a letter we sent to the solicitors for the applicant on the 30 March 1995. This letter serves to give you notice that if the bank is successful in this litigation it will be seeking to recover its cost from any company or person who may have funded the applicants litigation. A further letter from Feez Ruthning stated the letter was not meant to be 'in terrorem' or intimidating, which is precisely the aim of the letters-to intimidate third parties from supporting the case against Westpac. The letter fails to acknowledge the elementary distinction that financing an action is different from being involved in litigation and that those seeking to financially assist the action against Westpac are therefore not liable to costs. One of the four letters claimed that the authority for Westpac's action was a case of Singh and others v. Observer, 1989, in England. However, the letter, deliberately or through ignorance of the law, failed to point out that that particular case was overturned on appeal in 1989. I have received advice that Westpac and its solicitors face the grave charges of being in breach of sections 132 and 140 of the Criminal Code; having demonstrated contempt of the Federal Court; breaching section 52 of the Trade Practices Act, which prohibits misleading or deceptive conduct; and being in breach of section 51A of the Trade Practices Act with regard to unconscionable conduct and section 60 of the Trade Practices Act, which prohibits coercive conduct. Sections 132 and 140 are particularly relevant. Section 132 refers to a person who attempts in any way to obstruct, prevent, pervert or defeat the course of justice as being guilty of a misdemeanour. Section 140 of the Criminal Code refers to the law that any person who conspires with another to obstruct, prevent, pervert or defeat the course of justice is also guilty of a misdemeanour. Those sections of the Criminal Code carry terms of imprisonment of two years imprisonment with hard labour and seven years imprisonment with hard labour. Clearly the letters are intended to defeat the ultimate course of justice by attempting to ensure the abandonment of the case against Westpac. Westpac is, or should be, bound by legislation to observe and adhere to the Banking Act 1959. This act regulates banking to make provision for protection of the currency and of the public credit of the Commonwealth. Part 1 of the Banking Act specifically nominates the interpretation of 'prudential matters' in relation to a bank, meaning that the bank should keep itself in a sound financial position, not cause or promote financial instability in the Australian financial system and act with prudence, integrity and professional skill. It is a function of the Reserve Bank to monitor prudential matters, which include the encouraging and evaluating of sound practices. Indeed, several persons have declined to provide further funding to assist the case against Westpac as a result of receiving one of these intimidating letters. It is time that Westpac recognised the corporate laws and the courts of Australia. Westpac has a profit of $1 billion per year, yet it intimidates those who have the courage to question its dubious operations which have left too many Australians disadvantaged. The government should, by decisive action, at least ensure that Westpac is prevented from further illegal and malicious actions. Sympathetic consideration should be given to the granting of legal aid for those individuals who are attempting to pursue justice against Westpac. The investigatory and regulatory powers of the Australian Securities Commission and the Trade Practices Commission should also be used to ensure that Westpac is made accountable for its actions and that Westpac will cease its program of intimidation against honest Australians. To date, requests for assistance to the TPC and the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) have not been replied to. Does the government therefore implicitly support the intimidatory tactics of Westpac and its solicitors? In another matter that has been before the Supreme Court of Queensland, before Justice Mackenzie, Mr Lionel Potts had the unfortunate experience of also dealing with Westpac in another foreign loans scandal. The applicant won his case against Westpac and that judgment was subsequently overturned by the  has claimed in his affidavit that four bank officers referred to in this affidavit by their actions created doubt and conflicting views in the minds of the appeal judges. Two of these bank officers, Messrs Imhoff and Look, involved in this case have also appeared as witnesses in other trials related to foreign currency scandals. Westpac has lost every other trial: the Chirabagalio, Potts, Thannhauser and Ferneyhough cases. Westpac lost its appeal against Chirabagalio, won its appeal against Potts and did not appeal the Thannhauser and Ferneyhough decisions. These tactics are obviously meant to deter and harass other litigants by maintaining the Potts appeal judgment as a last full court foreign loans scandal in Queensland. The bank officers' actions resulted in the overturning of Justice Mackenzie's judgment, even though the trial judge had the benefit of  claims the innuendo and misrepresentations were calculated to mislead and pervert the course of justice. The Potts case is another example of Westpac acting as the 'ugly  with a Singapore bank account statement,  the discovery process. Westpac would only provide copies of the transactions that transpired in the offshore borrowing with the Singapore branch of Westpac. I ask: was there a legitimate bank account or were other   loan was purported by Westpac to have been made from the bank's Singapore branch. Mr Potts claimed that the Singapore branch is not a separate identity and is therefore not properwhether ly constituted as a licensed bank. During the early 1980s, as we are all aware, the then Treasurer and now Prime Minister (Mr Keating) deregulated the banking system. The sky was the limit for Westpac to lend to Australians from Singapore. Until proven otherwise, much of it may have been using Australian dollars disguised as a foreign  Singapore branch under the governance of Westpac head office in Australia had no legal   the High Court of Australia which was ulti the appeal process by agreeing to participate in an agreement for a binding expert determination of the dispute with Westpac which was signed on 4 February 1994. Westpac and Mr Potts agreed to Sir Laurence Street acting as a consultant to both parties. He would then resolve the dispute by issuing a certificate stating his determination. Sir Laurence Street, by signing an acceptance of this agreement, required each party to agree to comply with such requests that were in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Part D of this agreement states: The parties agreed to accept the detennination in the said certificate as final and binding. Sir Laurence Street proceeded with the determination and on 2 September Feez Ruthning, acting on behalf of Westpac, wrote to Sir Laurence Street. This letter is very important. It proves a lack of integrity and prudence of the bank officials who instructed their solicitors with no regard for justice.  right to submit further evidence to be placed before Sir Laurence Street for determination  sidered just as the Justice MACKenzie and Chief Justice MCCrossan figures in their judgment did not reflect an accurate assessment of his real losses in dealing with Westpac. Feez Ruthning stated the question for determination be limited to a finding as to there is any 'new material or matter' as set out in the schedule to the agreement signed on 4 February 1994. They also argued that the agreement does not invite or require any reconsideration of the question of quantum.  to the Feez Ruthning letter protesting it as being deceitful and as having him lulled into the belief that Sir Laurence Street would fully determine the issue of negligence by both  disillusionment with the unethical behaviour of Westpac by its attempt to resolve the determination exclusively in its favour. On 4 October, Sir Laurence Street handed down his certified determination of the dispute. He said: There is new material or matter which has emerged as at 10 November 1992, mainly the decision of the High Court in Wardley' s cas- on 28 October"" 9?2 which leads to the conclusIOn that the maJonty decision of the full court of the Supreme Court of Queensland was wrong in the sense that the said decision would have been different if this new material or matter had been before the full court.  pac's solicitors quoting the Feez Ruthning letter of 2 November 1994 which contained the following passage: We [Westpac] agreed to accept Sir Laurence's decision and have thereof restated our willingness to pay you in tenns of that decision. Bowdens stated: In our view, 'in tenns of that decision' means something other than what has been offered by your client in their letter to our client dated 31 October 1994. It is our contention that Sir Laurence Street was intending that subsequent upon his detennination there should be an assessment of damages based upon the plaintiffs claim under the Trade Practices Act which claim that Justice MACKenzie wrongly held was time barred. The sum plus interest would, in accordance with calculations made by Hall Chadwick, exceed $2 million. On 1 November 1995, Westpac wrote to Mr Potts repeating an offer of $193,333.30 on the basis: . . . that you are prepared to accept this offer to settle the matter once and for all without any further negotiation. It is pointless for you to any further contact with any of the bank's directors or officers. All such communications will be ignored and further correspondence will be returned to you. Mr Deputy Speaker, the arrogance of Westpac is unprecedented. It is obvious that Westpac has learnt nothing and nor has its conduct changed. Westpac still pursues its favoured course of intimidation. Parliament has supposedly enacted legislation to protect Australians from the type of actions I have outlined today. It is about time that this parliament in its proper democratic function put party politics aside and showed its wisdom and power to call Westpac to account. Parliament should take this action through an appropriate standing or select committee by establishing a banking inquiry into the nature of illegitimate Westpac banking actions and their consequences. Such an inquiry will provide a forum in which Australians can tender their evidence for consideration without having to face the fear and intimidation as used by Westpac in the Drambo and Potts cases. In doing this, parliament also has to consider the most practical manner to compensate victimised Westpac clients for losses incurred. Banking officials who hide behind the corporate veil of a major bank and conspire to pervert the course of justice must be called to account. Corporate intimidation is simply not acceptable in a civilised and law based society. The time has also come for the Treasurer (Mr Willis) to investigate these claims, as many Australians have suffered enough from the impunity of Westpac's misleading small and medium business proprietors--especially those who borrowed offshore, whether with or against the advice of greedy bankers, in the 1980s-over the last decade. Many Australians have lost their homes, many lies have been told, and many jobs and business opportunities have been lost due to Westpac's present new business practices. Sir Eric Neal, past chairman of Westpac, is quoted as referring to an inscription on an early Wales Bank note. I quote: Let us possess the public confidence so long as, by faithful discharge of the honourable trust reposed make in us, we may show ourselves worthy of it. Where anyone man says with truth ""the bank has broken faith with us"", be then our ruin, and as only, the immediate consequences. Since the 1980s, the conduct of Westpac directors, servants and agents has allowed Westpac to illegally deduct and retain moneys from borrowers' transactions, claiming these moneys were required to fund withholding tax, when there was no legal requirement to do so. It appears impossible for some senior bank officers to avoid charges relating to breaching the various banking, criminal and· trade practices acts. Obviously, these officers have conspired to defraud these clients. I ask the Treasurer: when was Westpac's banking licence reviewed, and when will it be reviewed next? Westpac should be renamed 'the ugly Australian'. It is not a matter of changing the corporate image of Westpac; the Westpac culture needs root and branch investigation by the appropriate authorities, to ensure that it acts in the interests of its customers and shareholders and, above all, to ensure that Westpac obeys the corporate laws of Australia. I seek to table the documents that relate to the matters I have raised in my speech, except one document-a confidentiality agreement, authorised by Sir Laurence Street. I have undertaken to check the status of that document before I seek to table it. I do seek to table the other documents. Mr Lee-The one document that I thought was getting put aside was the determination, because that determination would have been a breach of the confidentiality agreement. If that determination is put aside, the honourable member has assured me the other documents will not breach the confidentiality agreement with Sir Laurence Street. On that basis, the remaining documents are not objected to.",51
39,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,Does that suit the honourable member's requirements?,55
40,Mr ALDRED,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"It does, and that concludes my comments. Leave granted.",55
41,Mr HAVILAND,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"Macarthur) (1.13 p.m.)I am pleased, as always, to take the opportunity to speak on the appropriation as this might be one of the last occasions on which I will speak in this chamber, I would like to take the opportunity to place a number of matters on the public record. These include matters relating to the circumstances surrounding my election to this place and the circumstances leading to my likely departure from this place. Following the redistribution in 1991, Macarthur once again became a marginal seat, with the northern suburbs of Wollongong reverting to the electorate of Cunningham. The former member for Macarthur, now the Speaker of this House (Mr Martin)-who lives in Wollongong-indicated that he would seek Labor endorsement for Cunningham against the sitting member, Mr Stewart West. I was then a Campbelltown City Council alderman, a federal public servant and a trade unionist. Having always been primarily interested in federal policy issues, I watched the redistribution process with interest. It was inevitable that there would be significant boundary changes in a rapidly growing area such as Macarthur. So, when the likely new boundaries became clear, I announced that I would seek federal Labor preselection for Macarthur. For some time, it seemed that I would be the only candidate, but eventually a number of other local branch members entered the race. It became obvious that many prominent ALP people, particularly within the New South Wales Right, considered that Macarthur was unwinnable. This was despite the Mackerras pendulum estimate of Macarthur as a 2.6 per cent Labor seat. This figure was actually wrong, as there had been an error in apportioning postal votes from the previous election. The real margin was more like one per cent to Labor. Despite this, many people-including selfappointed experts such as Michael Knight, the state member for Campbelltown-made it clear that they considered Macarthur unwinnable for Labor. This may explain why neither the Right nor the Left in New South Wales became involved in the Macarthur 1992 preselection-at least not in the way in which factions normally do become involved bills. But, in preselections. Although a member of the Left, I neither sought nor received support on a factional basis in the preselection which I ultimately won in June 1992. I took my chances with the local branch members in a rank and file preselection ballot, bearing in mind that in areas like Macarthur the further away you get from the Sydney GPO, the less relevant factions become. These members at the time were genuine, ordinary Labor Party branch members who were not particularly interested in party factionalism. I won that preselection on the basis of my track record of service to my union and the Labor Party, my local government experience and my commitment to social justice issues and policies. As I said, not many people thought that we could win Macarthur. Despite the predictions of gloom and doom, I always believed that I had a good chance of winning Macarthur for the ALP. Ironically, four days after I announced that I would seek preselection-that was on 17 November 1991-the coalition launched Fightback, with the GST and all, on 21 November. Unlike many others, I never believed that the Australian people would embrace the GST or Fightback, and I campaigned accordingly. I believed that under a new Prime Minister, Paul Keating, Labor had a chance to steer away from economic rationalism and show a clear contrast with the coalition, something which had been lacking for many years. As Macarthur is an area of young people and families, I was always confident that we would succeed with such a campaign, and that is what ultimately happened, although for a long period before the election it seemed that I had very little support from within the party. Once the election was called for 13 March, I did receive significant support from a number of trade unions, in particular the CFMEU and the Miscellaneous Workers Union. But it was also clear that a number of people within the Labor Party, particularly in Campbelltown, having predicted my defeat, were trying to ensure that their prediction would be right. I might return to that topic another time. I was elected on 13 March 1993 as the member for Macarthur. But this did not satisfy my detractors. It almost seems as though I provoked them. Suddenly, the same people who had been saying that I could not win the seat were saying that I should have won by a greater margin and that there had been a swing against Labor in Macarthur. This hypocrisy, which matched exactly the spin put on the result by the defeated Liberal candidate-you can understand the Liberals saying that, I guess-was based on the same erroneous Mackerras pendulum which showed Macarthur as a 2.6 per cent Labor seat. The margin now, of course, is 1.3 per cent. But, as I said earlier, the 2.6 per cent figure was wrong in the first place. It became obvious within weeks of my election that a campaign had already started within the Labor Party to undermine me and to defeat me at the next preselection. This is despite the fact that Macarthur was obviously-and still is-a marginal seat. I could go into a lot more detail about some of the bizarre incidents that occurred during those early weeks and months of my time in this place. I am also sorely tempted to name for the public record some of the people whom I know to be responsible for various actions, including the disgraceful ongoing smear campaign against me. However, I am tom between my desire to expose the truth for the public record and to bring people to account on the one hand and, on the other hand, my ultimate loyalty to the Labor movement and my desire not to see a coalition government. I am reminded, in fact, by the presence of the minister at the table, the Minister for Communications and the Arts and member for Dobell (Mr Lee), that in 1993 there was an article in the Sun-Herald, which was a profile on the minister at the table, in which he said, quite correctly, that, although our faction fights and internal differences are pretty hard fought in the Labor Party, at election time we forget that and get on with campaigning for the Labor candidate. I agree with the member for Dobell, as I said at the time in party meetings in my electorate, but unfortunately the same attitude was not adopted in 1993 or since by some of his factional colleagues in Campbelltown. Because I do not wish to be accused of stooping to the same depths as some of those people, I will resist the temptation, at least for the time being, to take matters further. Nobody can ever accuse me of being disloyal to the Labor Party, which is more than I can say for some of those who have sought to destroy me and to damage my reputation. Suffice it to say at this stage that there was a huge branchstacking campaign undertaken against me, which I believe was an abuse of ALP rules, quite apart from the fact that many of those recruited seem to have nothing in common with Labor objectives and have probably never voted Labor in their lives. If the Liberal Party in Western Australia thinks that it has problems with Noel Crichton-Browne, I can assure the opposition that there is more than one Noel Crichton-Browne in the political parties in this country. I might leave it at that. Those people who sought to defeat me obviously succeeded in the preselection last May. But at what cost? I note with interest a report in this morning's Financial Review which suggests that the Labor Party will lose Macarthur. And the Liberal Party has now chosen a former Premier as its candidate for Macarthur. Mr Lieberman-And a good candidate, too!",55
42,Mr HAVILAND,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"He is probably better than their previous candidate, but I certainly take no comfort from the prospect of a coalition victory in the next election, either in Macarthur or any other seat, and certainly not from the prospect of a Howard government. I have been critical of some actions of this government and also of the New South Wales government, particularly its failure to abolish the M5 tollway, which must surely damage the Labor vote in any election at any level of government, particularly in my electorate. I have also spoken publicly of my concern that the only way we seem to be able to defend some of our decisions on things like privatisation is to say that the coalition would be worse. It is no wonder that traditional Labor voters are said to be considering deserting the party. But no matter how angry Labor supporters are, the reality is this: a coalition government would indeed be far worse. Perhaps voters who are disillusioned with both major parties might look to a third alternative, such as Independents, Democrats or Greens. But I am certainly not convinced that those who are telling pollsters that they will not vote Labor will in fact vote for the coalition. The message for the Labor Party and the government is this: in 1993, as I said earlier, we won because we showed we were different from the coalition. That was what the Poles Apart campaign was all about, and it was certainly what my campaign in Macarthur was all about. But, in this era of economic rationalism, competition policy, privatisation and support for market forces-ahead of concern for social justice-it is again difficult for many people to tell the difference between the two major parties. If the government can demonstrate that we are different, as it did successfully in 1993, then I believe Labor can and will win the next election. The coalition has nothing positive to offer the Australian people. We do not seem to know what its policies are, because it will not release its policies. The ones we do know about are obviously ones that will not be embraced by the Australian people. The coalition is still seeking to make industrial relations an election issue. Good luck to it, I say. But I do not really mean 'good luck', because that is one area where there is indeed a probability that Labor will show the differences between us and the coalition, and we will probably win the election accordingly. I hope that Labor does win the election. We need to focus on what the Labor Party stands for and get back to basic traditional Labor issues and show that we are not just another conservative party like the coalition.",57
43,Mr RICHARD EVANS,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"I was tempted to ask for an extension to talk about such things, because I could give the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Haviland) some advice about how to handle factions. This year, 1995, marks the year that Australia remembers the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II and the huge sacrifices made by Australians during the torrid years of war 50 years ago. We remember the quality of the mostly young Australians who paid the ultimate sacrifice for their country and the security they provided for their families, my family and, I am sure, all families within our community. We should never forget the charity of those heroes, their sacrifice, their hope for the future and their desire to provide a free and vital society for future generations. The very values which these heroes held so dear 50 years ago, which are so easily ridiculed by so many commentators and extreme members of this place-mostly from the other side, I might note-are values which we should also always hold dear. We should never forget the place of those heroes in history and, this year, we have remembered their efforts of half a century ago. This has also been a year of election speculation-speculation which has now been shown to be part of the silly political game so many of us participate in-a game which has seen many Australians wish for an early election, so we can move on and not waste valuable months in not being sure about our future. But the choice Australians will make, whenever we have an election, is no game. It is possibly the most significant decision, the war, that voters will make about the type of government they want to lead them into the 21st century. The next election will be of rhetoric, mostly from the government-as we have seen already. As we saw at the last election; this government is probably best known for the breaking of promises. This election will be full of the usual Labor politistate cal tricks and deceptions. But the next election will mark a clear choice for Australians. The decision we will make next year will be a choice between the past and the future, between the lies and betrayal of the past and the promise and responsibility of the future, between the lost fortune of the past and the demands and opportunities of the future. Sometimes we are asked to pay the price to attain the things we strive for. For Australia this election is such a time. Are we prepared to pay the price? Are we prepared to pay the price to rid ourselves of a decade of the Labor government's abuse of power, of Labor's neglect of the broader community, and Labor's betrayal of the very qualities and values those Australian heroes fought for so valiantly 50 years ago? In Cowan, for instance, we have appalling levels of youth unemployment; 16 per cent of our young people in Cowan are unemployed. We have social security recipients, such as single parents, caught in the web of poverty and living below those standards set so proudly by the last generation. We have a community living in fear in Cowan, too scared to venture out after dark or use the various forms of public transport. We have struggling families in Cowan, trying to make ends meet, who are discriminated against by this government in relation to child care. We have a community badly in need of improved facilities, such as child-care and youth facilities. We have a growing population of homeless youth in Cowan. How, in a country so rich as Australia, can we have this sorry incidence of youth homelessness in our country? It is a disgrace which is a growing legacy of this Labor government. We have a growing ethnic community in Cowan which is denied equal access and equity to mainsince stream services. We have an Aboriginal community in Cowan, which in a recent survey was considered to be the poorest area full of Perth, which goes without adequate funding from this Labor government. Cowan has been a region of neglect over eight years of Labor rule prior to 1993 by both the federal government and the previous government. A cursory study of historical Hansard would indicate clearly that the region had been badly represented prior to 1993, but since that time most of these important issues have been addressed in this place. Cowan is just a small example of the neglect the Labor government has shown to all of Australia in its 13 years of rule I ask: are we prepared to pay the price to restore good fortune to the Australian people, that to provide a future full of hope and opportunities? Are we prepared to pay the price to rid the community of a government that lies to us, that removes the will to prosper, that threatens our future by destroying the hopes of our young, and will do whatever it takes to retain power? Do we believe the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) when he says one thing and then does the direct opposite? Can we ever believe this Prime Minister again? This is the Prime Minister who promised l-a-w tax cuts, and then raised sales tax on almost every product in Australia, the Prime Minister who promised not to increase the Medicare levy-as did the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence)-and then increased it. It should not shock those who follow royal commissions, particularly those who followed the recent Marks royal commission in Western Australia, to find out that the minister for health had been untruthful on that occasion. She was certainly untruthful when she said she would not increase the Medicare levy, and did so. Can we believe the Prime Minister who promised to reduce company tax, did so and then put it back up a year or two later? Can we believe the Prime Minister who promised to take all age pensioners from the income tax regime and then kept them within the tax net? I think it took about three days after the last election for that promise to be broken. Can we believe the Prime Minister who promised to reduce foreign debt and then raised debt to record levels? Can we ever believe again a Prime Minister who promised a surplus budget for this year but it is now seen to be in deficit? The simple answer for many Australians as confirmed by the front page of the Financial Review today is, 'No, we can never do so again. We can never believe this Prime Minister or this government again.' Are we prepared to allow at the head of our country's affairs a Labor Party that has been proven many times to be corrupt, has lied to us, continues to lose control of financial matters and has had former leaders gaoled for stealing public and other funds? Can we accept the doubtful claims of the Labor government that we Australians have never had it so good? Can we entrust the nation's economy to a party that ruined four state economies, took us into a recession and now is so out of control in managing prosperity that it is willing to lead us back into recession? Will the Australian people ever have the confidence to trust the Labor Party, a party for true believers, which deliberately and needlessly created the worse unemployment figures in Australia since the war, driving a stake to widen the gap between rich and poor? Would we trust our international affairs to the thought police of the Labor government which is willing to sell our community values to international bodies? Can we trust this government to be serious about human rights when it allows the continued degradation of our Aboriginal people, our indigenous people? Are we not the sons and daughters of the previous generation which fought and worked so hard to provide a nation so full of promise and opportunity? This is a nation rich with assets, a nation which cries out to progress; yet, as we have seen over the last few days in industrial relations, we are going backwards. This is a nation which has been betrayed and destroyed by the Labor Party, a Labor Party which has lowered standards, destroyed hope for our young and developed a growing wedge of conflict within the community. The light on the hill so much wanted by the true believers has been snuffed out for all time through their disappointment at their betrayal by this Labor government. Australians have a chance at the next election to redefine and redirect our future away from the politics of hate and division that are provided so easily by the Labor Party. Anyone who listened to the speech by the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) earlier on would agree that that particular member is an example of hate and division whenever he gets up and speaks in this place. Such politics cut across the grain of all things that characterise the Australian spirit. My colleagues and I within the coalition are absolutely committed to restoring the Australian people to their rightful place in their own country as participants and partners in government rather than frustrated onlookers of their future. We want Australians back in the business of running Australia and therefore owning Australia and its future. We believe that, of the great wealth of our country, the characteristic that stands out above all else is the Australian people's desire for social equity, opportunity and prosperity, individuality and a sense of community. These are the values that have been betrayed by the Labor Party. A lot of commentators, particularly the self-described rabid feminist Eva Cox, ridicule these values as part of the traditional values, but values such as honesty, integrity, charity, respect and responsibility are all traditional values. These are the values which patriots in the past have made the ultimate sacrifice to protect. Yet we have these self-proclaimed experts who believe that the values are old world. They are not old world; they are current world, new world and 1 something to aspire to. It is then obvious that we are at a defining point in our history: do we acknowledge our past and the freedoms of choice provided to us or move to the vile community of cynicism, dishonesty in our leaders and a community of fear and hate? In 1995 the Prime Minister and other fellow travellers have presented to us their picture of Australia and how we have supposedly benefited greatly from Labor in power. They have waxed lyrical about the achievements of the Labor Party and how Australia is apparently winning. Some say winners are grinners, yet when one reviews those Australians that have been grinning over the past decade it is quite obscene to see that it has been only the favoured ones, the mates of Labor, that grin. Australian families right now are not grinning. Young Australians have not got much to smile about. Small business in Australia is not smiling. In fact, the smile has been wiped from the faces of many Australians who remain very concerned about their future, and again I refer to today's Australian Financial Review. The media may be seduced by the Labor Party's ways, their smooth talk and their taxpayer funded media unit, but those Australians that care about their country will not be enticed by their snake oil sales pitch. The Labor Party story is well worn, it is tired and it is a bunch of rhetorical untruths. By contrast, despite what the media and others would have you believe, the coalition offers the Australian people security, social equity, opportunity, reward for endeavour, and a future our community and, more importantly, our nation's children can have confidence in. We in the coalition want to give renewed meaning to being Australian and capture the Australian spirit which cries out to be heard. Gone will be the politics of deceit and government of favourites and mates. We want to provide liberty, equality and humanity, the very essence and foundation of liberalism. As previously announced, our election program will have some great aims. Some of them are these. We will commit to responsible economic management to give hope for our future by reducing our national debt, which is a disgrace; to give Austn-lians choice at the workplace, which in recent times has been taken from them; to liberate small business people, farmers and small investors; to allow federalism to work and to reduce wasted funds and confusion which result from duplication of government services; to embrace the 21st century and the technological and information age; to allow all Australians to enjoy the fruits of our nation's sustainable resource development; to give Australian families a fair go; to give the Australian community ownership of their future and involve them in the decision making processes of our country; to give Australia back to Australians and to liberate our national identity from international authority. In short, the coalition will put people, Australian people, first. All of us have to insist that we can do much better as a nation. We must pay the price. We must reject the policies that subsidise indolence and apathy. We ought to be determined to change the direction of the wasteful Labor government, wasting the resources of our great nation. The greatest resource the Labor government wastes is the skill and the endeavour of our own people. A country as rich and as skilled as ours should never be producing so much inequality, so much poverty, so much injustice. Let us not continue the neglect and deceit of the Labor Party, where our youth are at risk, where our single parent families are left to wallow in the depths of despair through their poor status, where jobs are constantly at risk, as identified in the Financial Review today, and where our education system is not providing for our future. I have great faith in the Australian spirit, the spirit of a fair go. based upon integrity and honesty-the very values ridiculed by those in the Labor government who would have us believe that dishonesty of a minister is ,okay. Honesty is not a value to be played on the political stage. What do our children think when they hear it is okay for a minister of government, someone to be respected, to lie? What standards is the Labor Party subscribing to when it accepts lying amollgst its members? I believe the Aust-alian community has had enough of being taken for granted, of being lied to. They want better than what the Labor Party is offering. I believe Australia needs a new direction, new management, and new policies that liberate and reward. Mr Speaker, will you believe with me that our country can be rejuvenated, to provide a hope and future for ourselves and our children? To want less is a tragedy and a betrayal. When I entered parliament, some three years ago, I wanted to serve the community to the very best of my ability. I believe my role as the member for Cowan is to provide a voice to those Australians who want to be heard. The values of the Cowan constituents which they strive for, are mine. The hopeand dreams that they have for their families and their country are also mine. I believe I have represented their worries and their concerns about the future, which are also mine. I think I have represented them here in this place. But my will for them is not enough. My desire, my enthusiasm and my energy for them are not enough. What Australia now needs are patriots to stand and say that enough is enough. We have had enough of the lies, enough of reducing standards, enough of the collapsing youth employment market, enough of community division, and enough of the Australian Labor Party and their government for the few-their government of hate and division. Australia needs a new generation of heroes to stand up for their country as they did so willingly 50 years ago. We need a new generation to provide patriotism and fight the enemies-intolerance and reducing standards. W.e - eed them to fight for the future by reJectmg Labor at the forthcoming election. Mr Deputy Speaker, 1995 is a year to remember those who defended our heritage 50 years ago and the price they paid for our futur-. Let it also be remembered for the we Will pay for'the future of our children. Let us all pay the price and reject the Labor government at the next election.",57
44,Mr LEO MCLEAY,ABORIGINAL EDUCATION,"Watson) (1.42 p.m.}I suppose some of the matters that the member for Cowan (Mr Richard Evans) mentioned need to have a little bit of comment made on them. It never ceases to amaze me that in this House, day after day, one hears members of the opposition responding to their leader's mantra, which was, 'The times will suit me.' What their leader meant by that was that he hoped that Australia would be in a trough at the time of the election and, at that time, it would suit people to change their votes. In response to that mantra, of course, what we find from the opposition is this continual talking-down of Australia. There is continual talking-down of their country and of the hopes and aspirations of people, just for a bit of cheap political gain. What the opposition do not realise-and the Australian people do realise-is that there are a lot of good things going on out there in the community. There is a lot of progress being made. Australia is being dragged out of the very old-fashioned views that the Leader of the Opposition and member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) would have us take. The government is doing its best to try to tum Australia into a country that is outwardlooking rather than inward-looking, robust rather than weak, and willing to grasp opportunities rather than hide behind protective barriers. The government is also looking to do things that will help the future of Australia, rather than just trying to hark back to the 1950s, One of those areas where the government has done a lot of good has been the area of the environment, which has become one of the top issues on the agenda of the government and Australia, if for no other reason than that our environment in Australia has been recognised as a resource of great value. The recent ranking of Australia as first, in world terms, in terms of per capita wealth was achieved by incorporating our rich natural resources. Tourism is shaping up as our No. 1 industry, and central to tourism is the price maintenance of our natural resources. The government is providing $10 million over four years for the national ecotourism program to assist in the implementation of the national ecotourism strategy. The government has integrated its commitment to the environment and to employment programs, with our green jobs program which will create around 5,000 jobs in this financial year and 10,000 jobs per annum in ensuing years. The government can stand proudly on its environmental record. The Labor government has done a great deal in this area. Australia is recognised internationally as a world leader in the management and protection of World Heritage areas. Some outstanding examples of these are the Franklin River, Uluru and the Daintree. There has been a $53 million package for the national coastcare program to support community projects protecting Australia's important and beautiful coastal environments. There is no question but that the government has committed itself to sustainable development, whereas 20 years ago, in the days that the opposition would hark back to, governments would decide that a development was a good idea economically and basically would go ahead with it. These days, we are a lot wiser. We realise that industry, mining, construction and other developments have a cost beyond capital setup, running and labour costs. They also have an environmental cost, and this is something that needs to be considered right at the start of a project, not when the factory has been built or the open-cut mine has been operating for some years. It is important to sketch a quick picture of the government's approach and its thinking on the environment, and the development that the government has been involved in over the last decade. When people look for inspiration, one of the most inspiring points of view that the Labor government has taken has been in the area of the environment. There are a number of other matters I would like to discuss in this debate as well. The first is telecommunications and specifically the roll-out of cable. The government has made sure that Australia is in the best position to capitalise on the communications and information revolution. We have opened up the industry to competition, to make sure that people across Australia will have a better service and lower prices. The government has agreed that it is vital to our future that Aus- community. tralians have equity of access to the means of communication and of obtaining information. There is no question that this is something that has happened and is happening. From 1993-94, the cost of international calls has dropped by nine per cent and the cost of domestic long-distance calls has dropped by six per cent. This is a great thing for people, both socially and economically. The distance between Australia and the rest of the world is getting smaller, as is the distance across our vast land. Let us get down to the nitty-gritty of how those leaps in telecommunications are physically taking place. Everyone knows that communications technology is getting better day by day and that we can communicate faster, more cheaply and more easily than before. To assess the benefits of this improved technology, though, we have to have the infrastructure to carry it. We need to have the lines, the cabling running past our homes and businesses to carry all this communication and information. There are great benefits but also environmental costs in achieving this. People have been sold on the vision of the information superhighway and the interactivity that it offers with pay TV, home shopping, videoconferencing, the Internet and high speed links. What they have not been sold is the physical intrusion into their immediate environment that this vision entails. Foxtel and Optus Vision have been selling their pay TV services for quite a while now as something that is out there that is beamed into the lounge room. What they have not been selling to people is the digging up of their footpaths and the stringing up of more cables from telegraph poles outside their windows and the putting up of mobile phone towers wherever they feel like it. There is a simple reason why they have not been selling people this. It is because we have not forced them to. I think we have been too lenient on the carriers, on Telstra, Optus and Vodafone. We wanted a great thing for the people of Australia and that was access to the best communications system as soon as possible, but we placed a bit too much faith in the carriers to do this with sensitivity to the The carriers are getting the infrastructure out there with great speed and I do not think the government has anything to complain about on that score. But what the community is starting to complain about is that carriers are not consulting with them about it. They are spending a fortune on as on TV and in the papers about the amazing services they going to provide but how much are they spending to let people know that they are going to erect a mobile phone tower down the road or get the cranes out to put up more black cables on telegraph poles? The government, unfortunately, has not caused the carriers to be good, considerate corporate citizens and because we have not coerced them to be they have not. I must admit that I am quite surprised by the carriers' approach. When they are rolling out their infrastructure they view the community, the public, the local authorities, as impediments, as roadblocks on the way into their superhighway. But when the roll-out is finished they are turning around to the same people, that same community, that same pUblic, and saying, 'Please come and be our customers, we will treat you like gold. Our customer is the most important thing to us.' I am intrigued at the dichotomy of their approach. I have had some exposure to the approach of Optus. Since the recent outcry by the community and councils about the lack of consultation about cable roll-out, Optus has softened its approach slightly and given the appearance of taking these concerns into consideration. However, when you speak to the Optus people it is evident that, under the thin veneer of community consultation, their determination to bulldoze through with their roll-out is evident. They will go ahead and they will do what they want despite the objections and they will rely upon the authoriimpact ty that carriers have to do it. Again, Vodafone is one of the operators that has sometimes had scant regard for the people in the area where they intend to erect mobile phone towers. They tend to make the decision about the location before consulting with the community at all. It is a common thing for people to wake up in the morning and find that a tower is being erected in their neighbourhood that they have heard nothing about. I would have thought that in the past the demonising of Telstra by other carriers and by, quite rightly, people in the community, would have made the new entrants into this market a bit more sensitive. I think the irony are is that Telstra people have lifted their game and are becoming a bit more sensitive but at the same time the newer carriers are starting to learn the same old tricks that Telstra used to employ. I would have thought that it would have made good business sense for carriers to notify people in the areas where they are putting up their infrastructure and even to take that opportunity to inform them about the services they will be offering and maybe to gain some customers. I would like to emphasise that I am not attacking the principle of competition in the telecommunications industry, or the goal that we have of providing access to these services throughout Australia, and in particular in remote and rural areas. What I am expressing is surprise, and I must say regret, at the approach of the carriers in implementing this roll-out. It is regrettable that the carriers appear to have opted to comply only with the letter of the national code under which they are rolling out infrastructure rather than with the spirit of the code which was drafted to encourage a speedy roll-out for the benefit of Australians. Austel is in the process of reviewing the operation of the code and it appears there will be some major modifications and tightening of provisions to ensure that the carriers do not ride roughshod over the communities they are proposing to serve in the future. I hope to see the new code establish more detailed procedures for consideration of environmental and health impact by the roll-out of infrastructure with a process for planning to enhance this without bringing the roll-out to a grinding halt. It is too late to think about environmental considerations once the structures are there. Its impact on the environment must be assessed and options properly canvassed before work begins. All the carriers need to consult more widely with the communities that they wish to service and they must adopt a more conciliatory approach or otherwise the government will need to ensure that there is mechanism to have this consultation occur. I community. have to say that we are at the stage where the government will need to take some approaches to curtail this laissez-faire approach that carriers have at present. I would like to move from the question of the information superhighway to that of ordinary blacktop roads. Roads are becoming a vexed question in my electorate. Everyone uses them and wants better ones, of course, but no-one wants to pay for the building of them or to have them running past their homes. That is a classic example of the clash of economic and environmental concerns. Since 1983 the federal Labor government has spent $18.5 billion on road funding. In this budget we have proposed the allocation of $2.5 billion over the next three years the national highway, along with $727.4 million in untied road grants to states and local authorities for this financial year. government is addressing the problem of the impact of heavy freight vehicles on urban roads and the environment through a policy of constructing ring roads and freight routes to link highways and industrial freight generspace ating areas, such as the orbital road in Westney. ern Sydney. This road will be vital to the linking of Sydney West Airport with the rest of Sydney and New South Wales. As an example of the environmental probal lems with building roads, I would like to briefly talk about the difficulties we are having with the extension of the M5 motorof way to the east, which will run through heart of my electorate. This is a project by the previous Liberal government in New South Wales. There are a lot of people in electorate who have problems with this road, not the least of whom are those whose homes will be resumed. Earlier on in this program, we had a great victory in protecting the environmentally sensitive Wolli Creek area by having the road tunnelled under it. Unfortunately, while we have solved the problem of WolIi Creek and the horrific overpass that the Roads Traffic Authority intended building in the Turrella area, there are still a number of problems with this proposal in terms of its journed. some impact on the environment and the local When completed, the road will carry a large the number of heavy vehicles as it will link Sydney airport with the west. Residents are very concerned about the noise and air pollution impacts of these heavy vehicles, particularly around the King Georges Road intersection. At the moment, there is no proposal to tunnel under King Georges Road to avoid that intersection. Instead, there will be an overpass at the intersection which will mean that heavy trucks will have to stop at a toll plaza before the intersection, then roll down the hill to the intersection before screeching on their brakes and changing gear to go up the overpass. The complex process of consultation on this for issue has gone on for years. But, while the Roads and Traffic Authority is dealing with half the problem in tunnelling from Turrella The to Bexley Road, it should really grasp the nettle in this issue and continue that tunnel all the way from Bexley Road up to King Georges Road. We would then find that there would be a very important piece of open left for the people in that part of SydSo, with a tunnel, we could ensure that we would do away with most of the environmentproblems that come from the road and also ensure that people's lives are made that much better. The additional benefit for the people my electorate would be a very large piece the of open space which would benefit both begun present and future generations. A lot of discussion and consideration needs my to be given to the built environment in our cities. The two issues I have raised-the problems with large roads that go through residential areas and the difficulties that telecommunications carriers are causing-are problems that the national government needs to consider. But they are problems that need to be resolved by other levels of government. I commend these bills to the House and thank and members for their interest. Debate (on motion by Mr Hicks) adNA APEC Leaders Meeting in Osaka, Japan",61
45,Mr KEATING,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Blaxland-Prime Minister}-by leave-This was the third meeting of leaders of the APEC economies. The process began with the meeting hosted by President Clinton in Seattle in 1993 following a proposal I had made, orally and by correspondence, with the other APEC leaders, for a leaders forum to empower the APEC process. It continued with the historic meeting chaired by President Soeharto in Indonesia a year ago, which produced the Bogor declaration. In that declaration the APEC economies committed themselves to the goal of free and open trade in the Asia-Pacific at the latest by 2010 for industrialised countries and 2020 for developing countries. The Bogor goals were unprecedented and audacious. The challenge for APEC this year was to put in place at Osaka a plan of action which would show how the goals could be implemented. I believe the result in Osaka was an outstanding success. The plan of action and leaders declaration met all Australia's aims and have firmly cemented APEC as the key regional body for coordinating the development and growth of the Asia-Pacific into the next century. It has provided a framework which will ensure Australia's continuing and deeper integration into the dynamic region around us with all the economic, political and strategic benefits which follow from that. It is of deep and long-run significance to Australia. At Osaka, the 18 APEC economies, which already account for 60 per cent of the world's GOP and half its trade, renewed their commitment-what the leaders declaration describes as their 'unwavering resolve'-to free and open trade and investment in the APEC region by 2010/2020. The Osaka action agenda sets out the principles which will underpin the process of trade liberalisation and trade facilitation Asia-Pacific. The eight principles we have set down include WTO consistency, comparability, non-discrimination, transparency, standstill, and a commitment to move together in the liberalisation process. But a central principle for Australia is comprehensive coverage of all sectors and issues. This means that agriculture is firmly on the APEC agenda. This was one of the most difficult issues we faced during the year. But as I told Prime Minister Murayama, Mill Minister Hashimoto and Foreign Minister Kono in several meetings over the past twelve months, it was an acid test of APEC's relevance not only to Australia but to developing agricultural producers like Thailand and Indonesia. This is a real win for Australian farmers because it enables them to plan confidently for the opening up of the vast market around us and brings closer our vision of Australia as a global supplier of food. In addition to the principles, a process was agreed for liberalisation. Leaders directed ministers and officials to immediately begin the preparation of 'concrete and substantive' action plans to be submitted to the 1996 ministerial meeting in the Philippines for assessment. Overall implementation of the plans will begin in January 1997, with annual reviews and improvements thereafter. Here I emphasise 'begin'. The plans will be most detailed for the early years, but will stretch through to the 2010/2020 end dates. We have got two key things right about APEC. First, we know where we are going. We have decided on the end point we wish to reach-free and open trade and investment in the APEC region-and we have a process for getting there: concerted liberalisation. This is an entirely new model for global trade liberalisation. It does not depend on the legalistic and adversarial approach of traditional trade rounds in which the incentive for negotiators was to keep their best cards in their pockets, ensuring that offers were therefore grudging and incomplete. It substitutes instead a new form of concerted individual movement in which peer pressure and self interest will work hand in hand to maintain in the progress towards goals which have already been set; that is, the end goal having been set at the beginning. The second thing we have right in APEC is the regular involvement of leaders. Their meetings give the process an authority and drive which could never be matched by meetings of ministers alone. Their engagement invests the outcome of the annual discussions with a weight and authenticity which keeps it moving forward. The APEC process marks a very significant new development in trade negotiations. I suspect it is likely to prove much more relevant to the sort of global economy which is now developing--one in which Asian countries have an increasingly significant economic role; in which many more states need to be engaged in the process and have a stake in the outcome; and in which the role of developing countries like China and Indonesia will become more central. One of APEC's greatest values as an institution is that it is a practical example of north-south cooperation. It provides a framework for developed and developing economies to work together to liberalise and tate trade and investment and to promote economic and technical cooperation. It has been fundamental to the whole APEC outcome that President Soeharto-the leader of one of the world's largest developing countries-has been one of the driving forces behind the liberalisation process. Leaders did not only talk about principles and process at Osaka. They also delivered a package of initial actions-a 'downpayment' on their Uruguay Round commitmentswhich demonstrates beyond question APEC's seriousness of purpose. For example, Japan announced the acceleration by approximately two years of its Uruguay Round tariff reduction commitments on items affecting trade worth ¥1O billion as well as a substantial package of deregulation measures. China announced that it would substantially reduce tariffs on over 4,000 tariff lines and will eliminate import control measures on about 170 tariff lines. The other APEC members, including Indonesia, all put good contriin butions on the table. Through these downpayments APEC has managed to do something the G7 members could not bring themselves to do earlier this year. APEC has become the principal catalyst for global trade liberalisation. At the Osaka meeting we urged other WTO members to match APEC's efforts. We also agreed to hold a meeting of APEC trade ministers next year to consider joint initiatives in advance of the first ministerial meeting of the WTO which will be held in December 1996 in Singapore. In addition to these trade liberalisation measures, a number of important trade facilitation measures are also to be taken. For example, APEC will introduce a common harmonised system of tariff classifications by 1996, an internationally agreed standard electronic customs message system by 1999 and pilot mutual recognition agreements in the area of standards by 1997. These are important benefits for the business community. Customs procedures alone can add 10 per cent to the cost of doing business and although tariffs in some parts of facilithe APEC region remain high, the main impediments for many of our businesses are in the non-tariff area. The APEC leaders also acknowledged the vital work the business sector must play in APEC's work by agreeing to the recommendation from the Pacific Business Forum that we establish a permanent APEC Business Advisory Council, with its members to be appointed directly by leaders. I want to acknowledge here the outstanding work which Australia's representatives on the Pacific Business Forum, Ms Imelda Roche of  Dunlop, have done for Aus-ralia and for the APEC region, and to thank them on the government's behalf. The Eminent Persons Group has also made a very valuable contribution to APEC's development work; it set signposts along the way, and I again thank Mr Neville Wran for all his work over. the past three years I announced during the Osaka meeting that response to one of the recommendations of the Pacific Business Forum Australia will introduce a business travel card to facilitate regional travel by accredited business people. We have also proposed that other APEC economies join us in this scheme. This will help greatly to facilitate the freer movement of business people around the region, and this of course will be of material assistance to mobility and to enterprise. The long-term benefits of APEC's trade liberalisation and facilitation are enormous. Recent modelling work undertaken by the Office of National Assessments and the Industry Commission backs up earlier conclusions and suggests that, when the full effects of the Bogor commitments have flowed through, the income of APEC members will increase by 3.8 per cent or $US745 billionmore than the current size of the Australian and Korean economies combined. Australians will benefit directly and substantially from this process. The initial results of the most recent modelling shows that Australia's real income will rise by 6.8 per cent or $40 billion when all the effects have flowed through, and that growth of this order can - expected to generate around 500,000 new Jobs over the course of the liberalisation period. These revised figures on the benefits to Australia, which are the result of more c?mprehensive modelling, are substantially higher than those I gave the House in the statement. I made after the Bogor declaration. Most of the focus on APEC has concentrated on its trade liberalisation dimensions. These are central to APEC's work and are vital to the region's continuing prosperity. But APEC also has a number of other dimensions, including its important work in areas like education and training, science and technolog-, small and medium enterprises, transportatIOn, telecommunications, tourism, economic policy and sustainable development. Cooperation in these areas is expanding quickly and we are seeing the development of much more intensive sets of linkages between APEC governments and businesses in all these new areas. One of APEC's major tasks-and one which was recognised by all the leaders at Osaka-will be - to keep resources flowing to the rapidly growing East Asian economies, especially China, as the region's unprecedented growth continues. For example, East Asia's demand for energy is doubling every 12 years compared with the world average of every 28 years. China's demand for grains is growing so fast that its estimated shortage within 15 years could be three to six times Australia's total annual wheat production. APEC's infrastructure requirements over the next decade are likely to require $US2 trillion, of which well over $US5OO billion will have to come from the private sector. The way we handle these requirements will affect not only the region's prosperity but also its security in the first part of the next century. I said at the leaders meeting that Australia was ready to address the concerns which Japan, Korea and China have expressed about meeting their food needs. I suggested the creation of an APEC task force on food and agribusiness to examine regional food challenges into the next century. I will be writing shortly to my colleagues to follow that up and put some flesh on that proposal. If the Bogor commitments are fully implemented, by the year 2020 APEC will account for more than three-quarters of global production and three-quarters of the world's trade. ASEAN's per capita incomes will be five times higher than they currently are. One enormously beneficial consequence of the establishment of this process and these APEC meetings is the opportunity it provides for closer contact between regional leaders. In addition to the discussions in the leaders meeting itself, I was able to hold very useful bilateral discussions with President Kim Young Sam of Korea, President Soeharto of Indonesia, President Zedillo of Mexico, Prt;sident Jiang Zemin of China, Prime Minister Murayama of Japan, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong of Singapore, Prime Minister Banham of Thailand, Prime Minister Bolger of New Zealand and Vice President Gore of the United States. This meeting was a very great success for Prime Minister Murayama and the Japanese government, especially MITI Minister Hashimoto and Foreign Minister Kono who were most directly involved. Japan's leadership was very important in helping to shape this outstanding result, and I take this opportunity to congratulate them on it. I feel very confident that President Ramos of the Philippines, whom I had a number of discussions with over various luncheon and dinner opportunities, who will chair APEC in 1996, will continue this work. I have offered him any assistance Australia can provide. I would like also to take the opportunity here to mention the work of the officials of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in their collaborative work with their counterparts in Japan over the course of the year and, of course, their work with some of the officials from the other countries which have been engaged in the process. I think Australia's role in this, the fact that we not only have ideas but also can express them at official level, has very much helped this process over the course of the year. I suggested last year after the Bogor meeting that the establishment and development of APEC would rank with the establishment of the structures which grew from the Bretton Woods agreement after the Second World War as a model to serve the interests of a new world. After the meeting in Osaka I am more than ever convinced of the truth of this. With APEC heading for 75 per cent of world GDP and 75 per cent of world trade over the forecast period, and the contribution it is likely to make to it, I am sure this may well prove to - so. Australians can feel well pleased with APEC's progress and our own central role in developing it. I present the following paper: APEC Leaders Meeting in Osaka, JapanMinisterial Statement, 22 November 1995. Motion (by Mr Beazley) proposed: That the House take note of the paper.",65
46,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"On behalf of the opposition, I welcome the statement made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) regarding the meeting in Osaka. I also take the opportunity, again on behalf of the opposition, to express strong agreement with the government's goals and objectives in relation to the APEC arrangement. This is an important initiative. I certainly want to make it clear to the House that the goals of APEC are shared in common by both sides of the parliament. The Prime Minister has made a contribution to this process, as indeed did both of his predecessors, Bob Hawke and Malcolm Fraser, in their different ways. The goal of trade liberalisation in our region is one that all sensible Australians will aspire to, and the way in which successive governments of Australia go about achieving it will, in the years to come, be a very important measure of this country's sense of its own importance, its own destiny and its own role in this region. As the Prime Minister said, it does represent a very important north-south dialogue; it does bring together nations of vastly different cultures, of vastly different histories, with vastly different economies and with vastly different interests. If the goals of the APEC arrangement can be achieved by the designated years, then it will be a very particular tribute to the leadership skills of all those who have played and will playa role in the future in achieving those goals. It is important, as the Prime Minister has said, that the arrangements re-endorsed at Osaka do not contain any sectoral exclusions. It would have been quite unacceptable to both the Liberal and National parties as well as the government if there had been any suggestion that agriculture be in any way excluded, on the basis of some kind of different sectoral approach. I welcome the fact that there has been absolutely no reference at all to that in the final understandings that emerged from the agreement. Regional trade liberalisation does need to be conducted on an open, nondiscriminatory basis-and the goals, as I said, are very important and laudable goals to which we all aspire. What has been said in Osaka and what was contained in the Bogor declaration represent a statement of goals and a statement of objectives. Thus far, everybody can feel well pleased, with a sense of purpose and a sense of having made progress. The real test will begin in 1996 when, in accordance with the Prime Minister's statement, it will be necessary for concrete and substantive action plans to be submitted to the 1996 ministerial meeting in the Philippines for assessment. It is at that point that the bold language and the laudable objectives which have come out of the two meetings referred to in the Prime Minister's statement will really be put to the test. I think it is fair to say, without gainsaying the positive goals contained in APEC, that many Australian exporters within the region still feel that amassed against them are a large number of both tariff and non-tariff barriers. There are many Australian exporters who feel that the practice of freer trade thus far has been rather one-sided so far as the Australian manufacturers and Australian exporters are concerned. If, as a consequence of the maturation of the APEC process, that attitude changes and those barriers begin to come down and those restrictions begin to disappear, then those exporters and those manufacturers will have every reason to feel well pleased. It is true that, as part of the understanding reached in Japan, countries made what were called 'downpayments' on their Uruguay Round commitments, which included a contribution from Australia as well as contributions from Japan, China and other APEC countries. I guess I would be speaking of behalf of many Australian exporters in the region, many Australian business men and women who have responded to the exhortation of both government and opposition alike to become heavily involved in trade in the region, if I expressed the view and the hope that they get the benefit of some of those downpayments from those other countries in the region. When we talk about the region, it is important that we preserve a sense of perspective. We ought to remember that it is undeniably the fastest growing economic region in the world. It is also undeniable that Australia's share of East Asian imports has dropped 20 per cent in the last 10 years; that since 1983 we have lost some market share in China, Hong Kong, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and Brunei; and that our merchandise trade surplus with the APEC region has declined from $5.8 billion in 1990-91 to $1.8 billion in 1994-95. This is not to gainsay in any way the goal of the APEC arrangement; it is merely to preserve a sense of perspective. It is also necessary, in the interests of preserving a sense of perspective, to bear in mind that we should never make the error of placing all of our trade eggs in the one basket. We should remember that this country, as well as having major enduring and unarguable economic interests and economic links with the region, has very strong economic linkages with the rest of the world. It is worth recalling in that context some recent figures released by the government's own statistical collection base, which indicated that over the last five to 10 years there had been a dramatic widening in the proportionality of direct investment from Australia into North America and Europe as compared with direct investment into the countries in our immediate region. I acknowledge that included amongst the APEC countries are the nations of North America but, of course, not the nations of Europe. I simply make that point not to gainsay the importance of the APEC arrangement but to inject, I hope, a sense of balance into the discussion of the issue. It is an important vision for this country to have these kinds of economic linkages and economic involvement with the nations of our region and the nations of the Pacific. I share the Prime Minister's vision-as he described it, 'our vision of Australia as a global supplier of food'. That has a strange resonance with some remarks I used yesterday when I addressed the annual conference of the National Farmers Federation, where I expressed the view of the coalition that we saw with appropriate domestic policies that Australia might indeed become the supermarket to Asia. On the subject of appropriate domestic economic policies, it is worthwhile reminding ourselves that, in order to derive the full benefit that the APEC goal and the APEC vision offers Australia, it will be necessary for our own domestic economic house to be in better order than it is at present. It is wrong to imagine that, because you live cheek by jowl with the fast growing region in the world, you automatically get a share of the action. There is only earned action in international trade; there is no automatic market share. You have to go out and fight for your market share, and in order to fight effectively for that market share you need to be more competitive than this country is at the present time. When we think of the hope that APEC offers to Australia, the opportunity it offers, and the enthusiasm that is shared across the political divide in this parliament, it is worthwhile remembering that we will only enjoy the benefits of APEC, if it does reach full maturation, if we have demonstrated through our own domestic economic performance that we are equal to the task of winning on our own merits and in our own right an effective market share of that very burgeoning economic area of the world. I welcome the Prime Minister's statement. I assure the House that the goals are shared in common. They are important goals. Whatever caveats I have entered in these brief remarks are not caveats in any way, in any sense, begrudging the goals and the vision of APEC; rather, I hope they are recognising some fundamental realities that people ultimately respond when performance is delivered rather than goals and objectives stated. Debate (on motion by Mr Grace) adjourned. APPROPRIATION BILL (No.3) 1995·96 Cognate bills: APPROPRIATION BILL (No.4) 1995·96 APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (No.2) 1995·96 Second Reading Debate resumed. Mr mCKS (Riverina) (2.27 p.m.)-Today I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No.3) 1995-96, Appropriation Bill (No.4) 1995-96 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No.2) 1995-96. It gives me an opportunity to speak on a number of issues facing the electorate of the Riverina. The first issue I would like to touch on is emergency services in the region. During recent discussions with representatives from the police, the fire service, the ambulance service, and the State Emergency Service a number of matters came to the fore. An important issue, given the number of transport vehicles travelling through the Riverina, is the transport and storage of hazardous materials. Following a recent transport accident in the area, an inspection of the truck's manifest indicated that the load included some chemicals classified as hazardous materials. As a result, it was necessary to call in officers the Environment Protection Agency. Firemen were called to work for long periods in fully encapsulated suits and the road, which was a major arterial road, was closed to through traffic for a lengthy period. Subsequently, it was determined that the goods shown on the manifest were not in fact on the truck involved in the accident. It appears it is still legal to show on the manifest goods that are not on the load. It is only when hazardous materials are being carried without being shown on the manifest that an offence is committed. A false or incorrect manifest can cause many problems and cost the community dearly in the use of manpower and delays. Imagine the work done and the frustration experienced by just one person in a protective suit, in the middle of summer, walking the required distance to the accident scene and working to clean up what was thought to be a hazardous chemical spill, only to learn that the spill was harmless. We would all appreciate it and be grateful if the spill was harmless, but the strain on those persons cleaning up the mess would be extreme. The answer may be the standardisation of manifests throughout Australia, and a colour code may be the way to go. Recently a State Rail carriage carrying hazardous waste was derailed, landing on its side. Would you believe it, the signage was located on the side of the railway truck that was on the ground and was therefore hidden. This placed those people working to right the carriage at risk because they were completely ignorant of the danger. Railway carriage.> carry potentially dangerous loads and should be signed on more than just one side. It appears that there has been little progress to allow private citizens, particularly farmers, to dispose of dangerous chemicals unless they dangerously dump them in landfill sites. It is extremely difficult to dispose of these chemicals in any other way. Therefore, much of this chemical is stored in sheds in towns and cities and on farms. Governments have discussed waste incinerators as an option, but this option was abandoned because of public opposition. I am not aware of any other from facility in existence, or proposed, that will alleviate this problem. There is always the risk that when firemen attend a fire in an urban, shearing, tractor or any other type of shed they are going into a potentially dangerous environment. It is suggested that, as in some states, law that signage be used to signify the presence of hazardous materials on a property. I think we have all seen those signs. However, I cannot envisage a person who has a drum of some hazardous chemical which may have been left over from some past era and who, because of government or bureaucratic inaction, cannot dispose of it, would put up an ugly sign saying that the chemical was in their shed. There needs to be an ongoing education program among the general public on the dangers associated with the transport of potentially dangerous materials by any type of vehicle. The emergence of new materials, the proliferation of carriers involved in the transport of dangerous goods and a general acceptance that existing emergency service procedures will cope with the threat are reasons for concern. To press my point, I ask: what legislation is there in place to prevent a general carrier loading a mixture of diesel fuel and superphosphate, which is a potential bomb, then during his trip parking in the main street of some town or city outside the picture theatre or local pub? There is no such legislation prohibiting the carriage of such lethal cocktails. Members might ask why the member for Riverina is raising this in the federal parliament as these are state issues. I understand that the federal minister is meeting with state ministers on the question of transport very shortly. I raise these issues so that some standardisation may be arrived at. A great deal of consternation has been expressed in Wagga Wagga and district about the closure of the Department of Agriculture veterinary laboratory in that city. Mr Deputy Speaker Hollis, I know that you were concerned to get the CSIRO laboratories into Wagga Wagga-so you know that city wellin an effort to provide some decentralisation. Unfortunately, you were not successful but you certainly did a good job. While the closure of the laboratory may be a state government issue, I believe that because of its importance to the Riverina region it should be mentioned in this forum. The closure of the laboratory will result in the loss it be of 12 permanent and 13 contract jobs in the region. Most importantly of all, we will lose the services of an important organisation in one of the most productive livestock areas in Australia. The laboratory in Armidale is also going. Both are being superseded by the laboratry at Camden near Sydney. The two laboratories to remain open are at Wollongbar near Lismore and Orange. While I wish these two laboratories well, it seems strange to me that they are both in marginally held federal Labor electorates with a pending federal election in sight. The figures being used as an excuse for closing the Wagga Wagga laboratory are at best rubbery and at worse totally misleading. The New South Wales government has actually shown a commercial earning of the laboratory of $270,000 as an expense against the organisation, but this is only part of the misconception being perpetrated by the government. It is to be hoped that even at this late stage the minister in New South Wales will put common sense before political expediency and allow the Wagga Wagga laboratory to remain open. I now turn to a very important matter which concerns those people who suffer from mental illness. The Richardson inquiry of the 1980s decided to take the care-for these peopleout of dedicated institutions for these people and to make homes and houses in the community available so they could mix with the general community and have a useful life and a high quality of life. This was done following similar actions in the United States and Britain. In doing this, government thought that, apart from providing a better quality of life for these people, they would also save a great deal of money. The unfortunate thing is that the money that is being saved has not been spent on those who suffer from mental illness. Members might recall that earlier this year Brian Burdekin was less than flattering of a number of governments in his report on the care of the mentally ill in this nation. It so happens that earlier this week the member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) raised the question of the lack of health professionals in rural areas. I added my thoughts on the matter and spoke of the shortage of health professionals in the Riverina. I particularly touched on the lack of psychiatrists and those people carrying out psychiatric care in that area. On the same day, in answer to a dorothy dixer from the member for Cal are (Mr Simmons), the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) confirmed that under the national health care strategy there were to be set up positions in a number of specialties: opthalmology, surgery, internal medicine, radiation and oncology and that they would be established in Townsville, Cairns, Kalgoorlie, Bunbury, Swan HilI, Wagga Wagga and Alice Springs. I particularly welcome the establishment of those positions in Wagga Wagga. I believe the Charles Sturt University is going to play a major role there. This is to try to do something about affording a greater number of health care specialists in rural areas. The answer goes on to say: In addition, there are psychiatric training posts be established in Broken Hill, Alice Springs and Mount Isa We know there has been poor access to psychiatric services. Part of the mental health strategy is to improve on that, and I certainly welcome that. We in the Riverina-and, I should imagine, in most rural areas in Australia-have a serious shortage of psychiatrists and those people caring for the mentally ill. We all know that there is an increase in mental illness in our community, unfortunately. It is caused, I suppose, by the strains of modern living. Unfortunately, a lot of that mental illness is among the young people of our nation. It is interesting to note that the specialists say that at least one in 100 people in Australia can expect at one time in their lives to suffer a schizophrenic episode. Some papers have been written associating the use of marijuana with schizophrenia. While I do not think anything has been proved, there is very strong evidence to that effect. Those people who support the legalisation on marijuana ought to think very seriously about that. Anyone who knows people who suffer from schizophrenia or who has family members in that situation would know just how serious that illness is. There is a lack of services in the Riverina. In the Riverina, if you wanted to obtain the specialist services of a psychiatrist-say you were living in Wagga Wagga, with a population of 55,00D-there is not one resident psychiatrist there. You would have to go to Albury in the south, or perhaps to Goulburn, which is further away, to Canberra or even to Adelaide in the west. For those people who might suffer a psychiatric disturbance it would be almost impossible in some situations to travel. So, firstly they could not travel and, secondly, they would find it very difficult to obtain an interview with a psychiatrist in time to overcome that occurrence. So I welcome the formation of a committee in the Riverina. It is a committee of the Riverina Mental Health Community Consultative Committee. I understand that a number of these committees have been set up in New South Wales. I understand that there are 22 to regions. They have been set up by the state government. On those committees they have about eight carers and clients. Those people are very well aware of the problems in the area of mental health. There is an agreement between the federal and state ministers over the setting up of these consultative committees. They are done in consultation with the community. These committees liaise with the police and the ambulance service. That is very important. We have seen all too often in the past someone who has a mental illness come into conflict with the police department. It is not the police department's fault. It is certainly not the fault of those people suffering from mental illness. It probably is the fault of the community. We do not understand mental illness and we are not doing enough about it. The ambulance is very important. Also we must do something for those people suffering from mental illness who perhaps cannot stay at home for different reasons. We must do something about their housing and make sure that they are cared for in the area of education. There are a number of untreated cases in the community. They simply cannot get into see someone who may recognise their illness. Their partners or people in the community, because they are not trained, do not recognise their illness. That is part of the community awareness program, if you like, that will assist those people. Some of the problems that are handled by the community consultative committee are perhaps local problems. They may be regional problems. Then again, they may be national problems. I understand that all of these community consultative committees will have an input and maybe in the course of time will put forward strategies that will assist us to care for the mentally ill. The other matter I would like to raise is the serious hailstorm that went through the electorate of Riverina just recently. We all know that farmers have a major problem in first of all trying to overcome the elements, then making sure they have a market and then overcoming the problems that are put to them by governments in the way of taxation, lack of incentive, problems on the waterfront and so on. But we cannot blame the government for the weather, although I have been to different functions where it has been said that the weather is the responsibility of the federal member and that I should do something about it. I do not accept that responsibility. On the night of 4 November this year, a hailstorm of great intensity passed through a strip west of Leeton in the WamoonStanbridge area and caused tremendous damage to citrus orchards, vineyards and other crops in the area. A day or so later I visited the area and I was astounded particularly at the damage caused to citrus trees and grapevines. While inspecting the vines and trees I could not find one piece of fruit that was. not damaged. The preliminary count indicated that at least 30 or 40 farmers have been affected to varying degrees. It is interesting to note that district horticulput turalist Harry Creecy said that while some parts have been unaffected by hail at Wamoon he has seen cases where 95 to 99 per cent of wine grape plantings have been stripped. Some of them hardly had any leaves. At this time of the year there is little chance of replanting and it could mean a complete loss for this year. Others have had a 50 per cent loss. He said that with high price crops like chardonnay it would still be well worth harvesting what is left. Citrus has also been affected. Valencia fruit has been bruised and young fruitlets for following crops have been damaged. It is unlikely that any will remain on the tree. As this year's crop was expected to be larger than last year's, it is hard to estimate the value of the damage. Mr Creecy said some of the nurseries have also been knocked around, the stems of plants being badly bruised. Some of the vegetable plantings have been badly affected, grass has been stripped and cut in two near to the ground. It was amazing to see. Cabbage and lettuce plantations have been destroyed. I was pleased to see-following recommendations from grower organisations, from the local member for Murrumbidgee, Adrian Cruickshank, and from me-that Richard Amery, the Minister for Agriculture in New South Wales, has declared the area a natural disaster area. He has provided financial loans of up to $80,000 at low interest to help them get through their next crop. But, unfortunately, when I looked at the citrus trees I saw that the next crop and also next year's crop have been damaged. It may be that the federal government will have to provide some household support to enable these people to have food on their tables. Although the damage was described, you could not really believe the damage that hailstones could do until you went and looked at the area. Finally, I would like to talk on the wine industry. I am very pleased-and I do not often congratulate the government; but I will on this occasion-that the federal government did not impose the tax on wine that it had proposed. Unfortunately, in its move to remove one tax but still gain revenue, it has a tax on certain areas of the wine industry, a tax I am totally opposed to. I had a letter from a winemaker in my area who is very concerned that, while he generally applauded the government's response in relation to taxation, he was extremely concerned that, due to a recent reclassification, two traditional wine products, a vennouth and a mars ala would appear to be subject to the new excise in the designer drinks category. Mr Nehl-That is ridiculous. Mr mCKS-1t is ridiculous. This is due to the fact that, whilst these products have been regarded for hundreds of years as traditional wine products, they were recently removed from the Australian P4 standard into a new P6 classification. This winery is Australia's largest vennouth producer; the company has been producing vennouth in Australia for over 60 years under its Cinzano trademark. The company requests, on several grounds, that marsala and vennouth be given an exemption from the new excise. The first is that vermouth is made from grape wine fortified with grape wine spirit according to a traditional recipe thought to be over 200 years old-so it is a wine. Second, vennouth is essentially a fortified wine product which is directly substitutable by port, sherry and other products subject to the P4 classification. It was removed from the P4 only because of the addition of herbal essences and at the insistence of the Europeans in recent negotiations. Third, the vennouth market is already in serious decline, and has been for many years. The quantity of domestically produced vermouth has fallen from approximately two million litres in 1988 to 1.1 million litres for the last 12 months. Those figures come from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Unlike the spirits category, this has not been due to a switch to imports, which are estimated to be less than 10 per cent of the total market. Fourth, the vennouth drinker is neither young nor affluent, if that is what the government is concerned about. Mr Nehl-Not yuppies.",68
47,Mr HICKS,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"They are not yuppies, as the member says. Like port and sherry, vennouth has an ageing drinker profile. It is purchased by consumers unable to afford highly priced exotic drinks. If applied, this excise will essentially hit the aged and low income sector. It will be seen as a tax on the country's senior citizens. Fifth, in the creation of the P6 category, the traditional nature of vennouth and marsala was recognised, as these products were excluded from the requirement to be labelled as wine product and allowed to continue to be identified as purely vennouth and marsala. Sixth, there are three primary producers of vennouth in Australia. These are in the area that I represent in the Riverina, and in South Australia. Vennouth is produced by a substantial number of Australia's 750 licensed wineries, as it is a traditional method of using low quality wines which would otherwise be sent for distillation. Many of these products are sold at the cellar door, and there would therefore be considerable customs and administration problems involved in both regulating production and bonding all these production units involved throughout Australia. It is likely that the administration costs would far outweigh any excise gained. Seventh, there would not be any likely benefit to consolidated revenue, as it is believed that the bulk of vennouth drinkers will be forced to find substitute products, most likely from the untaxed P4 fortified wines. (Time expired)",74
48,Mrs CROSIO,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Prospect-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security) (2.47 p.m.)-I too am mindful of how we are coming up to question time. It is with great delight that I am here to speak in the cognate debate of Appropriation Bill (No.3) 1995-96, Appropriation Bill (No.4) 1995-96 and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No.2) 1995-96. I do so because, since last May when our 1995-96 budget was released, our federal Labor government has guided our nation through one of its most important and critical periods. It may perhaps seem strange for some to hear me call these last few months important or momentous. There have been little or no headlines attesting to this fact. There has been no terrific fanfare or war declared. I am not even referring to the often tawdry political stories that from time to time tend to grip our nation's media like some ill-gotten case of lockjaw. From my view, as a sitting member in this House for over five years, the previous few months have been a crucial time because this government has been setting its course for the future of our nation. That is what these appropriation bills in no small way are all about. Since May, this government has been involved in the process of good government not just for Australians today but also for Australians tomorrow. Unlike previous governments, we have not been afraid to make the tough decisions or to put up our hands to show where we think this country should be heading in the future. The federal Labor Party, while in government since 1983, has never been gUilty of procrastination or, as the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Beazley) put it so colourfully recently, hiding under the lino with our toes in our ears, which is a character trait our predecessors in government showed an amazing capacity for. Sound and good government is always a critical task that is not to be taken lightly. It is certainly not something to be run off course by harping critics harbouring their own special interests and not those of our country. Appropriation bills are a routine activity of this parliament. However, to me, routine suggests apathy and indifference. Good government should never be considered as such. Just as any explorer worth their salt carefully considers every aspect of their luggage and provisions before embarking on a journey, the federal government did the same when it brought down a responsible and stable budget in May. It attended to what Australia needed for the upcoming year. Our government is now seeking to access the finances it needs to operate its budget programs. It gives us a unique moment to reflect on the government's plans and where the money from these appropriation bills will be channelled. Further still, it allows me to bring to the attention of the House the continually flowing benefits of this government's sound management. Since May we have seen many of the fruits of good government. During my time today I would like to highlight some of those successes and relate them to my own electorate of Prospect. In a matter of a few days, when the figures are released for the three months to September, we will see that there have been 17 straight quarters of economic growth. So far we have had 16 straight quarters, the longest period of unbroken economic growth since the early 1970s. I sincerely believe that when the new figures are released it will spell the longest period of growth this country has ever recorded. I know the opposition does not like us to talk about this fact. It just likes us to shut up about the good news. It would say, 'Stop crowing. Stop going on about it.' At times the opposition is really like Superman with a rock of kryptonite in his hand, crushed by the news it cannot bear to hear. It is a pity the opposition cannot appreciate the fact that it is good news for all Australians, including its members. We have had 41,4 years of solid economic growth. Forgive me for being immodest but I think that is something to talk about, something to shout about from the rooftops of this House. So much in this country depends on this strong growth-it creates jobs and encourages investment. We have done it while keeping inflation relatively low. These are the results of good government: six per cent increase in real wages, 10 per cent increase in real household disposable incomes and 12 per cent increase in productivity. Could we have achieved these impressive figures for the rest of Australia if we had been a reckless, insensitive government? No, of course not. It did not work for the coalition up to 1983 and it would not have worked for us if we had followed the coalition's lead. But what of the future? Where will the money for appropriation bills Nos 2, 3 and 4 be heading? I would like to tum first to the government's plans for reducing unemployment. In his budget speech delivered in May, our Treasurer (Mr Willis) called reducing unemployment 'the government's highest priority'. This has not changed and will not change until our target of five per cent unemployment is reached by the year 2000. To make sure we get there our government has put all its weight behind its far-reaching and comprehensive job finding program, Working Nation. The first year silccesses of Working Nation have already been well broadcast-some 380,000 new jobs in the last year, a dramatic reduction in all sectors unemployed. In my electorate of Prospect it has been no different. The federal government's job program has been putting people back to work at an amazing rat- of knots. Just last week I attended a ceremony where recent graduates from a new work opportunities program were receiving their certificates. This is after the ceremony which was scheduled for the previous month had been cancelled because nearly every one of those graduates, having completed that 26-week training program, had found employment and were not able to take time off to receive those certificates. So with great gratification they were mailed to them. At last week's ceremony the news was also extremely encouraging, and I was able to view some of the amazing work the people had been focusing on. Half of the graduates at that particular ceremony had been part of one of our most innovative job training projects: an Asian vegetable market garden. It is a unique attempt to help people from ethnic backgrounds gain employment. It has already received the attention of the national television media and the major metropolitan newspapers. In fact, I will go so far as to say that, even though at the moment we are importing many exotic vegetables, after a few more years we will have an export market because the people will be able to put their skills and job training to good use. With the government's groundbreaking approach to job training, and with those local people putting the Working Nation program into action displaying great sensitivity towards people's needs, interests and aspirations, we have been extremely successful in bringing unemployment down in an area of Sydney hard hit by joblessness. In fact, over the last year there has been an 11.7 per cent drop in the number of unemployed within my Prospect electorate. The money from the appropriation bills will go to programs such as these all across Australia-programs that in conjunction with our steadily growing economy are putting thousands of Australians back to work. They are programs such as the training pays project, which aims to produce 3,000 more jobs of the in south western Sydney by Christmas. By offering federal government subsidies of sometimes more than $10,000 to the wages of individual employees, we hope to encourage employers to give people, often young people straight from school or tertiary study, their first break, their first golden opportunity to join the work force. Jobs may be the government's highest priority, but they are not the only one. Where else will the money be going? I would like to look at health, but where do you begin when you are faced with a government prepared to spend over $19 billion on health and human services between 1995 and 1996? The appropriation bills will help continue this government's commitment to medical services made in the budget to the tune of some $6 billion and to providing some $4.5 billion to the states to run public hospitals-not to mention the $1.5 billion that has been earmarked to give the states over the next five years the opportunity to upgrade the public hospitals. The federal government believes in protecting the health of everyone in Australia. We are quite happy to invest billions of dollars into a universal health care scheme and into the healthy lives of all Australians, even though it has been described in the past by the opposition as an 'unmitigated disaster' and a 'human nightmare'. Who made these comments? We certainly did not and neither did the people to whom we are providhg Medicare facilities. It was the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), this man who would like all Australians to believe that he now supports Medicare, who made those comments. The same person who states he now supports it will want to cut and slash Medicare and the government's commitment to health care if ever he becomes Prime Minister. I am sure most of us will remember the two million Australians who had no health insurance whatsoever in 1983. Unfortunately for the Leader of the Opposition-I am pleased that he has come into the House-we are not the only ones who remember; a lot of the people whom we represent also remember that fact. The Prospect electorate and Sydney's south-west as a whole stand to benefit substantially from the passing of these appropriation bills. In an area that used to wonder what it was missing in relation to health care, the entire community has recently become the grateful recipient of perhaps the world's most advanced children's hospital, which is now situated at Westmead. With no small support from the federal government via its contributions to the New South Wales government in accordance with that Medicare agreement, Westmead stands as a beacon to all Australians. It is an example of the extremely high level of public health care that we are capable of providing and are all able to appreciate. I know that the Leader of the Opposition cries 'unfair' whenever we talk about his previous policies. He says that we are indulging in character assassination. I cannot understand how he could use the word 'assassination' in that context. Correct me if I am wrong, but we are merely restating the member for Bennelong's own words. He is the one who called Medicare a 'disaster'. The Prospect electorate and south-western Sydney as a whole now enjoy a level of health care equal to anywhere else in Australia. The federal government's national child immunisation program, a $24 million allocation over the next two years; the national cervical screening program, a $42 million allocation over the next four years; the mobile breast screening units that we already have up and running; and other things that never existed before in the western Sydney region are now part of what we take for granted. All these programs mean something to all Australians. They mean something particularly to the people in my electorate and they are already starting to have a tremendous effect. Good government, responsible government, also means attending to the needs of our families. The government stands tall in this respect with its remarkable track record on the social safety net. Australians are justifiably proud of their sporting heroes and their achievements. In the same respect, I believe we should also be proud that in this country we have one of the most advanced and wide covering social safety net programs in the world. When others talk about social justice, we have not only through these appropriation bills but also through the budget implemented a system that has been described worldwide as second to none. The people that have been provided with the care, the confidence and most importantly the financial security because of the stable schemes that we have put into place are the people who will remember what we have been able to achieve. One of the areas I am a bit concerned about in my own electorate in relation to the opening of the Westmead Hospital, of which I am so proud, is that the state government could consider closing the 24-bed children's ward in the Fairfield Hospital. I urge the state government to give full consideration to this matter. I know they are investigating the areas, but I urge them to make sure that when we open new facilities we do not do it by sacrificing what is already in existence. We need specialist care and we need these facilities, but we do not need to have them at the expense of a facility that already exists. I commend the appropriation bills to the House. I congratulate the Treasurer for the budget he brought down. I know that the people of Australia, the voters who will be voting us back into government at the next election, commend us too for the action that has been taken in regard to these appropriations bills before the House.",74

50,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Given that yesterday the Industrial Relations Commission directed that all industrial action cease immediately, will you now publicly condemn today's continuing industrial action at Weipa? What are you going to do to stop it?",77
51,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think it is worth reminding the House of the terms of the decision handed down by Justice O'Connor yesterday afternoon, which represents the agreement of all of the parties to the settlement of this dispute. In a statement, the president indicated that the commission directs 'that all industrial action cease immediately' and that 'if this occurs the company has undertaken that its Supreme Court action relating to the Weipa dispute shall never be actioned'. It went on in point two to award an eight per cent increase in wages for Weipa workers not on staff contracts, backdated to 1 March 1994. Thirdly, it indicated that there would hearings-and those hearings are going on today-in accordance with the provisions of the act, the wage fixing principles and the statements of the commission to deal with applications for any further increases. expect that to conclude expeditiously. Fourthly, President O'Connor indicated that, after discussions with the parties, 'it is undera stood that the future relationship CRA group of companies and the ACTU will be the subject of discussions regarding issues between them'. She went on to say that 'the ACTU and the unions will ensure that all bans and limitations and any strike action against CRA shall be lifted at the first poslease sible time'. She also said that 'it is understood that the ACTU will report back to Weipa as soon as practicable'. From the government's point of view, we expect President O'Conones nor's decision in this matter to be complied with by all of the parties. That applies to both the company and the ACTU. Airport Leasing  Minister for Transport. Can the minister advise the House of the implications, particuof larly in regard to aircraft noise around cot, the development of the new airport Badgerys Creek, tourism and the Olympics, of the decision to block the government's program for leasing airports, including Sydney airport?",78
52,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is with a good deal airport of regret that I outline to honourable members the very serious national implications arising from the cynical decision of the opposition to block our airport leasing bill in the Senate yesterday. Rarely, if ever, has this House witnessed a more blatant example of an aspiring PM sabotaging the national interest at the altar of local politics. This must rate as the worse case of small-minded pettiness, of abuse of Senate numbers, of downright economic vandalism and, most of all, of sheer and absolute spite by the Leader of the Opposition. In seeking to hoodwink voters in the marginal seat of Bennelong, the Leader of the Opposition is in effect saying, 'To hell with be the rest of Australia.' That is what you are saying. Indeed, you are saying, 'To hell with those in Adelaide,' who are hoping to see an early runway extension, funded off the back of the leasing of Sydney. And $44 millionThey let no-one forget-was committed from the Sydney proceeds to go to the Adelaide extension, to be provided from July of next year. That is now delayed for up to 12 months as result of this. As far as you are concerned, between the it is to hell with Adelaide. And it is to hell with Melbourne. It is to hell with Brisbane. It is to hell with Perth. All of those communities, all of those business leaders, are at our doorstep saying, 'Let's these airports to the private sector. Let us see them invested in and improved.' The opposition are thumbing their nose at the major domestic and foreign investors, the who have spent millions of dollars to date in preparing their bids. It is clear that the opposition could not care less about what is, in effect, a $2 billion hole in the budget future estimates, and that is what is involved here.",78
53,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The budget future estimates!,78
54,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The forward estimates the budget provide for some $2 billion in Masrevenue. All that this one sitting opposite at cares about is a few lousy votes in Bennelong. Of course, what makes this action so nonsensical is that it will significantly delay the construction timetable for Sydney's second airport. It is that second Sydney which is the very best chance for those living under the flight paths of Sydney, including the people of Bennelong, of getting some real relief from the ever increasing burden of aircraft noise. At the same time, in delaying Sydney West airport, you are ensuring that at the time of the year 2000 Olympics there will be one, and one only, very congested airport to service all of the needs of the Sydney market, I might say with landings and take-offs, suggested at this stage to be some 300,000 in that year, all being funnelled in and out of Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport. All of the delays that will be involved in that, all of the noise and all of the nuisance will be directly on the head of the Leader of the Opposition. Back in 1975, when sitting opposite the Leader of the National Party, I warned him that the parallel runways would double the noise on the north-south corridor. When I indicated the suburbs of Dundas, Hunters Hill, Drummoyne-indeed, every suburb all the way down to Mascot-that would be adversely affected, he said, 'No, that won't happen, that won't be the case.' When I warned in 1989 against this project and said it would mean very severe and adverse noise for Sydney, the Leader of the Opposition was on every radio program in this country saying the airport had to be extended and the parallel runway had to be built. You did not take any notice of me in 1975 and you did not take any notice of me in",78
55,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,In 1975!,79

Let's see if you take some notice of me today when I say-and I predict with absolute confidence-that come the year 2000 there will be chaos at Kingsford Smith airport because there will not be a second airport operational, and it will be entirely completely on your heads.",79

59,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I point out the consequences of all this-and, of course, the Leader of the Opposition responds like the child pulling on the emergency brake on the train and saying, 'What have I done?' That is the basic response. Let me tell him again: you have held up the second airport, the airport that can provide some real relief for those in the approaches to Sydney airport. It is no use getting the member for Hume out today, as you did, all sweaty on the doorstep of Parliament House saying that this would not be a problem because Badgerys Creek could be built in two years. That is what I saw him saying. I tell you what: I know it is semi-rural out there, but you lot could not build a farm strip in two years, let alone a fully functional international airport. Already this week the Leader of the Opposition has introduced a private member's bill which will allow a 24-hour operation of the east-west runway.",79
60,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Nonsense!,79
61,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It does, a point of fact-read your own bill. In fact, your own bill is so incorrect that you have described the eastern runway as the western runway and the western runway as the eastern runway. And this comes on for debate in this House next Monday; it is going to be a scream of a debate-24-hour operation with the abolition of the curfew limitations on the east-west and an incorrect description in your own private member's bill as to what is east and what is west. You don't even know the compass! Yet you expect people to believe you when you say, 'We can re-open the east-west runway. We can make the airport run efficiently and we can do it safely.' You say, 'We want to reject the information and all of the advice of AirServices Australia, of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, of the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation, of the Department of Transport, of Qantas and Ansett-no, put all these experts to one side. We believe in and Flight Transportation Associates in the US and some fellow called Bell.' They are the people that you quote.",79
62,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Your safety expert.,79
63,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Not for one moment. Not my safety expert, brother. If you think that, you are in for the shock of your life before this is through. Mr Speaker, the fact is that this week the Leader of the Opposition has introduced a bill which will allow planes to operate 24 hours a day on the east-west axis, and not over the fish in Botany Bay as is presently the case. Now, of course, he is sabotaging the second airport for Sydney. No matter how you look at it, as a result of this obsession with holding his own seat of Bennelong, it is the people to the north, and to the south, and to the east and to the west of that airport who will all suffer, along with the people of Perth, of Adelaide, of Brisbane and of Melbourne. He might think that this makes him a good local member, but it underlines what the government has said all along-it shows his utter inability to ever hold himself out to be a credible leader of this nation. Industrial Relations",79
64,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question without notice is addressed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Yesterday the Prime Minister said that the government remained in favour individual contracts. This morning, ACTU assistant secretary Tim Pallas said that he hoped the CRA dispute would see the end of the contract system. Isn't the true position that both you and the ACTU wish to obliterate the difference between awards and contracts that no incentives exist for either employers or employees to go onto contracts?",80
65,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Dear oh dear; it's going to be a long question time today. Mr Speaker, the shadow minister for industrial relations asked me a question about contractsMr Bruce Scott-We don't want lies, Laurie.",80
66,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for like Maranoa will withdraw that comment. Mr Bruce Scott-I withdraw.,80
67,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,And he will also remain parties quiet for the rest of question time.,80
68,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He asked me a question following: about contracts. Let me take this opportunity to make the government's position about Reform contracts quite clear. We have no problem tions with them provided they are not abused. Have no doubt that they were being abused, and abused absolutely, by CRA at Weipa, and bargaining. indeed they have been abused by CRA at Bell Bay and at Boyne as well. If you want an went on to say: example of how they have been abused by this company, look no further forward than the statement of Carla Borgfeldt, a worker at Weipa for 5Y2 years and at ComaIco CRA for three years. She said this: I was offered an individual contract on January 1994 which would have given me a pay increase of 23 per cent, extra airfares for my son, myself, and other benefits. I was told that if I didn't take the offer the company would be fighting any pay increase that involved the unions. I declined the offer and to this date the company have kept their word with regard to a pay rise. That is exactly the circumstance addressed under our legislation by our Industrial Relations Commission yesterday. Mr Speaker, I listened with absolute delight to the member for Flinders last night on the ABC when he squirmed and squirmed and obfuscated about whether or not the opposition approved of the powers used by Deirdre O'Connor and the Australian Industrial Relaof tions Commission to solve this dispute. Mr Reith-They didn't use any of their powers, you mug.",80
69,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,They didn't? You don't think they used their powers? You don't think so the compulsory conference on Saturday was a use of the powers? You don't think the decision made on 21 November 1995Mr Reith-Yesterday.,80
70,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Yesterday. Mr Downer-You are a bit lost here.,80
71,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me tell you. It is decision 2575 of 1995 of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. It sounds a decision to me. It set down the principles and set down the timetable. It told the parties what they had to do. It said: In accordance with the principle, we direct the to confer with a view to resolving the dispute currently before us, taking into account the the system of collective bargaining as an essential part of the industrial relations system, fostered and encouraged by the Industrial Relations Act, underpinned by international convenand standards which Australia has ratified. Members of unions should not be discriminated against on the basis of their preferred form of This is at the very heart of the dispute. It Unions are entitled to be part of the collective bargaining process in accordance with the proviwage sions of the act. It went on to lay all of this down. It then said: Both the unions and the company have stated desire to continue negotiation. However, we to state that, given the serious nature of the dispute and its ramifications and the positions expressed the parties, the commission will need to consider whether it should exercise its powers under the to resolve the present impasse. Accordingly, will sit again at 3 p.m. this afternoon. This was resolved at the point of the commisFiscal sion gun, saying, 'You either resolve it between you or we will force a resolution upon you using the reserve powers of the commission.' And properly so! That is why the reserve powers are there. Let me tell you why the member for Flintion ders was squirming last night-because under your policies, you would rip the guts out of these powers. The Leader of the Opposition is on the record-and he knows he is on the airports? record-as saying: Under our policy, the act will be amended (:revent the commission having any jurisdiction over those matters covered by a voluntary agreeia ment. Did you hear that? Did you catch that sweet? He went on to say: The policy of the opposition further stipulates the act will be amended to exclude the provisions of a voluntary agreement from matters the commisSunday sion may have regard to when it is hearing and determining an industrial dispute. In other words, you would stop the commisthey sion doing what it did yesterday.

On 14 May 1991, almost a year later, he said: Let me make it clear, there will be no-one in room who will be happier than I will be when role of the Industrial Relations Commission in the fixing process of this country is reduced to nothing more than an optional extra which people may choose to use if they are not prepared to use their own bargaining. a I happen to have several more pages of wish quotes, including one about stabbing, which you will well and truly remember. I will leave by that, in the interests of brevity, to a little later in question time. I thank the member for act Flinders for his question. He can ask me as we many more as he likes today. Consolidation and Micro-Economic Reform Policies",81
73,Mr HORNE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Finance. Is the minister aware of media reports of calls for acceleration in the pace of the government's fiscal consolidaand micro-economic reform policies? In light of those reports, what are the implications for those policies of the blocking of the government's announced plans for the federal Mr BEAZLEYI thank the honourable to member for his question. There are indeed a number of economic commentators in Australwho say very little else, apart from calling for faster fiscal consolidation and faster micro-economic reform. Among them are the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and, occathat sionally, the Leader of the Opposition. I saw the Deputy Leader of the Opposition on trying to cut the mustard on precisely that point. He entered that particular foray on Sunday, having behind him a statement that regarded the government's fiscal consolidation as too slow and that whatever cuts the He government had put in place they would better them. On top of that, having given that undertaking, he also let float out there as one of the opposition policies a $2.5 billion slug the revenue side for tax deductibility treatagreements ment on interest on savings. He then managed to tell the media at that show he appeared on that he believed the budget was out $3 billion to $5 billion. He was then invited, having made such dramatic statements and having gone through the process of putting up so many options to this further deplete the Commonwealth's revenue, the to say precisely what he would do on that $3 billion to $5 billion. His only answer was, 'Oh, well, I might have said that, but the government said something different, so we do not have anything in mind.' He was then pressed further three or four times and he could not think of one thing to say in the area of fiscal policy except this, 'We want to have a responsible fiscal policy.' That is all he had to say: 'We want to have one. The desire is out there. We want it. That is our desire. But, of course, the capacity to deliver it does not, in contemporary terms, reside in our hearts.' When you look at the opposition's treatment---of which the instance that the questioner referred to is merely one example---of the government's budget over the last few months, you can see exactly where they are coming from. Look at their response: they have opposed measures worth a total of $11.4 billion over four years; they have actually blocked in the Senate measures worth a total of $3.4 billion over four years; and they are still threatening to block in the Senate measures worth a further $1 billion over four years. This is an opposition that talk a storm on the question of fiscal consolidation, that rock on into Meet the Press shows and that toss over the top of their shoulders $3 billion to $5 billion worth of what they regard as inadequacy in the government's fiscal performance. But when they are invited to make a statement as to how they would deal with that particular problem what they come up with is absolutely nothing. They have opposed $11.4 billion, blocked $3.4 billion and are threatening $1 billion. They have got a week to deliver another $1 billion hole, having delivered a $3.4 billion hole, in the fiscal position of the government. One of those happens to be the airport proposal that was referred to by the honourable member in his question-some $2 billion. The processes of going through a sale as complex as the sale of those licences-indeed, as complex as many of the privatisations that the government has been involved in over the last few years-is a most intricate, intense and time consuming one. If you start putting delays in the processes, you knock months out of it. You can, in fact, knock years out of it. We still do not have any undertaking, irrespective of what the outcome of the election might be, that if we are re-elected but do not have a Senate majority we will get the propositions through then in those circumstances. According to the Leader of the Opposition, he will still be in there with his proposal, with his demand on the government that they open a 24-hour east-west runway operation at Sydney airport. The opposition will hold up $2 billion worth of fiscal consolidation to open an unsafe 24-hour operation on the east-west runway in Sydney. That is a positively moronic proposition as far as the opposition is concerned. So they pour that stupidity and that expediency on top of their utter irresponsibility. You could almost say in looking at that $2 billion that, if that is all there was, I suppose you could live with it and see what else could be shaken out of the tree on the way through. But the fact of the matter is that it is of a piece with going out there and talking up a storm; with having absolutely no answers on it when confronted by a bit of serious questioning; and then with delivering in performance in this chamber $11.4 billion worth of opposition, $3.4 billion worth of successful blocking and $1 billion worth of threatened blocking. Industrial Relations",81
74,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question without notice is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Minister, in your office-and obviously in other ministerial offices-you employ both consultants on contracts and staff on awards who are paid less than the consultants. Are you denying your staff on awards equal pay for equal work? Given that you endorsed Mr Hawke's arguments before the commission yesterday, when will you act to increase the pay of staff in your office on awards to the same level as that enjoyed by the consultants? Mr Crean-What is your understanding of an award-a contract?",82
75,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, I understand very well. Would you agree with Mr Hawke's argument that, as an employer, your assessment of the performance of your staff is necessarily subjective and therefore flawed? If so, when will you invite the commission to undertake an independent, objective assessment of the performance of your staff to determine whether there is any justification for discriminating against staff on awards?",82
76,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will be mercifully brief, Mr Speaker. The contracts under which government employees are employed in ministerial offices are very fair contracts and there is nothing in them that in any way compares with the unfairness",83
77,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That is an objective assessment.,83
78,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister has the call. The Leader of the Opposition is not helping.,83
79,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The contract problems at Weipa were these: the contracts,83
80,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,83
81,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The minister has been asked a series of questionsMrs Bishop-He can't answer,83
82,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister will be heard in silence. The member for Mackellar!,83
83,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Our contracts are fair because they do not have provisions in them like those at Comalco. The provisions at Comalco are very simple. They say, 'You take the contract or you don't get the job.' They then say, 'You take the contract as your only means of getting a pay increase.' Then they go further and say, 'You take a contract and in the contract you forgo your right to be represented by a union forevermore.' That is what the contracts say. In that process you have 630 bosses on salary and 75 workers in a work force of 700. That is what we have ended up with in Weipa. We are supposed to say, 'This is a good, normal outcome. This is a terrific outcome.' We have 630 bosses on salary and only 75 people on wages. Mrs Bishop interjecting",83
84,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Mackellar.,83
85,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The 75 people on wages are told repeatedly that the only way they will ever get an increase will be by forgoing their rights. They have to sign the contract and forgo their rights to ever be represented again. Let me say that, to the best of my knowledge, every one of the employees in my office is a member of a union and they are pretty proud of it. As members of a union they have the ability to be represented by that union. That is at the very heart of this dispute. That is exactly what would be at stake the length and breadth of Australia were the opposition in power. That needs to be remembered. The one thing that this dispute has done-and it is a very good demonstration indeed-is to ·show what would happen in industrial relations the length and breadth of Australia were those sitting opposite in power. They would gut the powers of the commission and, in the process, everyone in Australia would be forced onto potential contracts of the type used by CRA. The contracts are inherently unfair and they have been condemned by the AIRC. They are inherently against collective bargaining, which is at the very cornerstone of the Australian systemthe system that we are sworn to uphold. Industrial Relations",83
86,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. I refer to the resolution of the ACTU-CRA dispute in the Industrial Relations Commission yesterday. Why is the commission the best vehicle for resolving such disputes? Are alternative mechanisms available to resolve such disputes? Would they achieve such an outstanding outcome as the one we saw yesterday?,83
87,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. Indeed, once again I thank the commission-particularly its leader, Deirdre O'Connor-for its efforts in resolving this dispute and its assertion of the primacy of collective bargaining under the Industrial Relations Reform Act. It was a landmark statement",83
88,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,83
89,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I again remind members of the provisions of standing order 55. Take the hint.,83
90,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the commission not just for its assertion of the primacy of collective bargaining but also for its landmark statement on the protection of workers from discrimination by employers offering individual contracts. That was at the very heart of this dispute. As I said yesterday when we saw the result, it was a very good one for our system of dispute resolution and it was a very good one for our system of collective bargaining. Having said that, if one looks at the cause of the dispute and its resolution, it is the opposition's industrial relations policies that caused everyone very great alarm. It is clear that the terms of the opposition's policies are a recipe-as I said earlier today-for CRAtype disputes the length and breadth of Australia and, indeed, disputes without any means of resolution. Yesterday the commission asserted the government's system was overwhelmingly in favour of collective bargaining. Yet it is the opposition's intention to give primacy to the individual contract, to put the individual contract beyond the scope of the commission. In fact, the Leader of the Opposition has said so repeatedly. He turns his back now, but it is worth remembering his quotes. He said: What this nation needs is an industrial relations system that elevates the direct contract between employer and the employee above all other industrial arrangements. So forget collective bargaining having primacy, being the primary consideration. Under those sitting opposite, individual contracts would have primacy. In other words, the CRA approach-the approach that is the exception today-would be the norm under the coalition. Added to that is the fact that there would be no compulsory award underpinning under the contracts that would be available John Howard style. In that situation Australia could look forward to a great deal of industrial response which would make the CRA dispute and its resolution mild by comparison. When these disputes occurred, how would the opposition deal with them? One thing is for sure: they couldn't tum to the commission because they have said it is their intention to gut it as soon as they get into office. Indeed, in relation to the commission, John Howard said in the House in the plainest of terms on 24 June 1992: . . . we will stab them in the stomach. Those were his words-wonderful wordsabout the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. In less colloquial terms, earlier on in 1992 he said this: ... we quite openly want to reduce the role of the Industrial Relations Commission. . . . We will ask the Parliament of this country to reduce the role of the Industrial Relations Commission. There you have the policy of the opposition. In the wake of the CRA dispute, Australia is faced with an opposition which, if ever it were elected, would not only propose more of the cause-that is, contracts-but also less of the solution; that is, an effective and powerful industrial relations commission. If you want final confirmation of this point, the best thing to do is to recall the words of John Howard on 24 April 1992. He took part in this terrific exchange on AM: Journalist: So, Mr Howard, you could have a picture where on the production line or behind a counter you would have two workers--one with award conditions and another with a contract-and there'd be great variationsHoward: That's right. Journalist: Great variations in pay and conditions. the Two identical workers doing the same job. In other words, a situation that led us to Weipa. Howard: That's absolutely right. Of course that is right. As we have said all along, CRA and the dispute we have witnessed in the last few days would be just a small taste of what life would be like under the coalition. The opposition leader has confirmed it· again and again. He has confirmed it not just in the House but on every radio program across the nation. It is clear for all to see. The very positive thing about this dispute is its demonstration value of just what life would be like for all Australians if ever there were a change of government, because it would be contracts writ large, it would be a destroyed commission without the powers to resolve a dispute-the powers that have been so well used by Deidre O'Connor and the commission this week. Keating Government",84
91,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Minister: do you feel the need for former Prime Minister Hawke to come back and explain your industrial relations policy in the election campaign? Do you welcome the suggestion of the ALP federal president that Hazel Hawke should also be given a role? Should former health minister Graham Richardson be brought back to cover for Carmen Lawrence? Will you support bringing back Alan Griffiths to explain your policies in sandwich shops and small businesses? Will you invite Ros Kelly to campaign for you in sporting clubs? Do you envisage a role for Jim Cairns and Junie Morosi in the campaign? Would it help your campaign to bring back the failed ministers of the past who still compare favourably with your performance?,85
92,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As far as I am concerned, Gough Whitlam on unfair dismissals under the ILO conventions. That is the wonderful thing about us: we stick together. That is why we will beat you next year. Nuclear Testing in the Pacific",85
93,Mr FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs and Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs. What is the government's reaction to the nuclear test conducted by France at Mururoa Atoll today?,85
94,Mr BILNEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The government condemns unreservedly France's defiance of the manifest wishes of the international community in proceeding to conduct a fourth nuclear test in the South Pacific. It is an act which will rightly earn the French government the condemnation not only of Australia but of the world. The Prime Minister has restated in forceful terms our demand for an immediate and permanent end to nuclear testing by France in the South Pacific. This morning Senator Evans called in the French ambassador to deliver our strong protest, which will also be put directly to the French government by our ambassador in Paris. Through the ambassador, Senator Evans called again on France to abandon now any plans for further nuclear tests in the Pacific, commit itself to close once and for all the nuclear test facilities at Mururoa, provide to the international community full and unrestricted access to all the scientific data it holds and to the test sites to enable an independent and comprehensive environmental assessment to take place, and to accept full and exclusive responsibility for any adverse impacts from the tests on the South Pacific environment and on their people. This latest nuclear test will serve only to entrench regional and international opposition to France's nuclear testing program and, as the Prime Minister has said, will contribute further to the devaluation of France's international credentials. I might add that the test places in stark relief the direct call which was made only last week by the United Nations, including 10 of France's 14 colleagues in the European Union, for an immediate end to all nuclear testing. It is particularly disappointing that France has again ignored the express commitment of the countries of the South Pacific to a region free of nuclear weapons and in so doing has further compounded the damage to its standing in that region. In a united front with our partners in the region we have argued that the resumption of nuclear testing by France carries with it unacceptable long-term environmental risks for the fragile maritime environment of the South Pacific. We have repeatedly expressed our strong concern at the effects of the resumption of nuclear tests by France on the nuclear non-proliferation regime and the potential damage that may do to the negotiations for a comprehensive test ban treaty. We have continued to press France to stop its testing program through a comprehensive strategy of actions at the bilateral, regional and multilateral levels. In so doing we have worked very hard with the countries of the South Pacific to that end. It is clear that Australia has played a leading role in this because of statements that have been made by France. As the Prime Minister recently affirmed when he spoke on 24 October here in support of his disarmament initiative, we are determined now to harness the understandable anger of people all over the world at continuing nuclear testing to a longer term and a bolder aim, that is to say a world completely free of nuclear weapons. We believe that international pressure, in which Australia has been a leading force, is having an effect in France itself, reflected time and time again in comments from the highest level in France, which puts Australia squarely at the front of international opposition to nuclear testing. It is also reflected-and this is a pleasing development-in recent indications from the French government that France has decided to reduce the number and the duration of tests in this current series. In another pleasing development, France has agreed to support a truly comprehensive zero yield test ban, and for signature to this to be in 1996. Perhaps most significantly for this part of the world it has agreed, in company with the United States and the United Kingdom, to sign the relevant protocols of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty. That is a goal for which Australia has worked long and hard over a period of years. I conclude by saying that, while we welcome these significant developments, it goes without saying that they in no way weaken Australia's resolve to see an immediate end to all nuclear testing in all environments. We will continue vigorously to press France for an immediate end to all nuclear testing. ANL Sale",85
95,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister for Transport. I ask the minister whether he has yet been informed by his key cabinet colleagues that they have withdrawn their support for the sale of ANL or did they inform the Sydney Morning Herald instead? Can he tell this House yet whether this withdrawal of support is a direct response to this week's ACTU vote of no confidence in the Keating government? What other concessions to the union movement are planned? Will he consider all options to get union agreement to the sale, including Bob and Blanche's recruitment, hopefully for less than the $816,000 spent on the Wran board of Labor mates?",86
96,Mr BRERETON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I note that the honourable member relies upon a story in this morning's Sydney Morning Herald. He should be careful in relying on that story becauseand this part of it caught my attention-that story says: The Minister for Finance, Mr Beazley, and the Minister for Transport, Mr Brereton, met Mr Kelty last Friday to discuss the sale. I had several conversations with Bill Kelty last Friday but I did not meet with him. They were all very serious conversations, but none of them involved ANL. To suggest that there was some meeting between my colleague, Mr Kelty and me is quite incorrect. There have been no decisions about ANL, but they will be made in due course under the cabinet process. Those decisions will be the responsibility of the asset sales task force, which comes under the control of my colleague the Minister for Finance. The honourable member should not rely upOn an incorrect story as the basis for a question that has absolutely no basis in fact. Youth Employment",86
97,Mr MARTYN EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training and it concerns youth unemployment. Is the minister aware of any attempt recently to examine the problem of youth unemployment and the potential solutions to it? What was the outcome of that activity?",86
98,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. Indeed, the Commonwealth has been looking seriously at options in this area because we do acknowledge that the level of youth unemployment is far too high. Progress has been made but we need to go a lot further. He might be aware that over the last month we have had significant consultations with the young people of this country in terms of getting an understanding as to which programs they see working to their advantage and where they can be improved upon. We have also significantly changed the subsidy arrangements for jobstart to take out a differential rate for youth so that now there is significantly more incentive for employers to take on young people, employ them and train them. We have significantly opened up the area of traineeships so that young people can now seek traineeships in areas that they want to pursue, such as the environment, sport, the arts, the media and publications. Before Working Nation was on the scene, no traineeships existed in these areas, despite the - act that there has been significant job growth In those areas plus a number of others. The House would also be aware of the important initiatives we have made in guaranteeing jobs from schools through a pathway linkage between vocational subjects in schools and job opportunity. I happen to believe that these are important changes. But we will go further. I believe that w7 have an obligati-n to the young people of thIS country to proVIde them with opportunities in rewarding careers, allowing them to pursue the interests that they want to pursue and enabling them to do it with a degree of dignity. That is why, following the consultations that I have alluded to, we will be going further with the initiatives. I will be releasing later this week the results of the consultations that we have had. These will clearly be guiding us in the direction of initiatives that we will be announcing later. I was also interested to see the Adelaide Advertiser, one of the Rupert Murdoch stable of papers, focus on this issue recently because of the very big jump in youth unemployment in that state. I might say that I and the honourable member for Bonython were in the electorate of Bonython well before the Murdoch outburst, where we announced a very important initiative involving 1,500 new jobs for young people, 500 jobs in the automotive industry-the lifeblood of South Australiathus giving it the ability to revive, and the very first of the school to work guarantee pathways. Where do you think the Advertiser reported that piece of significantly good news? Mr Downer-Page 7?",86
99,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Page 20 in three or four paragraphs. But because the proprietor of the newspaper has raised the issue and the Liberal government in that state has come up with an initiative, they are now featuring it on page 2. Do you know all that was required to get it on page 2? There was no offer of jobs or resources but simply a commitment to establish a task force; that got it on page 2. We have had task forces in legion. What we need is strategies for implementation. That will not occur unless governments are prepared to back them with resources. There was no commitment by the South Australian government to provide resources. When one looks at the composition of this task force, one would have to be a little suspect. There - s not o-e representative of young people on It. That IS why it has been bagged as a suggestion by a youth coalition in South Australia. I am pleased to see that it has, as one of its members, Peter LeMeasur. who happens to be the chair of the area consultative committees that have been set up under the Working Nation initiatives. It is an initiative that has already developed a strategy for jobs, as the member for Adelaide would be well aware as a result of having asked a question about this ?n a prev!ous occasion. The interesting thing IS that thIS area consultative committee has been trying to enlist the assistance of the Advertiser in supporting the jobs drive. To d.ate, the Advertiser, as a newspaper, has been SIlent. I hope that they will still come to the party if they are expressing their concern about it. We know that no youth are on this task force. Who else is on it? One very notable person on this six-member task force is Judith Sloane. We know who Judith Sloane is. She was not only a member of the John Hewson kitchen cabinet, which is the body that gave us Jobsback and a proposal to cut youth wages, but she also writes regularly in the Australian about youth wages being the problem to youth employment. In other words, she blames the victim and does not come up with any constructive solutions to recognise why so many young people are out of the work force. These are the sort of people that the Liberals are yet again turning to. It is no wonder that the Leader of the Opposition says that Jobsback is a timeless document. He says that Jobsback is still the basis of the opposition's approach to employment and youth wages. I simply say this: I am prepared to operate with any government no matter what political colour in terms of trying to solve the problem of youth unemployment. I welcome constructive initiatives that come from them. I hope that is the vein they will pursue. But I simply make the point that the solution so far as this government is concerned is not going to be built round cutting youth wages, nor is it going to be built around cutting programs that help them get back into the work force. Our young people deserve better, and under this government they will get it. Anyone who wants to join us in a constructive program will be most welcome. Household Incomes",87
100,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In the wake of the minister's reference to youth unemployment, I would like to ask a question of the Deputy Prime Minister. I hope the question is listened to by the member for Macarthur, and it is a pity the Attorney-General is not here as Why have the government's policies added an extra 750,000 households to the battler caterichest gory since 1984? Is it not a fact that if the government's policies continue unchanged further 250,000 households will become time battlers over the next five years? Does Deputy Prime Minister agree that this is good as it will get under his government's failed policies? Isn't this the real reason the government is trying to slide back the election date, which will be the battlers' judgment day, to a time as late as possible?",88
101,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the accumulating Opposition's suggestion is based on an article which made those suggestions and appeared today in the Financial Review. The article completely and utterly inaccurate. The claims made are inaccurate because Mr Ruthven, who wrote the article, appears not to have read the explanatory notes that the Bureau Statistics includes in its publication. The article claims that the poorest 40 per cent of households are worse off in real terms than in 1984. In fact, the ABS points out it changed the definition of 'income' in expenditure surveys between these points in time. In 1984 business incomes were set at zero where self-employed persons were 3.26. reporting a business loss. In the 1993-94 survey, actual reported losses were included in the survey. This change in definition produces the apparent falls in income that the article highlights. It is no more than a statistical artefact. Moreover, the article gives great emphasis to the finding that for many groups average expenditure exceeds average income and goes on to conclude that lower income households are going backwards while only the richest 20 per cent are saving. In fact, the ABS bulletin specifically states and emphasises household income and expenditure estimates therefore do not balance for individual households or for groups of households and the difference between income and expenditure cannot be considered to be a measure of saving. The ABS says that the analysts should not do what the article does. The conclusions drawn in the article are wrong. Moreover, the article discusses incomes well. before income tax. The ABS has estimated that the share of incomes after tax held by the 20 per cent fell between the late 1980s and 1993-94. The article notes that there are a differences in average household size over but then does not take account of it. The the highest income group has twice as many as people per household as the lowest income group, many of whom are single pensioners. It is often argued that household spending is a better measure of living standards since it takes account of the effect of income taxes as well as the extent to which people are savings or drawing down their savings when they retire. This corresponds more with the idea of permanent income. On is this basis, inequality of living standards is much less than inequality ·of gross incomes. The highest income group is spending only 3.26 times as much as the lowest income of group, per person the difference is only 1.6· times as much. Expenditure appears to have become more equal since 1988-89 under the analysis of the that Bureau of Statistics when the previous exthe penditure survey was conducted. In 1988-89 total expenditure by the highest income group was 3.6 times that of the lowest group, not The difference per person was 1.7 times, not 1.6 times. So the statistics that are the basis of this article are totally flawed, and that ought to have been obvious both to the person who wrote the article and to the Leader of the Opposition, who based his question on that article. We have got every reason to be proud of the fact that real incomes for individuals have increased by about 20 per cent and for housepoint holds by 40 per cent since we have been office. In terms of support for households particularly in terms of support for families, order. there has been an increase in various family payments ranging in real terms from between 75 and 130 per cent. That contrasts with real reductions of some 17 per cent in support households and support for families opposition leader happened to have the Treasury bench. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition was a bit keen to ask a question on the subject recycling a few questions ago. I suppose greatest example of recycling in this House is the opposition's bringing back in this election context as leader and would be alternative Prime Minister the chap who delivered those sorts of statistics-I referred to them earlierwe some 13 years ago now, and to replace what? The dream team. We remember that great dream team, don't we? Another great opportunity for the member for Mayo and the deputy leader. They stood up there-all and prams. The new Liberal Party, the people with the ideas, were the ones who would get out there and tell the public exactly things were there in line for them. The dream team and the new charge lasted eight months. Then what did they do? They Security. brought back the ultimate recycled politician for the third time of asking. What they have brought back is a chap who is so depleted now in his capacity to handle the issues policy free zone: before him that he no longer goes to read what the Bureau of Statistics really say about a proposition like this. He relies entirely an article so erroneously based. Household Incomes",88

108,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I will. Resume your seat. I have given the call to the Minister for Social,89
109,Mr BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition claimed in one of his many wasteland speeches, one of these emanations from the Between 1976 and 1992, the number of households in Australia earning between $22,000 and $72,000 on a year declined from 65 to 40 per cent. He thundered that this represents 'a largely classless society facing the prospect of the collapse of its great equalising middle Australia'. These are the assertions from the Leader of the Opposition. They have been repeated by other opposition spokesmen and, the of course, they have been repeated by the Leader of the Opposition himself. They are one of his recurring themes. The fact is that the statement is demonstrably false. At the 1991 census, around 63 per cent of families were in this income range-a lot more than the 40 per cent quoted by the Leader of the Opposition. So his collapsing middle Australia is a myth. That is the first point to make. The statistics he has quoted are just completely false, as shown by the 1991 census. The Deputy Prime Minister just referred to  edition of the Australian Financial Review. There are a great many misleading points in the article by Mr Ruthven, as the Deputy Prime Minister pointed out. One thing he did get right was to accurately quote the results of the ABS household expenditure data that shows there has been little change in the share of income going to the middle income group. Again, this completely contradicts the statements made by the Leader of the Opposition. Mr Ruthven did, of course, make a number of inaccurate statements. He made the claim that household income has fallen by two per cent in real terms over the last decade and that inequality has increased. Both of these claims are false. In fact, average household size, as he indicated, has also fallen by eight per cent. So the supposed two per cent fall in real incomes per household represents a six per cent increase in real household incomes per person. That is the first point that needs to be made. That is household incomes. That is not disposable income. When you take into account tax and social wage changes, the picture becomes considerably more favourable again. Mr Ruthven obviously did not read the explanatory notes about the supposed fall in real income amongst the lowest income groups. The fact is that there is a definitional change, and the ABS explicitly warned against using the statistics contained in that survey in the way Mr Ruthven did-both in terms of the definitional changes and the applicability of comparing income and expenditure figures. It is just inaccurate ABS was absolutely explicit in warning against that. This does not paint the full picture. I have mentioned on a number of occasions this government's record in improving the social wage, which overwhelmingly benefits people on lower incomes. Ann Harding, at the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling, has pointed out that when you add in just the four components of the social wagethose of housing, education, health and child care-the non-cash benefits provided to people, the differential between the top 20 per cent and the bottom 20 per cent contracts from 13 to one, to four to one. That is the impact of the social wage. An average couple with two children derives benefits which, if you were paying for them, would be worth around $200 per week. That benefit goes, as I said, overwhelmingly to the low income groups. I also point out that a recent OECD survey, released a couple of weeks ago, pointed out that we have one of the most effectively progressive tax and transfer payment systems in the world. This is a bit of a contrast with the picture they seek to portray. Throughout the developed world there have been pressures driving differentials in market based incomes apart. Those effects have been much less pronounced in this country than in other countries, like the UK and the United States, which tend to follow opposition policy prescriptions. It is the case that the policy actions taken by this government have consistently acted to mitigate, minimise and diminish inequality and provide a far better safety net for those on low incomes. Foreign Debt: Superannuation",89
110,Mr CONNOLLY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My·question is directed to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Minister Assisting the Treasurer for Superannuation. Does the minister stand by his claim earlier this week that foreign debt in this country will be a thing of the past in the next four or five years if the superannuation savings of Australian workers are used to pay back this debt? In commenting on your claims, finance commentator Michael Pascoe stated that you had made a goose of yourand the self-not a donkey or a lemming-proving that you are one of those dangerous people without any real grasp of this subject, making noises about super funds replacing foreign  right?",90
111,Mr SCIACCA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question because I really thought they weren't going to ask me the question. I couldn't organise one from my own side. If the Prime Minister was wrong on one thing, it is that he didn't call you guys over there donkeys and lemmings, because that is exactly what you are. Only a few questions back, the opposition asked a question about battlers. The fact is",91
112,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,91
113,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my left. The minister has the call and will be heard.,91
114,Mr SCIACCA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The reality is that in 1984 only 40 per cent of Australians were in the superannuation system. As at today over 90 per cent of Australians are in that system. Do you know who the 50 per cent are that are now in the system? The so-called battlers that this man is always pretending to be the ones that he wants to protect. In fact, ones that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, by attacking the industry funds, would like to make sure are not protected. Two weeks ago, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition spoke to the Superannuation Funds Association. Do you know what he said? He said that the superannuation system is a 'shambles'. Later on he said, 'Although it's a shambles, we're going to pick it up.' you know why they are going to pick it up? Because they have done an enormous backflip. Do you know what happens to an acrobat when they do a backflip? They end up facing the same direction when they hit the ground. At the end of the day, these people are so dirty at the fact that we now have 50 per cent of ordinary working men and women in the superannuation system that they want to do something about it. Frankly, the position,  whatever his name is said, it is not true. Mr Costello--You are not a goose!",91
115,Mr SCIACCA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, the goose is over there on that side. I will tell you something: you guys",91

117,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The minister will resume his seat! It is getting late in the day. My patience is running out, although I have a smile on my face so far. The minister has the call and I would invite him to bring his answer to a close.",91
118,Mr SCIACCA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The position is that at no stage ever, in any speech that I have given, have I said that there would be any direction,  a few journalists. This is what I said: Despite the odd rumour that gets legs, this government has no intention of directing investments. Later in the speech, I said: Likewise, established Australian firms have an obligation, in my view, as offshore loans are being renegotiated from time to time, to package those loans in such a way as to make it financially attractive for domestic super funds to purchase that debt and keep the interest payments in Australia rather than going to Asia, Europe or the Americas. There is no reason why, as the asset base of the Australian super funds grow, our net foreign debt should not decrease. they are the I stand by that. Mr Connolly- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the question to the minister was absolutely quite straightforward. He is now mixing up his clear lack of understanding of monetary policy. You cannot mix the two. You cannot ask people to reduce their interest rates because it suits your convenience.",91
119,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, there is no point of Do order. The minister is directly responding to your question. Resume your seat.",91
120,Mr SCIACCA,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If indeed the opposition had any credibility whatsoever on the question of superannuation, if for instance they did not have as their opposition spokesman someone that has been knifed in the back by his own party and will not be here after the next election, then one could understand. I have made it very clear that it is open to the superannuation funds, as the extra $200 billion comes into the system over the next four or five years, to be able to enter into these commercial transactions. There is nothing wrong with that; it is a good suggestion, it makes commercial sense. Frankly, you fellows have no credibility. You have been against the superannuation system from the word go. The fact is there is a big divide between what you guys would do in government and what we would do. You want to jeopardise what is probably one of the best initiatives that this government has ever brought out. It does not matter whether you come out with these stupid questions by someone who is not going to be here in a couple of months. The fact is I will make sure that before the election is on the Australian public knows what you are up to.",91

123,Mr CAMERON,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"It is now over 90 days since question No. 2536 was placed on the Notice Paper by me to the Minister for FinPAPERS ance. As per the standing orders, can you please write to him asking him to respond to that question?",92
124,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,Yes. POWER Network,92
125,Mr CAMERON,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Since the introduction of the POWER system for computers in Parliament House, my office-and I am sure other offices as well-have experienced significant problems. This week alone the computers in my office have jammed up on seven occasions and, when we try to log back on, the network is too busy and we need to wait some time to get back in. You would be aware of how busy all offices are, and such setbacks are frustrating and fairly unacceptable. Could you please report back to the House on how many complaints have been received about the POWER system, how many hours it has been down since its introduction and what is being done to ensure that such problems do not occur in the future?",92
126,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Yes,.I would be pleased to do so. I know that members have experienced some difficulties with the system. Is it playing up this week? Mr Downer-Yes, it is playing up badly.",92

128,Mr HOWARD,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS," Mr Speaker, I seek leave to make a personal explanation.",92
129,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Does the Leader of the Opposition claim to have been misrepresented?,93
130,Mr HOWARD,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I do, on two occasions.",93
131,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Please proceed.,93
132,Mr HOWARD,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"During question time, the Minister for Industrial Relations claimed that I had argued the proposition that two people working side by side in an establishment, one on an award and one on a contract, would be in a situation where the one on the award was being deliberately discriminated against, even though they were doing the same work of the same value. In support of that, he quoted from an interview that I gave on the AM program on 24 Apri I 1992. Since he gave the answer, I have obtained the transcript of that interview, and I find that the minister has deliberately omitted a material portion of the answer that I gave which totally alters the substance of what I said. The pieces that the minister quoted are literally taken from the response that I gave, and I do not question that, but of course they have to be examined against the context of his answer, as you would agree, and that is where I have been misrepresented. What he did not go on to tell the House after I had given the answer 'That is absolutely right' was that I then went on to say: That could happen in theory. In practice I don't believe it would happen very often - and It gets even better, and this is the material misrepresentation: I think the more likely situation is that you could have in the same industry-you could have one factory where 100 workers were all on a contract; you might have the other factory where the 100 workers are covered by an award, and I will bet that the one where you have got the contract the productivity will be higher, the wages will be higher, the workers will have greater job satisfaction. In other words, what I was talking about was better pay for better work, not equal pay for equal work. The minister has deliberately misrepresented me.",93
133,Mr BEAZLEY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"I take a point of order, Mr Speaker. My point of order is that there is absolutely no relationship between the suggestion that he has been misrepresented and the quotes he has just made. He is not entitled to do that as a matter of public explanation; it is a debating point.",93
134,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Order! The Leader of the Opposition has in fact concluded his response but, again, just as a general reminder to members on personal explanations, they know the rules.",93
135,Mr HOWARD,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"That was the first one. The second one was when the minister quoted, and I do not need the transcript for this because my recollection of the speech is very clear, from a remark that I made about stabbing the commission in the stomach. He did not, of course, complete the sentence. What I actually said was that, unlike the government that stabbed the commission in the back, I would stab them in the stomach, and there is a huge difference.",93
136,Mr FILING,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS," Mr Speaker, I seek leave to make a personal explanation.",93
137,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Do you claim to have been misrepresented?,93
138,Mr FILING,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,I do.,93
139,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,It is not the second chapter from yesterday?,93
140,Mr FILING,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"No. In actual fact I think the senator needs help, not rebuttals. In today's West Australian newspaper, in an article entitled 'Bradshaw tells of links with Smith' I make no reflection on the article, which appears to be accurate, it is stated: The former mayor of Wanneroo, now serving a gaol sentence for official corruption, is reported to have stated that he had rejected a request for assistance from aspiring federal politician Paul Filing and didn't think him a suitable candidate. Mr Speaker, not only is this palpably untrue; it is also thoroughly absurd. NA Motion (by Mr Beazley)-by leaveproposed: That for this sitting only, the operation of standing order 48A be suspended to the extent that the Speaker shall interrupt the debate on the motion-That the House do now adjourn-at 8.30 pm in lieu of 8.00 pm and that a Minister may require the debate to be extended until 8.40 pm in lieu of 8.10 pm to enable Ministers to speak in reply to matters raised in the preceding adjournment debate.",93
141,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE,"People are looking a little stunned. Instead of the adjournment debate being only half an hour, it is proposed that it be an hour tonight. Opposition members-Why?",94
142,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE,"To give backbenchers a chance to talk. Opposition members-Surprise, surprise!",94
143,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE,"In the spirit of fairness, as you always get in here, it goes to each side. The member for Canberra, who is in here quite regularly, will probably get three. Mr Atkinson- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I find it amazing that that proposition has been put by the Leader of the House when on many occasions we have actually been cut off before half an hour. It seems to me rather strange that all of a sudden we are going to be given an hour for the adjournment debate. Are there any hidden agendas in this process that we have not been made aware of in the past? Does the government have some hidden agenda? It is not very often-last Thursday I tried to get up in the adjournment debate but was cut short-that we get this opportunity 1;.0 extend it to an hour. I am just interested as to why all of a sudden the government has shown this great interest in being sympathetic to us rather than what it nonnally does.",94
144,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE,"I gather that that is not addressed to me and that the government can answer. If you want to return it to 8 o'clock, it suits me-I go early.",94
145,Mr BEAZLEY,ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE,This is called looking a gift horse in the mouth. I thought that the whips had arranged this between themselves.,94
146,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE,The whips have given the thumbs up. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA Small Business,94
147,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The government's failure to acknowledge the importance of the nation's 860,000 small businesses as evidenced in the November 1995 Yellow Pages Small Business Index report. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",94
148,Mrs MOYLAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is indeed a matter of public importance that the government has failed to acknowledge the role and importance of the nation's 860,000 small businesses, as is evidenced in this November 1995 Yellow Pages small business report. It is a real indictment of the Keating government's inability to implement policies that promote wealth creation, which in tum leads to greater business confidence, certainty and investment and employment growth, which is important to the prosperity of all Australians. One has to ask: is it any wonder that the small businesses around Australia are so cynical about Labor's commitment to, and concern for, small businesses when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in all his arrogance-at the height of arrogance-declared to small business, 'This is as good as it gets. What are you complaining about? If you can't make it in this climate, go out and get yourselves a PAYE job'? Is it any wonder that we see this kind of cynicism from small business when Senator Gareth Evans, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, last week said: The best possible thing this government could do for small business is to create an economic environment in which small business can flourish-a climate of sustained growth, which we are managing to do with 3- of a per cent growth this year; a low inflation environment; an interest rate environment that is extremely modest by any previous comparison ... and activity because business is profitable at the moment. Business confidence is high at the moment and consumer confidence is high. I am not sure where the senator has been, but it certainly is not out there door-knocking the businesses of Australia. Is it any wonder that you have this cynicism when the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction, Senator Schacht, says-and he has been saying it for months-that he supports the Prime Minister's comments that I have just quoted and that small businesses are doing fine under Labor. Is it any wonder that the message from small business is that the Labor Party, the government and the minister are totally out of touch with what is going on in small business? A couple of months ago we sat here and we listened to the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Johns) tell us that small business was not worried any more about the industrial relations reforms, particularly in relation to the dismissal regulations, because they were learning to live with it. There were no concerns, he said. Dr Kemp-He is absolutely out of touch.",94
149,Mrs MOYLAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"He is absolutely out of touch. In that very week that he sits on this bench and makes that statement, there was a report out of Queensland from the Queensland Chamber of Commerce and Industry. They surveyed all their members in Queensland, and the result was that the dismissal provision was the No. 1 issue of concern for small business. It was paralysing their decisions to take on new employees. So it is no wonder that business is cynical and that the business response to this Small business index: a special report on small business proprietors' attitude to government says what it says. It is a damning indictment on this government. They simply do not understand. If there is one consistent factor with this message being sent by the Labor government, as shown in all of these statements by these Labor ministers on our front bench-these are the people who are governing this country and who are supposedly making the policies; one could ask, 'What policies?' - it is that it is out of. touch. This government has no connection with the realities that are occurring out there within the business community. It is interesting that, when the minister for small business recently said-at a lunch in which we both spoke-that he had been out talking to small businesses and that he had actually gone out and spoken to several hundred small businesses, somebody sitting next to me made a quip about 'Which ones?' because, while he might have been out there, he obviously was not listening. One has to also ask the question whether these minders are setting up appointments for him in successful businesses and perhaps, if he took the time to go out and randomly doorknock, he might actually come up with one or two right answers. The world that the Prime Minister, Senator Gareth Evans and Senator Schacht have been describing certainly bears no relationship to the real world for small business. Their comments bear no relationship to these facts: that Australia's interest rates are amongst the highest in the major industrialised countries, which impacts directly on small business borrowing costs; that the government's draconian industrial relations legislation is paralysing employment growth, increasing small business uncertainty and reducing employment flexibility and opportunity; and that rising inflation is rekindling small business fears of a re-run of Labor's disastrous boombust economic management patterns. It is also a fact that, for many rural and regional small businesses, their recession has never ended. It has continued unabated, and for some the conditions have worsened in rural and regional Australia. Small businesses are still being swamped by regulation and red tape. The fact is that under Labor the pages in the tax act has increased by 286 per cent. Small business proprietors are working harder and longer hours just to keep their heads above water. Business bankruptcies are now at a four-year high, and small businesses still remember, vividly, the 135,000 bankruptcies that emanated from the 'recession we had to have' - I quote the Prime Minister. The fact is that, under Labor, the small businesses, which are the engine room of the economic growth in this country, employing 3Y2 million Australians-or 45 per cent of the work force-and generating nearly one-third of gross domestic product is simply being given no incentive from the Labor government to capitalise on the many opportunities that are present within our economic structure. This fact is best illustrated by the 1995 budget in which taxes for small business were increased. The burden of tax was lumped onto small business. This government did nothing to cut through the real issues that are impeding the growth and development of small business in our country. For Labor, small business is simply a milch cow to satisfy its thirst for big government and big spending. Small business definitely knows that. That is exactly what has come out in this index in this report. Labor's rhetoric does not wash with individuals who are daily faced with the difficulties created by Labor's failed policies or Labor's lack of implementation of any policies. The customers and clients of small business are the people who are concerned about their futures. They are the ones who want jobs for their children. They are the ones who want security in their employment. They are the ones whose own dreams and aspirations are being shattered by Labor's failure. The Yellow Pages report has encapsulated the thoughts of the small business community very succinctly. After 13 years of Labor government, small business has stated that taxation, bureaucracy, paperwork, lack of incentive, lack of understanding, industrial relations and gove.mment charges are reasons for their belief that government policies are unsupportive of small business. The report is a damming report card of the performance of the minister and the Keating Labor government. This government's policies have been overwhelmingly dismissed as negative by 57 per cent of the small business respondents to this survey. There can be no louder message delivered by the small business community to the Labor government than that it feels it has been abandoned and neglected. That feeling is very much encapsulated in this report, which is a very respected document. An examination of the list of issues raised clearly supports this view. These issues have been promoted by representatives of the sector for years. A plethora of reports line the shelves. I would need a wheelbarrow to bring those reports down to this chamber. We have seen the inability of this government to translate this material into actual working policy. As far as small business is concerned, there has been-and still is-a policy vacuum in this government. After 13 years of Labor, small business is still being treated by the government as an outpost in the Australian economy; a convenient source of riches to fill the coffers of an increasingly burgeoning government. In return, small business is told by Labor that the provisional tax uplift factor cannot be set at a more realistic level; that capital gains tax reforms cannot be undertaken; and that fringe benefits tax reforms cannot be seriously addressed. In fact, when the government did endeavour to address that issue it undertook a review of the fringe benefits tax and came back and added to the burden of taxation on small business. Small business has also told Labor that it wants something done about industrial relations policies-particularly the unfair dismissal claims that are clogging the court system. Mr Anderson-Do they listen?",95
150,Mrs MOYLAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"There are no ears listening on that side of the House, I can tell you. Mr Anderson-Do you think they understand?",96
151,Mrs MOYLAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I don't think they understand at all. There is absolutely no understanding. Worse still, there is no commitment to wanting to understand. After 13 years of Labor government, the report reveals that small business proprietors around Australia have little confidence in the federal government's policies as they affect small business. Close to six out of 10 people in small business believe that the government's current economic and other policies work against the interests of small business. Taxes, bureaucracy, red tape, lack of incentives, lack of understanding of the needs of small business, IR policies, government charges and superannuation policies all feature prominently as the reasons for the negative view. They know that they can do more. They know that there are job opportunities. They a!so understand that Labor's industrial relations policies offer absolutely no incentive to employ. Furthermore, Labor's policies are not conducive to small business growth. The Yellow Pages report is small business speaking. This voice is not being heard. This is coming from the engine room that drives this economy. These are the people who are not cocooned in a plush ministerial suite. These are the people at the sharp end of Labor's policy vacuum and they do not like the pain that is being inflicted. They do not like the uncertainty that Labor has created. They do not like the lost opportunity and the wasted resources. They do not like the speed bumps that this government has imposed on small business growth and investment. It is a matter of great urgency that we to restore small business confidence and ensure a reasonable reward for effort. We see the unions going out for the workers, but this government is cutting away any profitability in small business. These people are not earning a reasonable reward for the work they do and the risk they take. It is a matter of urgency that we provide for them an incentive so that they can invest and grow and continue to offer employment opportunities. As the Yellow Pages report states, 63 per cent of small business proprietors believe Mr Howard would achieve the most for small business. Just 10 per cent support the Prime Minister. Sixty per cent believe the coalition would best look after the interests of small business, with just five per cent supporting the ALP. Dr Kemp-And also the interests of the unemployed.",96
152,Mrs MOYLAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is absolutely right. The member for Goldstein has just reminded me that there is a very strong correlation between the health of our nation, small businesses and our ability to get people back into work and off the unemployment list. Mr Anderson-Have they told the workers? Have they told the people they represent?",97
153,Mrs MOYLAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"They don't dare. They try to hide that. We all know what they do with the unempioyed. They churn them over on these training courses and when they come out there are still no jobs to go to. If they started at the right end and looked after business, we might resolve some of the problems of this country. Small business have expressed their support for the abilities of a future coalition government to deliver policies that will support the profitability and viability of this very important sector, which is the engine which drives this economy. They will not be disappointed in the ability of a coalition government to deliver.",97
154,Mr LINDSAY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Herbert-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology) (4.33 p.m.)-For the last 15 minutes we have been treated to a load of drivel from a shadow minister. This is the first occasion since the honourable member work for Pearce (Mrs Moylan) was appointed as a shadow minister that she has raised the issue of small business in this chamber. There have been five questions on small business to the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction (Senator Schacht) since he took over the portfolio. So I welcome the opportunity to speak on this matter of public importance. Small business is an issue which the opposition has demonstrably shown no interest in. It is a subject of vital importance to the Australian community. As a government, we have always recognised the importance of small business to Australia's economy and society. The statistics are worth noting. Small businesses make up 96 per cent of all firms in Australia, account for 45 per cent of total employment, and increasingly it is small firms that are driving employment growth and innovation in this country. Small firms, for example, created more than 850,000 new jobs between 1985-86 and 1993-94. To say that the government has failed to acknowledge small business is simply false. The Yellow Pages small index business report which the shadow minister referred to is fatally flawed. It was targeted specifically with a political bias. As a consequence, we say on the record that this report has no integrity. Let's deal with the shadow minister and her claims with respect to this report. They are in total conflict with recent business surveys as at 22 November 1995. Let me go through just a few of them. The Australian Chamber of small Commerce and Industry-Westpac survey of industrial trends shows that the net balance of respondents expecting output to increase in the next quarter rose by 23 percentage points to 70 per cent in the September quarter. Expectations about employment, overtime levels and new orders also rose in the latest survey. The Australian Chamber of ManufacturesTelstra survey of Australian manufacturing said that manufacturers are positive about trading conditions in the December quarter with almost half the respondents anticipating increased output in the final quarter of the calendar year. Moreover, firms also expect forward orders and employment capacity utilisation to improve in the December quarter. The New South Wales Chamber of Manufactures-State Bank survey of manufacturing activity said that the percentage of firms engaged in exporting is currently at its highest level ever. The ABS business expectation survey showed a firming of expectations over the year ahead. The National Australia Bank quarterly business survey showed that medium-term inflation expectations have deteriorated and a net balance of 28 per cent of firms expect inflation to remain between three and four per cent over the 1990s, down nine percentage points on the result for the June quarter. The survey also indicated that the strong productivity growth of recent years will continue with private sector productivity expected to rise two per cent in 1995-96. The Reuters survey and the Ernst and Young business indicator-the list goes on-are positive indicators of the rise of confidence in the business community. In addition to that, the federal government has three times a year circulated a progress report on the small business reform agenda. It goes out to forum members and is then distributed right around the country. It gives an analysis of small business trends and small business opportunities that are occurring in this country. This again is in stark contrast and is in conflict with that flawed survey conducted by the Yellow Pages. The shadow minister is a prolific writer of press releases, very few of which get published, and for good reason-because the content is right over the top. She also has a penchant to talk in hyperbole, in mysterious terms that are frankly misunderstood and cannot be understood by the small business community. She also gets up to a number of stunts on various occasions. For example, in June this year, at a speech at Brassey House, at the small business coalition dinner-she is in the chamber and I am sure she will remember it-she said she was glad that Senator Schacht, as minister for small business, had to deal with the issue of unconscionable conduct and she did not. That is the sort of standard we are to expect from a person who aspires to be a minister in a future federal government. She admits that the job of minister would be simply too hard for her. That is on her own admission. I will refer to her recent escapade in Adelaide later on. The shadow minister complained about interest rates, particularly the interest rate on the 90-day bill. The fact of the matter is that the 9O-day bank bill rate is a very important key business indicator. Under John Howard, the rate was significantly higher. In fact, through the Bank of New South Wales, I was paying over 23 per cent on a 90-day bill. Currently, the 90-day bill stands at 7.4 per cent. In March 1983, the 90-day bank bill rate, under John Howard-the official rate, despite what I paid-was 15.9 per cent. So the current major indicator for short-term business is half the· rate that existed under your leader. The absolute bumph that is spoken by the shadow minister needs to be exposed in the general community. The government's industry policy is strongly focused on the needs of Australian business. I remind honourable members what that policy is all about. The government's industry policy has two key objectives: creating a world competitive business environment, and building on the competitive strengths of our individual enterprises. Over the past decade the government has vastly improved the to business environment faced by all Australian firms. Some of these reforms have included dismantling the tariff barriers that were constraining the competitiveness of this country's businesses, deregulating the financial markets, floating the dollar, and creating an industrial relations system that is both efficient and fair in contrast to that espoused by the opposition. We well remember the industrial relations policy espoused by the current Leader of the Opposition during the last federal election campaign under their policy document Fightback, which was thoroughly rebuffed by the electorate in March 1993. Mr Deputy Speaker, I can assure you that the Australian people will be reminded again and again of the disaster that could befall them, particularly in their job security, if the opposition had its way and implemented its industrial relations policy. The Yellow Pages index survey that the shadow minister referred to--the one that I have stated is fatally flawed-tells us that tax is one issue close to the small business community's heart. May I remind members that the current company tax rate in this country is 36 per cent, fully 10 percentage points lower than it was in 1983. The reforms instituted by the government have created an environment where all firms can flourish; there is no question about that. Australia has now recorded 15 consecutive quarters of growth. That is almost four consecutive years of continuous growth, in excess of any index or indices used by the OECD countries. Importantly, this growth has been achieved at a time when inflation has been kept in check, the work force is growing rapidly, at more than double the average rate for the Western world since 1983 when your Leader of the Opposition was federal Treasurer, and when household disposable income is rising. The figures speak for themselves, but they mask an even more fundamental change to Australia's business environment. Australian industry is 50 per cent more competitive than it was in 1983. Exports are growing rapidly. Exports of high value added manufactures have increased by an average of 17.5 per cent a year over the last five years. This is the environment in which Australian small businesses are operating, in contrast to the fatally flawed report you referred to in the chamber here .. In my own portfolio, in regard to Ausindustry's assistance to small business, more than 5,000 firms have been assisted; 4,230 have phoned hotlines since June of this year for assistance; 2,800 firms received NIES assistance this year; and 2,200 firms have received grants or research and development tax concessions. In addition to that, there is BizLink, which is a computer program designed to provide to every small business in Australia, a bank or lawyer's office or accountant's office, information on federal government assistance programs for small business. These are incontrovertible facts. But where is the opposition's policy on small business? Opposition members close their eyes. They know nothing about small business and they have learnt nothing about small business. Let me tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, what the shadow minister got up to in Adelaide on 14 November. She made an address to the Australian Small Business Association. It must have been extremely disappointing for ASBA to have had a guest speaker, the opposition spokesperson on small business, and to have received no specific small business policies. I refer to an interview concerning the shadow minister on ABC radio on 14 November 1995. Mr Siekman, who is the President of the Australian Small Business Association, was asked a question. He responded as follows: We certainly would like to see policies that we can study and put· forward. The Australian Small Business Association is a dedicatedly apolitical organisation. We want to follow policies, not parties, and therefore we have to have a look at the policies. We're very keen to see what they are. Question: How much pressure are you putting on the Coalition to deliver you more detail so that you can have a look at those policies? Mr Siekman: We have asked all the parties to give us a look at their policies. We haven't got any from the coalition yet We will probably keep asking and we hope that they'll be revealed soon. Question: Are the Coalition taking you for granted, assuming that they've got you on the board anyway? Mr Siekman: They certainly haven't got us on board--<:ertainiy they shouldn't take us for granted. The shadow minister for small business has been parroting it around the country that small business supports the coalition, referring to a flawed Yellow Pages document which has no basis in fact, despite what they claim to be a 1,200 respondent survey about support from small business for the coalition. Small business is awake up to the opposition, awake up to its lack of policies. On 14 November, about a week ago, they identified the shadow minister for small business as a person of vacuum, a person who does not have any policies on this issue, a person who is unable to cobble together policies and, when pressed on a point, pleads that these policies will be released at a time closer to the electiori. We know very well that she has not got any policies and that she is intellectually incapable of cobbling a credible small business policy together. In developing the Australian business environment particularly for small business, we have been very conscious as a government of the particular needs of small business. Through the National Small Business Forum and other consultative mechanisms we have communicated directly with Australian small business about their needs. We have been involved in a consultative process. We have released a package for small business. That was done by the minister on 21 September. He will strengthen the Trade Practices Act to improve the standards of business conduct. This is another issue where the shadow minister initially promiseci support, positive participation, in the policy development process and then was stood on by the shadow Treasurer or others on the front bench and has resiled from supporting this important initiative. In addition, we will establish a small business trade practices unit within the Australian competition consumer commission to provide a focus for small business trade practices issues and also proceed with reform of corporate law to assist small business operators. We are proud of our accomplishments for small business. (Time expired)",97
155,Mr NEHL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am surprised and deeply disappointed that my friend the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Mr Lindsay), who is at the table, would descend into personal comments about and personal attacks on the member for Pearce (Mr Moylan). That is not part of his usual idiom. I am also surprised that he can stand in this place and talk about the Yellow Pages survey and say, 'The report has no integrity,' 'It is a flawed survey' and 'It is a fatally flawed report.' Isn't that surprising when the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction, Senator Schacht, only said on Monday something totally different? I refer the parliamentary secretary to page 3273 of the Senate Hansard on Monday when Senator Schacht said: Yes, I did say in August, and I stick by it, that the Yellow Pages survey is a credible survey of the expectations in the small business community. I read the survey this morning. Mr Vaile-Caught out!",100
156,Mr NEHL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am afraid the parliamentary secretary has indeed been caught out. His minister said the Yellow Pages survey is credible. The parliamentary secretary had better go back to the drawing board. I am very pleased to be able to support the member for Pearce. Small business is the backbone of this country. Have no doubt about it. That includes all the farming community as well. There are 816,000 small businesses. They are the major employer in Australia-so much so that if we could get rid of this present government and get a better economy, a better system, so that every small business could employ only one extra person, we would end unemployment in this country. This failed government has failed small business. I will come back if I have time to the details of that report. I would like to make the point right now about how business people in the survey said they would vote. It was a survey of 1,200 small businesses. That is a very substantial survey-not mickey mouse; a fair dinkum survey. How would they vote? Seventy-four per cent of the 1,200 said they would vote for the coalition. How many for the Labor Party? A mere 17 per cent. Why wouldn't they vote that way when this disreputable government has failed small business? It has failed because it does not understand small business, because collectively its members have no experience in small business, because they have never had to make a quid, because they have never had to make a profit and because they have never had to be concerned about the bottom line. Where are the small business men and women in the government? For example, let's look at the Prime Minister, the Hon. Paul John Keating. If you look at the 'Qualifications and occupation before entering federal parliament' section in the Parliamentary Handbook, you will see 'Research officer and industrial advocate, Federated Municipal and Shire Council Employees Union of Australia'. Mind you, he does not say that he was sacked from David Jones on 15 July 1957 and that the person who was in charge of him said, 'He was an arrogant person and often rude to customers.' Here is one leopard that does not change his spots: he is still arrogant and he is still rude to the punters. Mr Lindsay- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: it is n-t relevan- to the debate on small business. It IS totally melevant.",100
157,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE, areas. There is no point of order.,101
158,Mr NEHL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"If the parliamentary secretary does not really believe that experience in small business is not important to the small businesses of Australia, he is even further the creek without a paddle than I thought. You might say that the Prime Minister is only one person. There must be plenty ?f me- and women with small business expenence 10 the Labor government. I tell you what, it is hard to find one. Where are they? I know of one and that is Harry Woods, the member Pag-. There might be a few more coming inhibiting crawling out of the woodwork, but what the rest of them? This is why they do not understand-because they are social workers, shop stewards, teache-s,. public serva-ts, solicitors from the Abongmal Legal Service, academics and ACTU advocates. How about Laurie Brereton? His claim to fame in the business world is 'a traineeship in electrical trades' . Mr Bevis- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: the MPI deals with the importance of small business, not with the career backthe grounds of members of the chamber. I would urge you to encourage the member to come back to the MPI.",101
159,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The honourable Labor member is in order in that he was illustrating backgrounds of certain members. There is no point of order.,101
160,Mr NEHL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, you are renowned for your fairness. In an unfair attack on the member for Pearce, the parliamentary secretary did not help because he got into the personal qualifications and personal characteristics of the member for Pearce. Shame on him for doing it. I will go back to the member for Page. He knows how. to count the money-he is probably the only one who does-because he has a hotel. As a publican and a bookmaker, he has small business experience. That is just as well because after the next election he will be back in his pub. Small business is suffering because this government does not know and does not care. It does not acknowledge that its own labour policies are failing small business in many This Yellow Pages survey has revealed without any doubt that the areas that sm-l business is concerned about are where thiS government's policies--t--re are no poli-ie.s; there are actions-are fathng, and that IS 10 taxation. Small business is being treated up unfairly compared with big business. The bureaucracy and the paperwork is killing it. The lack of incentive, the lack of understanding of small business, the industrial relations policies of this present government only and-have no doubt-the unfair dismissal for program of this present gove-ment are small businesses from taking people about on. They are too scared-and with good reason. Everyone in this parliament has heard the stories of people who have been fired because they did not turn up for work, they were rude to the customers or they even had their hand in the till-they go for an unfair dismissal ruling-and the poor business has to put them back on or pay them something. It is totally unfair. Government charges are also totally unfair. The key national issues facing the next federal government have been identified by 1 200 small businesses surveyed by the Yello- Pages. There are three issues: unemployment, the economy and econ?ml- strategy, and foreign debt. The reahty IS that has failed when it comes to unemployment. There is no doubt about that. Labor has failed in a scandalous fashion on the economy and economic strategy, and when it comes to foreign debt this notorious Labor government has failed totally. But, above all, Labor has failed small business in so many ways. The people involved in small business are not wealthy, they are ordinary people, as most of the members in this place are ordinary people-unless they have houses at Woollahra and pig farms and so on. Small business people are hard working, dedicated people who work very long hours, very often seven days a week. I want to refute the claim made by the parliamentary secretary-and I am sure the member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) who is to speak next will say similar things. You have to realise something by looking at the empty shops. Aren't there empty shops in government members' electorates? Do you go around with your eyes closed? I am sure you do. The parliamentary secretary can sit there and say that Townsville has no empty shops, but I don't believe it. They are empty because the people have gone bankrupt. There are empty offices because the firms have gone insolvent under this Labor government. The farmers are ruined and are being forced off their land. There are lower incomes for lawyers, accountants and other professional people. There are lower retail sales and vastly reduced housing starts, with a disastrous impact on all the subcontractors. Motor vehicle sales are well and truly down. These are small businesses. As for the bankruptcy figures, I hope I have time to make the point that bankruptcies-and the Labor Party can trumpet their so-called success as much as they like-cannot be ignored. In 1991-92, there were 5,387 business bankruptcies-up 225 per cent from the number 10 years before. The total business bankruptcies in 10 years to 1991-92 were 27,992. Bankruptcies in total for 1991-92 were 16,780. (Time expired)",101
161,Mr LES SCOTT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I am delighted to speak on this matter of public importance because small business in our community is a matter of public importance. I would like to talk a little bit about small business in opposition to what the member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) just said. He roamed everyWhere, including attacking everyone in the House who did not have a small business background. If everyone had to have a small business background to come to this place, it would be a funny sort of parliament. By the very nature of democracy, this place has people from all walks of life. That is the great strength of this place. It is certainly not a weakness. If we are going to have to restrict ourselves in this place to speaking from our particular circumstance and background, that will certainly limit a lot of the debate. It is also a learning experience for us. We need to be able to avail ourselves of the available information so we can talk about a range of areas if we are going to represent all our constituents. I do agree that there are a huge number of people out there involved in small business. The statistics have been canvassed, certainly by the member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) earlier today-not so much by those opposite. They amaze me. I thought we might hear a little today about what their policies are on small business. I am sure that anyone from small business out there today would like to have seen the secret come out of the bag-but it is still a secret. There is clearly no indication from those opposite about what sort of policies they have. Let us go to some of the areas that the member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan) and the member for Cowper did not want to canvass. Let us consider the taxation position of the coalition government in 1983. Mr Lindsay-Sixty cents in the dollar.",102
162,Mr LES SCOTT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It was 60c in the dollar, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology reminds the House. Mr Lindsay-Forty-six cents was the company tax rate. Mr LES SCOrf-That is right; 46c in the dollar was the company tax rate. We have small businesses that range in size from very small businesses to almost medium sized businesses. Those family businesses were paying those sorts of tax rates, and we addressed that issue. Have those opposite ever heard of the franking of dividends? That was another measure that this government brought in. It never happened under the coalition. We brought it into assist people in business so that they did not pay double taxation. Mr Nehl-That doesn't help small business.",102
163,Mr LES SCOTT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It helps small businesses that are incorporated. The member for Cowper interjects that it does not help them. Good Lord, where has he been? Does he have any qualification to come in here with those sorts of outrageous comments? He is just not right. Mr Nehl-We are talking about partnerships and sole traders, you dill! Mr LES SCO'IT-In partnerships, you pay marginal tax rates. We reduced them from 60c in the dollar to 46c in the dollar. We have to remind you about that again. At the last election, what did the opposition want to impose on small business? A GST, for goodness sake. You are not even backing away from that. I heard someone from the opposition say here today in the appropriation debate that the coalition will not bring in more taxes. Butthis is the sneaky part-they are going to get the states to raise their own income tax. How will they do it? They would do it only through a consumption tax. That is the only way that they would do it. Anyone with half a brain knows that, apart from the people in the opposition, who do not understand it for a moment. That is exactly what you people will do. It is about time that you were honest with the Australian public and told them exactly what you propose to do. You are dead set wrong. Mr Nehl-No new taxes.",103
164,Mr LES SCOTT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,No new taxes by the Commonwealth. Mr Nehl-Exactly.,103
165,Mr LES SCOTT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is what you said, but there will be new taxes by the states, won't there? The honourable member for Cowper will not deny that, because he would be competing with his leader, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), otherwise. They certainly will do that. We have assisted small business in a few other areas apart from taxation. What about the banking industry? What was John Howard doing when he was Treasurer? He would not touch the banking industry.",103
166,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Rocher)Order! The honourable member will refer to members by their correct title. Mr LES SCOTTI will certainly do that. The honourable member for Bennelong certainly deserves the title of the recycled Leader of the Opposition. What did he ever do when it came to the banks? Absolutely nothing. He let them do their own thing. The members opposite now come in here and complain day in and day out about the banks. Mr Moore--I will write another letter to the Queensland Times. Mr LES SCOTTI would love to see another letter from you to the Queensland Times, because every time you write to my local paper my vote goes up. The member for Ryan is yet to give them any policies from the opposition. I am not sure what his portfolio is at the moment, but he is on the front-bench of the opposition. That is probably about the best position that he will hold. The honourable member for Herbert raised a very important point about interest rates that I want to address. He talked about the deregulation versus the regulation of the banks. He mentioned 90-day bank bill rates. I used to work for the Bank of New South Wales. The member for Herbert said that he was paying something like 23 per cent as a small businessman. He is very qualified to speak in this place, according to what the honourable member for Cowper had to say, because he was a small businessman. The honourable member for Herbert compared the old 23 per cent rate with the present 7.4 per cent. Those lower rates have assisted small business. Pressure must be maintained on the banks to produce such rates. In a deregulated environment, there are better packages. Small business can now shop around more. They do not have the same restrictions as they had before. Mr Sciacca-I am a small businessman25 years with 30 employees.",103
167,Mr LES SCOTT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is right. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs and now Minister assisting the Treasurer for Superannuation reminds me that he was also a small businessman. He will also want to speak on this MPI, because it is important. Evidently, the new rules from the opposition require you to have. a background in a particular area in order to speak on it. If they lems. ever get on this side of the House, they will not be able to speak on anything. Those seem to be their new rules, as outrageous as they are. That is the criteria. Because I happen to have worked in the banking industry, I used to deal with a lot of people in small businesses. I have small businesses in my electorate, like everybody else. I am supposed to come in here and say that because I do not have a small business background I am not allowed to represent these people. But I represent them very well. I know that all the honourable members on this side of the House represent them well because they take avery keen interest in small business. Mr Lindsay-No GST.",104
168,Mr LES SCOTT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is right. Small businesses were bitterly opposed to a GST. They will still be opposed to one if these people opposite ever have the opportunity to impose a consumption tax on them. That is what they would do. There is little doubt that the opposition would go down that path. I tried to write down a few comments made by the honourable member for Cowper so that I could rebut them, but I have a blank sheet because he did not talk about anything to do with this MPI. He wanted to attack people personally. I want to defend some comments the honourable member for Herbert made about the member for Pearce. He was not talking about her personally. Most people on this side very much respect the honourable member for Pearce as a human being, but unfortunately she is tied up with a coalition that has no policies. The honourable member for Herbert talked about her performance as a shadow minister. Her lack of performance, which has been highlighted here today, is very sad. She has not provided any alternative to this government's record in small business, and we are talking about a very important area. In my electorate there are a lot of successful small businesses. Last Friday night, I was invited to speak at the Master Builders Association dinner. They invite me back every year to talk to them about what is happening. That is how you keep in touch with people. You talk with them and listen to their probThe honourable member for Cowper mentioned housing starts and problems in the housing area. There are some problems at the moment because there has been an oversupply in relation to the demand. There are reasons for that, and the industry acknowledges them. As a result of that, there is a problem that needs to be addressed. It is being addressed in the industry. Most people in the industry are smart enough to know the problems, and they pace themselves to them. That oversupply is unfortunate. I acknowledge that it exists. But the government did not build the houses; the industry did. The industry acknowledges that they need to balance things so that those problems do not occur again. Mr Lindsay-Ask them about a GST.",104
169,Mr LES SCOTT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is right. They would be concerned about a GST. The housing industry is a vital industry. It is vital in my electorate. It employs a lot of people. I commend it for this. One area of my electorate involved with the industry is the Carole Park industrial area. I will be speaking later tonight about the efforts of two companies, Paradise Food Industries and Food Spectrum, that have received acknowledgments from this government. One has been able to get into the hard stuff, and the other has worked with Ausindustry. (Time expired)",104

171,Mr CONNOLLY,PAIRS,"Bradfield) (5.18 p.m.}I move: Schedule 5, page 43, item 16, omit ""Add at the end 'or Deputy Chairperson' "", substitute ""Omit the subsection"". On the face of it, this amendment is quite straightforward. It has been established coalition policy for some years that there be no NA age discrimination in Australia, and certainly not in the Commonwealth Public Service. We have presented no fewer than four bills on age discrimination in this parliament-two in the Senate and two in this chamber, both of which had their first reading and never had their second because this government, which believes so much in human rights, chose for all sorts of extraneous reasons not to take the matter further. In the Senate the same thing happened except there, because of the tyranny of numbers against the government, the legislation was actually carried. But, again, it was never introduced for debate in the House of Representatives. So what can best be described as a legislative stand-off had occurred in both chambers over a similar period of time on what most sensible people would regard as a fundamental human right. What is that fundamental human right? It is the right of every Australian citizen, regardless of their age, to be able to make a contribution to society for as long as they are so able to do. The provisions in the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Legislation Amendment Bill, in its initial form, specified that new position of deputy chairperson was not to be available to anybody over the age of 65. In other words, it was a clear case of age discrimination in its most obvious form. That is precisely what our legislation on no fewer than four occasions was meant to remove. This debate has been part of the Australian spectrum for many years but, like so many of these issues of human rights, it tends to be involved in obfuscation, ignorance and fundamental lack of real knowledge. I wonder how many members of this chamber, for example, would be aware that in the entire Commonwealth Public Service of well over 150,000 people there are today only 81 who are aged 65. Under the Public Service Act, as it currently stands, there are provisions by which a secretary to a department may permit someone to remain in employment on a very limited basis beyond that age. But the evidence is quite clear that that has not been the rule. Ever since the concept of retirement at age 55 was introduced, which again is one of the components of the superannuation package, there has been a pronounced view in legislation in this House-I regret to say that it was passed by both sides back in the 1970s-that earlier retirement should be favoured over later retirement. But we are told by the government in the context of its superannuation policy looking to the future that in the next 30 years we are going to have twice as many people out of the work force-they will be dependent to one degree or another on the welfare provisions provided mainly through taxation-with a ratio of workers to nonworkers double what it currently is at present. You do not need to be an intellectual genius, you certainly do not need to be a statistician and you certainly do not need to be an actuary to understand the fundamentals of that proposition. It is simply this: with an ageing society, with a society the age of which is going to get older as people live longer and live longer, healthier lives, the implications for people to retire any time after age 55 will simply mean that the number of years they are going to be available to work and make contributions to superannuation will the not be enough to maintain them for that extended lifestyle, This is despite the claim by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that, if somebody gets into the work force at age 25 in the year 2002 or 2003 and for 30 or 40 years continue on an ever raising scale of income and remain in continuous employment, they will be looking at around a quarter of a millionMr Sciacca-$460,000 in today's dollar terms.",105

176,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the 25th report of the committee for 1995 relating to the Commonwealth Law Courts building, Melbourne. Ordered that the report be printed.",109
177,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The committee's 25th report for 1995 relates to the proposed construction of a purpose-built Commonwealth law courts facility in Melbourne. The building will provide accommodation for the High Court, the Federal Court, the Industrial Relations Court and the Family Court. The site for the proposed development is the comer of William and Latrobe Streets, Melbourne, directly opposite Flagstaff Gardens. The estimated total cost of the building, including fitout costs and rise and fall, has been agreed at $108.4 million. In 1987, the government decided to provide clearly identifiable and purpose-designed Commonwealth law courts buildings in each capital city to accommodate the courts and associated staff and facilities. The Attorney General's Department aims to provide the judiciary, legal practitioners, court staff and the public with court facilities which meet the requirements of security and access and have a positive impact on the social and physical environment. The four jurisdictions currently occupy space in Melbourne at four separate city locations. At all locations the accommodation does not provide adequately for the operational and growth requirements of the courts. In addition, the level of security achievable in these buildings does not provide acceptable protection for judges, staff and the public. During the development of this proposal, the Attorney-General's Department advised that several options were investigated. These included: refurbishment of existing accommodation; the fitout of leased premises; acquisition of an existing building and converting it to a courts building; or building a purposedesigned facility. The comparison of the options provided to the committee indicates clearly that the construction of a new court complex on the Flagstaff site represents the best value for the Commonwealth. In agreeing to the project proceeding, the committee has recommended that the Attorney-General's Department consult with the Victorian government regarding a number of issues, including the possible sharing of library and child-care facilities. The committee has also recommended that the Attorney General's Department continue consultations with the Community and Public Sector Union to resolve issues such as space allocation, building facilities and amenities. In commending this report-the committee's 25th for 1995-to the House, I would point out that to date in 1995 the committee has reported on projects valued in excess of $1.2 billion. I make the point that we have five or six more reports to bring down in the next week. By all measures, this has been a very productive year for this extremely hard working committee. APPROPRIATION BILL (No.3) 1995·96 Cognate bills: APPROPRIATION BILL (No.4) 1995·96 APPROPRIA TION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (No.2) 1995·96 Second Reading Debate resumed.",110
178,Ms WORTH,COMMITTEES,"Adelaide) (5.37 p.m.)These appropriation bills seek an additional $1.4 billion of taxpayers' money to continue the business of government. Big spending departments are Defence, DEET, Social Security, and Administrative Services. Included are the legal costs of the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) in relation to the Marks royal commission. It is accepted that there is a role for government in paying legal costs of ministers who are engaged in legal disputes concerning their public and ministerial roles. However, there should be no acceptable argument for the use of taxpayers' money for a minister to try to avoid embarrassment, to avoid fronting up for scrutiny by embarking on legal challenges to stop the process of scrutiny before it could get under way. There should be no case for taxpayers funding the obstruction by the minister for health of the Marks royal commission. The minister for health frequently asserted that she was looking forward to giving her version of events to the commission, but then used every legal avenue possible to attempt to scuttle the commission. She now wants taxpayers to pay for her attempted obstruction. The minister for health is totally discredited; she has been found by the Marks royal commission to have lied. Some opposite, and chiefly the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), have attempted to discredit the Marks royal commission in their attempt to save the minister's skin. Others opposite have privately cringed as they have been asked to support someone who transported the political contamination of WA Inc. into the federal parliament. Some opposite have argued that the royal commission was a political witch-hunt set up simply to discredit the Minister for Human Services and Health. The fact is that the royal commission was set up after two of her former colleagues said that she had lied over what has been known as the Penny Easton affair, a shocking chain of events culminating in a young mother, who had worked as a nurse and a lawyer, committing suicide. In portraying the royal commission as a witch-hunt, the Labor Party has sought to undermine a member of our judiciary. In doing so, it has threatened the trust Australian people have for one of our most important institutions. Without this trust, we jeopardise the social stability that has set Australia aside from so many other countries tom by social unrest. Despite all failed but expensive attempts to stop the royal commission, the minister now stands condemned by the royal commission on the strength of the evidence given by her former colleagues and her former staff. She is condemned on two main grounds: for being untruthful and because her conduct was judged to be improper due to her use of Brian Easton's grievances and allegations for her own political advantage. The royal commissioner found: Generally speaking it is the weight of the evidence in contradiction of Dr Lawrence's version that requires disbelief. Marks continued: There was however other evidence which strongly undermined the credibility of Dr Lawrence. It did not depend on belief or disbelief of another witness, but solely on what she herself said. Examples are given but there can be no more damning example than, and I quote directly from the royal commission report: Dr Lawrence even more clearly told an untruth to the Press Club at Canberra on 19 April 1995 when she said that she knew on Wednesday, 4 November, that she would be exonerated in regard to the imprest account: ""I clearly want to debunk the claim that 1 seized on this petition as a way to deflect attention from a police inquiry into my imprest account. The fact is that by the day before the tabling of the petition 1 was already aware that the inquiry was completed and that 1 would be exonerated and 1 checked that detail with the lawyer involved yesterday. "" On the day before the tabling of the petition Dr Lawrence could not have been already aware that she would be exonerated because the decision not to charge her was not made by the police commissioner until the day following the tabling. It is no secret that members of parliament are being held in ever diminishing regard by the public. The Prime Minister, the Minister for Human Services and Health and any others who think it is desirable to adopt a personal philosophy that power and personal political gain excuse all else contribute to this diminishing respect and regard. The consequences of this diminishing respect for elected representatives is diminishing respect for our institutions. Every member of this place should be concerned that in September, 56 per cent of respondents to a Morgan poll agreed that they had lost faith in the political system. Of even more concern is that about 91 per cent endorsed the proposition that politicians twist the truth to suit their own political purposes. Former Commonwealth Auditor-General John Taylor has argued that democracy cannot work without trust and that politicians who lie break a social contract with the people they represent. He says: It is more than a moral question. It's a practical question. If you can't trust people you can't operate. The leadership has got to come from the top. Commissioner Marks says in his report that: Representative government is an integral part of our constitutional fabric. The source of power of elected representatives and those selected from them to govem is the people ... It is a corollary of representative government, so understood, that elected representatives owe the people a duty, akin to that of trustees, in the discharge of their functions and responsibilities. In a section of his report under a heading, 'Duties of members of parliament as holders of high office', Commissioner Marks writes: It is not surprising that representative government, as explained, gives rise to the expectation that the functions and duties of elected representatives shall be performed openly and with the utmost integrity. The Prime Minister and others opposite instead of trying to discredit the royal commission should set aside arrogance, listen to what the commissioner had to say and use the commissioner's findings to understand how our institutions are threatened in the absence of a commitment to truth by those who hold public office. I have been particularly alarmed by those within the government who have attempted to use the minister's gender as the grounds for her defence. On 15 November in the other place, Senator Crowley claimed that the minister for health was the victim of a witchhunt that 'set out to attack a brilliant and successful woman, because a brilliant and successful woman they cannot cope with'they being the opposition. Such an accusation is absolutely absurd. As I said earlier, this royal commission came about following accusations made by the minister for health's former Labor colleagues. The minister herself has sought refuge behind her gender by suggesting that a woman in politics is treated as either a 'madonna or a whore'-an argument that female politicians under scrutiny are treated more harshly than men. To me this is rubbish. It is crucial that women in parliament not be treated differently to their male colleagues. At the same time, women should not use their gender as a refuge from the scrutiny meted out to men. There is an angle to all this which has received little public comment-perhaps it has not been politically correct to comment but, in my view, it should be done. We have all seen television images of the minister during her difficulties surrounded by other womenmany of them in powerful positions themselves-all seen to be carrying flowers. Now I do not condemn this activity-it is not wrong to give support to those suffering personal difficulties. But what I have found beyond my comprehension is that all these women seem to have forgotten that it was the misfortune and difficulties of another young woman whose personal problems were exploited for political gain which led to this whole dreadful saga in the first place. The 'sisterhood', for want of another term, does itself untold damage by exercising blind loyalty towards one of their number and simply disregarding the facts. Former Labor minister Peter Walsh once referred to the minister for health as Pearl Pureheart. But I believe it says a good deal about the minister's ruthlessness when as Premier of Western Australia-and she herself knowing what it was like to be a sole parent and also to suffer the pain of divorce-she could so exploit the difficult personal circumstances of another woman, Penny Easton, a young mother whose marriage break-down and lack of property settlement obviously caused her much pain. The petition tabled in the Western Australian parliament made matters public that should have remained confidential and within the Family Court. It made accusations against Penny Easton which were found to have no foundations. Penny Easton committed suicide four days after the petition was tabled. The minister for health who also assists the Prime Minister for the status of women and women around Australia would do well to remember if they find themselves in positions of power and influence that they have a moral obligation to stand up for those who have less power and are more vulnerable. I caution all who would spring to the minister for health's defence of Commissioner Marks's words on 'Duties of members of parliament as holders of high office'. As I have already mentioned, in these bills the government is appropriating another $1.4 billion of taxpayers' funds for its activities in this financial year. In doing so, the government completely obliterates the $718 million surplus it claimed to have created in this year's budget. Given the urgent need for the government to save rather than spend its way into deficit each year, this continuing failure to contain its spending habit is frightening. This is something even the Treasurer (Mr Willis) understands. In his budget speech in May, the Treasurer identified the long-term decline of our national savings as the major constraint on growth, and indeed justified the budget on the grounds that it would: . . . provide for the continued expansion of the Australian economy . . . by tackling the major constraint on growth: the long-term decline of our national savings. At least the Treasurer seems to understand the problem-and it is that Australia's story during the last 13 years of Labor administration is the ever-recurring story of growth constrained by debt. It is always the same: the economy grows and so do the deficits on the current account; the brakes are applied to growth using interest rate hikes and the economy slows; the current account moves back towards balance and interest rates are eased; as they do, the economy begins to grow and, once again, we have a current account blow-out. And so it goeseach time, those hardest hit by the recession finding it harder and harder to get on their feet as the good times come and then quickly go. It does not need to be this way. As the Treasurer himself has said, we can-and again I quote in the hope the government might take heed: . . . provide for the continued expansion of the Australian economy . . . by tackling the major constraint on growth: the long-term decline of our national savings. By appropriating another $1.4 billion the government is acting in direct contradiction to the imperative to save implied by the Treasurer. And the government cannot excuse itself from the savings task by arguing that the decline in savings is the private sector's problem. Again, even the Treasurer understands that this is a cop-out. He said in the budget papers: It is difficult to escape the conclusion that for of the period under review the most important determinant of the current account deficit was the sizeable public dis saving. A conclusion that was set out perfectly clearly for the government as early as 1993 in the report on national saving that it commissioned from Vince FitzGerald, and I quote: The main contributor to our long-term decline in national saving is the decline in public sector saving. In this report FitzGerald also issued an ominous warning which puts the government's refusal to curb its spending habit into a chilling perspective. He wrote: ... we already have a very high foreign debt and a high current account deficit adding constantly to it. If we do not save more, then the investment necessary to ensure higher growth and more employment will only be funded by even greater recourse to foreign savings and a further build-up of foreign debt. Today, thanks to a current account record that culminated in a current account deficit for 1994-95 of six per cent of GDP, foreign debt stands at $180 billion and is an overwhelming problem for this country. The most recent edition of the Economist said it all: Australia's excessive reliance on foreign capital leaves the currency and long term interest rates vulnerable. A weaker currency would push up the cost of servicing its foreign debts. So unless the lucky country becomes a thrifty country, it will be in big trouble. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has gone to considerable effort to disguise the fact that we are, in the words of the Economist, in big trouble. As one member of the Labor caucus, quoted in the Australian of 14 September, put it, 'Keating made foreign debt sound positively good for you.' The Prime Minister has made foreign debt sound positively good and, in doing so, has exhibited a willingness to deceive the public which echoes that of the minister at the centre of the Marks royal commission. But the deception is not contained to this instance. The Minister for Human Services and Health is not alone. For instance, on budget night in May, the Treasurer announced most to the nation, 'The budget delivers a surplus in 1995-96 of $718 million.' Alan Ramsey's response in the Sydney Morning Herald hit the nail squarely on the head when he said, 'To trust this budget you have to trust Paul Keating.' As it turned out, the Treasurer's surplus was not to be trusted; it was a smoke and mirrors fudge job and one had only to tum to the back of the budget papers to find that the adjusted ABS budget figure, which eliminated asset sales and loan repayments from the states and so showed the real state of the books, was really a $8.2 billion deficit. On the link between the foreign debt and interest rates, in the Financial Review of 22 September the Treasurer was quoted as saying: The Federal Opposition have tried to convince the Australian people that the level of foreign debt is forcing up more mortgage interest rates in this country. That is a monstrous and demonstrable lie ... There is no relation whatever between mortgage interest rates and foreign debt. As Alan Wood so succinctly summed it up in the Australian on the same day, 'Wrong, Ralph!' The government's own report on savings, the FitzGerald report, stated: We need to pay higher interest rates to compensate for the risks inherent in our high external debt. The fact is that we pay about another $5 to $10 per week on a $100,000 mortgage because of the level of our foreign debtsomething that the Treasurer is unwilling to come clean about to the Australian people. Does the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) manage to get any closer to the truth in his portfolio area? As a way of justifying the government's lack of action on the unemployment front, the minister continues to claim that the government is on track to meet its target of five per cent unemployment by the year 2000. Yet this is patently untrue. As Labor said in its Working Nation statement of May 1994, 'We have got to grow at something like four to 4.5 per cent to keep unemployment coming down.' We are currently growing at well below four per cent, and this cycle's decline in the unemployment rate stopped decisively at 8.2 per cent a number of months ago. Since then, we have had monthly unemployment rates of 8.3 per cent, then 8.5 per cent and most recently 8.7 per cent. I really cannot put it any better than the editorial in the Australian of 8 September: Mr Crean claims we are on track to cut unemployment to 5 per cent. At best he is deluded and at worse Mr Crean is not telling the truth. I could go on and on. The Prime Minister claimed in 1992 that he would not increase taxes in his next term of government. He claimed that he had no intention of reneging on the second round of One Nation tax cuts, saying, 'They are not a promise. They are law-I-a-w law.' 'Not telling the truth', as the editorial from the Australian so delicately put it, is now a habit for this government and it is in this sense that the Minister for Human Services and Health is not alone. She came to this place with much fanfare; much was written and said about how the Prime Minister had persuaded her to leave Western Australian politics and enter the federal parliament. This was meant to be a great plus for Labor, guaranteed to get them the women's vote. Now the Prime Minister is trying to keep the minister in cabinet and in so doing is departing from convention. The minister should resign. She has been found guilty. The parliaments of Australia need men and women of ability and integrity.",110
179,Mr JENKINS,COMMITTEES,"Next March when honourable members are watching the 1996 Transurban Australian Grand Prix from Melbourne they may well ask themselves why a consortium essentially only important to Melbourne-in fact to one particular project in Melbourne-is featured so prominently in an international event. It would be a valid question. Many Victorians are already asking themselves that very question. Today in the Melbourne Age Kenneth Davidson says: It is hard to know whether to laugh or cry about the Kennett Government and its mates. Transurban sponsors for the Grand Prix? Are they serious? Why would any corporate entity, seeking to boost its corporate image or the profile for its products or services, sponsor the Grand Prix? It does not require a degree in marketing to see that sponsorship of this event would be corporate poison. Why would Telstra, which knocked back the chance, want to pay $8 million a year to sponsor an event that is deeply affronting to, conservatively, at least 10 to 20 per cent of Melbourne's population and which will need most of the Victorian police force to ensure that it goes ahead without violent protest? I do not want to dwell on the aspects of the Grand Prix but I certainly want to dwell on the project of the Transurban consortium, City Link, and the process by which it has been developed so far, as it is part of a very worrying trend in the state of Victoria. As the headline in the Davidson article in the Age today says, 'Time to question the decision process.' This trend sees increasingly more projects exempted from the usual practices of environmental and community scrutiny and sees legal rights to redress potential injustices severely curtailed. An environmental effects statement has not been prepared for the proposed expansion of the Tullamarine Freeway. The City Link Bill exempts the entire project from the Planning and Environment Act 1987. Just what is the City Link project? Briefly, it is a road complex that will join the Tullamarine Freeway from where it ends on the outskirts of the central business district to the existing south-eastern arterial road. It involves a new bridge over the Yarra and a tunnel beneath the Yarra River and the Domain park. In addition, as I have said, the Tullamarine Freeway will be extended. There will be a toll for the use of the City Link, depending on the length travelled. Transponders attached to the windshields of cars will be read by overhead meters. These meters will be placed in three strategic positions along the City Link project-at Bulla Road on the Tullamarine Freeway, in the Domain tunnel complex and at Toorak Road at the end of the existing south-east arterial. The amount charged for each section of the journey will be deducted from the transponder's memory. Motorists will have to purchase the transponder before travel. In getting to this position in promoting the City Link, the Victorian government has had very little consultation. For instance, there was no consultation with residents whose homes will disappear for the project. They were informed of the state government's plans, on the day the route of the project was announced, by a 'To the Householder' letter. There has been no consultation with the broader community which will be affected by the impact of private sector tolls on the proposed roads. Once the state legislation that allows for this project, the City Link Bill, becomes law, there will be no opportunity for community input. All rights are removed and all appeal rights are removed. The City Link Bill removes any necessity for Transurban to examine the effect of the project on the Yarra River or on Moonee Ponds Creek and the noise impact for residents along City Link. There is no requirement for Transurban to meet EPA pollution standards. In the great tradition of the Kennett government, the City Link Bill also limits the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Victoria in relation to City Link matters through a variation of the Constitution Act, thus joining the 30 or more other pieces of legislation exempted by amendments to the Constitution Act. The bill will give Transurban powers and indemnities normally only accorded to public bodies, bodies that are accountable to parliament. This is an unprecedented exemption to a private company. The Supreme Court will be unable to examine matters relating to any failure to follow planning procedures or compensation for the impact of City Link other than is provided for in the bill. The unprecedented actions of the government of Victoria to guarantee Transurban the profitability of the City Link project go to the very heart of issues of accountability and responsible government. It is not only the road closures and changes that the state government will finance; there are many other examples of the state government using its powers to guarantee a private sector monopoly a profit. The last state budget committed $300 million towards the project to acquire the land for its use and to help finance the so-called gateway monuments to Jeffrey 'Glib' Kennett, such as the 120-metre twin towers on the new Yarra Bridge and the 70-metre yellow beam. Transurban will be exempted from paying land tax, stamp duty, local government rates, water rates and building levies-worth millions of dollars. Policing and enforcing the compliance with tolls will be the responsibility of VicRoads, a state government agency. This means that a division of a statutory authority of the state government will be accountable for collecting the turnover for a private consortium and financing this collection. For the first 20 years of the contract, Transurban is guaranteed toll increases of 4Y2 per cent per year or the inflation rate, whichever is the greater. Profits are thus guaranteed, because in times of low inflation Transurban is able to increase tolls over and above the inflation rate. Among the most disturbing aspects of the City Link project are the circumstances under which the state government will compensate Transurban if certain action affects its ability to make a profit. These include some actions over which any future state government will have absolutely no control. If the Commonwealth government, for instance, conducts an environmental impact statement and the outcome delays the start of the project, the state government has to reimburse Transurban for the extra costs arising from the delay. Transurban can have the contract terminated if state government action results in tollway revenue falling by 20 per cent. If certain events occur that have an adverse effect on tollway revenue, Transurban can claim compensation. These circumstances include a future state government building a rapid rail link to the airport or any new road or surface deemed to have a detrimental effect on tollway revenue. A rapid rail link to Tullamarine airport from the central activities district should have been considered in conjunction with or at the same time as consideration of City Link. Matters that might lead to compensation include removal of parking restrictions, road closures and narrowings proposed to force people to use the City Link. They include future changes to state taxes and charges and the tollway enforcement arrangements, such as a future decision of a state government to make it no longer an offence to not pay the toll. The Kennett government has ensured that every avenue is covered to limit the actions of future state governments with regard to the City Link project. These limitations are contained in the ironclad contract between the Transurban consortium and the state government. At a time when governments-state and federal-have signed up for the implementation of a national competition policy, the City Link project must surely represent the very antithesis of competition and what competition is all about. For many who have always harboured reservations about the implementation of competition policy, it is sold to us on the basis that it has the potential, when undertaken properly, to benefit the people we represent. We are told that competition policy has the potential to deliver those people goods and services that reduce rates and give real choices. City Link must surely be an example of a complete absence of competition policy. Not only will the state government refuse to examine proposals for extended public transport facilities to the airport; it wishes to close roads, remove clearways and put additional parking on some of Melbourne's major arterial roads. This is all to ensure that commuters are forced to use City Link and Transurban is guaranteed its profit. Commuters are consumers too, especially if they have to pay tolls. They are entitled to the same choices as other consumers and are entitled to choose not to use City Link if they wish. A project which so flagrantly violates the federal-in fact, the national---competition policy should not dare to seek the assistance of the federal government in its implementation. The City Link project is essentially about government action to support a private sector monopoly-grossly at odds with any form of competition. The City Link project creates obvious concerns for Commonwealth transport policy. Under the One Nation project, the federal government has spent $20 million to upgrade the South Dynon railway terminal. This is part of the federal government's commitment to improving national railway infrastructure. The state government's plan to reduce Footscray Road from eight to four lanes to force commuters to use City Link has serious implications for access to the South Dynon terminal. The federal government should be concerned that it has invested millions in a project only to have that investment undermined by the actions of the state government. The federal government has a legitimate interest in proper and efficient transport networks and puts considerable funds into road building. All members should be concerned that transport policy in Victoria seems to be dictated by a private monopoly ability to make a profit. Many people claim to be unconcerned about this and not to care about the actions of the Kennett government with regard to its business dealings. If they are not concerned about City Link because they do not live in the northern, western or south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne, if they are not concerned because they will not need to use City Link on a regular basis and if they are not concerned about the as yet unknown environmental effects of this project, then they should be concerned about democracy in Victoria. The story surrounding this project is of concern anyone who believes in the responsibility and accountability of governments. Many Victorians have come increasingly to see the state government, the casino, the Grand Prix and Transurban as essentially different branches of the same operation. But by looking for Commonwealth assistance for the project, whether it be in the form of taxation breaks or infrastructure bonds funding, the state government of Victoria is seeking to implicate the Commonwealth in this City Link project. To this end, I have joined with a number of my colleagues from the northern and western suburbs in calling upon the Commonwealth government to ensure that a proper environmental impact appraisal takes place on this project. Much earlier, when the only project envisaged was the widening of the Tullamarine Freeway, we likewise called upon the Victorian government to carry out such an environmental impact assessment. There was an indication from the Premier that the proposal was being advertised as part of a planning scheme amendment and was being assessed in accordance with Victoria's Planning and Environment Act 1987. Of course, that process has been thrown out of the window because the City Link-through the City Link legislation-has been exempted from those environmental assessment procedures. My colleagues the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths), the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe), the honourable member for Jagajaga (Mr Staples), the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), Senator Kim Carr and Senator Barney Cooney and I are seeking an assurance that the Commonwealth-because the project will be looking for forms of taxation breaks-will look at the need for a proper environmental assessment. I urge the Commonwealth government to think very carefully before becoming in any way involved in this fiasco. Another roads matter I wish to touch upon in this appropriation debate has a direct impact on the electorate of Scullin. It is the proposed F2 freeway along Merri Creek to between the Western Ring Road and Craigiebum. The F2 freeway is simply the extension of the Hume Highway along a differellt alignment. As the Hume Highway is a declared national highway, any realignment of its route would become a concern of the federal government as it would form part of the national highways. Again, I think this is a project that we cannot hide from. The Commonwealth government has to recognise that it has a direct responsibility to ensure that this road is built with due consideration to all environmental matters. Organisations that have been concerned with the preservation of Merri Creek have contacted me. Their interest in this project has come about because the portion of the Western Ring Road between Mahoneys Road and Dalton Road is going through the planning stage. Whilst this is not a part of a national highway and not a Commonwealth responsibility, the two kilometres from Mahoneys Road to the end of the F2 freeway potentially could become declared national roads in that they join up with the national highway. Therefore, those organisations have been alerted that the Commonwealth may have an interest only because of that aspect. But, as I have indicated to them, this is not something that the Commonwealth can walk away from, because the overall F2 freeway project will be something that we have an interest in. The proposed alignment of the F2 freeway goes through three sensitive areas along Merri Creek: the first, just north of Mahoneys Road, is the proposed metropolitan park, which is based on a retarding basin in the Thomastown-Campbellfield area; the second, further north along the route of the freeway alignment, is a grasslands area of state significance in the vicinity of Cooper Street; and then the third, just south of Craigieburn and at the end of the reservation, is an area of grasslands of national significance. It is that third area that I wish to highlight. I believe that area is of sufficient concern that should necessitate the Commonwealth seeking the cooperation of the state government-and VicRoads is the authority that is involved in this project-in reassessing the alignment of the road and in carrying out a proper environmental impact of any new route that is envisaged. I also call upon the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) to ensure that ANCA, as the appropriate body, has sufficient funding made available to continue the purchase of this land. As I understand it, there are a number of species of remnant native grasslands that are important. But there are also two species that live in this habitat that are on the Endangered Species Protection Act; the plains wanderer and the striped legless lizard. I hope that both the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) and the minister for the environment will take a personal interest in this proposal for the F2 freeway. Whilst I do not envisage that it would gain a high priority at this point in time in our national highways program, now is the time when proper planning is being put in place to ensure that the road alignment is improved. I do not see the necessity of having a road alignment over a sevento eight-kilometre journey which crosses Merri Creek on three occasions. There is surely an alignment that is open for the road planners to ensure that the effect upon Merri Creek is minimised and that the grasslands that are affected by the present alignment are preserved and protected.",114
180,Mr ROCHER,COMMITTEES,"These three appropriation bills were introduced on 26 October. Appropriation Bill (No.3) 199596 authorises the Minister for Finance to issue an additional $836,356,000 from the consolidated revenue fund, in addition to funds appropriated by the Appropriation Act (No.1) 1995-96 for the annual services of government. This additional appropriation will be predominantly divided between the Departments of Defence; Employment, Education and Training; Social Security; and Treasury. According to the Bills Digest, most of these additional outlays will be due to wage rises under the Australian Public Service workplace agreement 1992-94 and the 1995-96 APS enterprise agreement. The original government strategy for enterprise bargaining in the Australian Public Service entailed a service wide agreement, followed by agency agreements. These agency agreements were supposed to set out goals for productivity improvements and corresponding wage rises as the goals were met. This raised the prospect of public servants at the same designation and increment in different agencies receiving different rates of pay-I might add by way of digression that there are shades of Weipa and CRA in all of this. The base rates would remain the same across the APS, but wages were to be topped up in those that met their goals. This makes pretty good sense where all agencies start from the same level of productivity and all are capable of improving productivity. However, the truth is that departments such as Social Security had less scope for productivity gains because it had already undertaken widespread reform and productivity improvements in the 1980s; whereas departments such as Employment, Education and Training had just embarked on the process of reform. The result was that certain departments, which had earlier been slow to embrace change, could afford to provide pay rises under the agency agreements, whereas those which had shown a longer commitment to increased productivity were less able to give their employees productivity related pay increases. Under agency agreements, a ceiling was placed on wage rises, with surplus gains going into an APS wide pool and shared out amongst all departments. That helped restore some equity, but it also rewarded those departments which did not even bother to formulate an agency agreement. Even the Department of Industrial Relations, which is supposed to provide advice on the formulation of agency agreements, only cobbled an agreement together for its own department at the very last moment-I have little doubt it only put that agreement together to avoid embarrassment at having none at all. What is of particular interest is that the government in the latest agreement has come to the realisation that a unified APS needs a uniform wage structure. The Australian Public Service needs to be made more efficient and certainly more effective. Increased ty and a reappraisal of functions are required, with the savings returned to the nation's taxpayers. Appropriation Bill (No.4) 1995-96 authorises the release of additional funds for proposed capital works and services and payments to the states and territories, most of which were first allocated funds under the Appropriation Act (No.2) 1995-96. This bill will authorise the payment of $800,000 to the Attorney-General's Department to pay the legal expenses of the Minister for Human Services and Health, the member for FremantIe (Dr Lawrence). These expenses, as so far explained by the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch), actually amount to approximately $700,000, of which $250,000 was used to attempt to stop the royal commission. Why should the taxpayers pay this bill? The incidents for which Minister Lawrence was hauled before the Marks royal commission had nothing to do with her role as a Commonwealth minister. They had nothing to do with her being a member of the House of Representatives, as was argued in the chamber only yesterday during a dissent motion to the Speaker's ruling. They relate to an earlier period of her political career when, as Premier of Western Australia, she used a petition of last resort as a political tool against Richard Court, the then opposition leader. Should the Australian taxpayer have to foot the bill for the minister's representation at the commission? That is the first question. Arguably, maybe. I think there is a case to be made for that. But should the Australian taxpayer have to foot the bill for attempts by the minister to stop, stifle, or otherwise derail the commission before it even got going? In that case my answer is obviously, beyond any doubt, no. Why should the Australian people pay the legal bills of the Minister for Human Services and Health with or without the fact that she was found by Commissioner Marks to have acted improperly and, indeed, worse. The West Australian newspaper got it right with its headline on 15 November which said, 'She lied.' No amount of ducking and weaving by Minister Lawrence will change the finding of productivithe Marks commission. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) defends the member for FremantIe. He attacks the royal commissioner and his terms of reference, yet with every attack he further weakens the standards of behaviour expected of members and senators. No previous Prime Minister would have tolerated the behaviour of the Minister for Human Services and Health in his ministry. The Prime Minister can only defend the member for Fremantle because, for him, everything goes in politics; nothing is unacceptable. His logic is akin to that of Lenin.",118
181,Mr KERR,COMMITTEES,"On a point of order: whilst in these budget debates there is enormous latitude granted to members, I think the standing orders ought to be observed in the sense that a matter arising whereby a personal attack on another member is being made ought to be made by a formal motion. I think there should be some limit. The debate, as far as it goes",119
182,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,Mr Snow)The member for Curtin is speaking on a matter involving expenditure and he is in order.,119
183,Mr ROCHER,COMMITTEES,"The result is everything to this Prime Minister. All means are legitimately able to be used; anything and anybody is expendable in achieving his desired result. This eventually develops into a disregard for the rights and interests of average citizens who are only the tools in the Prime Minister's pursuit of ever greater power. The Australian equivalent of Bonaparte believes himself and his ministers are above the rules of proper conduct. He will learn the hard way that this is not the case. The credibility of the minister for health is akin to that of the boy who cried wolf. Is anything that this minister says now and in the future believable? I think not. I remember clearly in June 1994 when the minister for health, referring to a possible increase in the Medicare levy, stated: There is no proposal to increase the levy and there won't be. Both the Prime Minister and myself have repeatedly ruled out any increase. She also went on to say that a rise in the levy was more likely under the coalition's policies. Of course, the government then went out and did exactly what she said they would not do and increased the Medicare levy. The minister's record in Western Australia in relation to WA Inc. is also a disgrace. Her performance in the federal parliament has been as consistent as her efforts in Western Australia. In 1992, when still Premier, the minister for health decried the fact that Western Australia received too many tied grants from the Commonwealth. When the Prime Minister suggested that the states could possibly have greater flexibility, so long as the Commonwealth could monitor the states programs, the minister for health, then Premier of Western Australia, said: I have always found that a touch insulting to be honest. The states are required to account for their expenditure to their parliaments and voters. I don't think if money is given to the states that it is, sense, any of the Commonwealth's business. Amen to that. However, by June 1994 the minister had somehow come to believe that it is the Commonwealth's business. When pushed by the states for greater freedom with health grants, the minister said: History shows you cannot trust the states with health funding. Just handing over large sums of money with no strings attached and no penalties for failure to perform would be a betrayal of the Australian community. It's clear that it is not an option that could be endorsed by the Commonwealth. The fact is that the member for Fremantle dissembled then and has yet to modify her ways. She should have taken the honourable course of action and resigned from the ministry months ago but, sparing that, the Prime Minister should have sacked her. This bill also includes a payment of $32 million to the New South Wales government for the redevelopment of the Sydney showground site to facilitate the establishment of the Fox film studio and the development of a new showground at Homebush. Of this $32 million, $7 million is to be used for the redevelopment of the present showground site. It is understandable that certain improvements to the showground site, such as improving gas and water connections, need to be made before Fox can move in, yet it is not clear at all to me what this has to do with the Commonwealth government. The Premier of New South Wales has stated that the deal with Fox will save taxpayers money. The federal parliament should not pay the New South Wales government money for the Fox studios. It is as simple as that. If the New South Wales government does not want to pay the additional $7 million, there are certainly plenty of other states that want the Fox studio and will pay to get it. Mr Egan, the New South Wales Treasurer, has already said that he can plug any funding gap. He can find the $7 million. This begs the question: why is the Commonwealth delivering these funds which are clearly not needed? It seems to be simple. Our Prime Minister foresees problems in marginal New South Wales seats. That can be the only reasonable explanation. He wants in a new movie studios, he wants world class arts facilities, he wants great architecture, and he wants it all in Sydney-except when he wants them in Tokyo or Berlin. Sydney is everything to our Prime Minister and he wants all Australians to pay for it. What sort of Prime Minister gets bogged down in argument with a New South Wales state government because he wants that government to move the Cahill Expressway and a railway line from Circular Quay? The Prime Minister should realise that he is not the Prime Minister of Sydney and, as such, has wider federal responsibilities, which include a faltering economy. This is an interesting case study of our Prime Minister's imperial delusions and of how the New South Wales Right is prepared to look after its own to the detriment of the overall national interest. If he has a cool $7 million to spare for the arts, why not make it available to them up front rather than subsidise the New South Wales government by the back door? The Prime Minister and his government need to focus on the real issues, not the trivial. What is the current position in our great nation? We had an illusory budget surplus of $718 million, which was nothing more than a public relations trick to fool the public into believing that the government had finally become serious and capable about national saving and the public contribution to national saving. In the back of the budget papers, the real underlying structural budget deficit showed the excess of spending over revenue was actually just over $8 billion. This deceit by Labor was bad enough, yet the way things are currently looking there is no way that Labor can deliver even its illusory budget surplus. Labor has failed so far to meet its privatisation timetable. In some ways, it is an Irish privatisation timetable when we consider not only that the Australian Industry Development Corporation has not been privati sed but also that the government has increased the capital of the AIDC to the tune of $200 million. That is reverse privatisation, and very expensive too. There have been budget blowouts everywhere, with backdowns on some tax measures, failed privatisations and commitments to increased expenditures across many areas. Des Moore of the Institute of Public Affairs actually believes the deficit for 1995-96 will now be about $1 billion. It goes without saying that this is a significant reversal on what the government stated it would try to achieve at budget time. However, it also throws into serious doubt the projections for the next few years during which the government claimed to have the capacity to further increase the size of that illusory surplus. As Des Moore said in the Financial Review of 20 November: More generally, this blowout significantly detracts from the credibility of the government's forward estimates beyond 1995-96. Those estimates provided for an annual current account surplus of around 0.5 per cent of GDP. That was always too small a contribution to saving by the Commonwealth. But what price now on there being any contribution at all? Mr Des Moore leaves his article with that question-highly pertinent, but totally without answer by Labor, which should be severely embarrassed by its lack of fiscal discipline. This situation must surely be related to the coming election. Of great concern is the similarity of this government in the junking of its fiscal policy to that of the Kirner government in Victoria immediately before its demise. It is amazing how the smell of an imminent election campaign can so quickly cause a Labor government to abandon responsible acts. We are also witnessing an increase in the rate of unemployment, which is to be deplored. It is now nationally at around 8.7 per cent. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) crows about job growth over the past two years, yet the facts speak for themselves. Unemployment is not coming down and will probably increase again. The government's response to unemployment is this Working Nation nonsense. That is a sham. Even the Department of Finance has apparently evaluated the performance of Working Nation and found it to be a wanton waste of taxpayers' funds. It is nothing more than a public relations gimmick. As the member for Pearce (Mrs Moylan) said earlier today in the discussion of a matter of public importance, to get the unemployed into training programs and have them come out still unemployed only affects the figures, the statistics. The greatest benefit for Working Nation claimed by the minister is the reduction in the number of long-term unemployed. The real rate of long-term unemployment is not much different today than it was 12 months ago. Make no mistake. If you move long-term unemployed into training programs and subsequently back on to the unemployment benefit, they are still long-term unemployed. It is interesting to note that New Zealand, our often much-maligned trans-Tasman neighbour, has an unemployment rate of around 6.1 per cent. New Zealand did not require a nonsense program like Working Nation. They have achieved rapid job growth by reforming the industrial relations system and putting in place policies to encourage faster economic growth. New Zealand has done this while keeping inflation in check at around two per cent. Australia has lower than expected economic growth, rising inflation---currently running 5.1 per cent-emerging wage pressures, a dismal balance of payments record and some of the highest real interest rates in the OECD. And this government claims it is doing a good job. They can claim all they like that black is white, but the electorate understands Labor's deceitful practices and will judge them by what they do-not by what they say.",119
184,Mr HOLDING,COMMITTEES,"I desire to join this debate to endorse some of the comments and adopt some of the positions taken previously in the debate by my colleague the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins). I begin by saying that all my life I have been a resident of Melbourne and a proud member of that community. I served in the Victorian parliament for many years. I am deeply concerned about the future of my city and my community. I am concerned at the abuse of parliamentary process, the total erosion of the principles the Westminster system which, despite complaints from members of the oppositionthank God-still operate in this House. I am ashamed of some of my parliamentary colleagues opposite who, like me, are Melburnians but berate the government day after day in this place and tum their backs because they do not want to see or they do not want to know or they simply choose to ignore what is going on, not merely in their own state but in their own electorates. What occurred in the Victorian parliament last fortnight has got to be a matter of deep concern to all Victorian parliamentarians, or federal parliamentarians who come from Victoria, in terms of the use of parliamentary majorities in both houses of parliament to impose a tax burden on the people of Victoria for a period of 34 years in respect of the City Link project, a project about which the opposition in the parliament, after a very short briefing, provided the government with 76 questions that go to the whole structure and nature of that relationship. As the parliament gets up, something like 18 have been answered. Ministers made statements in the parliament a fortnight ago to repudiate their own statements and to indicate that they either did not know all the facts or they lied. What we have operating in my state, to the at deep and profound regret of its citizens, is a political process which ought to be a matter of deep shame to every member of the coalition and a matter of deep shame to anybody who believes in parliamentary democracy. We often take parliamentary democracy for granted, but the reality is that the fundamental nature of our institution is that those who are elected to govern have a responsibility not merely to the people who have voted for them as a political party but to the broad community. They exercise a trust in terms of the traditions of that parliament and if they are going to embark upon major areas of expenditure, if they are going to embark upon something which will impose a toll on every road user in the state-an increasing toll for a period of over 30 years-I think they have a duty to the community, to their own supporters and to those who voted against them to explain the benefits, to explain the burdens, of and to indicate how it will all operate. There is also an interest in this parliament. When we are looking at the question of infrastructure in the states-and we are all Australians--one of the better developments under this government has been a commitment to provide funds to state governments to develop infrastructure, whether it is in road funding, in education, in hospital services or in the building of roads. Many of the finest roads that now exist in Victoria have been as a result of that initiative. How do we justify a situation where the government does not disclose fully the nature of the transactions that it has entered into with a private consortium, where it is limiting the size of some major roads, roads which were funded? I am talking about Footscray Road, which links the western suburbs with the city and with my own electorate. It was widened and reconstructed to increase the flow of traffic. Because of a private agreement it is now going to be narrowed in order to force users of that road onto a toll freeway. What is the logic and what is the justification? The member for Scullin has outlined many of the unanswered questions. In Victoria at present the duty of the government of the day---of any government-is to come clean and explain the details of its transactions. But what you do is ram legislation through the parliament because you have the numbers in both houses. Ministers have either lied or are not able to answer the questions that are put to them. When the legislation is through-and there is an ongoing financial commitment on behalf of Victorian taxpayers for up to 34 years-and you are asked for the detail of who is getting what, the answer is: 'You are not entitled to know; it is a matter of commercial-in-confidence. ' If ever there has been a subversion of the democratic process, if ever there has been an exercise where the electorate is treated with contempt, where private profit on behalf of the selective few who have the confidence of the Premier and his cronies is more important than the rights of citizens to know, it is in Victoria. No explanation is given. No justification is even attempted. My colleagues opposite in this House whose electorates are affected, whose constituents are affected, remain mute, silent. There are environmental issues involved. What is the point of the Commonwealth providing funds to the state of Victoria for infrastructures and road funding if the state of Victoria and the Premier of Victoria in an exercise of cosy complicity-the Transurban Corporation-can make a set of commercial deals which are going to affect the pocket of every Victorian citizen, and the details of which, if you can get them, have to be gouged out because they are commercial-inconfidence? This arrangement that has been made is going to affect small businesses in certain areas of Melbourne. It is going to affect those involved in the freight industry. It is going to involve the commercial life of our community. Let us look at some of the principles involved. First of all, you have an agreement that locks Victorians into tolls for a period of 34 years. Secondly, the Premier has made it perfectly clear that these arrangements can be extended virtually to any other road or any other freeway in any part of the state. What is the logic of narrowing a road to force transport to use a toll freeway except to enhance the profits of the operator of the freeway? This technology is going to finish up affecting other major highways throughout the state. Then there is built into this agreement a 4.5 per cent or higher inflation rate. That means that by the time City Link is finished you will not be paying $3 to use the tollway; you will be paying closer to $3.77. By the year 2000 that will go up to close to $6. One effect of this will be that motorists, in order to avoid the tollway, will then enter smaller suburban streets-streets where kids play, streets which are basically there for the use of local residents. It is a crazy situation-a very large sum of money over a period of time is going to be used to enhance the use of the motor car. At the same time the government of Victoria, which is hot to trot on the Grand Prix, knows that the only way it can handle the crowds which are likely to attend that function is by getting people to leave their cars in some cases some kilometres away from the actual site and encouraging them to use public transport. No detailed analysis has been made of this proposition. The Auditor-General has not examined it. The RACV, on the basis of what knowledge was available to it, has made an examination and has proven in surveys that what will happen is that it will force more and more motorists off the major arterial road into suburban back streets. What occurs if the Commonwealth decides, as I would hope at some stage it would, to provide finance to support the state of Victoria in building a rail link from Spencer Street station to Tullamarine airport? I am not talking about old technology; I am talking about perhaps systems like the Maglev fast train that operate in Germany. The fact is that, if people choose to use that link, as I think they would, there would be a drop in the usage of the existing freeway. The owner of Citylink would have to be compensated-and by whom? By the Victorian taxpayer. What kind of deal is that? The Victorian taxpayer is going to pay twice. The concept of the Commonwealth providing funds to assist in the development of infrastructure-and transport is a major part of it-is key to the future entire economic development of the state, especially Melbourne. What is the point of the Commonwealth doing that, if all you are doing is providing an additional tax burden on Victorian citizens? A major road, Toorak Road, is going to be affected. Part of it runs through my electorate and the major part of it runs through the electorate of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello). Do we hear him berating and ranting and talking about corruption? When it comes to his colleagues in Victoria he is mute even when the position of the local commissioners has been publicly misrepresented. When the parliament of Victoria was told they supported these concepts, it had to be denied, not by the elected councillors but by people put there by the Victorian government. This whole concept is not just a matter of states rights; it is a matter of people's rights. States do not have rights; they have obligations and duties. People have rights-and the people of Victoria have rights. In my view, it is the responsibility of the Commonwealth if it is going to put money into building up the infrastructure of the states; it is the duty of the minister for transport and the minister for conservation to ensure the integrity of the private deals made behind closed doors. The details are not available to the Victorian parliament, details which bind the average citizen, particularly those living on the outskirts of Melbourne, to having their hands in their pockets on a daily basis. It is the responsibility of federal ministers, who are prepared to make funds available to build infrastructures in the city, to see that the money they spend not only is properly spent but is not used or abused by its enabling the present government of Victoria to evade its responsibility to its citizens, to abuse the democratic processes of the parliament, and to keep the average Victorian in the dark while it makes its deals with private companies. Then, when pressed to provide information it uses a new and novel concept, 'We cannot say, because it is all business in confidence.' That means that private profit is more important than exercising its responsibility to the electors of the state of Victoria. I urge federal ministers-and there are a number of them involved-to examine this transaction very closely. I do not believe that it would withstand proper or effective examination. I adopt the arguments and concerns of my colleague the member for Scullin and I invite some of the gentlemen opposite, whose constituents are going to be affected by this, to at least stand up for what used to be oldtime liberal principles.

185,Mr WILLIAMS,COMMITTEES,"Tangney) (6.55 p.m.)The fact that Appropriation Bill (No.3), Appropriation Bill (No.4) and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) are on the Notice Paper gives me the opportunity to speak on a subject of concern to me. It is particularly relevant to the third bill mentioned, that relating to the parliamentary departments. The subject on which I wish to speak is the coalition's proposal for the establishment of a parliamentary treaties committee. The current interest in treaties which has existed for some time continues unabated. Only this week members of this House were circulated with a copy of a discussion paper produced by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry entitled Reforming Australia's treaty making processes. The ACCI, along with a number of other bodies, has had an interest in this subject and has made previous contributions to the public debate in the form of lengthy press releases during 1994. The interest in the making of treaties has been generated by concerns at their growing significance, particularly in so far as they have legislative importance within the country. It has also been generated by an apparent decline in the accountability of the executive in relation to the making of treaties; a decline in consultation by the executive with interest groups, including state and territory governments; and a declining involvement of the legislature, in particular this parliament, in their making. Those concerns have been expressed in a number of quarters and at a number of levels. One level of concern is on the international plane. It is feared by some that the commitment to international obligations involves a surrendering of national sovereignty. At another level, the plenary role of the executive in negotiating, signing and ratifying treaties to the exclusion of the legislature has raised another aspect of what has been referred to as the democratic deficit. That term was coined, I believe, by Sir Ninian Stephen in the Sir Earl Page Memorial Trust Lecture which he gave in September 1994. The critics refer to the non-accountability of the executive, which is under no formal obligation to consult state and territory governments, even as to matters within state and territory legislaon tive power, or to consult affected interest groups--or even to consult the public generally. Treaties do have an important effect. Those effccls are presently under close consideration. The traditional principle has been that, by entering into a treaty, Australia becomes obliged at international law to implement the terms of the treaty into domestic law but that, until the domestic legislation is enacted, the treaty is not part of the law of Australia or of any Australian state or territory. Traditionally, however, courts have regarded the terms of the treaty as relevant to the interpretation of a statute and have generally sought to construe a statute consistently with the terms of an unimplemented treaty. The recent response of the government, in the form of the introduction of the Administrative Decisions (Effect of International Instruments) Bill 1995, to the decision of the High Court in the case of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs v. Ah Hin Teoh shows that the role of treaties, like the process for making them, is being subjected to pressure for change. I do not propose to go into that subject. However, it is pertinent to mention that the report for 1994-95 of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission was tabled in this House today. In that report, the president of the commission, Sir Ronald Wilson, repeated the commission's grave concerns about the Teoh bill and its proposed limiting of the impact of treaties as signed by Australia but not enacted in domestic law and its particular impact upon several treaties which HREOC oversees. The concerns relate to the lack of consultation by the Commonwealth government with state and territory governments and interest groups. There is no formal procedure or mechanism for public consultation on treaties under consideration. Whether interest groups are consulted really depends upon the decision of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and any line or portfolio department involved in the negotiation. Since 1992, there have been procedures in place for reference to the standing committee treaties comprising senior Commonwealth, state and territory officers who meet twice a year. The functions of that committee, however, are quite limited and do not envisage public consultation. The committee is only a mechanism for the provision of information on treaty negotiations and implementation and a mechanism for facilitating state and territory involvement in negotiating delegations. It is not a body to which the substance or merits of a treaty proposal are referred. A disturbing aspect of the treaty making process is the increasing downgrading of the function of making treaties-a plenary function of the executive-within the executive. It has recently been highlighted that a treaty signed or ratified for Australia does not need the approval of cabinet. The present procedures involve the approval of only the Federal Executive Council, theoretically a body of higher rank but not a body to which the substance or merits of a treaty will be committed. The significance of treaties is such in the eyes of the government that the approval of cabinet is not always obtained. It is treated as adequate that the Executive Council is simply assured, in the absence of cabinet approval, that the matters concerned fall within the scope of existing policy, that all relevant ministers have agreed to it and that the Prime Minister has agreed to or been informed of the action proposed. Since 1990, it appears that less than one-quarter of treaties to which Australia has become a party have been deemed to have required cabinet approval for final consent. When it comes to parliamentary involvement, the situation is even more bleak. The Commonwealth parliament has no constitutional role or otherwise in relation to the approval, signing or ratification of treaties. The only role of any real significance is that it implements treaty obligations domestically by passing legislation. In principle, this is a subsidiary role. The substance of the domestic legislation required to implement the treaty is determined by the substance of the treaty obligations. They are a fait accompli when the matter comes before this parliament. All the parliament can do is, in effect, determine the form of the legislation in which the substantive obligations will be dealt with. For at least 13 years, treaties have been referred to this parliament only by being tabled in batches every six months. They are now tabled under a deemed tabling procedure, which means that they do not get physically tabled. They are treated as tabled by being delivered to the Clerk. The only record that appears of the tabling is what appears in the Votes and Proceedings the following day. For some considerable time, there have been calls for a greater role for parliament in the treaty making process. Those calls have come from a diverse range of persons and bodies. They include members of the Constitutional Commission, which reported in 1988, and a variety of peak industry bodies, including the ACCI. Sir Ninian Stephen has made a plea, as has Justice Michael Kirby. The numerous participants at a conference conducted by the Constitutional Centenary Foundation in May on 'Australian governance in a global society' unanimously called for a role for the parliament in relation to the approval of treaties. The coalition has had its proposals for reform of the treaty making processes on the table for some time. They were outlined by the then Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), in October last year. The particular initiatives include the preparation of cost benefit analyses for the benefit of parliament in relation to each treaty prior to its ratification; the tabling of treaties in parliament with a provision for debate prior to ratification; the establishment of a treaties council as part of the Council of Australian Governments, or COAG; the enactment of domestic legislation prior to ratification; and the establishment of a parliamentary treaties committee. I commented on the proposal to establish the parliamentary treaties committee in a speech I delivered on the grievance debate on 23 October. I explained in that speech the nature of the proposal as I see it. I now want to add some further comments. In offering those comments, I seek to anticipate some possible criticisms of the coalition proposal and offer answers to them. One likely criticism is that there are already too many parliamentary committees and to create another committee fur treaties would add to the burden. It is true that there are quite a number of parliamentary committees, but there are many more in the Senate than in this House. What is proposed is a joint committee, and there are presently only 12 of them. The principal answer, however, is not that the number of joint committees is not that large. The principal answer is that the subject of treaties is very important and justifies the attention of a parliamentary committee. Given the significance of treaties for domestic legislation-making a treaty is commonly, although not always, a step in the legislative process-the involvement of both houses is warranted. A question which would have to be addressed in relation to a committee at some stage is what, for the purposes of the role that committee, constitutes a treaty. There is quite a range of international bilateral, plurilateral and multilateral agreements. Many international agreements emanate in different forms from multilateral organisations of which Australia is a member. There is really no need for a narrow definition for the terms of reference of the committee, but it would probably need to be defined, at least broadly, for the benefit of the departments which would be involved in reporting to the committee. The committee itself could learn from its own experience in dealing with the range of diverse forms of international agreement. It is relevant to the role of the proposed committee that Australia becomes a party by signature, ratification or other process to literally scores of treaties each year. Many take years to negotiate and they go through many drafts in their gestation. Given their number, it would be appropriate for the parliamentary treaties committee to review a treaty at the latest stage possible, preferably immediately before signature, or after signature and before ratification. That would eliminate a review of the many drafts through which some treaties go. However. that should not prevent the committee of its own initiative from examining a draft at an earlier stage. This could be particularly appropriate where international participants appear to be taking the draft terms of a treaty in directions not appropriate or palatable to Australia or its interests. Given the large number of treaties under consideration at any given time and the diversity of subject matter. a parliamentary treaties committee would need to give close consideration to what it should examine in relation to each treaty. It could then attempt to regularise the procedures it employs. Some aspects would be common to different types of treaties and could be examined as a matter of course. Identification of those aspects would enable the committee to begin the process of developing a set of principles and guidelines for its own reference. or even a charter to guide the scrutiny. Other committees have done this, particular examples that can be offered are the Senate Standing Comof mittee on Regulations and Ordinances and the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. It is accepted that those committees have much simpler tasks than a treaties committee would have, but the principles are the same. If guidelines, as I suggest, were developed, the secretariat of the committee would be able to do standard reports on treaties which are regularly made with different parties on the same or similar subject matter--extradition treaties might be such a category, as might reciprocal tax treaties. The upshot of the development of guidelines could in due course be that the parliamentary treaties committee secretariat would do regular reports raising no concerns on which the committee itself would need only to note. A similar procedure could be utilised in relation to the numerous protocols or agreements which amend principal treaties or international agreements. In many cases the amendment is minor and could be dealt with simply by a short report from the secretariat. Among the coalition reform proposals is one that a cost benefit analysis be prepared for each treaty under consideration for adherence by Australia. The committee would provide a useful reference point for the examination of the analyses. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade would have at least a coordinating role in relation to the preparation of such analyses. but in many cases the preparation of it would be the function of a line department or a portfolio department. With experience. the committee could develop, again, principles or guidelines for the scrutiny of the analyses. therehy assisting the departments in the preparation of them. The coalition proposal envisages that the parliamentary treaties committee would examine whether legislation would be necessary in order to implement a treaty. This would be a very important role. The assertion is regularly made by the government-and in this case DFAT publications are relevantthat legislation is always put in place before a treaty is ratified. I personally regard that as a false assertion, at least at present. It could become fact, or at least could have a greater element of truth, if there were a parliamentary treaties committee which had a responsibility for examining whether legislation was necessary. If it were necessary, it could examine whether it already existed or was about to be put in place. For a variety of reasons, legislation to implement a treaty may in fact not be necessary. This could be because the obligations undertaken by Australia in the treaty could be met either within the country or overseas by the executive without the need for legislative authority. Examples in this respect might be treaties on defence cooperation or on the provision of aid to developing countries. In other cases, there will already be state laws in place which will be adequate for the purpose. This occurs in relation to a number of International Labour Organisation conventions to which Australia has adhered. In other cases, existing legislation will whatever purpose is required. In this respect extradition legislation would be already in place. But it is important that the question be asked independently, and particularly on behalf of the legislature in relation to each treaty, whether legislation is necessary and, if it is, whether it has been enacted. This could prevent precipitate ratification of treaties before the nature of the legislation required was identified, as occurred, for example, in relation to the adherence to ILO convention No. 158. It would also help in the adoption of a cooperative federalist approach to the making of treaties in which the Commonwealth does not need to override the states using the external affairs power but would cooperate with the states in putting appropriate state legislation on the books. Special mention should be made of the role of state and territory governments. A parliamentary treaties committee, as envisaged under coalition proposals, would not focus on state and territory issues as they would be dealt with under the proposed treaty council, the establishment of which is also recommended in the coalition treaty proposals. A parliamentary treaties committee would enable this parliament to fulfil its proper role in relation to the making of treaties, and in particular to focus on whether or not legislation is necessary to implement obligations undertaken or about to be undertaken on behalf of Australia. (Time expired)  to respond to the thoughtful contribution of the honourable for Tangney (Mr Williams). From my perspective, I am always a supporter of wanting to make the legislature, particularly this House, more relevant and more real to the operations of Australia. Therefore, as a democrat, I actually support that there should be a treaties committee of the parliament. Let me be quite frank and say that, whilst I do not ascribe the motives to the honourable member for Tangney, there is some concern on this side of the House that the proposed treaties committee is really a device for opposing treaties rather than having a more constructive role of examining treaties. I would also like to draw to the attention of the House serve that the Joint Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee in its peacekeeping report suggested, for example, that it should be a function of the legislature to approve peacekeeping undertakings by the government. I regret that was one of the recommendations of the committee that was rejected by the government in its response. I still assert that it is a proper role for parliament to approve the deployment of peacekeeping troops or police or whatever-a particular response Australia has been called upon to make in the trouble spots of the world. I apologise to the honourable member for Tangney for not understanding the treaties committee's role in response to defence cooperation, although I certainly believe it is quite appropriate for activities under defence cooperation to be reviewed by the parliament, and also his comments about aid. Perhaps I will have a chance later to catch up with him and get a fuller and better understanding of that. It was a matter of considerable disappointment to me that a request to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) that members of parliament actually go to the recent landmines conference and participate was declined. I found it extraordinarily ironic that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade had actually made provisions for members of parliament to be part of the Australian delegation but that no money was forthcoming to facilitate that. I would argue that members of parliament, as they generally do when they operate in such situations, do bring a very strong bipartisan approach to such deliberations and can make a very constructive and practical contribution to the delegation. I would suggest to the honourable member for Tangney that it is also important that not only the committee be domiciled in the parliament but also from time to time it is appropriate for representatives to actually be at the negotiations. The honourable member for Tangney, unlike his opposition colleagues, did not refer to the opposition amendment to the appropriation for the Attorney-General's Department, which is to decline federal funding to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) for her representation at the Marks royal commission. I found it really ironic listening to many of the contributions. This royal commission brings up from a number of perspectives an interesting principle-that is, to what extent people are accountable for what they mayor may not have done at another level of government. Clearly, there is no criminality; there is no maladministration. Nothing was done that could bring the minister before the courts. However, she was subject to a royal commission. Carmen Lawrence was the Premier of Western Australia, which is a very high position. Prior to my election to this place, I occupied much more modest positions as an alderman on Blacktown City Council and as deputy mayor of Blacktown City Council. If in some way I had inadvertently misinformed some people about some rate paying action, does that mean that I am accountable for that as a federal member? Does that somehow call into question my fitness to discharge my duties of office? If we start this principle, where do we stop? I think it is a very dangerous principle. We really need to put on the Hansard record why the opposition and the Court government are interested in this royal commission. Carmen Lawrence proved to be an outstanding Premier and she has proved to be an outstanding minister in a federal government. If Carmen Lawrence had retired from state parliament, if she had not pursued the position of Leader of the Opposition and chose to stand down, does any member of this House believe that there would have been a royal commission? Absolutely not. This royal commission was concocted for three reasons. The first is that Carmen Lawrence, as a woman, had the temerity not only to be an outstanding minister for health but also to be amongst those considered for future leadership of this party. That seems to have caused offence. I was really startled by the response of my electorate. I did not put out anything locally. But, spontaneously, ordinary people have rung up my office and said, 'Look, the actions of the opposition in blocking the payment of the $243,537 for legal expenses is rubbish. We don't believe it is proper. We have absolute sympathy with Carmen Lawrence. If there's going to be an appeal, will you put $10 down for me and $20 down for my mother-in-law?' That has never happened to me before. My electorate is made up of great people, but they are not on fancy salaries. I am not misleading the House in any way in saying that this has been a spontaneous response. If the opposition are trying to say, 'Look, we're somehow scoring points,' they are missing the point. A lot of ordinary people and particularly women are taking great offence to this. They know that this royal commission was trumped up. It is not about maladministration, it is not about corruption; it is about a petition that was put to parliament. As a serving member on the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues, I do not agree with the suppression of names under legislation, which is the way the current act is framed. But this royal commission did not investigate Premier Court's role as Leader of the Opposition in raising questions about the marriage of Penny Easton and the income of Penny Easton's husband. None of that was in the royal commission. I take great offence to the posturing of opposition members because there is a clear case of criminality in Western Australia; there is a clear case of proven corruption in Western Australia. This has caused two members of the federal Liberal Party to withdraw from that party and sit as Independents in this House. Has one opposition member said, 'We ought to have a royal commission?' The honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing), one of those Independents, says, 'I want a full judicial inquiry; the Liberal Party has to fix up its own act.' But have you ever heard the Leader of the Opposition, John Howard, who connived in and concocted the Marks royal commission, say, 'This is a matter where we do not have clean hands; it needs to be exorcised, it needs to be investigated and the cancer cut out?' There is one very effective way to do it: by having a royal commission and identifying criminally corrupt members of the Liberal Party in Western Australia-a member of the state parliament in Western Australia. This corruption goes as far as the state Attorney-General, her husband and campaign funds. They have not asked for any of this. Apparently, this is acceptable Liberal Party behaviour. Of course, the Mayor of Wanneroo, currently in gaol, a Liberal, a known associate of Crichton-Browne, a known numbers man and fixer in the federal electorate of Moore, wants to give evidence. He would prefer to give it to a full judicial inquiry or a royal commission. That has not been granted. We only have to witness some of the questions by the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) about the Marks royal commission and about Carmen Lawrence. Has he supported the call of his National Party colleague in Western Australia, Hendy Cowan, for a full inquiry? Has he raised the issue of this cancer, this corruption, this criminality, in this House? Of course not. Mr Deputy Speaker, I have great faith in ordinary people. Sometimes they get fooled but you cannot fool them all the time. They can see through the sham of the Marks royal commission, which was designed to get Carmen Lawrence, a prominent female minister in the federal cabinet, someone who legitimately was seen as having a call on future leadership positions, not because of any illegal act that she performed or for illegally taking money, as the state Attorney-General did-tainted campaign funds. It was not that she was involved in a Liberal controlled council in Western Australia, riddled with corruption. It was all about a petition that any member of parliament, be they a federal or a state member of parliament, is required to table, whether they agree with it or disagree with it. I have to say honestly to this House that on occasions I have had petitions tabled with which I totally and publicly disagree. But, as a federal member of parliament, I have a responsibility, I thinkMr Cleary-Would you have cheerfully tabled that Halden one?",124

187,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMITTEES,"Ignore the interjections.  honourable member came into the House, that I do not agree with the current act in relation to family law. I believe the Family Court should be like any other court-if you want to suppress names, you should make a petition to the judge and he decides the case on the merits. I have said: isn't it a pity that the Marks royal commission never investigated the role of the then state Leader of the Opposition in the questions that he raised? Let me answer the question the honourable member has posed. If I have a petition presented to me by a constituent or a number of constituents, I believe I am duty bound to table it, whether I agree or disagree with it. Also, I have great difficulty in responding to precisely what my recollection would be of three years ago. I do not keep a detailed diary. NA",130

189,Mr ATKINSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Isaacs) (7.30 p.m.}-I am pleased to advise that this year's Isaacs electorate environment essay competition was the most successful to date. The competition was launched on 5 June, world environment day. Its aim was to promote the importance of the environment to children. This year's competition received hundreds of entries from primary schools throughout the electorate of Isaacs. I am delighted that a number of environmental organisations in my electorate were actively involved as judges of the competition. Ms Mara Hayler, from the MordiallocBeaumaris Conservation League, and Mrs Dorothy Meadows, from Edithvale-Seaford Wetlands Inc., have been judging the competition now for three years. I am very grateful for their support and diligence. I was especially pleased that Mr Ron Pearson, from the Friends of Braeside Park, Ms Kathy Speakman, from the Aspendale Gardens Residents Association, and Mr Stephen Calvert-Smith, from the Friends of Bradshaw Park, accepted my invitation to act as judges in this year's competition. The theme of this year's competition was linked to the theme of this year's world environment day: 'I can do that!' Federal, state and territory governments chose this theme to emphasise that personal action is indeed an important part of preserving Australia's unique environment. The winner of the competition was Rikki-Lee Chivers of Rangebank Primary School in Cranbourne. Rikki's poem, entitled 'Rubbish', attracted the support of all judges and reads as follows: Rubbish, rubbish everywhere. I ask myself does anyone care? It lies there silent on the ground Asking us to be found. On windy days it blows about, and Sometimes I just want to shout, Pick it up you lazy thing And put it in the rubbish bin. If we recycle paper and plastic That would be just fantastic. Don't forget your glass things too For this is what we need to do. So at shopping centres, school and home You must make sure that things aren't thrown. Please watch out for sons and daughters As they may pollute our Aussie waters Because we don't want animals to choke Don't let loose your cans of Coke! So please remember everything And put your rubbish in the bin! I am sure members would agree with me that the sentiments expressed in Rikki' s poem are admirable and suggest a course of action which all Australians should remember. It is crucial that we do not forget that the urban environment is just as significant as other environmental issues. The problems of the urban environment are substantial. With the support of all Australians we can address these problems. I congratulate the students for their entries in this year's competition and hope that it has been a reinforcement to them that individuals can indeed make a positive impact on the state of our environment. Industrial Relations",131
190,Mr SWAN,ADJOURNMENT,"To many working Australians reading the headlines of recent days, the Weipa dispute might have seemed to be an affair that was a long way away-something happening in an isolated mining town or the back of Cape York with no immediate relevance to themselves. But what has been at stake affects not only workers, who were game enough to put themselves on the line against one of the biggest companies in Australia, part of which I think is one of the largest mining conglomerates in the world. Behind this dispute is the central question of the right of ordinary Australians working in their jobs to collectively organise together to protect and advance their wages and conditions so they can maintain their living standards. The choice, to put it starkly, is between a take it or leave it world-'sign here or no job'-and the Australian traditions of arbitration, negotiation and a fair go. What is at stake here is the capacity of a worker to protect his or her living standards against the might of corporate power. What is at stake here is the capacity to bargain with strength to protect those conditions-like overtime, penalty rates and sick leave-that enable a family to make ends meet. Historically, this has been achieved in Australia through the award system, which is built around conciliation and arbitration and founded on the capacity of workers to negotiate collectively as equals with their employers. More recently it has been done through enterprise bargaining based on an updated award system. Australians must understand that this dispute goes to the core of their capacity to maintain and individually influence their Ii ving standards into the 21 st century. The company is trying to destroy awards and enterprise bargaining based on the safety net of up-to-date awards protected by an independent referee. It wants a world of individual contracts and when the work force is all signed up to individual contracts the award will be destroyed and workers will have to face the future without the security of awards and unions or a referee. I said in the House on 16 November last year: CRA ... wants to ensure that bargains are onesided affairs, putting the might of the company against each individual worker. It wants to tively bind and gag its work force by ensuring each individually negotiated contract, in terms of the long-term outcomes, is akin to a boxing between an Australian heavyweight champion and a first-time bantamweight. In such a context there can never be a fair contest let alone a bargain involving negotiation. There can be no negotiation or bargaining in the circumstances that CRA is seeking to impose upon its work force. Last year when I made that speech I was talking about not only Weipa but also Bell Bay. I also outlined the history of CRA's attacks on awards and the vicious and un-Australian tactics used to undermine the whole of the industrial system, firstly in New Zealand and then at Bell Bay in Tasmania. Now it is Weipa. Here they pretend they are the workers' friend by appearing to be generous to one group of workers while viciously discriminating against those who understand the long-term importance of awards to their Australian living standards and their colleagues who have accepted contracts. Last year I warned that CRA's attitude would put at risk the significant productivity gains that we have had in recent years and the decade of industrial peace. That has proved to be the case. This week in the AIRC the company's strategy in relation to Weipa has been rejected like it was with Bell Bay. Listening to the statements from the company over the last 24 hours, you have to be sceptical that the company is going to change its ways. CRA will certainly be up to its same old tricks either at Weipa or elsewhere in the not too distant future. During the Weipa dispute CRA has boasted that new workers starting are choosing to freely sign contracts. That is like saying that the bank teller with a pistol pointed at his head is choosing of his own free will to hand over the money to a robber. It simply cannot be an even-handed negotiation. The new worker at Weipa is like one man against a whole football team. They have levelled the playing field all right so that the whole pack of forwards can run over him. The essence of a CRA type contract is that it provides for no negotiation. It is printed as no change, take it or leave it. Apply the techcollecnique outside of Weipa to, say, a nurse that seeking a job at one of the nursing home chains or a young shop assistant perhaps contest signing up at Coles Myer. The fact of the matter is that they do not have equal power to bargain. At Bell Bay and Weipa, Comalco was not interested in taking the path of enterprise bargaining that so many companies have gone along to build productivity in Australia. Right from the start such an option was ruled out. They went for confrontation and not collaboration. The sad thing is that it is not just CRA that wants to abolish the award system. It is also the intent of the Liberal and National parties in this House. They are content to work hand in hand with rogue companies like CRA to destroy the basis of our industrial relations system. That is precisely what Richard Court has been doing in Western Australia, what Jeff Kennett has been doing in Victoria and what the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) would do nationally if he were elected to power. They are absolutely and completely hostile to the award system and genuine enterprise bargaining based on negotiation and the collective involvement of unions. They want to rip away from ordinary workers safety and security in terms of living standards. (Time expired) Kennett Government: City Link",131
191,Mr CLEARY,ADJOURNMENT,"The member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) and the member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) have raised in the House tonight a very imponant issue-the disastrous Kennett City Link project. Transurban's decision to sponsor the grand prix was the last straw, really. Mr Abbott-Are you supporting it?",133
192,Mr CLEARY,ADJOURNMENT,"Wait for the punch line. If we thought there was something wrong with the project, this decision confirmed our worse suspicions. Quite frankly, the Kennett government must go. Members of the federal coalition know but cannot say that Kennett is their biggest problem. His bombastic cadet boy style and his arrogant contempt for any questions that fall off the lips of a docile media pack has even the most gentle people in a state of rage. What the member for Scullin and the member for Melbourne Ports did not say is that the state Labor opposition is not opposed to freeway widening or the imposition of regressive taxes, a petrol tax example, to fund such freeway building. What the member for Scullin, whom I respect, and the member for Melbourne Ports also did not say is that the City Link originatwho ed with the state ALP and, in its present form as Melbourne Access 2000, recommends new lanes north of Bell Street, extra lanes south Brunswick Road and the widening of the Tullamarine Freeway between Bell Street and Brunswick Road. As far as tolls are concerned, it is worth remembering that Bob Carr, despite all the pre-election claims, did not remove tolls from the M6 once he was elected. It is also worth noting that it has been argued that the ALP's freeway widening policy is substantially unfunded. Surprise, surprise! All of this is a matter for concern. Melbourne Access 2000 claims to 'seek to foster the long-term development of transport access in inner Melbourne in an environmentally sustainable way'. If the ALP wants to be environmentally sound, it should not be widening freeways, a la Jeff Kennett; it should be comprehensively developing public transport. But, of course, it was Peter Batchelor, the ALP spokesperson on public transport; and his mates who wanted to close the Upfield railway line. It is also worth pointing out that at a recent meeting at the Brunswick Town Hall a member of the ALP claimed that he would resign from the party rather than support the ALP's Melbourne Access 2000. It is all very well for the state ALP to claim that it is interested in a mix of private and public transport when it did nothing to ensure the survival of the Upfield line and has refused point blank to discuss the federal government's involvement in this project. The federal government's complicity cannot be hidden. I do not care what Senator Kim Carr says about the matter, because he says basically nothing. I do not care how often he raises the question of environmental safeguards when he is running around Wills as duty senator. The facts are the federal government will provide massive tax breaks for infrastructure bonds raised to build City Link. The facts are that the minister responsible, the for Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), has not said a word about City Link. I have no axe to grind with the member for Scullin, but I cannot say the same for those great decei vers are running around Melbourne obfuscating the federal government's involvement. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of for Transport, the member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe), well knows that I raised this issue with him in February this year and have continued to raise it. What we need to know, however, is exactly what is the federal government's position. As far as I can decipher, the parliamentary secretary is saying that, as long as the City Link does not discriminate against a rapid light rail link to Tullamarine, tax concessions will be granted. If this is true, then as long as the state government allows for a rapid link to the airport the government will cheerfully fund what I understand the member for Scullin and the member for Melbourne Ports regard as a disastrous project. The facts are, however, that we in the north do not want any freeway widening, rapid rail link or not. To focus on the processes and the toll is a convenient way of ignoring the bigger issue: that is, just what kind of public transport system we want and just what the state ALP is proposing. But the point is: everyone here says that this City Link is anti-competitive. If it is anti-competitive, the federal government cannot give it a tax break. So the facts are that this cannot receive tax concessions for infrastructure bonds. So I am happy-the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) would appreciate this-and I am smiling now, because I can leave the place knowing that City Link will not be built. The ALP have told me that it is anticompetitive and, if it is anti-competitive, it cannot receive any tax concessions from the Treasurer (Mr Willis). So I will sit down delighted that there will be no City Link in Melbourne, and I can put out a press release because I trust what the member for Melbourne Ports said and what the member for Scullin said today. I regard them as honourable men. I am really happy there will be no City Link because it is anti-competitive. Newsagents",133
193,Mr DODD,ADJOURNMENT,"I want to take the opportunity of the adjournment debate to make my contribution to the debate regarding news agents and competition policy. This matter, of course, was debated in the House on Monday through a motion moved by the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Atkinson). I was scheduled to speak in that debate, but my plane was delayed. The honourable member commenced his contribution to the debate by stating his hope that the debate would be bipartisan, and that certainly was the case, and I add my support to the thrust of his motion. All the arguments put in the debate were particularly cogent for remote areas like Cairns and Far North Queensland, the areas that I represent in this House. The maintenance of a relatively inexpensive system of home delivery for newspapers in areas where broadacre blocks predominate is essential to communication and information in regional centres. The argument, of course, applies as well to people who are disabled and the elderly. In my view, the current arrangements are clearly in the public benefit. Just as important are the current arrangements which allow news agents to cover the full range of magazines and overseas publications that may not have a large demand in small retail markets. This provides consumers in areas like Cairns and remote areas of my electorate-Weipa, Thursday Island, Cooktown, Mossman, Gordonvale and Babinda-with a wide range of magazines on areas such as the arts, crafts, hobbies, current affairs and sports which would not be available without the current arrangements. It is stating the obvious that supermarkets, petrol stations and convenience stores will not, both for economic reasons and even for space reasons, carry the wide range of publications today available in newsagents allover Australia. If you live in a capital city, no doubt you could seek out some of these specialist magazines in specialist stores, but that does not apply to regions like Cairns-let alone the smaller townships that I mentioned earlier. To change this, in my view, is not in the public interest. I have spoken to newsagents in my electorate, and they are not afraid of change. They would welcome any outcome which increases competition while maintaining their current range of publications offered and the current afford ability of newspaper delivery. Because of the growth in Cairns, I know that they would not be afraid of fair competition as an impediment to their future growth. The basis of the new considerations of the matter by the new Australian Competition and Consumer Commission seems to be that somehow circumstances have materially changed or altered the public interest consideration. The argument runs along the lines that, with the emergence of pay TV and computer-based news, there will be some sort of total decline in newspaper consumption in the very near future. I would suggest that reports of the deaths of newspapers are very premature. Newspapers will, I believe, continue to be a major-if not the major-source of informed information and comment for the general public. Another argument is that somehow because general shopping habits have changed, evidenced by extended trading hours, newsagents have become less relevant. I have not noticed, as I travel around my electorate, people leaving their comer news agencies in droves. Magazines have to be, if you go into supermarkets, placed near the checkout, presumably to induce people to read them as they wait in the queues. This is the only way that they seem to be able to sell those magazines. In my view, this does not constitute a material change. People still use the local family news agent as a source of information in a wide range of areas. I think that this is totally in the public benefit, and I would suggest that any change would not be of assistance, both to Australia and, in particular, to remote areas. I certainly hope that the family business-that is, the local news agent-will remain providing the same range of publications and the same home delivery services for many years to come. Department of Social Security",134
194,Mr WAKELIN,ADJOURNMENT,"On 6 February 1995, I spoke in the adjournment debate, and I mentioned then the teleservice centre in my electorate and the concern that constituents were expressing to me. I will quote from that presentation: Telecentres were originally set up because the DSS found that any DSS officer with a computer could answer a query for a client from any area of the state. The DSS also found that if all telephone queries were directed to a dedicated telecentre it gave local staff more time to deal with people in the office and process their own paperwork. Then I went on to say-and this is the key point: However, the regions have paid a price for this. The telecentre may have given local staff more time, but it has meant a loss in customer service. Therefore, it was no surprise when the National Audit Office revealed today that a great inefficiency exists within the Department of Social Security-an inefficiency which could have easily been prevented with proper planning. When these services started in late 1992, the initial target was that a referral to an action officer should be one minute from the initial response in 98 per cent of cases. Failings in relation to this led the target figure to be dropped in 1994 to achieve the standard in 85 per cent of cases. The figure achieved in 1994-95 was, however, only 38 per cent. There we have it from the National Audit Office. Key findings in the report, apart from the fact that the costs had blown out from $40 million two years ago to $56 million in the 1994-95 year, indicate that there has been an inefficient use of resources as well as a great deterioration in service. The report talks about the inadequate planning and implementation, the lack of flexibility and the lack of integration within the service. In regional Australia, and particularly in my electorate of Grey, it is of particular concern not only because people have to wait up to 90 minutes on these telecentre services but because they are costly and a great inconvenience. The 140 people employed in the Adelaide telecentre, which got one of the most notable mentions in dispatches, really illustrate how we have gone down the track of centralisation. If we were to put some of these people back into the DSS regional offices in Port Pirie, Whyalla, Port Augusta, Port Lincoln and Ceduna and use them flexibly and sensibly, we would not only deliver a more cost-effective and efficient service but actually serve the local people much more effectively. If you were to talk to some of the staff within the regional offices you would very quickly come to that conclusion. I just say to the government: it is there on the record. The National Audit Office has presented it to you. It is time that we looked at delivering effective services to rural and regional areas, and the peak load should be recognised. There should be a more flexible approach and, above all, staff should be taken out of the metropolitan areas and put into the regional centres, providing much needed job opportunities. Australian Industry and Products",135
195,Mr LES SCOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to speak briefly about buying Australian made products and supporting Australian owned industries, which I know most people in this place are well aware of, and to refer to a particularly successful business in my electorate known as Paradise Food Industries Pty Ltd. Recently, the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Walker) visited my electorate of Oxley to launch the new Australian Made television advertising campaign. The venue for the launch of the campaign was the Paradise Food Industries factory at Carole Park in my electorate in the state of Queensland. This local company, which was established in 1986 by the Wong brothers-Tim, Danny and Ted-is one of a number of highly successful and innovative food manufacturing companies based in the electorate. Since its establishment in 1986, Paradise Food Industries has grown to become one of 'Queensland's biscuit kings', producing Cottage Cookies, Kidz Cookies, Snax, crackers and breakfast bars. The company is wholly Australian owned and provides employment for more than 200 people in the community. Annual turnover is more than $20 million and over the past three years Paradise Food Industries has achieved record sales growth of approximately 20 per cent a year. Given the performance of this local company and the fact that the Wong family were one of the original licensees under the Australian Made campaign in 1986, both the minister and I thought the company was a great example of what the Australian Made campaign is all about. I am sure a lot of members have seen on television the advertisements, which were launched that day, promoting Australian owned products. Paradise Food Industries, very much an Australian owned company, demonstrates the kind of imagination and commitment that is essential for companies of the future. It reflects the attitudes that build strong Australtries, Ian companies with the confidence and the vision to identify and explore new markets. There is little doubt that Paradise Food Industries has benefited from increased sales as a result of the Australian Made campaign. I offer them my congratulations for their efforts and the records that they have achieved. Research indicates that the campaign has created some 6,000 new jobs and boosted gross domestic product by approximately $300 million since it started in 1986. In this context it was great to see the Wong family making their facilities available for a campaign which has had such a positive impact not only in the local region but throughout the nation as a whole. The 'Australian Made' logo has struck a patriotic chord in a community which has seen many Australians purchase Australian made goods from Australian companies in an effort to fulfil their campaign's aims of creating jobs, reducing our trade deficit and boosting Australian business. I think it is fair to say that Paradise Food Industries and the Wong family are the epitome of what 'Australian Made' is all about. As outlined earlier in my comments, Paradise Food Industries is one of a number of food manufacturers which are actually located in my electorate and they have had the drive to expand out of the local market into the national marketplace and from there into the competitive international marketplace. We have seen some biscuit companies in Australia. A lot of people eat biscuits. Unfortunately, some companies have been purchased by overseas investors and their profits have gone off-shore. This particular company, Paradise Food Industries, is really doing a great job. It certainly makes you more conscious when you go into the shopping centres and look at the various products. I do take the opportunity from time to time to go shopping with my wife for that very reason-to keep in touch with the prices and things like that. My wife does not particularly like me doing it because she reckons I buy all the wrong things. It certainly made me rather conscious of this local business, Paradise Food Induswhen I saw their products on the shelves and became very conscious of that company. Perhaps we need to become more aware of the value of buying Australian and making sure that those particular items are marked on the shelves in our stores. I offer my congratulations to the Wong family and to all the employees at Paradise Food Industries for their commitment and the work that they are doing in promoting Australian made products. I certainly wish them all very well for the future. Telecommunications",136
196,Mr ABBOTT,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to bring to the attention of the House answers to questions on notice, which confirm the grievous inadequacies in the government's telecommunications regime. I object to the Australian people, in particular, the people of my electorate, being used as guinea pigs in this government's crazy experiment with open slather in telecommunications. Answer to question No. 2586 from the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) said: Under the Telecommunications National Code carriers are required to co-locate towers. That is what he said. Then he added the escape hatch: ... unless it is not technically feasible. He went on to say: I am advised that as at September 1995 the carriers had co-located at around 135 sites. It sounds impressive until we realise that there are 2,000 of these mobile phone base stations and 135 co-locations means that at less than seven per cent of sites co-location is taking place. In other words, this government sets a rule which sounds good and then it puts in an exception which makes a complete mockery of the rule. The same answer goes on to say: DESTthe Department of the Environment, Sport and Territorieshas advised that it considers the possible colocation of mobile base station facilities its assessment process. It then goes on to say: I am advised that there has been one case where after AUSTEL intervention, the carriers involved agreed to co-locate. There are 2,000 of these base stations right around the country and there is one case where co-location has taken place after regulatory intervention. It is a complete and absolute joke. It is a fraud and a mockery of the Australian people. In answer to question No. 2373 the minister says: The decision to deliver pay television services by cable on power poles is one for the carriers, subject to the ... Telecommunications National Code. Austel has advised Ku-ring-gai council that the carriers do not have any right whatsoever to appeal to DEST under the telecommunications national code. It is a complete joke and a fraud, yet this minister has the hide to go around claiming that there is some adequate system of regulations. In the same answer the minister pointed out, admitted, that Telstra would be putting 20 per cent of its pay TV cable overhead on power poles. Yet he goes on to say: However, as the majority of Telstra's cabling will be underground it seems unlikely that there will be many areas where Optus and Telstra will both have cables mounted on power poles. Because it is 20 per cent, because it is one street in five throughout Australia, the minister thinks it does not matter. But it is one street in five that will have not just one cable the thickness of a 20c piece but two; one street in five that will have not just one splitter box per power pole the size of a video cassette but two; and one street in five that will have not just one signal amplifier the size of a briefcase every few hundred yards but two. It is as though the minister is saying, 'Well, something is happening in only Penrith, Liverpool and Blacktown; it is not happening in the rest of Sydney, therefore it does not matter.' In another answer, this time to question No. 2372, the minister says: The Code specifically provides a role for local councils to receive full details of the carriers' proposed activities to enable affected communities as part of to be consulted. Consultation does not happen. Dictation is what is happening. The carriers do not ask permission; they tell people what is happening. They do not ask, 'Can we do it?' They say, 'This is what we are going to do, and you can like it or lump it.' The minister should come in here and admit that the information superhighway risks becoming a dead end of poles and wires. We currently have 2,000 of these base stations. Soon we are going to have 10,000 of them sprouting like loathsome toadstools all over the suburbs of Australia. The garden suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne will be turned into giant clotheslines with pay TV cable. It is not good enough. I am in favour of telecommunications-I use them-but there has got to be a better way of delivering them than this. Royal Commissions Crichton-Browne, Senator Noel",137
197,Mr CAMPBELL,ADJOURNMENT,"I want to talk briefly on royal commissions, Senator Crichton-Browne and other things. In my view, royal commissions always set up by governments with an end view. It is quite clear that royal commissions do not follow the rules of evidence and are open to political use. It has been alleged that the recent Marks royal commission was guilty of procedural unfairness. That However, what I can say is that the royal commission into Western Australian governBrowne ment activities was clearly totally unprincimore pled and totally without any procedural fairness at all. It took realms and realms secret evidence that we will not know the details of for 30 years. That evidence was clearly used to colour the decisions that were arrived at. The first and principal conclusion of that $30 million exercise, after looking under every stone conceivable, was that there was no corruption in the Western Australian government. That was the finding of that royal commission. However, as a result of that, a premier and a minister went to gaol. The minister's sentence was overturned on appeal. If anyone looks at the facts in of Brian Burke, they will see that it was an outrageous decision. The West Australian newspaper was absoWestern lutely without principle at that time. It attendment ed the royal commission and reported it lurid detail. These people were tried convicted, in my view, by the West AustralLawrence, Ian. This lack of balance has also been shown by the West Australian in respect of CrichtonBrowne. I have had dealings with CrichtonBrowne over many years. He was, without a doubt, the most successful secretary of the Liberal Party in Western Australia. Under Crichton-Browne's leadership, the Liberal Party won every seat north of Geraldton. We did not hold one. It was a strategy put in place by state member Julian Grill and me that won every one of those seats back from CrichtonBrowne. He was, in my view, a formidable opponent. The fact that we hold those seats now is often not recognised by people in the Labor Party, who think we have always held them. It is one of the failings caused by some people's lack of history. I have found Crichton-Browne to be an are extremely good chairman. Anyone who has in had anything to do with committees would acknowledge that he is a very good chairman. He usually knows what he is talking about. He goes to some trouble to get the facts. He is certainly a listener; he listens to what may be so. people are saying. The other unusual thing about Crichtonis that he keeps his word. That is than I think can be said for the grubby lot in the Western Australian Liberal Party of who have been pursuing him. If I had to choose a partner in any venture, I would rather have Crichton-Browne than the sleazebags of Chaney, Viner et al who have pursued him so vigorously. The fact that the West Australian has jumped on this crusade I think is simply a reflection of the lack of balance that we get from the West Australian from time to time. I think they really ought to review their procedures. I wrote a letter to the West Australian saying basically that, and it was never published-but I guess that is what is to be respect expected from the West Australian. It is high time that people in Australia took a very hard look at what is happening. In Australia we have seen the Departof Public Prosecutions, set up by the in incumbent Labor government and in fact and appointed by the then Premier, Carmen operating on the basis that is, as judges have recently said, in danger of perverting the course of justice. We have seen ex officio indictments of people and people having to incur enormous costs. Even when they have been exonerated at the end of that, they have been simply financially broken. There is an association between Mr Ayton, the Deputy Commissioner of Police, and John MCKechnie, the Director of Public Prosecutions. I have evidence that in a recent case he wrote letters in the most cordial of terms to Mr Ayton asking for assistance in prosecutions. Unfortunately, a lot of the letters have been censored as to whether the DPP has claimed legal professional privilege. (Time expired) Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport",138
198,Mr MACK,ADJOURNMENT,"North Sydney) (8.07 p.m.)Some four weeks ago a new lobby group emerged in Sydney concerning the Sydney airport noise problems. The group styled the Sydney Airport Forum is certainly no ordinary protest group. It was announced that the forum would raise up to $1 million and was headed by a high-powered group from the lower North Shore. A spokesman indicated that the forum would use its resources to initiate legal action, undertake detailed cal research and devise advertising campaigns. The announcement was accompanied by rhetoric about 'dragging the knife over Sydney causing great scars on the city in the name of progress' and 'being fed up with the government willing to destroy our way of life to help their big business mates'. The spokesman also made a number of cryptic statements such as 'not being an anti-airport group per se' and 'understanding the need for infrastructure weighted against the destruction of lives of Australian citizens'. To anyone who has followed the problems of Sydney airport over the years, all this raises some questions. What is this group's real agenda? Why is it all being couched in cryptic statements? No normal resident group can talk of an instant budget of $1 million. Where is the money coming from? It seems remarkable that newspaper reports in the Australian and Sydney Morning Herald contained little critical analysis of the group. The line was taken that here was a new positive development which would make up for the generally flagging and ineffectual efforts of the community based anti-noise groups to date. The stated aim of the Sydney Airport Forum is to ensure that 'all sensible solutions are evaluated in a fair and open and non-political manner' . Motherhood statements like this are meaningless, but in fact the fine print states that the forum will 'endeavour to promote a solution to the noise issues before local resident action groups take direct action towards the tourism and airline industries', and that starts to let the cat out of the bag. This allied to the fact that the forum is headed by a director of the Sydney Tourism Task Force, an organisation which was one of the arch proponents of the third runway, makes a compelling case that the Sydney Airport Forum is in effect a front organisation to minimise the problems of the airline and tourism industries and minimise impediments to their growth at the airport. It is not surprising that, given the avalanche of propaganda for the construction of a third runway by business groups, it has taken this long for a front organisation for the continued expansion techniof the airport to be formed. The Sydney Airport Forum, with a few gullible acolytes, can take its place along with other industry fronts such as the Forest Protection Society, representing loggers and woodchippers; the Litter Research Association; and the Keep Australia Beautiful Society, representing the producers of waste. The forum indicates that its considerable funds will be used prior to the next federal election. Given the fact that the forum's members are overwhelmingly right-wing and given its denigration of other airport protest groups such as the No Aircraft Noise Party, anyone who did not come down in the last political shower would have to conclude there is a good chance of a brace of dummy Independents coming on, at least in the seat of Bennelong. The Labor Party's policy is to expand Sydney airport, concentrate the noise on the minimum number of voters but minimise the effect on right-wing Labor members. The Liberal Party's policy is to expand Sydney airport, disperse the noise on the maximum number of voters but minimise the effect on Liberal members. The Sydney Airport Forum's policy is to expand Sydney airport, spread the noise anywhere except Hunters Hill but minimise the effect on the tourism and airline industries. All three policies are focused on the next election and are contemptible. All attempt to perpetuate the fiction that satisfactory long term solutions are possible by variations of flight paths and airport management, when it is clear that any benefits will simply be overtaken by the growth of aircraft movements. In 1995, there is no solution to the environmental and economic haemorrhaging of Sydney or the need to provide first-rate facilities, except to accelerate the construction of a replacement airport at Badgerys Creek and to plan a new long-term international airport site completely outside the SydneyNewcastle-Nowra conurbation for the long term future. Mental Health",139
199,Mr HAVILAND,ADJOURNMENT,"Macarthur) (8.12 p.m.)Last Friday evening at Red Hill in Canberra, an Australian Federal Police officer shot dead Mr Warren I' Anson, a person with schizophrenia. This was the latest in a highly disturbing number of shootings by police of people with a mental illness. Most of these incidents in recent times have occurred in Victoria. This incident was a tragedy and the circumstances are particularly appalling. Mr I' Anson himself was an active volunteer worker in the mental health sector and assisted many other people with a mental illness. His own support worker suggested to him last Thursday that seek voluntary admission to hospital only 24 hours before his death. I understand she was told by the ACT mental health crisis team there were no beds available. Apparently, police were called on Friday and forced their way into Mr I' Anson's home, where he fatally shot within 45 minutes. There was attempt to call Mr I' Anson's family or friends for assistance in the period before his death. In addressing this issue tonight, I do wish to lay the blame for this tragedy at any individual police officer or any other person. Certainly, one could suggest that there may be a cultural problem with the police in Victoria, where incidents of this nature have sadly been commonplace. But any blame for these incidents does not necessarily lie with the police, who in many cases should not have been put in the position they were in. I believe what these incidents highlight is the failure of state and territory governments not only to properly implement the national mental health strategy but also to provide basic mental health services. Indeed, there is evidence that funding and services in mental health are being cut in some states and territories. In my role as chair of the caucus mental health working group, I have spoken airline to dozens of people across Australiaincluding consumers, carers and service providers-and have heard continuing horror stories about the lack of services and cuts to services by state and territory governments. The most frequent question I am asked by these people is: what can I do or what can we do as a federal government to monitor the states and to ensure that the states and territories are doing the right thing? This is a particular problem in Victoria and South Australia. We have heard previously from the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) about the way the Kennett government takes money out of the health budget in Victoria faster than the Commonwealth can put it in. In South Australia, the South Australian Mental Health Services has been abolished and absorbed into the South Australian Health Commission. The reason that this federal government initiated the national mental health strategy in he 1992, under then Minister Brian Howe, was that mental health, like Aboriginal health, had traditionally been a state responsibility but that had been badly neglected. This government the believed mental health to be a basic social justice issue and, accordingly, sought to was increase the Commonwealth's role. The no Burdekin report, presented in October 1993, was further evidence of the inadequacy of mental health services, and this resulted in the not federal government's commitment of $269 million over four years to the national mental health strategy, announced in the May 1994 budget. But the mental health community has the right to ask: where is this money going if people still cannot get basic services and if people are being shot by police? Many groups are now calling for a royal commission into the deaths by shooting of so many people. I certainly believe that an inquiry of some kind should be held and that its terms of reference should include an investigation into the levels of services provided by state and territory governments. On this subject, however, I am pleased to point out that today the Minister for Human Services and Health has written to all state and territory health ministers seeking their views on the formation of a task force to look at these incidents involving people with mental illness in crisis. The suggestion will be made that those health ministers involve their police ministers. The minister has also written to the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr)-another minister who is very interested in social justice-about this issue. So there are signs that this federal government will make a responsible and quick response to the tragedies of so many people being shot by police-police who should not have been called in the first place-and to these issues of people with mental illness in crisis. Ballarat Technology Park",140
200,Mr RONALDSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Ballarat) (8.16 p.m.)I would like to speak this evening about the Ballarat Technology Park and the ISSC Southern Region Data Centre. This coming Friday, 24 November, the Premier of Victoria, the Hon. Jeff Kennett, will officially open the Ballarat Technology Park and the ISSC Southern Region Data Centre in my electorate of Ballarat. At the same time, the Victorian Minister for Health, the Hon. Maree Tehan, will announce the western Victorian telemedicine project-a project to enable western Victorian hospitals to consult specialist radiologists and pathologists in Ballarat and Melbourne on a 24 hour a day, seven day a week basis. Both these events are major achievements for Ballarat and the region. The Victorian government has been actively involved and I should acknowledge its commitment to meeting the challenges of the information age under the agenda 21 project, which has enabled country Victoria to take up the many innovative opportunities of the information age. The Ballarat Technology Park, on the campus of the University of Ballarat, comprises nearly 29 hectares fronting onto Geelong Road. It was officially launched in February 1995 by Victorian regional development minister, Roger Hallam. The development of the Ballarat Technology Park has involved a partnership with the city of Ballarat, the initial project being the ISSC Southern Region Data Centre-a $14 million building development at the Ballarat Technology Park. The building project has been constructed by local building contractor H. Troon Pty Ltd. The building of the singleand two-storey construction will provide 200 workstations and a sophisticated computer environment in an air conditioned building. The area will be landscaped to fit with the local environment. The first tenant of the Ballarat Technology Park is an IBM-Lend Lease joint venture, ISSC Australia, which will provide computer outsourcing facilities on a commercial basis for clients in Australia and Asia operating from the new Southern Region Data Centre. The provision of Vic Roads and the Public Transport Commission outsourcing facilities in the Ballarat region is the core of this new development. Other ISSC clients to be served at the Ballarat Technology Park include Lend Lease, Cathay Pacific, the SECV and a $50 million project to supply computing services to the Asian region. IBM intends to invest up to $90 million in the next five years to operate the centre at Ballarat. The company has funded a chair in information technology at the University of Ballarat and will provide up to 20 scholarships and 10 traineeships. IBM will develop research links with the university and the institution will be able to tap into IBM's global facilities. The University of Ballarat is at the forefront of providing the skills necessary for the new information age. They have structured their computing degree to ensure that students develop lifelong learning and generic skills over and above the traditional discipline skills of a computer specialist. They are attempting to develop IT specialists with the interpersonal skills to enable them to communicate with the rest of us mere mortals. Collaboration between the University of Ballarat and the Ballarat Technology Park will enable the university to build IT elements into many of its courses and enhance graduate employability. In the information age, companies to be globally competitive will need to derive advantage from working smarter, using the computer as a cognitive tool. Tomorrow's graduates will need a synergistic interweaving of traditional disciplines and IT knowledge and skills. The University of Ballarat has responded to the challenge by making it possible for students to interweave the study of IT with their chosen course and complete a double degree in four years. The ISSC site at Ballarat is expected to employ about 350 people within three years. IT related industries are anticipated to employ over 3,000 people within the region within five years. I congratulate both the University of Ballarat and the city of Ballarat on their initiative in developing the Ballarat Technology Park and in providing Ballarat with a strategic advantage to face the challenges of information technology into the 21st century. We are justifiably proud of the University of Ballarat. Under the stewardship of Vice-Chancellor David James the university is at the cutting edge of IT development and has formed a close partnership with the community. The staff at the university are to be congratulated for their pro-active approach and commitment to this extraordinarily exciting development. Ravenswood, Tasmania",141
201,Mrs SILVIA SMITH,ADJOURNMENT,"Bass) (8.20 p.m.}--I rise this evening to voice my disgust and concern at what I consider to be an extremely discriminatory statement made publicly on Monday, 20 November, by an elected alderman for the City of Launceston Council against some of my constituents in the suburb of Ravenswood, Launceston. It appalls me that an elected representative of the people can abuse the rights of public office in this way. The suburb of Ravenswood was originally built as a housing division. Last week, a local developer outlined his proposal to build a $3 million hotel in Ravenswood. This is a substantial investment in anyone's books. I am in full support of the idea. It is a terrific concept which offers a positive addition to the area, particularly for employment opportunities in the building phase and later as a going concern. The councillor in question, Alderman George Brookes, who incidentally is also an elected member in the Legislative Council of Tasmania, stated at Monday'S council meeting-and his remarks were later reported in the Examiner: There are a lot of unemployed people up there, single parents and people on welfare. He also said that he was not a wowser but he was worried about an extra hotel in the area. Incidentally, there is no hotel in Ravenswood-only the Over 50s Club. How dare he take such a moralistic high ground. How dare he make ambit claims against the people of Ravenswood. This is the most despicable display of irresponsibility that I have ever seen from an elected representative of the people. How dare he cast a stigma on the people of Ravenswood in this fashion simply because of where they live and their current circumstances. Ravenswood residents have every right to be outraged, as is shown in the Examiner newspaper today. Narelle Cameron of the Ravenswood Primary School P&F said that everyone in Ravenswood is not a 'no-hoper' and that in fact, although many of them are unemployed often through no fault of their own, many are also in work. Nobody-and I repeat nobody-deserves the verbal abuse offered by George Brookes on Monday of this week. Other aldermen have stated that they thought the remarks were discriminatory; that they felt uncomfortable with the comments from one of their own; and that the comments were certainly not called for. The community response to this matter has been one of anger and outrage. I suggest that Alderman George Brookes should be condemned for his outrageous comments. He should apologise to the people of Ravenswood. It is my view that every elected member in every arena of government has a duty to act and speak responsibly and in a manner that sets an example for all. I might add, Mr Speaker, that that also goes for some of those elected to this place. Murray-Darling Basin Agreement",142
202,Mr SMYTH,ADJOURNMENT,"Canberra) (8.24 p.m.)Today a seminar was conducted in the Parliamentary Library concerning the Murray-Darling Basin. The member for Mallee (Mr Forrest) raised the issue of why the Australian Capital Territory was not a signatory to the Murray-Darling Basin agreement. It is a good question. After five years of ACT Labor government the agreement was not signed. As the former member for Canberra was herself a former minister for the environment, you would have thought that under her influence the local Labor Party would have signed the agreement. But no, Mr Speaker, it was not signed. It is clear to me that all Australians are concerned for their environment. The people of Canberra certainly are. I take this opportunity to call on the new ACT Liberal government to sign the agreement and confirm the commitment of the people of the Australian Capital Territory to their environment, and confirm that the people of the ACT are willing to carry their share of their environmental responsibility. The people of the ACT showed their support for our waterways during National Water Week this year through a festival that is run in my electorate called Aquafest 95. I had the honour to launch Aquafest 95 at Lake Tuggeranong College in the presence of the principal, Rob MCConchie; Dr Cath Bowmer, the Deputy Chief of the CSIRO Division of Water Resources; Mr Tony Tatarow of the CSIRO; David Everitt and Peter Costa from Lakewatch; and the students of the Tuggeranong Valley. As I said, Aquafest was launched at Lake Tuggeranong College and was run in conjunction with the National Water Week. The theme for National Water Week this year was 'protect, conserve and get involved'. National Water Week was to focus all Australians' attention on ways in which to protect our waterways, as well as encouraging all of us to reduce our water usage. It was also about encouraging all of us to become more involved in maintaining and improving our water quality. There were many practical suggestions, such as using low phosphorus washing powders because phosphorus contributes to bluegreen algae. It was suggested that we use less washing powder and only wash when there is a full load. It also suggested things like washing the car on the lawn so that the soapy water did not get into our waterways and disposing of food scraps and any oils properly to keep them out of our waterways. The highlight of National Water Week in the ACT was Aquafest 95. It brought Canberrans together as a community to celebrate, to educate, to learn, to discuss and to remind all of us, as the slogan said, that the future of water is in our hands. Water is a prominent feature in the Tuggeranong Valley, with the Murrumbidgee River flowing through the valley and the ACT. Many of my constituents have enjoyed, as I have, the recreation spots on the river like Pine Island and Point Hut. Indeed, the city of Canberra is the largest population centre in the Murray-Darling Basin. I find it extraordinary that we are not a signatory to the Murray-Darling agreement. I would urge members of the agreement-Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia-to make it practicable for the ACT to join that agreement. The other prominent reminder for all of us in the valley is Lake Tuggeranong. David Everitt has told me that Lake Tuggeranong is considered to be one of the world's best engineered lakes because its major function is as a sediment trap to protect the Murrumbidgee River. It does that rather nicely. In the Lake Tuggeranong region there is a group called the Lake Tuggeranong Lakewatch Group, under the stewardship of David Everitt, Peter Costa and, particularly, the students of Lake Tuggeranong College. They actually monitor the lake all year long and keep an eye out for things like blue-green algae. To the contributors who set up on the day as well as to the major sponsors-the CSIRO Division of Water Resources, ACT Waterwatch and the Department of Urban Services, ACTEW Corporation, Lakewatch and Valley View, which was a major sponsor-I say well done. I now call on the ACT government to ensure that its work is not undone and to get involved with the Murray-Darling Basin agreement. Member for Moore",143
203,Mr FILING,ADJOURNMENT,"As I mentioned today in a personal explanation following question time, in the West Australian newspaper there were some comments about me by a former mayor, now gaolbird, Dr Wayne Bradshaw. He used to be the mayor of the city of Wanneroo and had considerable power in the Liberal Party structure in the northern suburbs. Dr Bradshaw said that I had approached him and sought his support; he had rejected it because he thought I was not a very good candidate. These particular assertions made in the Kyle hearings going on at present are absolutely absurd. According to this particular sequence of events, I would have just beaten Dr Bradshaw as the candidate for Moore in 1989. In actual fact, the words he used in the inquiry are very telling. He said: Seven years of living in Wanneroo, he wasn't a member of one community activity, so I thought that ruled him out to be a suitable politician. In the council minutes for October 1990, then Councillor Bradshaw said the following in relation to a council debate: Secondly, I consider Paul Filing personally antiWanneroo. To the best of my knowledge he has lived here for six or seven years in Wanneroo has not been a member of one organisation in Wanneroo. I am personally yet to see him do one thing that has benefited Wanneroo. That is interesting because that particular debate arose from the fact that Dr Bradshaw-who, at the time was a Liberal Party branch president as well as being mayor-had banned me, the sitting Liberal federal member for the area, from attending council functions, including citizenship ceremonies. I had actually written to him, asking that he reconsider that ban as a matter of urgency or I would take up the matter in this place with the minister for immigration because I considered that he was overstepping his delegated powers as the mayor in granting citizenship. That is the context. It is quite absurd for Dr Bradshaw to claim that I had gone to him for support. He is the last person to whom I would have gone for support. He organised during his time a criminal operation in the city of Wanneroo.",144

Of course, a lot of other things have happened these days are by and large not in the work in higher education. Secondary participation to year 12 when the government came to office to year 12 now.

I should also correct a remark made by the apprenticeships and traineeships, and again government has been very successful during grow. The labour force has increased by around 8 million.

The means test for the new basic stringent than that which applies to family subject to 'means testing arrangements that are used. The exact details of the means test usual under Labor, we are debating legislation are yet to be determined. And, as we have seen, before us which it has just thought of. The current family payment assets test threshold threshold is $393,750. In addition, the family for circumstances where families have high no such provisions. This has been the cause that, despite low income, their asset value excludes replacement of the family payment system savings of $19.69 million in 1996-97, $19.21 99. The government argues that these new measures need to deal with both DEET and the Department the umbrella of DEET alone. Whether families Employment, Education and Training is a significant themselves when they look at the consequences and its horrendous size. Being under this many families to carry. The other changes which the bill makes are 1 loans. These loans enable students on Austudy double the amount traded. This schedule removes of eligibility in applying for the loan, but the year. It also removes the cut-off date is expected to provide savings of $6 million. Schedule 2 of the legislation abolishes students who would be eligible for Austudy payments students could take out interest free loans do away with these loans, as the demand for only about 4,000 to 5,000 students took up this some 11,000 to 15,000 students would There is an important question to be asked these loans. My recollection is that this measure rural students. Indeed, it was recommended MC 3587 than the proposed student payment, and the is more stringent than that which used to payment, as I understand it, will consist of a in two instalments.

Eligibility for student payment will be are similar to Austudy'-those are the words that are yet to be defined. As seems more and more with dubious substance, the details of which the government still has further details to put is $584,500. Under Austudy the assets test payment test has hardship provisions which allow asset value but no or low income. Austudy has of constant complaints from rural communities them from being eligible for Austudy. The with student payment is estimated to provide million in 1997-98 and $19.03 million in 1998are advantageous in that families no longer of Social Security, but will now fall under will welcome falling under the Department of question that families may like to ask of the policies pursued by this department, department could be quite a crushing burden for relatively minor.

This last amendment Austudy category 2 loans. These loans are for but are excluded by the means test. Such of up to $2,000. The government has decided to them was not as great as expected. Apparently, option, although the department estimated that avail themselves of these loans. about the nature of the students who took out was introduced to be of specific benefit to by the Chapman inquiry that loans be made more NA MC 3588 freely available so that students who might be tests could avail themselves of loans. I think it would be valuable for the government the 4,000 to 5,000 students who took out these that raises the question of whether or not the disadvantage to rural students. If that is so, and farming families struggling to make a another blow to these families. The government says that this measure will in 1995-96, $2.7 million in 1996-97, and $3.13 this measure and I would appreciate it if the parliament some information about the nature by this particular savings measure. I must say that I do find it a quite extraordinary fewer have used it than the department anticipated. 4,000 to 5,000 students-not an inconsiderable were only loans. It is not as if the government was much greater than expected. It is not as the expenditures are not great and, presumably, Schedule 4 of the bill abolishes the Austudy Spouses will be able to apply for the parenting This particular change has no financial implications. Schedule 7 imposes a $10 weekly fine for circumstances which may affect eligibility for generate revenue of $3 million in 1996-97, overpayments. Schedule 8 clarifies the application of the or foster care. Schedule 9 of the bill gives the collection of debt. As we all remember, 1994 was the International from the government in relation to this year legislation, further evidence that the government because it is restricting eligibility for assistance for families who need it. The government's record on families is, of families which have borne the brunt of the Minister (Mr Keating). It is families which have something like 780,000 unemployed people families to support. We see the failure of the government's promise We see unemployment creeping up. We see higher than it was eight months ago. Working yet we find youth unemployment 29 per cent introduced.

Indeed, abolition of these loans will be of particular this will be just another example of rural Australia go of it under the mismanagement of the countryprovide savings, which will be only $760,000 million in 1997-98. There is a question about minister, in his response, could provide to the of the students who will be excluded from loans justification for cutting out a measure that Presumably, it was of great value to these number.

CSL Ltd: Indemnity Agreements (Question No. 2640)",199
246,Mr COSTELLO,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"the Minister for Human Services and Health, upon notice, on 26 September 1995: Will she provide details of all indemnity agreements between the Commonwealth and CSL Ltd, including all terms and conditions.",199
247,Dr LAWRENCE,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourregion- able member's question is as follows: The Commonwealth has three Contracts under which it provides indemnities to CSL Limited and which are 'Commercial-in-Confidence'. A copy of the 'Indemnity Agreement Between the Commonwealth and CSL Limited' dated 23 December 1993 has been provided to the honourable member. The other two Contracts: 'An Agreement Between the Commonwealth of Australia and CSL Limited' dated 23 December 1993; and 'Diagnostic Products Agreement Between the Commonwealth of Australia and CSL Limited' dated 23 December 1993, contain confidentiality clauses requiring CSL's consent before they, or any part of them, can be released. CSL has not given that consent because the Prospectus for the sale of CSL contains relevant information on those indemnities. The Prospectus provides: 'An Agreement Between the Commonwealth of Australia and CSL Limited' When operations of the plasma fractionation facility at Broadmeadows began, CSL and the Commonwealth entered into a contract effective 1 January 1994 and ending on 30 June 2004, and extendable to 30 June 2009 at the option of the Commonwealth. This contract provides for the processing by CSL of Australian-sourced human plasma collected and sent to it by the Blood Transfusion Services. The contract provides an indemnity by the Commonwealth to CSL against claims by any person who becomes HIV - positive or contracts an AIDS-related condition or hepatitis as a result of the therapeutic use by that person or that person's natural parent or spouse (collectively, a claimant) of a CSL product derived from Australian plasma and produced pursuant to this contract. The indemnity extends to any claim made against CSL by a person who becomes HIV - positive, contracts an AIDS-related condition or hepatitis through infection communicated by a claimant. It extends also to any third party claim made against CSL. The indemnity covers all Australian-sourced plasma manufactured under the contract for the duration of the contract. However, the indemnity is subject to certain limitations. For instance, the Commonwealth will only indemnify CSL for amounts which CSL is legally liable to pay in respect of any claim. Further, the indemnity will not cover amounts which CSL is liable to pay in respect of a punitive or exemplary component of damages awarded against it. The indemnity also does not cover any liability that attaches to CSL because of the deliberate or reckless failure by CSL to satisfy required standards of care in the manufacCommission ture of products. 'Diagnostic Products Agreement Between the Commonwealth of Australia and CSL Limited' The Commonwealth and CSL have entered into a contract which provides for CSL to process and manufacture Australian-derived human red blood cells and plasma collected by the Blood Transfusion Services into certain diagnostic products. The agreement also provides for CSL to supply the finished product free to the Red Cross for distribution. The contract continues to 30 June 2001, and may be extended for up to 3 years at the option of the Commonwealth. The contract provides an indemnity by the Commonwealth to CSL covering all diagnostic products produced from I January 1994 in terms similar to the indemnity provided in 'An Agreement Between the Commonwealth of Australia and CSL Limited'. Apart from the fact that each indemnity refers to its individual products, the main difference between them is that the indemnity in 'An Agreement Between the Commonwealth of Australia and CSL Limited' is subject to an additional condition specifically related to the special procedures used in the manufacture of plasma products. Warning Labels: Concealment (Question No. 2667)",199
