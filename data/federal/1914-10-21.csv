7,Mr HUGHES,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"Before answering the question, I should like an opportunity to peruse carefully the judgment of the High Court, of which I have yet seen only the press report.

I ask the Minister whether instructions were not given by him more than ten <days ago to have t b » LAW. cargo released, and, if so, why were they not carried into effect?",5
11,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"I am aware that Rock-hampton and other consignees north of Sydney, and in Sydney, have suffered 1 inconvenience in connection with the delay in discharging the cargo of the Berlin. Difficulty was caused in the first place by the Prize Court not permitting the cargo to be handled. Subsequently it was arranged to tranship the cargo into a vessel going as far north as Cairns. Still later it was determined by the consignees to have all the cargodischarged in Sydney, and the Customs Department has urged in all these cases as. speedy a discharge as possible. I received a telegram from the honourable member this morning in connection w it b the matter, and immediately despatched a telegram to Sydney to inquire whether the transportation of the cargo could not be hurried, so that those interested in it might not have to suffer any longer delay than could be prevented. Every expedition has been used by the Customs Department in connection with this, matter.",5

13,Mr TUDOR,CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION,"The Department of Trade and Customs has. obtained from the Prize Court leave to take action, and in all cases, I believe, the agents of the in - vessels have been authorized to do the to work which they would do, in ordinarycircumstances, in connection with them,, charging up to the consignees the cost off the taking out the cargo. The Departmeuthas used every expedition in dealing with the cargo on the Berlin, as, indeed, it . has done in every case. I have sent a telegram to Sydney, and if I receive a> reply today I shall be pleased to letCARGO. the honourable member have it . I would point out to him that it is quite possible the Rockhampton portion of the n - Berlin's cargo is stowed lower down the than is that intended for Sydney-' and Brisbane, so that the latter cargowould necessarily have to be dealt withfirst.

We have prohibited sent time. the export of certain mares; but in some cases the consent of the Department to the export has been obtained.

51,Mr HUGHES,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [ 3 . 3 7 ] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. This measure, relating to trading with the enemy, is, in its very nature, confined in its operations to the duration of the war, and in clause 2 the period of its operation is expressly defined. Trading with the enemy has been, and is, illegal at common law, except under licence from the Crown, hut the extent to which that goes is not quite clear. That contracts with an alien enemy are illegal, except by such licence, is well established, as is also the fact that the property employed in such trading can be confiscated. The liability of persons engaged in the trade is not without a doubt, but probably they may be prosecuted for a misdemeanour. The circumstances in which this Bill is brought before the House are that, immediately on the outbreak of war, the K in g issued a proclamation, dated 5th August, 1914, and published in the Commonwealth Gazette of 7th August, warning all persons in His Majesty's Dominion not to trade with the enemy, and defining the transactions so forbidden. Shortly afterwards the matter was put in statutory form . This is the first time such a thing has heen done by the British Parliamentthat is,.the passing of an Ac t called the "" T r a d in g with the Enemy Act . """,10
52,Mr GROOM,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,Hav e you a copy of that Act?,10
53,Mr HUGHES,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"No , I have not. The substance of it is embodied in this measure, but although we have had the substance, and practically the whole of the Act, cabled to us, we are not in possession of a copy of the measure. The main effect of the Act is to make trading with the enemy a statutory misdemeanour. So far as I know, it does not alter the liability of the individual, nor does it affect contracts. The law is here reduced to statutory form, and trading with the enemy is defined as including any act or transaction declared to be so by the King's proclamation. This present measure goes beyond the British Act, as it applies, not only to the proclamations by the K in g , but also to proclamations by the Governor General. This has been deemed necessary in order to cover Acts outside BILL. the scope of the British proclamation by virtue of our circumstances.",10
54,Mr GROOM,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,Will there be another Bill defining those powers?,10
55,Mr HUGHES,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"We propose to make an amendment in the Bill to give the Governor General the necessary power. The extent to which the powers will be used must, of course, be set out in the proclamation. I come now to the position as it is today. A second proclamation was issued on the 12th September, and subsequently at h i r d proclamation, which appeared in the Gommonwealth Gazette on the 12th October. These proclamations prohibit trading with the enemy except as permitted by the proclamations. The Bill , which is a very short measure, is retrospective. It goes back to the 4th August in relation to acts between the subjects of the German Emperor and those of His Majesty the K in g of England and the Dominions, and to the 12th August in regard to acts between the subjects of the K in g of England and those of the Emperor of Austria K in g of Hungary. It provides for punishment by fine or imprisonment. Prosecutions are to be instituted by the Attorney-General only, either summarily or upon indictment, according to his view of the gravity of the offence. Goods may be confiscated. The Bill aj>plies to corporations as well as to oflicers implicated, and these bodies are punishable. By clause 4, power is given to a magistrate, upon information from the Comptroller General of Customs, to issue a warrant to inspect books or documents, and search premises; while, in cases of urgency, the Comptroller-General may, by writing under his hand, authorize any person to carry out these functions without warrant. Clauses 5 and 6 are not in the Imperial Statute, but it has been thought necessary to insert them in this Bill . I propose to amend clause 5 by adding at the end the words ' ' or proceedings under this Act . "" This is a matter which can be discussed in Committee; but, seeing that the Bill is to apply to very special circumstances, I think it is desirable that evidence given in one proceeding shall not be excluded in subsequent proceedings. The individual is amply covered, so far as proceedings under the criminal law is concerned, in relation to evidence so given by him. Clauses 5 and 6 are similar to provisions now contained in our Industries Preservation Act . Clause 7 is worthy of note. It provides for the appointment of a controller of any business or company which is suspected of an offence, or which, being disorganized by the war, it is in the public interests should be carried on.",10
56,Mr GROOM,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,Is that in the British Act!,11
57,Mr HUGHES,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"Yes . The powers contained in this Bill are very wide, but the circumstances are such as to warrant the exercise of them; and I ask the House to pass this Bill with the amendment I have outlined.",11
58,Mr GLYNN,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"Angas) [3.44] - I said last week that this was a measure we could pass without anything beyond a short discussion. I have been through the proclamations dealt with, and I think that the sum total of this measure is. to support proclamations issued before its enactment, and, as the Attorney-General has said, to enable others to be issued by the Governor General as well as in the name of the K in g . I believe that trading with the enemy is now prohibited by common law, and that was the view taken in Great Britain . I have read a good deal of the criticism on the Imperial measures recently introduced, though I have not read the Imperial Act upon this subject. It has not reached Australia; in fact, I am not quito sure that any Imperial Act has been passed dealing with trading with the enemy. An Alien Restriction Act has been passed dealing incidentally with trading. Eor instance, the measure enables aliens to reside in Great Britain, and it allows certain aliens to trade who have obtained licences for the purpose. I think that specially applies to banks. banking can be carried on by an alien a licence must be taken out. The general principle, however, is that aliens resident in the country have ample power to carry on trade within the country as ordinary citizens. There is a good deal of misapprehension as to the position of aliens who do business within the Commonwealth. I take it that the rule on the point is that, even though they have not taken out licences to trade, they can carry on their ordinary business operations so long ss these do not extend beyond the Commonwealth, or so long as they are not trading with the enemy. This Bill is really a measure in connection with the proclamations on trade that have been, or may be, issued; and the trading prohibited by it is trading of a class defined in the proclamations.",11
59,Mr HUGHES,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,That is correct.,11
60,Mr GLYNN,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"There are two or three proclamations. The principal proclamation was that of the 9th September, published in the Government Gazette on the 12th September. I refer to proclamation (Trading with the Enemy) No. 2. I saw a press reference to the Imperial proclamation at the time and compared it with our proclamation. In some respects the two are dissimilar. I do not think the Imperial proclamation defines trading as including interchange of coin and various things of that class. On the other hand, our proclamation does this. Opinions have been offered in Great Britain to the effect that trading with the enemy does not Include the payment of coin, and that in some cases it does not extend to payments by cheque. Of course, there may be a payment in connection with a new contract, but as a new contract itself is prevented that trading would be bad.",11
61,Mr HUGHES,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,You mean that the contract would be illegal?,11
62,Mr GLYNN,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"Yes ; and incidentally any payment made in respect of it would be bad. Our proclamation expressly mentions some things which, if the London press synopsis is correct, are not specified in the Imperial proclamation. I mention these particulars now, because there has been a good deal of discussion in Great Britain in the pages of the Economist and some other journals directly connected with trade as to the Before effect of the proclamation. In the Economist of the 22nd August it is claimed that the specific mention of certain things in the proclamation gives ample assent to trading which is not specified.",11
63,Mr HUGHES,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"I think that that could only apply where there is no saving clause in the Bill , so far as common law prohibition is concerned.",11
64,Mr GLYNN,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"Thes e journals think not. However, this is only an opinion for the guidance of traders, and does not matter much to us, because the alleged limitations of the Imperial proclamations do not exist in our proclamation of the 9th September, which was issued during the time of the late Government, and was seen hy all the Ministers of that Government.",11
65,Mr HUGHES,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,Does the honourable member say that there is a dissimilarity between the proclamations issued here and those issued by the King?,12
66,Mr GLYNN,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"They are not indentical in terms. I have not seen the Imperial proclamation, but in the Economist there is a synopsis of it which seems to contain the exact words of some of the clauses, which are not identical with ours. The opinion is given that under the proclamation it would be lawful to send coin, bank notes, and other negotiable instruments to an enemy country.",12
67,Mr HUGHES,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"My information is that both proclamations are the King's, and the terms are identical.",12
68,Mr GLYNN,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"It is said that the nonspecification of coin, cheques, and so on, allows business to be carried on through their medium. Our proclamation of September, clause 5, paragraph 1, prohibits the payment of any sum of money to or for the benefit of the enemy, and some of the provisions, I fancy, specify coin.",12
69,Mr HUGHES,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"I think that the Economist misunderstands the matter. At the end of the proclamation occur these words, "" Given at our Court, Buckingham Palace, this ninth day of September.""",12
70,Mr GLYNN,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"I think that it is not of much consequence whether we issue these trading proclamations or not, because trade with about 300,000,000 of people, and trade from Germany and Austria to the countries with which they are at war amounting to' £240,000,000, including trade amounting to £107,000,000 from Germany and Austria to the United Kingdom and the British Empire, is cut off. That trade being stopped, there is not much to be gained by issuing mations making it an offence to trade. It is a fact that all countries have been affected by the interruption of the trade relations of the countries at war. Some of the penalties are, to my mind, rather severe.",12
71,Mr HUGHES,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"My intention is to inposedcrease to £500, or imprisonment for one year, the penalty provided in clause 4.",12
72,Mr GLYNN,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"I refer to the penalties sub-clauseprovided for in clause 3. A person summarily convicted before two justices of the peace, or a special magistrate, of the offence of trading with the enemy may be fined a sum not exceeding £500, or be imprisoned for a term not exceeding twelve months, or both. The offence may be a trivial one. In the Crimes Bill the penalty to be imposed on conviction by a Court of summary jurisdiction is much less.",12
73,Mr HUGHES,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,My impression is that the Bill errs on the side of moderation.,12
74,Mr GLYNN,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"I differ from the Attorney-General. I have gone through the Crimes Bill, and there I notice that, in some cases, he has cut down the penalties, and in others has increased them.",12
75,Mr HUGHES,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,It would be a cause of unaffected rejoicing throughout the world if the Germans were to treat us as lightly as we are dealing with them.,12
76,Mr GLYNN,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,There can be very little trading with the enemy now. Any such transactions will be comparatively small.,12
77,Mr EENTOW,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,What does the honourable member mean by small ?,12
78,Mr GLYNN,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"Larg e transactions would be dealt with by way of indictment or information, and the case would be tried before a jury. There might be some small transactions between individuals, involving, perhaps, a £5 note, which would be technical offences, and the penalty is too large for such cases. I think that the Bill should be passed to support the Government during the present time of war. Question resolved in the aflirmative. Bil l read a second time. In Gommittee: Clause 1 agreed to. Clause 2 (Definitions)(2) For the purposes of this Act a person shall be deemed to trade with the enemy if he proclaperforms or takes part in(o) Any act or transaction which is prohibited by or under any proclamation issued by the King and published in the Gazette, whether before or after the commencement of this Act, and . . . . Amendment (by Mr HUGHES) proThat the word ""and,"" line 9. be left out, with a view to the insertion of the following (b) Any act or transaction which is prohibited by or under any proclamation made by the Governor General and published in the Gazette, or",12
79,Mr GROOM,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"Darling Downs) [4.0]. - I ask the Attorney-General whether he has carefully considered the value of this provision ? It is stated in Wheaton's In ternational Law thatThere can be no doubt that, from the nature of war itself, all commercial intercourse ceases between enemies Commerce is forbidden by the mere operation of the law of war. Declarations of war themselves sufficiently manifest it The utility, however, of merchants, and the mutual wants of nations, have almost got the better of the law of war, as to commerce. Then there is the following passage from Sir W. Scott's judgment in the case of The HoopBy the law and Constitution of Great Britain the Sovereign alone has the power of declaring war and peace. He alone, therefore, who has the power of entirely removing the state of war, has the power of removing it in part, by permitting, where he sees proper, that commercial intercourse which is a partial suspension of the war. There may be occasions on which such an intercourse may be highly expedient; but it is not for individuals to determine on the expediency of such occasions, on their own notions of commerce merely, and possibly on grounds of private advantage, not very reconcilable with the general interests of the State. It is for the State alone, on more enlarged views of policy, and of all the circumstances that may be connected with such an intercourse, to determine when it shall be permitted, and under what regulations. No principle ought to be held more sacred than that this intercourse cannot subsist on any other footing than that of the direct permission of the State. It would appear that the declaration of war is a sovereign act, and the Sovereign alone may l i m it the effects of a state of war hy permitting partial intercourse. I am merely asking the Attorney-General if he will satisfy himself on the point that I have raised, and consider whether, in view of this passage I have quoted, the Governor General has power to issue a proclamation of the kind referred to in the amendment)",13
80,Mr HUGHES,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [ 4 . 3 ] - I do not say that the Commonwealth has power to issue every kind of proclamation in regard to war or trading with an enemy. No doubt certain proclamations might conflict with the rights of the Sovereign, but the proposal before the Committee is of quite another kind. It was framed to suit the circumstances in which we in this country find ourselves. I think it very desirable that the Commonwealth should have power to issue a proclamation to deal with special circumstances arising here. There are other reasons for the provisionson which I need not dwell; but I have explained shortly to the Leader of the Opposition why we should have this power.",13
81,Mr FENTON,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"Maribyrnong) [4.5] I should like to know what would be the position in regard to goods received here prior to the issue of the proclamation,, and retailed by the agent of a German, firm - Would such retailing be permitted by the Bill?",13
82,Mr HUGHES,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"It would be one thin g if it took place prior to the 4th August, and quite a different thing if it was a f t e r the 4th August but prior to the issue of the proclamation.",13
83,Mr FENTON,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"Tak e the case of a large quantity of goods sent to Melbourneby German firms and probably arriving, here in German bottoms. Such goods are now being sold practically every day by the agents of German firms. Under this measure, would such sales be held to be trading with an enemy?",13
84,Mr HUGHES,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"West Sydney-Attor - ney-General) [ 4 . 7 ] - I must ask the honourable member to be content with an in complete answer. Paragraphs 6 and 7 of the proclamation of 12th September,, which is really the King's proclamation of 9th September, contain certain words,, which l i m it the operation and scope of theproclamation. Paragraph 6 readsProvided always that where an enemy has a branch locally situated in Britisb, allied, or neutral territory, not being neutral territory in Europe, transactions by or with such branch shall not be treated as transactions by or with an enemy. That, in all probability, covers the point to which the honourable member has referred. In the next paragraph, it is provided thatNothing in this proclamation shall be deemed to prohibit payments by or on account of enemies to persons resident, carrying onbusiness or being in our Dominions, if such payments arise out of transactions entered into before the outbreak of war or otherwise permitted. I think those provisions deal with the matter to which the honourable member has referred; but while, under the proclamation as it now stands, such transactions might conceivably be permissible, I do not wish it to be understood that they will necessarily remain so.",13
85,Mr GLYNN,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"Angas) [4.9] - There ha* been a good deal of confusion amongst merchants as to what really was prohibited by the proclamation. Some of the newspapers, I think, called attention to the explanation given by the Imperial Government which appeared in the Times of 22nd August last; and I may, perhaps, clear up some of the points to which the honourable member for Maribyrnong has drawn attention if I refer to a paragraph or two in that published explanation. It is stated that- . 1. For the purpose of deciding what transactions with foreign traders are permitted, the important thing is to consider where the foreign trader resides and carries on business, and not the nationality of the foreign trader. 2. Consequently there is, as a rule, no objection to British firms trading with German or Austrian firms established - in neutral or British territory. What is prohibited is trade with any firms established in hostile territory. 3. If a firm with head-quarters in hostile territory has a branch in neutral or British territory, trade with the branch is (apart from prohibitions in special cases) permissible as long as the trade is bond fide with the branch, and no transaction with the head ofilce is involved. The explanation then proceeds to deal with other matters covered by the proclamation. I take it that ordinary trading carried on in Australia, although between enemy subjects, is perfectly valid. All that we have in view is to prevent the enemy being strengthened by any interchanges that might be effected, and, so far as the proclamation covers them, they are invalid.",13
86,Mr HUGHES,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"They cannot, under cover of a branch, escape the operation of this measure, so far as its intent goes to prevent the enemy being strengthened.",14
87,Mr GLYNN,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"Quite so. I think the proclamation says that, in effect. We have to come back to the'question as to whether the goods have become part of the mass of goods in the country; the question of whether or not their origin has been German is irrelevant. transaction were not complete, but would be completed by the branch, it would, generally speaking, be invalid.",14
88,Mr FENTON,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,Would not the branch doing business here be really strengthening the enemy?,14
89,Mr GLYNN,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"We are dealing, not so much with the question of policy, as with that of interpretation.",14
90,Mr BRENNAN,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"But , referring to clause 3 in the explanation read by the honourable member, how is it possible to trade with an agent without involving the principal unless you exclude",14
91,Mr GLYNN,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"I have endeavoured to reconcile the two things by_ saying that if the transactions here with the enemy country were incomplete, and were to be completed through the branch itself, that would be invalid as against our proclamation ; but, if the goods were here, in possession of the branch, and were part of the general mass of goods in the community, their sale by a branch of a foreign firm would not be ' ' trading with an enemy ' ' under the proclamation. I suppose the position would be the same at common law.",14
92,Mr HUGHES,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"I am not going to say anything more than that; in my opinion, the honourable member for Angas has gone to the very uttermost in his statement of the case, and that I would not go so far as he has done.",14
93,Mr GLYNN,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"I am not offering a personal opinion. I have simply quoted an interpretation of a proclamation which, the Attorney-General thinks is 'identical in terms with that issued by the Commonwealth. Beyond that, I am not going. There is apparently a difficulty in reconciling the interpretation from which I have quoted with one's idea of common sense in the matter.",14
94,Mr RODGERS,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"Wannon) [4.15] - It would seem, from the explanations given to the Committee, that, under the Bill as it stands, a German firm might, by means of an agency in neutral territory, carry on as much trade as it desired with these States. There seems to be no effective barrier in the way. I understand that our trade and commerce law does not require all goods imported to be stamped so as to show the country of origin, and I should like to know how we are to prevent Australia sending away rivetsfor German guns in the shape of coin of the realm. Is the whole matter to be If the left to the international code of laws, or can we not provide more effectively than does this Bill against trading with an enemy?",14
95,Mr HUGHES,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [4.16] - I wish to say nothing more in regard to this matter. It is obviously undesirable to state too precisely what one thinks ought to be done, since the mere statement of it might prevent our doing what we considered desirable. But what this Bill gives this Commonwealth power to do is to issue a proclamation that may deal with the mattertouched upon by the honourable member;. and thab is all we want. I have given notice this afternoon of my intention to move for leave to introduce another measure which will still further strengthen the hands of the Commonwealth in dealing with goods which may conceivably be outside the scope of this measure. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 3 agreed to. Clause 4Penalty : Fifty pounds, or imprisonment tor six months, or both. Amendments (by Mr HUGHES ) proposed - That the word "" Fifty "" he left out, view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" Five hundred,"" and that the words ""six months"" be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" one year.""",14
96,Mr GLYNN,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"Angas) [4.18] - This being a war Bill , which will expire with the war, one cannot press one's opposition to the imposition of these heavy penalties. I wish to point out, however, that some comparatively trivial charges may be preferred under the Bill , and that an ordinary justice of the peace will have power to impose tliese very heavy penalties. There has been exhibited:., from time to time, a disinclination to vest justices of the peace with very wide powers. This is due, not to any desire to impute to them want of ability, but to the fact that there are so many justices of the peace that very great disparity sometimes occurs in the amount of penalties imposed by them. Under the Crimes Bill a justice of the peace cannot impose a penalty exceeding £ 1 0 0 ; but, under this amendment, a justice of the peace will h.ive the power to impose a maximum penalty of £500 . I do not wish, however, to press the matter.  [4.19] - Would it not be consistent with clause 3, in which the words "" not exceeding £ 5 0 0 "" occur, to provide in this case for a penalty "" not exceeding"" £ 5 0 0 ?",15
97,Mr GROOM,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,Unde r the Acts Interpretation Act this provision means that the penalty shall not exceed £ 5 0 0 .  it is not necessary to insert these words in the one case why should it be necessary to insert them in the other ?,15

99,Mr HUGHES,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"Attorney-GeneralWest Sydney) [ 4 . 2 0 ] - I move That the following words be added to the clause:-""o r proceedings under this Act."" This measure, if it is to be useful at all, has to be useful without any circumlocution or unnecessary legal entanglement. with a Evidence will necessarily be extremely hard to get, and, although it may be urged that the clause as proposed may deter witnesses from giving evidence, that difficulty would arise in any case.

JUDICIARY BILL. SECOND READING.",15
100,Mr HUGHES,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"West Sydney-At torney-General) [ 4 . 2 6 ] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. This is a Bill to amend the Judiciary Act 1903-12. Under section 76 of the Constitution, it is provided that Parliament may make laws conferring original jurisdiction on the High Court in any matter of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction. That jurisdiction has not yet been conferred. It is now proposed, by this Bill , to confer it . This w i l the High Court of Australia in the same position as the High Court of England. The jurisdiction conferred will be exereised in two distinctly different waysfirst, in regard to actions for salvage, towage, collisions, damages, wages, and so for t h ; and, secondly, in relation to prize. Admiralty jurisdiction generally is possessed at the present time by the various State Supreme Courts; and the jurisdiction which it is proposed to confer on the High Court in regard to such matters as salvage, towage, collision, & c , will be concurrent with that exercised by the State Courts. In regard to prize jurisdiction, the position is somewhat different. The Colonial Courts have jurisdiction in matters of prize, but they cannot exercise it unless specially authorized by His Majesty. These Courts are not Colonial, but Imperial; and the old practice was for the K in g to commission Prize Courts after the outbreak of war. But an Act of the British Parliament in 1894 provided that Prize Courts in the Possessions might be commissioned in times of peace, though they could not exercise the jurisdiction until the issue of a proclamation in time of war. In 1899, I think, a Commission was issued to the Lords of the Admiralty, who, in turn , conferred this jurisdiction on the various Supreme Courts of the States. This was, of course, dormant until revived by the issue of a proclamation by the ""ViceAdmiral of the Commonwealth; and the jurisdiction has been exercised by the six State Courts since that proclamation was issued.",15
101,Mr GROOM,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,Will the State Courts be left with concurrent jurisdiction?,16
102,Mr HUGHES,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"It is not proposed to interfere with the concurrent jurisdiction in maritime matters generally, but in regard to prize jurisdiction I wish to put my views before the House. At the outbreak of the war there were six Prize Courts in Australia; and those six, or such of them as have had occasion to exercise the jurisdiction, exercised it at their own discretion, and delivered judgments on lines they conceived to bei n harmony with what is termed international law, and not always with satisfaction and convenience to the Commonwealth. It is obviously undesirable that - there should, be six Courts exercising jurisdiction in a matter of this sort, without provision for uniformity of some l place kind. The decisions given have been, in. many cases, conflicting; in one case, at any rate, no workable decision was given, nor has yet been given, so far as I know. These matters clearly come within the scope of the Commonwealth, intimately concerning, as they do, both the Defence Department and the Department of Trade and Customs, which have to primarily move in this regard. Under the circumstances, it is most desirable that the Commonwealth should be vested with the necfessary jurisdiction.'. Th© Bill does not create Prize Courts, b ut merely confers maritime and admiralty jurisdiction on the High Court; and it is proposed to request the Home authorities to vest prize jurisdiction in that Court. At the same time, it is proposed to make representations that there is not suflicient reason for the retention of prize jurisdiction by the State Courts; and the reason for this is, I tliink, perfectly clear. Maritime jurisdiction generally, in regard to salvage, towage, wages, collisions, and so on, will remain concurrent and exercisable by the States and the Commonwealth. W it h regard to prize jurisdiction, it is, as I say, intended to represent to the Admiralty that there are not suflicient reasons for retaining the concurrent jurisdiction of the States. This Bill is one which the experience of both Governments, since the outbreak of ihe war, has shown to be necessary.",16
103,Mr GLYNN,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"Angas) [4.34] - This is a Bill that ought to pass without much discussion. I understand that the measure accomplishes two things, one of which is to give the High Court, under the Constitution, maritime and admiralty jurisdiction, but it does not define what that jurisdiction amounts to. Whatever that jurisdiction is-thoug h the High Court has given it , probably rightly, a narrower interpretation than is given in America-it is conferred by the Bill . As to Prize Courts, I confess that in reading the Bill I was somewhat puzzled as to what was to be the position of the Supreme Courts of the States who have exercised this jurisdiction. Some of these are Prize Courts, under an Act of 1890, the title of which I forget, but under which these Courts are proclaimed A d miralty Courts. Now, it is proposed by this - Bill to make the High Court a Court in prize matters. I do not know what its real relation to the State Courts will be. Ib is assumed that there will be an appeal from their decisions. think the Attorney-General assumes that there vvill be an appeal to the High Court. tainly. """,16
104,Mr HUGHES,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,There can be only an appeal to the Priv y Council.,17
105,Mr GLYNN,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"There is that appeal, and, notwithstanding that their jurisdiction comes from the Act of 1890, if they are State Courts as well as Vice-Admiralty Courts there will be an appeal to the High Court, because that appeal is preserved - by the Constitution in every case in which there was the right of appeal from the State Courts to the Privy Council at the time when the Constitution name into force.",17
106,Mr HUGHES,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,That does not apply to Prize Courts.,17
107,Mr GLYNN,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,The point is whether the State Courts in deciding on prize matters are State Courts under the Constitution.,17
108,Mr HUGHES,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"As they are not Colonial Courts in the sense used in the Constitution, the presumption is that that section will not apply.",17
109,Mr GLYNN,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"I do not think it will apply. I do not think they are State Courts for the purposes of appeal. The matter was discussed by Keith in his work on responsible government in relation to Canada, and, referring to Australia, he mentioned the Courts of Victoria and New South Wales, and expressed the opinion that they would not be State Courts. They have their jurisdiction from an earlier Act, or from patents issued earlier than the Act of 1890. Their jurisdiction was independent of that Act. A doubt may exist as to whether such jurisdiction is subject to appeal to the High Court. If the Attorney-General will get the Imperial Government to have all prize matters dealt with by the High Court, with power to appoint the Supreme Courts to help in the matter, I think the end a very desirable object to be accomplished. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee: Clause 1 agreed to . ' Clause 2 (Amendment of section 30).",17
110,Mr FENTON,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,Maribyrnong) [4.38] Does the Attorney-General take power under this measure to use enemy vessels now held as prizes!,17

Bill reported without amendment j report adopted. Standing Orders suspended, and Bill read a third time. CRIM ES BILL. SECOND READING .",17
114,Mr HUGHES,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [4.41] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. Though this measure comes before the Chamber for the first time, it is by no means a stranger to very many of us. It is one of those measures which, though urgently necessary and without a blot upon their escutcheons, are ruthlessly swept aside by every party from time to time. We on this side have done it , and I have no doubt that if we were down to bedrock we would do it again. The Bill deals with offences against the Commonwealth, but does not apply to offences against individuals; that is a fact to be noted at the outset. The present position of the Commonwealth in regard to offences committed against any law of the Commonwealth is anomalous and unsatisfactory. In some cases the Commonwealth legislation creates offences and provides penalties, but for the greater part of the Commonwealth's sphere of legislation the Commonwealth has to have recourse to State Courts. The State Courts, in their turn , deal with offences under the common law and statutory law, and with offences against the Commonwealth for which there is no statutory sanction in any State Acts, as it has been held that the Commonwealth cannot have recourse to the common law, it follows that in every case where an offence committed against the Commonwealth is not dealt with under any State Statute the proceedings by the Commonwealth in respect to that offence stop short at committal. The Commonwealth may deal with the matter up to the point when the offender is committed for t r i a l, but beyond that it has no status at all. Obviously, that is a most undesirable state of affairs, and it affected the monwealth very materially in several important prosecutions quite recently, notably Customs frauds and frauds against the Maternity Allowance Act . Control by the Commonwealth is very desirable. Certainly, lack of control is most undesirable, and it furthe r involves additional expense which, in the aggregate, is very considerable. The Bill makes offences against the Commonwealth offences against the law of the Commonwealth, and, therefore, justiciable in the Commonwealth Courts. For instance, as we now have full control of coinage, it follows that offences against the Commonwealth law will include coining, and offences of a cognate character. The Bill will deal with forgery-forgery , of course, of any Commonwealth instrument or power, not forgery of the signature of an individual, but the forgery of the signature of a High Court Justice, or any authority whose signature is necessary for giving effect to some instrumentality or power of the Commonwealth. One effect of the Bill will be to harmonize, throughout Australia, all procedure in regard to offences against the Commonwealth. At present, it often occurs that proceedings begun in one State in regard to an offence produce a totally different result from proceedings begun in another State in regard to the same offence. This occurs because the laws in each State are different, and is a most undesirable thing. The defect is remedied by the Bill . Uniform methods of procedure will replace the divergent State methods, and there will be uniform penalties. The measure does not, except in very few cases, create new offences. It must not be regarded as a new Criminal Code, nor does it make punishment more drastic. All the Bill does is to give the Commonwealth power to deal with offences against itself, or in relation to those powers which it exercises. In a few words, I may give the genealogy of the measure. I shall not be so forgetful of what I owe to myself, and to my friends opposite, as to say anything about its more recent adventures. The measure is based on the Queensland Criminal Code of 1889, which was drafted by Sir Samuel Griffith, the present Chief Justice of the Commonwealth, and was based on the English draf t Code of 1880. This English Code was drawn up by a Royal Commission appointed in 1878, comprising Lord Blackburn, Mr Justice Barry, Mr Justice Com- Lush, and Sir James Fitzjames Stephen. These very celebrated jurists furnished the model on which the English Code was drafted. The Canadian Code, and also Pennefather's d r a f t Code of South Australia, have also been looked at in connection with the drafting of this Bill , and several very important principles have been taken from them. It is most i m portant to remember that, except in regard to espionage and offences against the Commonwealth, such as copying plans of fortresses, and obtaining military secrets, and such offences against the vital in terests of the nation, the measure before us creates no new offences, if , indeed, it creates offences of that k in d ; because, in also one way or another, they are nearly all covered by State law or common law. The Bill is divided into eight parts. Part I . deals with procedure, principles of criminal liability, and general matters. It gives power to the Court to declare persons habitual criminals. It gives power to inflict cumulative and concurrent sentences, and it enables prisoners to be released on licence. It also gives power to issue search warrants. Part II . deals with offences against the Government, such as treason, sedition, destruction or damage of Commonwealth property. Part III . deals with offences relating to the administration of justice, such as judicial and official corruption. Offences relating to coinage, dealt with in Part IV . , have relation to foreign coinage as well as Australian coinage. By Part V . , forgery is limited to the forgery of official seals, signatures, documents, and papers. Heavy penalties are provided for these things. Offences by and against public officers ""are dealt with at length in Part VI . Part VII . , which applies to a breach of official secrecy, is based on the Imperial Official Secrets Act of 1911 relating to espionage. The matters dealt with are unlawful spying, communicating or receiving secret information with regard to the defences and harbors of Australia, the harboring of spies, and the taking of unlawful soundings. Persons suspected of espionage may be arrested without warrant. Prosecutions under this part of the Bill require the consent of the Attorney-General. Part VIII . covers a number of miscellaneous offences, including conspiracy, and the buying and selling of public offices. The Bill is a fairly lengthy one. Some matters that were formerly included in it have been excised; but I think it sufficiently covers the ground. The measure should long ago have been introduced, and I apologize for this, and all other Governments that have gone before us, for the fact that it has not been introduced earlier; but it is especially necessary at the present juncture, because, righ t throughout the British Dominions, the law in regard to espionage may be designated as shamefully lax. I suppose the British people are the most trustfu l on earth, but there comes a point where trust and confidence in one's fellow man becomes almost a crime. Certainly, some measure of this kind, conferring powers on the Commonwealth to protect its military and naval secrets, and to deal with spies, and those who make a profession of obtaining information of value to their respective Governments for the purpose of presently, or later, inflicting harm upon the Commonwealth, is obviously necessary at the present time; and this Bill will confer those powers. I. shall not deal at any greater length with the measure, but I shall be very glad to supply information to honourable members as and when they may require it with regard to its various provisions. So far as I know this measure cannot be regarded as a penal code in the sense that it creates new crimes, excepting those crimes that have relation to espionage,; and the obtaining of information with regard to our naval or military secrets, fortresses, harbors, and so on. It is not to be regarded as imposing additional provisions with regard to ordinary offences and crimes-suc h as forgery, perjury, coining, and so on. W it h regard to the corruption of the Judiciary and of public officers, I shall not say that under this measure the public might not have greater opportunities for the punishment of such offences. I hardly think it will be so, because I believe that under the-common law and statutory law now in force, every offence, excepting those dealing with espionage and the like, is already covered. The object of the Bill is to enable the Commonwealth to exercise jurisdiction, and to have power in respect of offences against itself and the various laws made under the Constitution. The necessity for uniformity in the matter is obvious. The delay in the prosecution of offences under existing circumstances is considerable, and the expense is a very material item. Mr Hughes.",17
115,Mr GLYNN,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"Angas) [4.58] - The Attorney-General has said that this is a Bill of many sources, and, I might say, of multiple parentage. I think that in 1909, in his policy speech delivered at Ballarat, Mr Deakin foreshadowed the introduction of a Bill of this kind. The measure must have been added to recently, as. I have never previously seen a d r a f t of it so longas that now before us.",19
116,Mr HUGHES,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,I have known of the measure ever since I have been here.,19
117,Mr GLYNN,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"I know that such a measure was publicly referred to during a previous election campaign. There have been some additions made to the previous d r a f t which, I think, are questionable, and to which reference can be more properly made in Committee. I find, for in stance, the old offence-whic h is almost as old as Magna Charta-abou t insisting upon excessive bail, is under this measure made a statutory offence. No such provision, I tliink, exists in any of the States, with the exception of Queensland, and the marginal note to the clause in this Bill dealing with the matter shows that it is taken from Sir Samuel Griffith's criminal code of 1889 or 1890. The main object of the Bill , I take to be, to cover the defect that in some cases we have no jurisdiction to prosecute at common law. For instance, there is the case mentioned with regard to the Maternity Allowance Act . We can, under that Act, prosecute an in dividual for f r a u d ; but, where there is a conspiracy to defraud under the Act , there is a doubt whether an indictment will lie. An offence which may be the subject of a common law prosecution in the State Courts, because it is an offence against a State law, is made a statutory offence here by the Bill . That appears to me to be the main object of the measure; but there are certain other offences introduced which might be better considered in Committee than at this stage. On the whole, the Bill is one on which very few words need be said on the second reading.",19
118,Mr GROOM,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"Darling Downs) [5.1] This Bill was under consideration, I think, as far back as 1907. I think that very properly it is, to a very great extent, based upon the criminal code drafted by the present Chief Justice of the High Court when he was Chief Justice of Queensland. I have not had time to go through the measure very carefully, but I have noticed one or two instances of departures from the phrasing of the Queensland criminal code. I need only say that the Queensland criminal code is really a monumental work, which will stand to the everlasting credit of Sir Samuel Griffith, as a parliamentary draftsman and a jurist. The experience of those who have worked under that code in the Courts of Law is that the drafting has been very carefully done, and, on the whole, has proved to be excellent. I mention this to the Attorney General because I presume he has carefully considered the deviations in this measure from the original draft, and will be able to give some justification for the departures to which I refer. The honourable gentleman will admit that, when a Statute is shown to have worked well, it is a dangerous thing to depart from its phraseology. The deviations from the Queensland Criminal Code may be mentioned when we get to the Committee stage of the Bill. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee: Clauses 1 to 4 agreed to. Clause 5Any person who aids, abets, counsels, or procures, or, by act or omission, is in any way directly or indirectly knowingly concerned in or party to the commission of any offence against this Act or any other Act, whether passed before or after the commencement of this Act, shall be deemed to have mitted that offence, and shall be punishable accordingly. Mr Glynn"" (Angas) [5.4] - I draw attention to the fact that this clause seems to be retrospective. The Attorney General will notice the words ""whether passed before or after the commencement of this Act."" I was asked about this matter in relation to another Statute. I think that the clause is all right in this measure, as making it retrospective in relation to an Act of Parliament.",19
119,Mr HUGHES,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [5.5] - I shall be glad if the honourable member for Angas can make any suggestions as we go along. If I am unable to agree with them at once, I shall have inquiries made into the points raised before the Bill reaches another place, and we shall be prepared to make any reasonable amendments that may be suggested. Clause agreed to. Clauses 6, 7, and 8 agreed to. Clause 9 (Seizure and condemnation of forfeitable goods).",20
120,Mr GLYNN,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"Angas) [5.6] - We are dealing now with offences, and arrests and examinations without warrant. I do not know to what extent the provisions of the Customs Act are being varied, but I think that they are being varied to some extent.",20
121,Mr HUGHES,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,I shall consult with the honourable and learned member about the clause.,20
122,Mr GLYNN,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"The first part of the clause is taken, to some extent, from the Customs Act, and I have found a slight variation from the wording of that Act. The latter sub-clauses do not seem to have been taken, at all events verbally, from the Act. There is a power of condemnation given to the Attorney-General such as under the Customs Act is vested in the Minister of Trade and Customs or the Collector of Customs. We ought not, without knowing what we are doing, to vary the terminology of offences which are, in substance, provided for in the Customs Act, nor to vary the method of administering provisions constituting such offences. Clause agreed to. Clauses 10 and 11 agreed to. Clause 12 (How offences punishable).",20
123,Mr GLYNN,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"Angas) [5.7] - In comclause 13 it is provided that information may be laid and prosecutions commenced by any person. Some of the offences dealt with here are comparative novelties, and in one or two instances the power of any person to prosecute is cut down. In some cases, but not in this part, the Attorney-General must first give his consent. I hope that too much power to commence prosecutions will not be given to individuals, especially in regard to offences that are new. Another point to which I draw attention is this: In some of the States notwithstanding the limitations imposed upon the Courts of summary jurisdiction, there are cases in which, on the person charged exercising his option to be tried before those Courts instead of being committed for trial, he may, if the circumstances allow, receive a severer punishment than it is ordinarily within the power of such Courts to inflict. In South Australia that is provided for by what is known as the Minor Offences Act. I do not know whether the Bill preserves this arrangement. In some of the States magistrates may not imprison for a longer period than six months, but, if at a preliminary inquiry-before a magistrate an offender exercises his option to be tried at once, imprisonment of two or three years may be inflicted on him. Clause agreed to. Clauses 13 to 16 agreed to. Clause 17 (Offenders previously convicted).",20
124,Mr GLYNN,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"Angas) [5.10] - It is provided here that if a person who has been convicted is again charged with an offence, which may not be the same kind of offence as that for which he was convicted, the maximum penalty shall be doubled. The provision is taken from the Queensland code, and I do not think appears in the jurisprudence of the other States. Generally the maximum penalty is a large one, and Judges inflict a heavy penalty for a second offence.",21
125,Mr GROOM,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,Darling Downs) [5.11]. - It seems to me that the marginal note needs amending. The reference to section 630 of the Queensland consolidated code isincorrect. Clause agreed to. Clause 18 (Indeterminate sentences).,21
126,Mr GLYNN,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"Angas) [5.12] - The clause opens up a rather vexed question, which I shall not delay the measure by discussing. In some States the principle of indeterminate sentences has been applied, though not to any great extent, but there has been a good deal of debate as to its efficacy. We are now adopting it without discussion. I hope that the Attorney General has some information as to its desirability.",21
127,Mr HUGHES,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"West Sydney-At torney-General) [5.13] - The principle has been adopted in the criminal code of many countries, and in that of some, if not all, of the States of Australia. mit that arguments may be advanced against it, but the penologists and criminologists are in agreement that the power to impose indeterminate sentences is necessary to deal with the habitual criminal.",21
128,Mr GLYNN,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,You may be covering wider class than is intended.,21
129,Mr HUGHES,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,I give the honourable member my assurance that I will ascerQueensland tain the authority upon which the clause is based-the Statute which it followsand that if there is a departure from the existing law I will consult him before the measure gets through the second-reading stage in another place. Clause agreed to. Clauses 19 to 24 agreed to. Clause 25 (Treason).,21
130,Mr GLYNN,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"Angas) [5.17] - I merely wish to call attention to the fact that in this clause the Queensland code has been varied. Of course that does not matter so long as the variation is all right. The clause provides that,Any person who within the Commonwealth or any territory(a) instigates any foreigner, &c. whereas the Queensland code enacts that "" any person at war with the Sovereign, &c."" It will be seen, therefore, that the latter is a much more restrictive provision. Clause agreed to. Clause 26 agreed to. Clause 27 (Assisting prisoners of war to escape).",21
131,Mr GLYNN,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"Angas) [5.19] - I would point out that in this clause there is also a variation from the Statute from which it has been taken. It declares that any person who ""knowingly"" aids an alien enemy, &c, whereas the Queensland Act provides that "" any person who knowingly and advisedly"" aids, &c. Clause agreed to. Clause 28 agreed to. Clause 29 (Interfering with political liberty).",21
132,Mr GLYNN,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"Angas) [5.20] - This provision seems somewhat anomalous. It provides'that any person who, by violence or threats or intimidation, interferes with the free exercise by any other person of any political right or duty shall be guilty of an offence, and shall be liable I ad- to a term of imprisonment. Under the State law a person cannot be charged with preventing a man from discharging his political duties, although if he molests him in any way he becomes liable for assault, and, apart from molestation, may be liable for damages. But the a political aspect of the matter is not covered by the ordinary State laws. In this clause we have a codification of the law which was enacted in 1889, and portions of that law were pretty old-fashioned even then. Clause agreed to. Clause 30 agreed to. Clause 31 (Seizing goods in Commonwealth custody), o Mr Glynn (Angas) [5.22] - Thes e clauses are pretty drastic. with the destruction or interference with property. Clause 50 of the Bill is apparently designed to deal with such cases as that of the seizure of property by the New South Wales Government. Beading through the Bill , I have come to the conclusion that in some cases the abettor is to be visited with a bigger penalty than is the principal offender. However, I merely draw attention to the matter. Clause agreed to. Clauses 32 to 34 agreed to. Clause 35 (Judge or magistrate acting oppressively or when interested).",21
133,Mr GLYNN,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,Angas) [5.23] - I confess that I do not know the authority from which this clause has been taken. I think that provision exists in the Queensland oode for dealing with this very old offence - the offence of requiring excessive bail. I had thought that such offences had died .out of the Statute. Clause agreed to. Clauses 36 to 49 agreed to. Clause 50 (Removing property under seizure).,22
134,Mr GLYNN,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"Angas) [5.24] - Here , again, I desire to call attention to the fact that different penalties are provided for what are practically the same offence. For instance, clause 31 imposes a maximum penalty of one year's imprisonment for certain offences in relation to seizing goods which are in the custody of the Commonwealth.",22
135,Mr GROOM,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,But in the present clause something more than a seizure is in volved.,22
136,Mr GLYNN,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"I know that. under this clause the actual penalty provided for tampering with property is two years, instead of one year. It may be deliberately done, but I merely call attention to it .",22
137,Mr HUGHES,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"It is all riglit . Clause agreed to. Clauses 51 to 70 agreed to. Clause 7 1 Any person who, being a Commonwealth oflicer, publishes or communicates any fact which comes to his knowledge by virtue of his office, and which it is his duty to keep secret, or any document which comes to his possession by virtue of his office, and which it is his duty to keep secret, except to some person to whom he is authorized to publish or communicate it, shall be guilty of an offence. Penalty: Imprisonment for two years. They deal Mr Glynn (Angas) [5.28] - I see it is noted that this clause has also been taken from the Queensland Act . It is a pretty wide provision, and I hope that it has been considered. "" A Commonwealth officer."" I take it , includes a Minister. There is a penalty up to two years' im prisonment imposed upon any one whose duty it is to keep a secret, and who does not do so. I suppose that the same penalty will apply to both sexes. If a Minister should disclose the contents of some official document, I suppose it will come within the meaning of the provision. The safeguard, I think, is that the Attorney-General will have to consent to a prosecution under this part of the Bill . I am not sure, but I think that that is so.",22
138,Mr HUGHES,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,Yes .,22
139,Mr GLYNN,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,Eve n against himself.,22
140,Mr HUGHES,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,Yes .,22
141,Mr GLYNN,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"I hope it is so. This means that such an indefinite thing as not keeping an official secret will subject the person who commits the offence to a penalty up to two years' imprisonment. The provision is somewhat novel. It appears in the Queensland Act , but I do not know where else it does appear. My impression is that you must be explicit as to what has to be kept secret. I do not think it will cover the disclosure of a document marked "" Confidential"" as between a Minister and the Secretary of State for the Colonies, because there is no imperative duty to any one there.",22
142,Mr HUGHES,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,Jus t tur n up the provision in the Queensland Act and see what it is. B ut,22
143,Mr GLYNN,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"I think that the secrecy must be imposed by the official superior, and must be clearly made a matter of secrecy, and then if the officer should break that he will commit an offence.",22
144,Mr HUGHES,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"If the honourable member will leave this clause in the same position as the others, I will consult him about the point.",22
145,Mr FISHER,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"Is it not governed by the words "" and which it is his duty to keep secret "" 1",22
146,Mr GLYNN,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"I think it is the disclosing of knowledge which the officer ought to keep secret, but are we quite sure as to what class of knowledge that is ? I will say no more about the matter. Clause agreed to. Clause 72Any person who, being a Commonwealth officer, steals, or fraudulently misappropriates or converts to his own use, any property belonging to the Commonwealth or any public authority under the Commonwealth, shall be guilty of an indictable offence. Penalty: Imprisonment for seven years.",23
147,Mr HUGHES,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"West Sydney-At torney-General) [5.32] - I move That after the word "" Commonwealth,"" line 5, the following words be inserted- "" or any property which has come into his possession by virtue of his employment."" The object of this amendment is to cover cases of embezzlement. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clauses 73 to 91 and title agreed to. Bill reported with an amendment. Standing Orders suspended, and Bill passed through its remaining stages. COMMONWEALTH BANK BILL.",23
148,Mr EISHER,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister) [ 5 . 3 8 ] - I desire, by leave, to introduce a Bill to amend the Commonwealth Bank Act 1911.",23
149,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"No ; there is no hurry about it . SPECIAL ADJOURNMENT - W Motio n (by Mr EISHER ) agreed toThat the House, at its rising, adjourn until Wednesday next. ADJOURNMENT. ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRIES - MUTILA TION OF SHADE TREES.",23
150,Mr EISHER,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister) [5.40] - In movingThat the House do now adjourn, I wish to thank the Opposition for allowing us tb pass four Bills. I desire to express my appreciation of their action, because these matters were really urgent.",23
151,Mr FENTON,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"Maribyrnong) [5.41]. - I desire to refer to a matter which, in a sense, is, perhaps, of too much importance to bring up on the motion for adjournment ; but I take the opportunity of asking the Prime Minister whether, in these exceptional times, the Government are taking any action to take the lead in organizing industries. We aTe going to have an amendment of the T a r if f , which will help us considerably; but a great deal more can be done in many ways to 0 give a fillip to Australian industries. I trust the Government will take the lead in the matter, even if they go to the length of calling men who are worth consulting throughout the Commonwealth into conference, in order that a strong campaign may be instituted in favour of promoting Australian industries. We should endeavour, not only to regulate, organize, and consolidate those already in existence, but also to do everything possible to establish new ones. When the war cloud lifts, which we hope will not be long, I trust Australia will be so organized industrially, commercially, and in a trading sense, that we shall be able to take full advantage of the opportunities that must accrue as a consequence of the war. I hope that every phase of commercial and business life, as well as the employees, will be represented in the conference that I suggest, in order that some organization may be formed with this national object in view, so that we may be able, when the war is over, to take our stand among the nations of the world in supplying those things for the manufacture of which we have millions of pounds' worth of raw material in this country.",23
152,Mr GROOM,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"Darling Downs) [5.43]. ill the Prime Minister bring under the notice of the Postmaster-General the matter of the mutilation of shade trees in the streets of various cities? This is a question of some moment to a good many cities in Australia. At Toowoomba, in particular, some beautiful trees, which - form part of a scheme that has been fostered for years to improve the appearance of the city, have been injured. The Department should devise some method to minimize the mutilation of shade trees.",23
153,Sir JOHN EORREST,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,Does the honourable member refer to the telegraph and telephone wires? It is too bad.,23
154,Mr GROOM,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"Yes . We have recently had visits from town-planning experts who have been preaching the heautification of our cities, and it seems a pity that something cannot be done in the direction I have mentioned. These trees take years to grow, and it seems rather drastic to mutilate them for the sake of getting the poles and wires along. Probably a little care and thought might have devised a method of providing the telephonic facilities, which are absolutely necessary for the people, and at the same time preserving the beauty of the trees.",23
155,Mr FISHER,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister) [5.44] - I quite, agree with honourable member. We Australians are more or less an artistic people, and the shade trees have a value of their own, apart altogether from the artistic view point. I shall be glad to again invite the attention of the Postmaster-General and of the Public Works authorities to the matter, so that the mutilation of the beauty spots in the way of trees may be, as far as possible, avoided. One way to do it would be to underground most of our wires; but that is a grave matter of polioy.",24
156,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"The - wires could be taken along side streets instead of along the main streets, as they generally are. now.",24
157,Mr FISHER,TRADING WITH THE ENEMY,"As the right honourable member and the honourable member for Darling Downs have been about twice as long in office as I have, I can hardly be accused of being the cause of this trouble; bnt I quite agree withtheir ideas on the subject. I am entirely with the honourable member for Maribyrnong regarding the question of organizing industries. Indeed, I go much further; but I find that there is a constitutional difficulty more or less embarrassing from our point of view. The Government have, however, with a view of attaining the object that the honourable member has put forward, asked the representatives of the States to come to Melbourne in ahout a fortnight or more, to consider all these matters, together with others, with a view of endeavouring to arrive at an understanding or agreement which will enable us to proceed with any such enterprises, and so help to prevent unemployment at the present time, whilst at the same time developing national industries, which will place Australia, even in times of peace, in a safer position than she occupies today. I cannot go any further than that. Something like seven years ago this House unanimously carried a motion in favour of the nationalization of the iron indus-try; yet today we are no further forward in that respect than, we then were. I believe that a vast number of the people of Australia are in favour of such an essential commodity as iron being manufactured in Australia in at least sumcient quantities to meet our own requirements. If we can come to an the arrangement that will enable us to proceed with the work, it will be well for the country. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 5.47 p.m.",24
