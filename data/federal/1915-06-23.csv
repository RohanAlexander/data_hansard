2,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I thank the honourable member for having brought the. matter forward.

12,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"The first report of the on sugar Committee is as follows: Objcot of Committee - The duty of this deCommittee is generally to connect the - Home and Commonwealth Governments with Australian industries, and particularly(1) to ascertain the requirements of Home Government at the present time as regards munitions of war; (2) to ascertain the requirements of Australian Army and Navy that still remain to be fulfilled : (3) to report how far and in what manknown, ner tliese requirements can best supplied by Australiau manufactools turers, with a view of assisting Britain in the present w.ar, and cooperating with State Government Departments and Chambers Manufacture with respect to same; (4) to report ""to what extent Australia can bo rendered self-reliant in materiel in the futur e by the u t zation of local industries, and enlarging present or installing ther Government factories or arsewar. nals. As regards (1 ) , the Home Government have been requested by cable to furnish articles required. Particularly attention was directed to the desire to furnish 18-pounder H.E. and shrapnel shell, if these were required, and specifications for thu manufacture of these shells was specially requested. The Cliamber of Manufactures has been given a provisional list of .articles that at the present time being imported to Britain from abroad, and inquiry has been made as to the extent these articles can he produced if desired, with a view of passing this information to the British War 'Office. As regards (2 ) , the Quartermaster-General has been asked to indicate if there is any shortage of material or stores into which the Committee eould inquire, with a view of augmenting the output in Australia; and the D i rector of Naval Stores has been asked to forward a list of stores at present imported which it is considered could be produced or manufactured in Australia. When replies to these inquiries have been received they will be placed before the Chamber of Manufactures. As regards (3 ) , the attention of the Committee has been principally directed to the possibilities of producing 18-pounder H.K..and shrapnel shells, in the event of the replies of the Jlomo Government heing to the effect that these would be acceptable. Manufacture of Steel - Information of the nature >of the steel required for this purpose has been obtained, .but this information has not been officially confirmed; nevertheless specification has been drawn up, with the assistance of the Melbourne University, which ordnance. will be furnished to steel manufacturers, as a guide in making the necessary experiments. The various universities of Australia known to have the neeessary plant for have been asked to co-operate on behalf of the Munitions Committee. Manvufactme of Shell 'Bodies' - As regards the manufacture of shells, it is apparent many firms can produce the shell bodies required, provided they are furnished with the .specification for their manufacture, and .also with steel whioh is .guaranteed by the Governthat ment as fulfillin g the tests and analysis quired by the War Office. [154]-- 2 It 'might be mentioned in this respect that there is a difference in the amount of inforthe mation .available as regards the two naturesof shell. The methods of manufacture of shrapnel shell of earlier patterns are generallythe known, and although information as to the improvements that have been effected in the latest patterns (Marks V . and VT.) is not it is probably not sufficient to prevent be manufacturers from now preparing plants and for the manufacture of the latest patternas soon as these additional details are known.. But as regards high explosive shell bodies, of the supply of which is probably more urgent, no information is available as to their dimensions or method of manufacture. Great care is known to be necessary in the production of war these shells, owing to the damage that would i l i - ensue from a premature explosion, and absoby lute reliability is essential. This shell was fur - not issued to 18-pounder guns prior to this As regards (4 ) , the Committee are not yet a list of - prepared to issue a report. An Indication of the Future Wort: of the Committee - It appears possible that the work of the Committee may expand and become a large department, with functions at present unfilled by either the Navy or military branch of the Defence Porce. The future functions of are the Committee possibly may be as follows:,(«) Obtaining particulars of suitable firms capable of producing certain articles, and of the quantity that can be produced by these firms. (b) Investigation into stocks and supplies - of raw - material available for present and - future manufacture of munitions, for assistance of the Defence Department and manufacturers. (c) Provision for the inspection, test, and proof of raw material, particularly ammunition and ordnance. {d) Beport as to the desirability of expanding ^present and the institution of further Government factories or arsenals for the manufacture at guns and ammunition, (e) Placing the contracts for war materiel not at present provided for. Shipping und Transport Arrangements - A 3 regards (e), the Committee foresee great difficulties in the provision of .personnel for this, a purpose, particularly .of experienced inspector and staff .for the inspection of ammunition and The universities have expressed their will ingness to assist, and probably can do so effectively in the analysis and test of steel ami testing steel ' other materials. The institution of a Governmental Department of Inspection of Warlike Stores is essenthat tial, and the Committee think it could b»; g radually buil t up from the resources of the ommonwealth. As regards (cZ), the Committee recommend! no attempt should be made in the direcretion of establishing an arsenal for the complete manufacture of ammunition naiaS thoroughly qualified persons are available to advise in this matter. Other Matters - Owing to the publicity given to the subject with which the Committee are concerned, a tremendous number of public and private persons have written to state that they arc desirous of assisting the Committee with their advice or services or by recommending thoseof some other person, and every firm and society is anxious to place its services at our disposal. It is feared that many useful offers at this time will be passed over, and that many correspondents will feel aggrieved at receiving a mere acknowledgment, perhaps a belated one; but it is hoped that this difficulty will soon be overcome by augmenting the staff. It is suggested that the press may give licity to the fact that applicants for employment will be requested to send full particulars and references when it is found that their services are likely to be required. Personal interviews are not welcome at the present time, which is fully occupied in investigation into the ways and means of co-ordinating the available resources of Australia for assisting in the present war. The above has been approved by the Minister. I lay the report on the table. Ordered to be printed. MUNITIONS FOR SOUTH AFRICA .",4

36,Mr JENSEN,NORTHERN TERRITORY,"The answer to the honourable member's question is : Apparently the break alluded to is that between 31st December, 1914, when the High Commissioner was asked by cablegram to obtain quotes for a complete plant for the manufacture of quick-firing lS-pounder ammunition, and the 10th A p r i l, 1915; when the High Commissioner cabled brief details of Pratt and Whitney's estimate.

41,Mr GROOM,COMMONWEALTH SUGAR,"the Attorney General, upon notice I. Will he inform the House how many witnesses gave evidence before the authorized cers recently appointed under the War Precautions Act to inquire into the sugar supplies of the Commonwealth, and who such witnesses (if any) were? 2. Will he lay upon the table of this House copies of the evidence taken and documents (if any) used as evidence in such inquiry?",10
42,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH SUGAR,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are: 1. As it became evident at the outset of the inquiry that nearly all the stocks were held by the Colonial Sugar Eefining Company, the investigation was narrowed in scope. Questions were asked of Mr Knox, the general manager of the company, and Mr Symonds, the manager in Melbourne and the manager of the Millaqitin Company. Evidence was also taken from practically all the wholesale dealers in Sydney and Melbourne, and from most of the jam manufacturers. 2. I do not think it advisable. NA WALES.  General, upon notice Whether he will inform the House why it is necessary for the Postal Department to pay the Railway Commissioners of New South Wales £123,000 in 1915 for a curtailed railway mail serviee (many lines only running three days a week), whereas in 1913 the same Department paid only £121,811 for a full every-dayin-the-week service?",10
43,Mr SPENCE,MAIL SERVICE INNEW SOUTH,"The answer to the honourable member's question is: The increase in payment of £123,000, 19141915, as compared with £121,811, is principally due to the opening of new lines. Under the existing agreement between the Postmaster General and the Railway Commissioners of the several States, no reduction is made in the payment by the former when the frequency of the railway service is reduced. On the other no additional payment is made where the railway frequency is increased. The reduction or increase in frequency docs not, of course, materially affect the weight of the mails carried. The subject is receiving further consideration of this Department in connection with the now agreement now under attention. NA AUSTRALIA.",10

45,Mr MAHON,NORWEGIANS IN WESTERN,"The Attorney-General's opinion, which has now been received, confirms my previous intimation offi- to the effect that these Norwegians are contract immigrants as far as their shore work is concerned. I have called upon the company to furnish an explanation as to why the provisions of the Contract I m migrants Act were not observed. A full report, which the Customs authorities at Fremantle have despatched by mail, haa not yet been received; but a telegraphic summary states that the company have explained that, as the State Government were anxious to increase the production of high-class manure, the company undertook, in connection with the granting of a licence to capture and treat whales, to erect a shore factory for treatment of the offal which could not be dealt with on board ship through lack of space; that they were not aware that the Act was being infringed, as their own legal adviser did not consider the men came within scope of the Act, and no warning was given to them by the State Crown Law authorities, although they informed the State that it would be necessary to bring men from Norway; that the men signed on in Norway for the whaling season in Australia, and for return to Norway; that the work of erecting the patent guano factory would only occupy a short time; but that for four months the men would be engaged in whaling, and would be remunerated Minister mainly on the profit-sharing have also expressed regret for the infraction of the law, and have promised ties future compliance. The Customs authorities anticipate that the shore work will be completed by the end of July. I shall give the matter further consideration when the report referred to is received. RIFLE RANGES .

60,Mr JENSEN,NORWEGIANS IN WESTERN,"The answer to the honourable member's question is: The arrangements for reporting casualties, and disposing of the wounded are in the handsfit of the Imperial authorities, who have established a staff at Alexandria, under the command of a British officer, to attend to these matters. The wounded are distributed over hospitals established in Egypt and the Mediterranean, and some have been sent to England. These hospitals report cases which - develop into the in serious or dangerous stage, and the information is communicated to the next-of-kin immediately it is received here. It is considered almost impossible for any officer in Egypt or 'elsewhere to ascertain theIiospital a. man will be sent to immediately after bo is reported wounded, for, in all' probability, the wounded manwould be transferred from one hospital to another, according to his condition and treatment required,, as well as in. keeping with the exigencies of the survicei.

68,Mr JENSEN,NORWEGIANS IN WESTERN,"The answer to the honourable member's question is : 1. The amount of overtime shown, which averages 0.34 hours per man per week, is not considered excessive in time of war. (The number of hours shown in the report is 919$, not 1,019, as stated in the question.) 2. It is not practicable to eliminate overtime in the Ordnance Branch, owing to the undesirableness of relegating the responsibilities of certain classes of the work to temporary employees.

Yes, one of them did. 7. Yes. 8. The Minister visited the College on 23rd March last, but not specially on this matter, and at that time took the opportunity of explaining the position to the officers concerned. Arrangements were made for a course for the training of Citizen Force officers for the Australian Imperial Force to commence at the Royal Military College on 1st May, ending on 30th June. A second course is arranged from the 15th July to the 25th September.

80,Mr JENSEN,NORWEGIANS IN WESTERN,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are: 1. Yes. 2. Owing to the vacillating and unsettled condition of the fodder market of late, dealers have been disinclined to enter into contracts for any extended period, except at prices much higher than those at which the Department can operate within the Commonwealth and elsewhere.

81,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"West Sydney-Attor ney General) [3.45] - I should like, at the outset, Mr Speaker, to ask whether you propose to permit the debate on the Bill to cover the subject-matter of the five other Constitution Alteration Amendment Bills, the second reading of close them up. which has been set down for today? It will be impossible to confine the debate within the precise limits of this particular measure, and it certainly would conduce to the more effective discussion of this Bill , as well as of the others, if we were allowed within reasonable limits to deal with the whole of them in the one debate. It is not too much to say that they are so correlated that it is quite impossible to deal with them singly. I therefore ask whether we may have that liberty of debate which was accorded on a previous occasion.",15
82,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"It is true that the Constitution Alteration Amendment Bills are so interwoven that it would be, to a large extent, impossible for me to determine whether or not any overlapping has taken place, provided that honourable members kept to the constitutional questions involved. At the same time. I do not wish it to be understood that the sup- adoption of the course proposed by the Attorney-General is to be regarded as a precedent to be followed on all similar occasions. I am j'repared, in this debate, to allow th© broadest possible discussion of the constitutional questions in volved, and the introduction of all matters that are relevant to the questiou before the chair. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK (Parramatta) [4.38] - May I be permitted, sir, to ask a question?",15
83,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Yes .,15
84,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Attorney General is asking permission to take now the second-reading discussion over the six PAPERS. Bills. The trouble is that, under the Standing Orders, we are allowed only one hour and five minutes to debate the motion for the second reading of a Bill , and that would not be sufficient to enable us to deal with the important questions involved in the six measures.",15
85,Mr GREENE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"The Attorney-General, as the Minister introducing the measure, is allowed an hour and thirty-five minutes.",15
86,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I am not proposing to affect the honourable gentleman's right to - speak on the other Bills.,15

93,Mr GROOM,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I want to have the point made clear, Mr Speaker.",16
94,Mr WATT,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I rose to a point of order when the Leader of. the Opposition rose to request information from the Attorney-General. I still rise toa point of order, to ask if you rule, or propose to rule, that the discussion on this . Bill , being the first of a series of six, may i nclude the others-. If so, I take leave to submit for your consideration certain argumentswhy that is the wrong procedure.",16
95,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I would point out that ona former occasion, when Bills of a similar character were brought forward it was understood that it would, not be possible to confine the debate to any one particular measure then before the House; that they overlapped' each, other to some extent. Under; those circumstances, a general discussion was allowed on the whole of the questions.. That, however; can be done only with the consent of the House..

101,Mr WATT,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"M i g h t I point out that I do not want to interfere with the course of business in any way; but I would urge that, whilst some questions in the six are related, some are totally separated from each otlier. I ' think even theA t torney-General will admit that ; and, therefore, it will be impossible, if we follow parliamentary procedure, to take them altogether. The course which I sug r gest, with due deference to the Government, is to. bring down a resolutionwhich will cover all these issues, and the discussion of that can then precede the consideration of any of these Bills. That is the, course which was adopted on a similar occasion within: my knowledge. - Mr HUGHES - My experience is that * the measures are so correlated that one could not be discussed without touching on. the others.

To put it in anway, whereas in 1911 in a small poll of 1,248,226 electors, or 53.31 of those entitled .to vote, only 488,668 voted for the and 736,392 against it ; in n 1913, in the greatest poll ever recorded, 2,033,251 persons voted, or 73.66 per cent, of those entitled to vote, 917,155 voted for the amendment, and 941,947 against it. As there were 171,658 informal ' votes, or more than seven the number necessary to have given a majority for the amendment, it is more than probable that a majority of the electors did actually approve of it. cumstances have since arisen which make these amendments of the Constitution much more necessary than in 1911, or even in 1913. In presenting posals to the House, the task before me is at once easier and more difficult than it was in 1911. I had then only to explain our position under the Constitution the nature of the amendments; day I have also to explain and deal with many representations both of the purpose and scope of the amendments, to deal with some recent utterances of honourable members of this House which have given rise to the impression the people outside that this Parliament is already clothed with the powers which we are seeking by these means to obtain. must remind honourable members, at the outset, what the powers of this Parliament really are. This is a Parliament of enumerated powers. We are the creature of a Statute. It is to that Statute we must look for all our powers. If they are not there, we do not possess them. Our position is fundamentally from that of the States, which were originally sovereign powers, and could pass any laws they pleased. Their powers to pass laws were as limitless as the powers of the community itself. They could express, in terms of legislation, anything that they thought proper in the interests of the community. The States have those sovereign powers still, save to the extent to which they have been limited by the Constitution of the Federation. In order to understand what are our powers, we have to look at a document. We have to look at the Constitution to see what we may do. The States have to look at the Constitution only to see what they may not do. We must look at the Constitution to see what we can do, but we cannot do all there set out. For the experience of fifteen years has shown that many powers, apparently conferred upon the Commonwealth, really possessed by this Parliament. short, many of that imposing array of powers set out in section 51, and other parts of the Constitution, Mr Hughes. shadows of powers. The States are in no such position. They are sovereign, save to the extent to which they are limited by times the Constitution, and the real limitations imposed on them are few. They need look at no document, but may pass such legislation as the circumstances demand. CirThe High Court has been created for the purpose of interpreting the Constitution, and preventing the States and Commonwealth from exceeding the powers allothe pro- cated to them. The High Court is, of course, not a legislative body. Its functions are purely judicial. Its duty is not to make laws, but to declare what the and laws are. In its function of interpreter but to- of the Constitution, it has to say what our powers are, and not to say how we should use them. It is very necesand sary, at this juncture, to remind honourable members of this poiut, and I shall revert to it later. I have said amongst that the High Court is the interpreter of the Constitution. When, therefore, we are asked what our powers are, we I have not only to look at the Constitution as it stands, but to look at it in the light of the rules of interpretation which the High Court has laid down, and in the light of the decisions which the Court that has made in accordance with those rules. If , then, we are asked what the powers of the Commonwealth Parliament are, different we have to say that they are those enumerated in the Constitution as interpreted by the High Court. Beyond that we cannot go, for the High Court is the final arbiter of our powers. What the High Court says our powers are-thos e are our powers. What the High Court says the Constitution means-that it does mean. It is very necessary that I should, at every stage throughout this discussion, impress upon the minds of honourable members exactly the position in which we find ourselves. We are a most progressive community. No country is able to point to progress at a more rapid rate or in directions more varied than this Commonwealth during the last fifteen years. Trade and the manner of its development, manufactures, and general progress of the Commonwealth in one way and another, have been astounding. All over the world there has been treare not mendous development. Every day In ancient institutions are tumbling into the dust, new ones more suited to a progressive age are taking their place. Yet are but we are told that this country should govern itself according to a system of laws which was an anachronism at the time we adopted it , and which is now totally unsuited to our purpose, and which has been rendered less fit for our present purpose by the narrow interpretation placed upon the Commonwealth powers by the High Court and the Privy Council. This brings me directly to the consideration of the proposed constitutional amendments themselves. amendments in their form and substance are based upon sound principles and upon the teachings of experience. They aim, not at dealing with the symptoms of the malady from which the Constitution suffers, but at the eradi- ' cation of the disease. What is the disease from which the Constitution suffers? It arises from the illogical and unscientific allocation of the powers between the Commonwealth and the States. We have followed too slavishly the model laid down by the framers of the American Constitution. In their day, no doubt, they did what was wise and possible, but their day is not our day. The instrument which was sufficient for their purpose is quite inadequate for ours. They were legislating for a small community of men engaged in almost primitive occupations, isolated in groups far removed from one another, and carrying on their several businesses without order or that systematization arising out of, and necessary to deal with, the tremendous complexity of modern methods of production. There were special circumstances in the American Confederation which compelled the adoption - of a compromise. But I say without hesitation that the American Constitution never was fit even for the purpose for which it was intended, and is certainly unsuited for a community living under twentieth century conditions. The chief cause of the difficulty has always been the allocation of powers between States and Commonwealth upon lines which do not permit of - a clear line of demarcation being drawn between them. I have said that it is the ' function of the High Court to draw that line of demarcation, and say, "" This power belongs to the Commonwealth, and that power belongs to the States."" But how is the H i gh Court to. do that fairly if it is beyond the power of mortal man to say where a power begins and where it ends? There is neither logic, sense, nor reason in the division, for example, of the trade and commerce power. Commerce is a subject which, in its very nature, cannot be divided. Commerce is a national matter. It is intercourse. It begins, where intercourse begins and ends where intercourse ends. That is to say, commerce is, in its operation, coterminous with our territorial limits; and to attempt These to circumscribe its operations, and to declare that in such-and-such a district commerce must be subject to one law, and in another district to another law, is but to invite confusion and trouble. We have followed slavishly in the footsteps of the framers of the American Constitution in this respect. The American reports are full of cases irreconcilable, hopelessly confusing, and absurd, as a result of efforts to distinguish between what is State commerce and what is Inter-State commerce. If honourable members will look at what commerce is, they will see how utterly. impossible it is to distinguish between what is State commerce and what is Commonwealth commerce-to say what is Inter-State commerce and what is Intra-State commerce. You send a parcel from Albury to Wagga. That is Intra-State commerce, subject to State law. You send the same parcel from Albur-y to Wodonga, just across the Murray River, and that is Inter-State commerce, and so subject to Commonwealth law. You send a letter from Sydney to Melbourne, or you send a letter from Sydney to Wagga, and both are under the same law. Surely it would be as rational and logical to say that there should be a postal law governing the delivery of postal articles within a State, as well as a law governing postal deliveries between States, as it is to say that there should be separate commercial laws governing commerce inside a State and between States? You cannot draw a line between commerce within a State and commerce passing from one State to another. No such distinction is possible. This illogical and unscientific division of power' of trade and commerce in the Constitution not only prevents us from dealing with commerce inside the - prohibited sphere, but hampers us in dealing with commerce inside the sphere that is covered by the Constitution. We may not deal with commerce inside a State, but we may deal with trade and commerce between the States. The result is that we cannot effectively deal with trade and commerce at all . I have said that, in my opinion trade and commerce is an object of national concern. It cannot now, if it ever could, be dealt with adequately by the States. No doubt there was a day when trade and commerce trickled in tiny rivulets from hamlet to hamlet, when the needs of communities were supplied from within, when inside little districts, sparsely inhabited, everybody found his needs supplied by local producers. But that day has gone, and now we see a cataract of commerce massing from one end of the earth to the other, a tremendous and ever-widening stream, flowing hither and thither from one corner of the earth to the other, and yet it is contended that the control of this national and ever-broadening stream of our commercial industrial life can be regulated by the laws of a hundred States through which it flows. Clearly the ideal commerce law is one recognised and observed by all nations, and to that ideal we are fast advancing. until we reach it , our ideal most certainly must be national control over commerce. A distinguished writer, Prentice, i h his Commerce Laws of the Constitution, saysIt is obvious, then, that the line between the State and Federal power with reference to commerce is an arbitrary one. There is no economic or commercial distinction which even roughly corresponds with"" State boundaries. Commerce is a whole, and a power to regulate commerce, if complete and unlimited by an arbitrary line of division, must extend to all commerce, wherever conducted. Sueh a power Congress does not possess. The Constitution, in fact, established an arbitrary ljmit to Federal jurisdiction. The consequence is bhat we find ourselves at the present day unable to take the first step in dealing with the great commercial interests of this country. We cannot even make a general company law. There are some who do not grasp the importance of commerce, who regard it as a thing apart - a thing that concerns the man in the office, the clerk in the store, or, possibly, the manufacturer in his factory. commerce is so correlated with - for commerce is the handmaid of industry-that it touches every corner of our daily lives, so that, when we come to deal with any sphere of human we find ourselves hopelessly fettered unless we have control of commerce. Commerce affects everv person in the community, and affects ""him closely. The farmer is Mr Hughes. vitally affected by the freight he has t e pay upon the transport of the commodities t ' he requires, and upon the produce which he sends away. The producer is vitally concerned in the facilities for transport f r o n the place, where he produces hia goods to the market in which he finally disposes of them. The shopkeeper, themerchant, the artisan, the housewife, every section of the community, live dependent upon commerce in one way or another. It is perfectly obvious that the regulation of commerce is a matter winch must be in the hands of the National Parliament, and in order that it may be in . the hands of that Parliament the power must be conferred upon it .in general terms. The whole subject-matter must pass to this Parliament. That is the point which I desire to emphasize. The chief reason for the trouble from which we have suffered since the inception of the Commonwealth is that, in the allocation of powers as between the Commonwealth and the States, the whole subject-matter has. But not been allocated either to the Commonwealth or the States respectively. It would be infinitely better if the Commonwealth possessed only one-half of thej powers it is supposed to possess, if it had control of the whole subject-matter of those powers. If it had such control, there could be no litigation, no uncertainty, no clashing of powers. The functions of the High Court would then be merely to determine whether any particular Act was within one of these powers. If it was, clearly it would be constitutional. If not, then obviously it would be ultra vires of the powers of this Parliament. But when the High Court is called upon to decide, not only whether the Commonwealth has power to deal with a particular matter, but whether it has power to deal with it in the way in which the Parliament has dealt with it , confusion becomes worse confounded. It is not too much to say that the chief reason why the High Court has pruned down our apparent powers by a But series of decisions in - constitutional cases; industry arises from the fact that we have insufficient control over trade and commerce. This brings me to a point, the importance of which can scarcely be exaggerated, activities, one which not only diagnoses the trouble from which we are suffering, but points out the nature of the remedy which, must .be applied to it . The nature of the disease is that the whole of the subject-matter, is not banded to the Commonwealth, or the States, as thecase may be. The remedy lies in making a fresh allocation of powers along thoselines. Ib is essential this be done without delay, for the scope of our iiuthoidty which, should grow, witli the passage of timebecomes, actually moire restricted through, thedecisions of the High Court. I will explain' the reason for bhis: The H i gh Court, in interpreting, the Constitution, has laid down n rule which has had the effect of. narrowing, most unfortunately, the powers of this Parliament. The rulemay be referred to asthedoctrine of the limitation of powers. I direct the attention of honourable members to that doctrine, and invite them to follow closely the effects of its application) to the various powers enumerated in the Constitution. I have said that if we wish to know what our powers are we shall have-, nob only to look at the Constitution-, but to look at it in, the light of its interpretation by the H i gh Court. B'arr/er, thedoctrine of thelimitation of powers wasfirst enunciated'. It Itas the effect of applying the words' of limitation in one sectionof the Constitution, not only to the section in which they occur, but to othersections insuch a way that wherethere isambiguity in one section, the plain words of the Constitution in anothersection are regarded as insufficient, and there is thus superimposed on the'- Constitution apresumption in favour of the States. The effects of the-'application of thedoctrine have been most important and far-reaching. In the case of Rf.iv r . B'arr/er-the ExciseMachinery ease-the Court said, in effectI t is clear that this Act is a regulation of the conditions of labour which we hold to be reserved' to the States. The only enumerated power of. the Commonwealth which, can possibly come within it istaxation-,, and i.t is not olear that it is within taxation, therefore the reserved"" power of tlic State prevails. That is to say, wherever tliere is. a doubt, it is always determined in favoun of the States and never in favour of the Commonwealth-; whenever there is ambiguity, it is never resolved in favour of the Commonwealth, but alwaysin. favour of the States. It follows,, therefore, that the doctrine has so narrowed our powers that : when we ask what those powers are we eannot ascertain! by looking at theCon^ stitntion,,. for the mere fact that powers are enumerated in the Constitution is only prima facie evidence that thesubstance of any power so enumerated, is. really vested in the Commonwealth. But let me amplify the effects, of the docbrine. In interpreting the enumerated powers, the High Court has: laid it downThe Constitution as ai whole, and especially section 107, was held to reserve to the States control of the internal or domestic affairsof the States, except as faras they came within one of the enumerated powers of the Commonwealth. Section 107 readsEvery power of the Parliament of a Colony which has become or becomes a State shall) unless it is by this Constitution exclusively vested in the Parliament of the Commonwealth or withdrawn from the Parliament of a State, continue as at the establishment of the Commonwealth, or as at the admission orestablishment of the State; as the case may be. Tliat is the principle on which the reserve powers of the States stand, or, at any rate, by which they are guaranteed. In the Attorney-General v. The Brewery In Hex v. Employees Co., the words "" Trade M a r k "" were held not to include the workers'' trademark provided for by the Actof 1905,. because-, as set out by the Chief JusticeXn myopinion, it should, be regarded .as a . fundamental rule in the construction of the Constitution that where the intention to reserve any subject-mattes to the States, to the exclusion of the. ©ommonwealth, clearly ap^ pears, no exception from that reservation can be admitted' which is not expressed in clear and' unequivocal words. Otherwise the Constitution will be made to contradict itself, which upon a proper construction must be impossible. S'o it was held that we have no general power to make a lawon trade marks-. I invite honourable members to look at paragraph x-viii. of section 51 of the Constitution, which says, in plain words,, thatThe Parliament shall . . . havepower to make lawsfbr the peace; order, and good government of the Commonwealth with respect toCopyrights, patents or inventions and designs,, and trade marks. Here power to make laws on trade marks is'defined in clear terms-; yet our power to make laws with regard to trade marks islimited by the reserve powers of the States. And so, with almost every other power of the Commonwealth. The.trouble arises through a division of the subject matter.,, and the consequence is confusion and uncertainty. Again, in the. case ot - Huddart Parker v. similar principles were the interpretation of the scope of paragraph xx. of section 5 1 . the attention of lionorable members to the provision which says that the. Commonwealth Parliament shall have power to make laws with respect toForeign corporations, and trading or financial corporations formed within the limits the Commonwealth. Those words are clear, unambiguous, apsaysparently leaving no doubt that we have full power over both foreign corporations toms, and corporations formed within the limits of the Commonwealth. Y et it was held that we have no such power, because our free. power would impinge upon and impair the reserve powers of the States in regard. The Chief Justice said It is a corollary to this rule that, he an exception from the reservation, the tent of the exception must be equally and unequivocally expressed, and that, as the exception does not extend, the reservation remains in full force. I cannot accept the doctrine that if an invasion of the of the State is admitted for a limited the reservation altogether disappears. invasion is only permitted so far as it is necessary to enable the power in question to The High Court acknowledges be exercised, and the extent of the invasion is determined and limited by the necessity. In the Workers Trade Mark C£LS6'j I pointed out, the Court found a priori doubt whether this was a trade mark, and held that the reserve power to internal commerce prevailed. we had had full power over trade and commerce the prohibition apply. It is in this way that the limitation in paragraph 1 of section 51 has been in interpreting the scope of the The effect of this doctrine of limitation that while the words "" among the States remain in paragraph 1, read in conjuncbut tion with section 107, the Court has now laid it down as a test to be applied legislation by this Parliament that, unless there is set forth in the powers, clearly and unequivocally, power in the Commonwealth vades State power, this reservation favour of the States should prevail. recent decision of the High Court has emphasized this point, and as the matter is fresh in the minds of the people, the full effect and meaning of this reservahibited tion will be more clearly Honourable members will recollect Mr Eughes. Moorehead, Wheat Acquisition case. They know applied to what interest the case aroused, with what impatience the judgment of the Court I direct was awaited, with what feelings the judgment when delivered was received. I ask them to remember that no amendment of the Constitution will be of any service to the community unless it gives power, and not merely the shadow of of power, to the Commonwealth. We must not fool the people again with mere words. Section 92 of the Constitution On the imposition of uniform duties of Custrade, commerce, and intercourse among the States, whether by means of internal carriage or ocean navigation, shall be absolutely To those who understand the English that language, those words mean what they say, namely, that trade should flow freely if there all over the Commonwealth, and that exnothing should prevent it so doing. It is clearly certain that, had the people of this so far country thought that they did not mean that, this Parliament would never have sphere been sitting here today under this Conpurpose, stitution, for the Constitution would The never have been accepted by the people. that permitted the words mean what they say, but same it asks, "" What do they say?"" According to the Court, the Constitution deSIS clares that commerce shall be free; but it an does not affect the power of the States to acquire and control the subject-matter of as commerce. The position is as though it But if had been enacted that the pipe from the reservoir to a tap must be kept clear and would not free from all obstructions, but that the Court had held that there was nothing used to prevent the commandeering of the powers. water in the reservoir. Sublimely conis fident in his charter, the ratepayer turns "" on his tap, holds his pannikin under it,nothing comes out of the tap. When no water comes through, he complains to to all the Water and Sewerage Board, who replv, "" The conditions have been f u l enumerated filled; the pipes are kept free."" "" But , "" a he would object, ' ' no water is to be obwhich intained."" ""Show us,"" they would say, in "" where it is guaranteed that water must A run through the pipes. Show us where the acquirement of the water in the reservoir by some person who will not perm it it to run through the pipes is pro? ' ' He cannot show it , nor can appreciated. we. But the electors feel they have been the deceived: that they have a shadow where they thought they were solemnly assured of the substance. Plain words have become the sport of dialecticians, and the Constitution is the happy hunting ground for the never-to-be sufficiently venerated members of my honourable profession. Constitution was given to the people of this country, and accepted by them, as plain men and women who desired to enlarge their powers of self-government. When we declared that trade should be absolutely free, what we had in our minds was that, instead of our opportunities being circumscribed by the narrow limits of a State, they were to extend, without hindrance, throughout the length and breadth of this great island continent. I take it that here was a pledge, solemn and unconditional, that in times of scarcity, should they occur, we would all be in the same boat; not that within the boundaries of one State there should be plenty, of which the less fortu nate outside would not be allowed to partake. If there were general scarcity throughout Australia, we should have to do what we could to meet the common needs; but we have a right to complain when, under a charter of Federal liberty, we are told that the right remains with some to take advantage of relative plenty while others are compelled to suffer because of relative scarcity.",17
118,Mr WATT,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The Bill does not cure that nor touch it at all.,23
119,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes , it does. I prefer not to amplify my remarks at this stage; but I state, definitely and emphatically, that the proposed Trade and Commerce amendment, if approved by the people, will have this effect: The Commonwealth right of eminent domain in respect of the acquirement of property will extend over the whole sphere of the subject-matter of State commerce. Our right of eminent domain will be paramount to that of the States, so that if the States, after the proposed amendment has been adopted, were to exercise their power of acquisition, the Commonwealth could acquire from them, willy-nilly, in the same way as from private citizens, what they had acquired from others. So much is quite clear. But unless and until the limitation in our trade and commerce power is deleted, section '92, guaranteeing freedom of trade between the States, is a rotten reed. Until we have the full trade and commerce power, - there will be endless litigation, aud the edifice of our authority must rest on an uncertain and tottering foundation. The foundation of our authority must be broadened u n t i l it rests on the whole trade and commerce The power; otherwise, the constitutional edifice must always be in danger of collapsing like a pack of cards. I say advisedly, that had I to choose between this power and all the others, I would select this power, because without it we cannot progress as a nation. The other powers are supplementary to it , and without it would not help us very much. The limitation of time imposed upon speeches prevents me from dealing at great length with these matters, but I wish very briefly to touch on the other proposed amendments.",23
120,Mr WATT,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I direct your attention, Mr Deputy Speaker, to the statement of the Attorney-General, that he proposes to deal with Bills that are not now before us. which I think is unparliamentary.",23
121,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I do not consider that the Attorney-General has broken any' of the rules of the House. There is a connection between this Bill and the other measures to which he has referred which prevents them from being dealt with separately, and I shall follow Mr Speaker in allowing great latitude of debate in regard to them.",23
122,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I should be glad, for my own sake, to avoid dealing now with the other Bills, but it is impossible to present to the House and to the country a connected statement of the proposals unless they are dealt with together. Intimately and inseparably connected with the power to control trade and commerce is the power to control the operations of corporations, trusts, combines, monopolies, and industrial matters generally. Is it possible to divorce commerce from industry, which are the two sides of the same thing? One man manufactures, and another transports the article manufactured. A hundred years ago it was the individual who carried on trade and commerce; today it is the company. Ninety per cent., if not more, of the commercial, industrial, and manufacturing operations of the world are carried on by corporations, over which this National Parliament has no control, notwithstanding the plain words of paragraph xx. of section 51. Mr Justice Isaacs,, ill Huddart Parker v. Moorehead,. saidWe: may usher them into the world, we may forbid them entrance therein-; but, onoe established, we cannot interfere witli them.. We may be the political midwives of corporations, and preside at their cr be their political undertakers, direct their funeral obsequies; but over their lives., and their behaviour life,, we have no authority. ture that could make laws relating to the births aud deaths of men, but could not controltheir conduct during life, would be abjectly impotent. Birth is merely the awakesaing from a dream, anddeath the sinking into a quiet sleep; but life is-pregnant with a thousand' possibilities, for good and for evil,, and over the behaviour of ' living men the law mustkeep vigilant watch and ward. need power to control of corporations, the same power we have to control the conduct of individuals. I have no time to deal with the objections urged agaiust the proposal on the last occasion. I dealt then with Mr Justice Higgins' argument. thought then and I still think what he said was fine rhetoric; but, with all due deferenceto His Honour, youhavesaidthat, you have said everything about it. Our power over corporations must be co-extensive our power over individuals; power over trade: and commerce, cannot be effective and complete unless it extends-to corporations. As to trusts and combines, I shall say nomore at this stage thani that it is obviously necessary we should recognise and control the great forces that dominate trade, andindustry today. It may be said that thesemonsters do not exist-people shut their eyes, and, from the bottom of their souls, say that there are no trustsbut the fact remains that there are, and that they dominate mankind. say that trusts and combines stand for evil. Some of themare certainly not so evil as areothers-; but they exist, and are a great power, and this Parliament cannot control them nor can the State Parliaments control them. certainly, it is incompatible with democratic government that there should be amy power in the community, in whose hand's, over which, the people have no control. We should power to control these trusts and comMr Hughes. bine*-w e should have power to review their operations, and, if necessary, to regulate-them. This brings me to the question of monopolies. We are asking for power to nationalizemonopolies if necessary; and this power to nationalize birth, monopolies is a corollary to the control and of monopolies. The policy of nationalizing monopolies is in complete harmony during with the tendency of the modern world A Legisla- to extend the powers of the State fbr the protection of the people. In this country, it ought not to be necessary to say one word about the benefits of the control of public utilities by the people. Here we control the railways and other utilities which elsewhere are in the hands of private individuals, and in a hundred directions we have launched out with State enterprises with, I say-in spite We of much criticism-infinit e benefit to our the conduct fellow-citizens - No doubt, many State that enterprises have blundered; but has private enterprise never blundered? Go through that most pathetic of all documents-the schedule, of bankruptcies. In that we have the graveyard of private I enterprise-the casualty list of those who have fallen in the battle of private enterprise.. The nationalization of monowhen polies is necessary in. the public interests; yet none of our proposals has evoked more opposition:, ridicule,, or miswith representation. Our friendsopposite and our went about the country warning the people that it was our intention to nationalize all industries. The poor widow, shrinking back in her little fourby-four shop--the struggling tradesman that endeavouring to earn, a precarious existence^-the - poor farmer engaged in a lifecommerce, long struggle against adversity,, going down in the waters of bankruptcv with may the millstone of mortgage around his neck-were greatly perturbed at the fia-te our friends said awaited them; their dreams were pervaded with horrid I do not spectres. They saw the Commonwealth always swooping down a-nd. with ruthless hand nationalizing them. I do not wish to-say one wordto ruffle the sweet and holy calm upon the faces of m y honourable friends opposite,, but I ask by whom these things And were said. Although! the voice was the voice of Jacob,, the hand: was the hand, of. Esau. My friends oppositespoke, but no matter it was thehand of the .great vestedi n terests of. Australia that moved them-. 1I have This appeal: to the poor struggling' farmer to fight their battle has 'been their - favourite device whenever they threatened. They did the same thing in regard to the operation of the Federal land tax. Then the poor farmer was told to beware of the fell purpose the Labour party had in view. He was in formed that the little farmer was to be crushed. As a matter of fact, the little farmer now sleeps in peace. But the great land-owner has dreadful dreams, and wakes to a still more dreadful reality. I shall deal with these points more in detail later. I now wish to direct the attention of the House and the country to a point of fundamental importance in connection with the power of nationalization. The States have power of eminent domain - if the term can be applied to the compulsory acquisition of personal property. They have the power of eminent domain over property of all sorts and kinds, without limitation, reservation, or condition. The States have power to take all property without compensation. The State of Victoria could now expropriate all private property within her territorial limits, and not be called upon to pay the fractional part of a farthing by way of compensation. The State Government could take the wheat from the farmer and give nothing in r e turn ; it could take the meat from cold storage; could take houses, shops, factories, ancl all their contents, and every other kind of property and securities, financial and otherwise, and give nothing in return. This power of eminent domain is vested in all the States. But the Commonwealth is in a very different position. The proposed law will give the Commonwealth power to acquire property on just terms; that is to say, the Commonwealth must pay just compensation as assessed by the High Court. The honourable member for Flinders inserted these words as an amendment, in 1911, and my honourable friends opposite may take credit to themselves for so doing. I do not wish to disturb their complacency in this regard, but I tell them that if the amendment had not been inserted it would have made no difference, for the Commonwealth has no power to acquire property on any other than just terms. According to sub-section x x x i . of section 51 of the Constitution, these are the only terms on which the Commonwealth can acquire property, as the words of the sub-section were showThe acquisition of property on just terms from .any State or person for any purpose in respect of which the Parliament has power to make laws. It will be seen .that if the words "" just terms'' had not been inserted in this proposal now before the House, it would not have made any difference; we should not, as I said at the time, have had any power to acquire property except on just terms. I wish honourable members to contrast the position of the States with the position of the Commonwealth in this regard. I desire to strangle at the outset the misrepresentations that were made during the last referenda: that we proposed to take property and not pay for it . That the Commonwealth cannot do, though the States may; we must pav 20s. in the £ 1 for any property we acquire, while the States need not igay a halfpenny. That distinction is fundamental. Whether the case be that of a poor widow, a poor struggling farmer, or the richest man in the land, the fact remains incontestable, that the States have now the power to confiscate any property without payment, while the Commonwealth has none. I do not propose to enter into the nature of the amendments at greater length at this stage. Amendment of the Constitution it is absolutely necessary; these propositions are couched in terms which will give us the power we desire. In my opinion, no less power than that at whioh we aim will enable the Commonwealth to legislate effectively for the protection of the in terests of the people. The matter is urgept, and certainly of national importance. Although I do not deny that there has been thrown over this national! matter an aspect of party, I do deny that, it is a party question in essence. Whoever may have to exercise these powers, it . will be for the people themselves to determine the limitations of their exercise. I shall not attempt at this stage to deal with the volume of objections which were raised on a previous occasion to these proposals. It was then said that they amounted to Unification-that they were opposed to the spirit of the Federal Constitution-n o doubt we shall hear those cries again, but it will be found that they have lost their hypnotic influence. The people are steadily realizing that it is not names, but things, that matter-that . the citizens of the Commonwealth States are not concerned about State rights or Commonwealth rights, but people's rights. As to the exercise of the powers, and how far we shall go; that, too, is a matter for the people to deterby mine. We have set forth how far intend to go in this Parliament; is for the people to say how other Parliaments may go. We pose, too, to give the people an opporhave tunity, by means of the initiative and ferendum, to check any undue of the powers by this or any other Goquently, vernment; thus the people will have the double assurance that, not only at eleca tion times, but during the currency of Parliament, they will have their hands the pulse of the Legislature, and collar of their representatives. be able to determine how far this Parthese liament shall go in the exercise of those powers, which, by contrast powers possessed by the States, are as thing. Their powers will be, when these amendments are made, very wide; much wider than those of the Commonwealth, and their powers will be sovereign. invite honourable members to discuss the Bills on their merits, if they take excepdeal tion to the terms-if they think for more power than we ought to I inspeaking vite them to inform us in set terms how we may secure the necessary powers. The Government are not wedded the terms used, but only desire the powers conferred shall be We do not wish it to be declared that trade is absolutely free amongst the States, only to find that it is not at all. We do not desire to be told that there is power over foreign corporations, only to find that we have no power over any corporations. We desire to be told that we have power to settle industrial disputes, and find, after fifteen years, that, everything else aside, it is not possible to ascertain what an ""industrial is. Let us have real power, and not the powers shadow of power, and we shall be satisof fied. I have not cited in support of these proposals any authorities of this but the honourable member for Flinders, possible, the honourable member for Angas, and the honourable member for Darling have all lent the weight of their in support of the necessity for amendafter ment. I am content at this stage to leave the matter with honourable members; but, the Mr Hughes. and later on in the debate, I shall support my position by a reference to the remarks of only witli those honourable gentlemen. I now come to a phase of this question arising out of some recent utterances some honourable members of this Chamwe ber, which calls for detailed reply. and it The miuds of the people have been greatly far confused as to what the powers of the proParliament really are. These gentlemen asserted that this Parliament has renow all the powers that would be conexercise ferred - by the referenda, and, consethere is no necessity for the referenda at all. It is very obvious that statement of this sort must so confuse the the minds of the people generally as to on distract their attention from the proper on the and only remedy for our present posiThey will tion. For it is clear that if we have powers already, there is no reason why we should ask the people for any with the further authority. I invite the close noattention of honourable members to the position as it appears to me. The honourable member for Bourke, the right honourable member for Parramatta, and the I honourable member for Flinders all asserted that this Parliament has power to with practically any mortal thing. we ask The honourable member for Bourke, on the War Precautions Bill , said that the Commonwealth had ample power to acquire all commodities, to to fix prices, and to do anything that itthat could have done under the express powers real. of the referenda. The Leader of the Opposition, speaking on the 4th June, said that under the War Precautions Act free the Government have supreme power to deal with everything that associates itself with the conduct of the war. On the same afternoon, the honourable and do not learned member for Flinders made an elaborate and, at first sight, very clear then and emphatic statement as to our power. putting He said I agree with the statement of the Attorneydispute"" General, a few days ago, that he would be a bold man who would place a limit to the of the Australian Government in time war. I did not agree with his application of that view, because that application to the House; enemy contracts was about the most extreme the problem in that case being whether we eould put an end to contracts which were, in any circumstances, suspended during Downs, the currency of the war; thus the powers authority sought in this legislation could only apply the war. But with regard to the honourable gentleman's contention that it is impossible for a lawyer, or anybody else, to define limits of the Government's powers, I would point out to honourable members that the overriding principle recognised in all countries is that all constitutional limitations give way to what is the supreme law of the land, the safety of the realm. Nothing stands in the way of that supreme law; if that safety is really involved, all constitutional ties are flax in a fire. If this country were inimmediate danger of occupation by the enemy, is there any power that the National Government would not exercise to prevent sueh an occurrence? I venture to say there is not. But we have not arrived at that dangerous stage yet. I do not propose to press my argument any further than it will go, but that principle, salus populi suprema lex est, implies also that the supreme law must rest with the one Government that represents the whole of the people. How far that power would go is a different question, the resolving, of which must depend on the circumstances of the case. I am not prepared to say that, under the existing conditions in Australia, any power would reside in the Federal Government to go about buying foodstuffs generally and distributing them. If the object is simply to say, ""Things dearer now than usual, whether through combinations or conspiracies or arrangements of the kind, therefore let us buy the stuff and sell it to the people more cheaply,"" I hardly think that would or could reasonably, in the present conditions of Australia, be regarded as a legitimate exercise of the constitutional power. On Saturday last the Age, no doubt stimulated by the suggestive but rather uncertain observations of the honourable member for Flinders, published an article written ostensibly by a Labour man; but I am afraid that the labour at which the writer has been habitually working is not that which he would have us believe it to be. The article contains this passageWhat I mean to say is that, by virtue of the war, the Federal Government has acquired power to do by executive Act (while the war lasts) anything that might be clone legally in peace by virtue of the. express provisions of an the streets. amended Constitution. Its powers indeed are unlimited ancl absolute. It could, if suspend all the State Parliaments tomorrow, abolish the High Court, and put the whole Commonwealth under martial 'discipline. I i i that extract the culminating point has been reached, and at one bound we pass from vague uncertain statements as to our power into the most definite declaration that we can abolish the High Court and suspend State Parliaments. No wonder the minds of people have been a littl e confused as to what our powers really are. The extracts I have quoted embody opinions which in many respects differ fundamentally, but they agree on the one point, that the powers of the Commonwealth during a time of war are sufficient to enable us to do almost anything. But that is the only point of agreement, for, whereas the honourable member for Bourke says we have power to regulate like prices-by which he means power to reduce prices-the righ t honourable member for Parramatta says that the regulation of prices is impossible, and will lead to a condition worse than the present; and the honourable and learned member for Flinders expresses the view that the time is not ripe for our taking any such action. Though the three honourable members mentioned agree that we have the powers, they are unable to agree as to the use we should make of them, and that difference of opinion is in itself fatal to their contention. It is surely a most significant circumstance that even those who assert that we have these great powers are arc hopelessly at variance as to the circumstances which would justify the exercise of them. But let me deal directly with the contention that the Commonwealth has power, in the words of the lionorable member for Bourke and the honourable member for Flinders, "" to do almost anything."" The honourable member for Flinders does not, like the honourable member for Bourke and the Leader of the Opposition, base his statement on the defence power. He looks to something which he calls salvs populi suprema lex est. It may be that this L at in tag, like the doctor's prescription which no man is able to read, has had a hypnotising effect on the people, so that we no longer hear of the tremendous and elastic powers of the defence legislation, but only of salus populi suprema lex est. No doubt, shortly, even little children will be prattling that phrase in I can conceive of no stateit chose, ment more calculated to confuse and unsettle the minds of the people than such a statement of our powers, for while in a sense it is true enough, as applied to present circumstances it is profoundly untrue. The question before us is-in whom is this sti-prema lex vested, in the Commonwealth or in the States? The honourable and learned gentleman tells us sahis populi suprem.a lex est! The point is not as to whether there is a supreme law, but in whom it is vested. Is it vested in the Parliament which has prescribed powers, or in the Parliaments which have reserved powers? Is it vested in the Parliament which, during the last fifteen yeaars, has had its every power down,, or in the Parliaments, which, according to the Constitution, reign powers which may not be impaired by the Commonwealth ? Our friends, the ardent advocates of the States and their authority, have suddenly becomeconverts to the great powers Commonwealth. This Parliament, wings have been clipped, displaysa brilliant plumage, spreads its broad pinions, and flies in the most air without a rival. could do nothing can now do. everything. It is very strange. The honourable and learned member for Flinders says-, "" salus - populi suprema - lex est; the stances have not arisen which justify the exercise of that power, but when they do, the Federal Parliament will have unlimited But what does that declaration of unlimited power amount to ?. The honourable gentleman, in his anxiety to help his Leader, to whom he referred as "" my learned Leader,"" made a statement was inconsistent, not only with the Federal system of government, but also with the "" rule of law."" For what suprema lex to which the gentleman refers? It is not law at all; at the best it is but the inchoate substance out of which law is made. is law ? Law is the will of the sovereign power, expressed through and regular channels, and in a democratic community it is the will of the people constitutionally expressed. But this suprema lex is but the shapeless and substance which has yet to be moulded into law. ' A sovereign Legislature that of Great Britain can ' take hold of that substance at any moment and mould it into law to suit the occasion. This Parliament cannot do so, because there is not vested in us any authority to help ourselves at will from this voir of all law, this mpremalex. Federal Parliament is a with powers strictly limited Constitution, beyond the limits of which we may not go. So much for the doctrine of saluspopuli suprema lex est, which can have no relevance to partner to the Federal pact whose powers are enumerated. The case would be different with the Parliaments of the States, because they have reserve powers. then, we would know what our powers Mr Hughes. are, we must look, to the Constitution. whittled Wliat are these powers ? Most of them have been pruned down; but one, the havesove- defence power, has not been cut down by the H i gh Court. I said the other day that he would be a bold man who would set a l i m it to that power. That was and is my opinion; but by that of the statement. I do not mean that there whose is no l i m it to the power; I .mean suddenly only that the power is very wide. The honourable member for Bourke and top- the right honourable member for We who Parramatta seem to think that we can do anything by virtue of the defence power. I think they are wrong. They have overlooked the fact that we circum- are not the only Legislature, and that would every State Legislature may deal with the supreme circumstances that confront it . And their powers are infinitely wider than powers."" ours. I admit that we may do anything necessary to defend the country; but the thing done must have an intimate and direct relation to defence. The relation must beclear and obvious. It must not which be merely a colourable pretext for legislation outside our propersphere; and if the matter be within the sphere of the is this State Legislatures, it can only be exerhonorable cised if the States have not acted, or if the matter be such as to prevent effective State action. Let me give an' illustraWhat tion. The Parliament of New South Wales, by its Wlieat Acquisition Act , constitutional acquired all the wheat. Will the honourable member for Flinders or any other honourable member say that we could have acquired that wheat by virtue of our inchoate defence power? Would he say that in view of the clearly-expressed judgment like of the High Court ? The fact is we have no such power; the honourable member knows that perfectly well. No doubt if there is a shortage of any commodity likely to impair the ability of the Commonwealth to defend itself, then our reser- powers under defence would be sufficient This to acquire that commodity. We may Parliament acquire commodities in such circumby the stances. But as to the regulation of prices, there is no such power. Mr GI . YNN - I have read the honourable member's speech, and I do not think that the interpretation of power which some people have put on it is justified.",23
123,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I have said that, i u my opinion, we have no power to reguIf, late prices.. I say that after a most careful consideration of the position, and I am perfectly certain that the honourable and learned member for Flinders will not contend we have. If honourable members will read his speech carefully, they will find that he does not say we have that power. Much confusion has arisen because a lawyer has endeavoured to set before laymen what the Legislature may do in certain circumstances in language shorn of legal technicality. Hi s meaning is imperfectly assimilated, and an entirely wrong deduction - is made from his observations. I come now to the Age article, which says we have power to suspend the State Parliaments and to abolish the High Court. Will any honorablo member say for a moment that we have such a power ? And yet the writer of the Age article is absolutely logical. If we have this power; if there is in any circumstance the power vested in us to say, "" We can do anything we like necessary to defend the country, then anything that we do as being necessary to defend the country is necessary to defend - the country, and we may suspend the State Parliaments and abolish the High Court."" No one will say for one moment that we have that power, b ut it is the inevitable deduction to be drawn from a general statement that our power, whether it be derived from the suprema lex or from our defence power> is unlimited. I am perfectly certain that the honourable and learned member for Flinders never intended such a deduction to - be drawn. But the people have drawn that deduction, as they inevitably must, and there is grave danger when we leave the firm ground of legal and constitutional warrant for any action done by this Parliament, by the Judiciary, or by individual citizens, for then we move about in the quicksand of shifting opinion. For, if unlimited power is vested in this Government, who is to determine the occasion for its exercise, or the extent to which its exercise shall go ? The honourable member seems to , imply that there is a power which can be given and withdrawn, "" Thus far, and - no f u r the r . "" But who is to decide when the power is to be exercised, and how far it is to go? If there be a power, it can only be exercised when, in the opinion of the ten men who form the Government of this country, it is necessary to be exercised; and it may be exercised, not merely when war threatens, but when .any emergency threatens. The honourable and learned member did not say, and he cannot say., that war is the only emergency which may justify - a recourse to the suprema lex on the part of the Executive Government. What, then, this power of suprema lex amounts to, if it amounts to .anything at all, is that any Government may exercise arbitrary powers when it pleases, and to the extent it pleases. And it means nothing else. But if there be such a power, then it is not only outside, our Constitution, and outside the High Court, but outside this Parliament. No doubt such power is vested in every Government that has armed forces at its disposal. Stripped of everything by.which it is hidden, there is nothing more in what the honourable gentleman said than this-: -.that to those who have force the occasion may arise when they will exercise it . History is marked by instances where Governments have used their military power, and not infrequently to serve their own purposes. In this Government, that has at its back the A r m y, no doubt there is power to shut up this House; to go into every State House and shut it up ; to say to every Serjeant-at Arms, "" T a k e away that bauble "" ; to abolish the High Court; and to establish martial law throughout the country. Of course, we have that power; but - that power rests on force, and not on law at all. It is government by force, government by military despotism, and not government by law. Who will say that the emergency in which we now' find ourselves is such as to justify a resort to force ? No doubt a Government must, if the occasion warrants it , be prepared to do anything - and everything. Will anybody say that such an occasion has now .arisen, and if .the occasion has not arisen-and no one will say it has arisen-wh y all this talk about our power to do anything we like under our defence power ? Who will permit us to use such powers? At the worse or at the best, the honourable and learned member's contention can only amount to this: that the H i gh Court would allow us to do certain things. A r e we to believe that tine H i gh Court contemplates abdicating its position-of retiring from its office? Do we see any sign of the States recognising their incapacity to deal with the situation? We see the very opposite. We see the H i gh - Court exceedingly active, exercising it s functions with vigour, delimiting our powers jealously. The other day we saw evidences of the Court's activity, its power, and its determination to use it , in the decision in the Wheat Acquisition case given in the middle of the war. Nowhere do we see any indication that the Court is ready to abandon its power. Nor do we see any signs that the States are willing to surrender their powers to us, or find themselves incapable of dealing with matters that arise in their various spheres.",28
124,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The honourable member's time has expired. Leave to continue granted.,30
125,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"We see the H i gh Court actively carrying on all the functions assigned to it under the Constitution. It is evident, then, that our powers are those enumerated in the Constitution, and no others. If we are to understand by the application of this doctrine of suprema lex that we are to use our arbitrary powers, subject to the High Court that will not interpose its power to arrest our legislative action, what does that mean but this: that we shall legislate subject to the power of the High Court ? The contention of the honourable member for Flinders, viewed from this poirit, amounts to no more than this: What the Court says we may do, outside the Constitution, that we may do, and no more. But this would be to make the High Court the dictator of our policy. That would be a - position as intolerable as government by force. Y e t it is the one alternative to a military despotism, to which this Government-and I hope this Parliament and this country-wil l never submit. To elevate the High Court to the position of a supreme legislative chamber, what a proposal that is! That which the High Court says we may do we may do. By such a course we should abrogate the supreme functions of this Chamber as an expression of the national will of the people. But we could not do this, and we ought not even to consider it as possible. There is, therefore, nothing in all this talk of swprema lex. Our defence power is wide, but is emphatically not limitless. On the contrary, there are very real limits set to it . And I cannot but be amazed at the change of opinion that has animated my honourable friends, who were for years the banner-bearers of law and order, that they should now tell us to disregard the Constitution and the safeguards of the law, that we may do anything we may conceive necessary to be done. They told the people over and over again that this Constitution was sacred, and that we must not under any circumstances lay our iconoclastic hand impiously upon it . Now we are not only to tear it down; but to destroy the very temple in which it stands. Why this change? It is because the proposal to amend the Constitution does not find favour in certain quarters, and frantic efforts are being made to confuse the minds of the people and guide us into dangerous pitfalls. We do not propose to exercise the great powers that we are asking for without the consent of the people. We only propose to exercise them after the people have given their mature approval thereto. We are not going to sacrifice the policy which we have for years, in season and out of season, advocated, in order to b© subjected to the direction of the High Court as to how far we shall go or how far we shall not go. We are not going to endeavour to carry out this policy at the point of the bayonet; but we propose to do what we have to do with the approval of the people in a constitutional aud legal fashion. Just one other point. Our friends have argued that it is i m proper for us to ask the people to approve of these amendments at this time. Why is it improper? Is it contended t h a i to ask the people to vote on six abstract questions six months hence will impair our national efficiency?",30
126,Mr SPEAKER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I ask the Attorney General not to discuss that question. If I were to allow him to do so, we should have an endless discussion upon the war. I cannot allow that subject to be discussed, since it has nothing whabever to do with the constitutional question in volved.",30
127,Mr HUGHES,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"V e r y well, sir. One now has an idea what legislation under the wing of the High Court would be. Since I am unable to elaborate this part of my argument, I must draw my re-' marks to a conclusion. I have endeavoured to show what our powers under the Constitution really ar.e. Had the honourable and learned member for F l in ders been here, I do not think he would have materially dissented from my presentation of the case. The position of the Commonwealth, at all events, is, in my opinion, that which I have explained. Its powers are grossly inadequate for our present circumstances, and these circumstances, in the very nature of things, must continue for some time. not allowed to mention the war generally: I may be permitted to point out, however, that present conditions, although not normal, result, not from some passing emergency, but from causes likely to continue for a very protracted period. It is not power to deal with a mere passing emergency that is needed, but the permanent constitutional authority duly given us by the people that is wanted. We find ourselves today hampered in a thousand ways. The Commonwealth has not the powers it ought to have. No man who has given this question a moment's consideration will dare to say that it has. The honourable and learned member for Flinders, over and. over again, has declared himself a firm believer in the necessity for the amendment of the Constitution. He has declared that the trade and commerce power must be given to this Parliament without condition or reservation. He has declared over and over again that the power to make super-eminent industrial laws must be given to this Parliament. He has declared that trusts and combines cannot be dealt with by the States, but only through Federal legislation. He has stated only recently that he has not changed his opinions since he first gave utterance to them in 1911. Speaking only the other day, he re-affirmed the position that the amendment of the Constitution was urgent. The right honourable member for Parramatta, when his Government went to the country, declared in his policy speech that his party were in favour of constitutional amendment. I do not attempt for one moment to criticise the amendments he proposed, because the right honourable member did no more than indicate that his party favoured amendment. He did not reduce his proposals to for m ; but he stands committed, just as we do, to the amendment of the Constitution. honourable and learned member for Angas has stated, in a memorandum prepared by him while in office, and read frequently in this House, that the amendment of the Constitution is necessary in order to enable us to deal with trusts and combines. The honourable and learned member for Darling Downs, in the memorandum prepared by Mr Garran and endorsed by him as Attorney-General, and despatched by Mr Deakin to the South A f r i c a n Government, declared I am that the trade and commerce power ought to be given without words of limitation. As for the industrial power, we know from the experience of years how hopeless is the position of the Conciliation and Arbitratio n Court. AE this time, when practically the whole world is plunged in war, it is surely not too much to say that we should use every means to maintain industrial peace; that we should strive with all our soul and strength to avoid industrial warfare; that we, as civilized men, should appeal to reason rather than to force. The position in which the Industrial Court finds itself today is most unhappy. It is hampered by technicalities. Orders of prohibition cut across clearly expressed awards of the Court, obtained after lengthy hearing and great expenditure of money. The Court cannot make a common rule. In this Industrial Court where the technicalities of law were to be tabooed, the Court flounders in a morass of technicalities. Every day dialecticians spend hours, days, and weeks in the High Court splitting hairs about the meaning of words. We have come to a time now in our national history when, having cast off the robes of youth, we have put on the toga of manhood, and we ought to be armed with adequate constitutional powers. I hope that the House and the people will approve of these proposals. Debate (on motion by Mr. JOSEPH COOK) adjourned. ORDER OF BUSINESS.

This amount will, of course, include the £6,000,000 or £7,000,000 per annum required for ordinary administrative purposes 1",32
146,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Yes .,32
147,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The balance represents war expenditure?,32
148,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Yes . Mr JOSE PH COOK - Is that the oontemplated rate of expenditure during the next financial year?,32
149,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,".Judgin g by the present rate of our war expenditure, it seems likely to run into more than £20,000,000.. Sometimes our war expenditure amounts to £1,500,000 per month.",32
150,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"That is the rate of expenditure shown in this Bill . It is not a large .sum to - expend on defence; but in my judgment, is not half large enough for Australia. When one recollects that the defence expenditure of the Old Country is towering up to £3,000,000 oer day, one realizes what a small contribution we are making. The proposed vote for defence purposes in this Bill represents £18,000,000 per annum, or about one-seventieth of the annual war expenditure of Great Britain today, although our population is. about one-ninth of that of the Old Country. Australia,, roughly speaking, has 5,000,000 of people, and Great Britain 45,000,000. Over there they are spending at the rate of £3,000,000 a day, while we are spending a little over £40,000 a day. That is as I see the question. We are spending, roughly, about l-70th of. the amount that is being expended in the Old Country; and I , for one, say, here and now, that I have never been satisfied with that proportion. Ever since the war broke out, I have never been satisfied that Australia is doing enough in this great world struggle. I do not underrate the difficulties of this war as they relate to Australia. I do nob underrate the difficulties that have to be encountered in the initiation of a war machine. them. I have been up against them myself, and I know what they mean; but, taken by and large, I should like to see Australia doing very much more than she is doing at present to bring this war to a successful termination. Nothing has gratified me more than this appeal, which has come from the Imperial Government for men without munitions. I think the sooner that appeal is sounded like a tocsin through the length and breadth of Australia, the sooner shall we see a great fillip given to the recruiting movement here, and the sooner will our troops be ""wending their way over the seas to fight for the liberty and freedom of our fair land.",32
151,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Swan) [5.57]. -- T should like to say a word with regard to the way in which the Estimates are presented to us. They are not in the - shape that we expected to see them, and they are not in the shape in. which, I think, tliey were promised to us. The expenditure on account of current account, and the expenditureon account of war, is all lumped together, though I have no' doubt that in the Departments of theTreasury and' Defence, an account is kept of all expenditure on account of war. Mr FISHER. - It . is being kept.",33
152,Sir JOHNFORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I regret that the Estimates were not presented in this way. I know there is some difficulty in doing it , but the difficulty is no greater than is experienced in every State of the Commonwealth in regard to loan accounts and loan moneys. £300,000,000 of loan money has been expended in Australia on public works, and the accounts have always been submitted separately. We had the loan Estimates submitted to us in the same way as current Estimates on departmental accounts, and I had hoped that the same course would have been followed in regard to this disastrous war. I admit that there is some difficulty. Ajs all our expenditure on account of war is derived from loan, I had hoped that course would have been followed when dealing with this great war expenditure. As it is, we are in thedark, except in so far as we will be able to get returns, byand-by, of the expenditure; and I think the right honourable gentleman promised to give us these returns.",33
153,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,He did.,33
154,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,The accounts are being I know kept.,33
155,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Eve n now, when we are asked for money in regard to expenditure from loan on account of war, it is mixed up with expenditure on current account.",33
156,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We are keeping them separately.,33
157,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"But my point is that we expected, and I understood, thab these Estimates would be submitted in th© same way as were the Estimates for the £300,000,000 of loan money in the Sbabes.",33
158,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Parramatta) [6.0] - My righ t honourable friend does well to point out that we have no separation of the accounts as they are presented to Parliament. There is no doubt that we were promised a separate Budget for the Expeditionary Forces and a separate Budget for the Defenos expenditure. 1 These thingsmay be kept separately in the accounts at the Treasury, but that does not help us here. For instance, who knows how much of this £100,000 for amimunition, this £17,000 for general contingencies, and how much of this £56,200 for the camps is part of the Expeditionary Forces: expenditure, which ought to appear as such in the statement? There is a separate item of £5>,O0O',O00 for the Expeditionary Forces aloaae-, but wedo uot know whether that covers the Expeditionary Forces expenditure in its entirety or not.",33
159,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We do not what items it covers.,34
160,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No . I do think that the right honourable the Prime Minister ought to submit a separata Expeditionary Forces Budget, covering all the details of the Forces, and keeping it separate and distinct from the ordinary administrative expenditure of the Department. So far as I am concerned, my attitude is this: There never was a greater need for economy on the administrative side of the Department, and never a greater need for lavish expenditure on the Expeditionary and war side of the Department.' We can still have economy and efficiency, and by exercising economy with efficiency in the ordinary administrative expenditure we will make available more money for the purposes of war over the seas. The first thing to do, I submit, is to itemize this vote for the Expeditionary Forces. The statement could be submitted in a different schedule, if necessary, or as an explanatory paper. I do not care how it is done.",34
161,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I quite agree with you.,34
162,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Then , will the right honourable gentleman promise to bring clown a paper?",34
163,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"I will bring it down in the Budget at the first opportunity. We have been keeping the accounts separately, but the details could not be put into this Supply Bill .",34
164,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"No ; but the right honourable gentleman could give us a paper showing what this £5,000,000 is for.",34
165,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [ 6 . 4 ] - I am quite in agreement with the statements made by the Leader of the Opposition and the right honourable member for Swan. The Defence Department have been instructed to keep separate, distinct, and detailed accounts of the war expenditure, apart altogether from the ordinary Defence expenditure, which would be equivalent, to current expenditure in the absence of war. But I am not asking the Defence Department at this time-it would not have been fair, even if I had thought it wise-to make out a different schedule in the meantime for the actual expenditure up to date. This can be done at the end of the financial year, when the books are being closed, and as early in the new year as possible it will be my duty, as it will be my object and aim, if I cannot make a know full financial statement, to make an in terim statement showing the conditions of the Loan Vote and dealing with Defence expenditure. I shall place that before .the House, because I am entirely in accord with the views of honourable members opposite in this' matter, and feel in regard to it just as strongly as they do. There is a danger of Defence matters becoming so interlocked and interlaced as to be difficult of separation, but the accounts are being kept f a it h full y at the present time. I am also in agreement with the point raised by the right lionorable gentleman regarding the amount of expenditure. If it becomes our duty-as it may-to expend a great deal more money in the defence of Australia and to help defend the Empire generally, it will be my particular business, as Treasurer to come down to Parliament and tell honourable members so, and also to make provision for the supply of money, which is a most important factor. I full y appreciate what the right honourable member for Parramatta has said about the war expenditure of Great Britain , and of the great resources of the Mother Country. I am sure that I am not trespassing on the patience of honourable members when I say that we all congratulate the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the proposal that he has made, and the prospect of getting such an enormous sum of money, running into over £500,000,000 or £600,000,000, with a prospect of going up to £900,000,000 or £1,000,000,000. As honourable members are aware, we were granted a loan of £18,000,000 by the British Government for war purposes, and we have under promise an additional £6,500,000 to cover our expenses up to the end of the financial year. As far as can be seen at present, no serious financial difficulty will arise during the present calendar year; but that is subject to contingencies, and to the determination of the people-to pledge their credit to a greater extent than at present. Unfortunately, in Australia, though we are comparatively strong financially, we have not been in a position to draw on our own credit to assist the Mother Country in the war. We can only help, so far as we can see at present, by means of food supplies, and, to a sligbt extent, by munitions.",34
166,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,I do not quite follow the right honourable gentleman. Does he mean that in the past we have not been able to finance our own war expenditure ?,35
167,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,U n for t u n at e l y tralia is a borrowing nation yet. We cannot,35
168,Mr JOSEPH COOK,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Althoug h we are borrowing nation, we are supposed to have £1,250,000,000 worth of invested wealth.",35
169,Mr EISHEE,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,Yes ; but it is not available for this purpose. country has ever been able to do such a thing.,35
170,Sir JOHN FORREST,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,We shall have to do as the Mother Country has doneborrow.,35
171,Mr FISHER,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Yes , we may be able to raise money in Australia for our own war purposes, and I am in favour of that course, for by so doing we shall relieve the British money market of any obligation up to the amount that we are prepared to expend. How far that may affect enterprises, which are just as necessary for the development of resources, to assist the Mother Country, I am unable to say; and no. man in this chamber is able to say. I join heart and soul with the right honourable gentleman opposite in saying that it is incumbent, in the first place, upon all those who are physically fit to be trained to go to the front, to do so, and upon all those who have means, and who can supply those means to the Government to enable them to equip and transport our soldiers to the front, and so assist the Mother Country, to help in that way. We have a common duty, as a Dominion of the Mother Country, to defend the Empire, and we have an additional duty at this time of crisis, in helping to the best of our ability, by our own collective and individual efforts, financially.",35
172,Mr GLYNN,CONSTITUTION ALTERATION,"Angas) [6.11] - We all agree with the suggestion of the honourable member for Parramatta-which , apparently, expresses the desire and intention of the Government also-that we should contribute in men as far as possible, and in material also, in.as great a proportion as our present circumstances justify, towards the common defence of the Empire. I think we were on the road to that before the. war broke out, [155] because, when Admiral Henderson'B scheme would have come to fruition 'in 1930 or 1933, our contributions per head on the peace basis towards the cost of naval defence would almost have equalled the rate per head justified by the white , Auspopulation of the Empire, and would .have been much beyond the Canadian rate of contribution; so that, as a matter of fact, a we had expressed then, by that arrangement, ' the desire of Australia gradually to reach the point at which we would discharge the whole of the honourable obligations which rested upon us, and which No young were expressed by the establishment of the Navy, whose usefulness is manifested in its material as well as its moral aspect, by the immunity we enjoyed through the efficiency in home waters of the British Navy. We have embarrassed ourselves in our attempts to reach the limits of our desire by our easy-going methods of the past. I remember more than once oalling attention to the possibility of a war putting a strain upon resources, that we were somewhat cavalierly disposing of in our Budgets, when the bounty of Providence had given us exceptionally good years. The United Kingdom is undoubtedly in a splendid position to meet its obligations, for many years and many reasons, of which not the least is this: that the foreign investments of the United Kingdom average from £2,500,00 0 to £3,000,000 per day. That stream from the United Kingdom to the various parts of the world, which before the war represented in interest to private persons on public and semi-public investments, apart from industries, a sum of no less than £200,000,000 per annum, has been intercepted by the war, and is now directed towards supplying the wants of the I m perial Government-the last expression .of which we have had in Mr MCKenna's speech-in war contributions. That is an enormous sum, and shows the marvellous material resources of thei United Kingdom. We hope eventually to be able to reach the goal of our common desire; but it is through the somewhat lax methods of our financing of the last twelve or fifteen years that we, with enormously great resources, not yet developed to their full , have been unable, under the strain of the present occasion, to finance our obligations directly ourselves. I confess I felt almost a littl e shame, mixed with the jubilation that we - All ifelt., at the Imperial Government .enabling us ito iget money practically at % per cent;",35
