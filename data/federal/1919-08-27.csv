Is the Minister aware that there is at the doors of our hat mills an ample supply of the best and cheapest hat-making wool in the world, and, in these circumstances, is he prepared to act upon the Scriptural injunction, to "" render unto Csesar the things that are Csesar's,"" and not to prevent - the rabbit trapper-- ",21

Under the guise of - asking a question, the honourable member has practically delivered a speech embodying assertions of fact, furnishing information which, apparently,- he sought to elicit from the Minister. Such a form of question is not' permissible. WHARF LABOURERS' DISPUTE. - STATEMENT MADE BY THE ' ' AGE "" ROYAL COMMISSION'S REPORT.",21
6,Mr TUDOR,Unknown," I desire to make a statement relative to the Melbourne Waterside workers' dispute, which - ha? been in existence for nearly two years. In this morning's issue of the Age, i't is stated that, at a meeting of the Wharf Labourers Union yesterdayI t was reported that Senator Millen hod said that he could not give the Disputes Committee any definite assurance that the Labour Bureau would be abolished. A long discussion then took place, and after the representatives of the Disputes Committee had spoken, the following resolution was carried:1. That the wharf labourers refuse to work with any loyalist wharf labourers, original or otherwise. 2. That no work in connection with the handling of coal or general cargo be undertaken until the Labour Bureau is closed. 3. That the executive be instructed ta bring the resolution under the notice of Senator Millen on the following morning. That statement is absolutely inaccurate. No such resolution was carried by the wharf labourers or waterside workers yesterday. I am officially informed by the quessecretary of the Melbourne Wharf Union that the only resolution him carried at the meeting yesterday was That this meeting adjourn, and leave to the power to - call the next meeting of there the union re the dispute. That motion was unanimously agreed to. Senator. Mille n was advised early this morning that the report published in the Ago was incorreet, and that the men who are engaged in the industry are anxious that industrial harmony shall once more prevail. As a matter of fact, the union - has this morning issued a w r it against the proprietors of the Age, claiming £10,000 damages for the publication of this in uccurate statement. A very serious situation might be created if newspapers could with impunity misrepress-nt unions in this way. Such misrepresentations tend only to lead to industrial chaos. The men are anxious to bring about an amicable settlement,. and it is utterly wrong that any newspaper should t ry tp promote a feeling of discontent. The statement made in the Age was quoted in the Conciliation and A r b i tration Court this morning by Mr Adams, representative of the Steam-ship Owners Association. Mr Justice Higgins asked when the Government proposed to give iheir decision, and in reply was informed by Mr Adams that an effort would be made to obtain the information for him by tomorrow morning. The position is that the wharf labourers have agreed to certain suggested terms, with a view to the settlement of the dispute. I am sure that honourable members irrespective of their party political opinions will agree, when they hear of these terms, that the wharf labourers are endeavouring at all events to do the fair thing. I have had handed to me the f o l lowing statement, setting out accurately the decision of the W h a rf Labourers U n i o n :Messrs. Joyce, Gray, and Holloway, of the Trades Ball Council, and Messrs. BatcB, Cadden, ancl Riley, of the Wharf Labourers Union, interviewed Mr Shepherd, on the 6th inst., in connection with the wharf labourers' dispute, and submitted the following suggested terms of settlement:1. Tho wharf labourers are quite willing to work alongside the original loyalists to whom the Government pledge applies. Original loyalists to be those engaged between 13th August and 3rd November, 1917. It was alleged by the wharf labourers that the number would not exceed 200. 2. Preference to be given to the original loyalists up to the extent of the living wage limit under existing awards-at present £2 12s. 6d. 3. That the bona fide original loyalists be identified, and that the Wharf Labourers Union accept the position of preference being given to them, presumably after ootid fide returned soldier wharf labourers. 4. That the Bureau be abolished, and the old "" pick-up "" place reverted to. 5. That the Wharf Labourers Union undertake to themselves control the position on the wharfs. 6. Union to inflict penalties on any members molesting loyalists by fines, suspension, and/or expulsion from union. 7. Tn the event of the union not carrying out itB promise, the Bureau to be re-established. These terms have been agreed to by every member of the union at a meeting specially culled for the purpose. It is not in the interests of industrial harmony that a newspaper reporter Bhould draw upon his imagination to make it appear that a totally different decision has been arrived at.",21
7,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,"I ask the At torney-General when we are likely to he supplied with the recommendations of Mr . Dethridge, who acted as a Royal Commissioner for the purpose of inquiring into the existing industrial dispute, on the part of the wharf labourers?",22
8,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I am not in a position to give the honourable member definite information in regard to the matter.

The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) and Mr Larkin - have had consultations regard to this matter, and I think that six of the ships have been We sold. I hope at an early date to be able to tell the House exactly the position. Necessarily there will be a considerable or loss by the.

21,Mr ORCHARD,FROZEN AN D CANNE D MEA T,"I ask the Acting Leader of the House whether, in view of the notorious fact that thousands of citizens in affluent circumstances have deliberately refrained hitherto from subscribing to war loans, while others have contributed more than their quota, the Government will adopt the only equitable course qpen to them of immediately in troducing legislation to compel the former class to do their duty to the couutry and the men who have been fighting for it ?",24

The continued dry weather, and the fact that the level of the water in the river is below the average, is causing a good deal of anxiety to settlers along its course, and will affect both civilian and soldier settlement. . Mr GROOM - The honourable member asks me generally about the weirs. May I make a statement which will perhaps cover the present position ? The works authorized at the present time are the construction bf the M it t a M it t a storage scheme at the head of the river; the Lake Victoria scheme for South Australia, at the lower portion; ancl also the Torrumbarry weir, which is well on its way. In addition, lock No. 1, at Blanchetown, is well advanced. lock walls are up, and the work is in a fairly advanced stage. Authorit y has also been given to construct lock and weir No. 2 and lock and weir No. 3, in South Australia; and also lock and weir No. 9, which is immediately below AVentworth, near Frenchman's Creek. will be the means of supplying the Lake Victoria scheme.

Eva to interview a number of the shipowners to see if they would co-operate with us i u arriving at some method of training, not only officers, but men, for the mercantile marine, but I am sorry to say that our request met with no response. The suggestion of the late in structor was to train only officers; but I think much more is required, because there should be some place where we could train, not only officers, but men, for The - this purpose.

Medical attention is granted to members of the Naval Brigade StalT, i.e., Permanent Instructional Stan, by medical officers, who receive nn annual allowance from the Department for such duty, and the regulations allow wives and children medical attendance, "" provided no extra expense to the Department is incurred."" The Department has altered the system' of payment to medical officers by abolishing the annual allowance, and making .payment of a fixed fee for each service rendered. The limited benefits previously obtained by wives and families without expense to the Department will now be discontinued, owing to the now arrangement made with the medical oflicers. The regulations as regards provision of mediGrovernment cal attendance have not been amended, but an alteration in the method of payment for medical attendance has been made. 2. Medical attendance on wives and families of members of the Naval Brigade staff has neveT been considered as part of their .pay. The men themselves are entitled to medical attendance, but the obligation to provide medical attendance for wives nnd families at the expense of the Department has never been recognised. 3. A leading seaman on the Naval Brigade staff receives consolidated salary of £144 to £150 per annum. The weekly rate for a man nn £144 per annum would, therefore, the £2 15s. 4(1. No uniform allowance is granted, but such men arc, on appointment, in 'possession of a full kit, provided at Government expense. 4.

66,Mr MASSYGREENE,SUGGESTED IMPERIA L,"Tee . The questionsasked were as follow:1. Is it a fact, as stated in the press cables, that the Military Department have, in England, disposed of a large number of Australian Army horses at £17 'per head, such horses to be utilized as food? 2. Is-not horse flesh an appreciated article of diet in many European countries? 3. Is it a fact that in many parts of the Commonwealth there are very many thousands of wild and other horses, whose wholesome flesh could be exported to those countries desiring it, if the embargo against exportation were removed! 4. As it is stated the Department has already disposed of horses to be utilized for food purposes, what objection is there, other than n sentimental one, to the removal of the em'bargo, and thus give considerable monetary gain to the Commonwealth, and wholesome food to those countries whose people have a taste for it? The answers to the questions are1. The Defence Department has received no official information in regard to this matter. 2. It is 'believed such is a fact. 3. It is understood there are many thousands of wild and other horses in many parts of the Commonwealth. 4. This question has had consideration on several occasions, when it was decided not to encourage the export of horse flesh. AB the is experiencing the greatest difficulty in obtaining sufficient refrigerated tonnage to move beef and mutton offered for export, no good purpose would be served hy further considering the question at present.

Is it a fact that when Mr A. S.

Is it a fact that Mr Whyte, as° secretary of the National Federation, is representing that organization on the Peace Loan Committee t 5.

72,Mr BRENNAN,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"Batman) [ 3 . 4 9 ] - I remarked on Friday last that the most debatable principle in the Bill , and the one to which I would offer most strenuous opposition, is contained in clause 3. My objection Ho that clause is that it panders to the party-predominant spirit, and enables a Government to use its political powers for the purpose of admittin g or rejecting immigrants, acof public cording as their (political views may be pleasing or offensive to the arty in power for the time being, I shall read that clause in so far as it extends the operation of the policy of exclusion, and is therefore to my mind objectionable. It proposes to amend section 3 of the principal Act by inserting after paragraph gc the following paragraphs{gd) any anarchist or. person who advocates the overthrow by force or violence of the established government of the Commonwealth or of any State or of any other civilized country, or of all forms of law, or who is opposed to organized government, or who advocates the assassination of public officials or who advocates or teaches the unlawful destruction of property, or who is a member of or affiliated with any organization which entertains and teaches any of the doctrines and practices specified in this paragraph; (ge) for the period of fivo years after the commencement of this paragraph, and (i) which was issued to thereafter until the Governor General him by and on be-, 'by proclamation otherwise determines, half of the Imperial any person who in the opinion of an Government or any officer is of German, Austro-German, Government recog- .

I remark first of aft the attention which is devoted to anarchists. One might have supposed that the Government would not forbear at least ai passing reference to the cloven hoof pf the - Socialist,, whose class has served this Government, and many of its predecessors on several haTd-fought political battlefields, as comprising those who are destined to bring Australia to ruin. I notice, boo, that there is not more than an oblique reference to the hydra-headed representative of "" direct action,"" and only an indirect reference, if, indeed, that, to the Industrial .Workers of the World organization, which has also served the political purposes of this Government, and many of its predecessors. I am not unmindful of the fact that the Government, although it does not specifically mention these abhorrent influences, takes to itself dant powers in the exercise of its discreviolence tion to exclude from this country any person whose political views are displeasing to it .",32
73,Mr GLYNN,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"There is not the slightest son."" intention of doing that.",33
74,Mr BRENNAN,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"I am confident that the amiable Minister who introduced this Bill has no such intention. which this Bill expressed are not within the compass of the honourable member's intention.; but, unfortunately, he, good man though he is, is but a creature of sible. circumstances and of his surroundings.",33
75,Mr FENTON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,Is it not a case of Esau done. and. Jacob over again?,33
76,Mr BRENNAN,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"Probably . fact remains that it is clearlv within discretion of the Minister to say who. or does not come within these extensive definition clauses. Our friend the anarchist has received a little passing attention in the Bill . I do not know why. For the last sixty years, I should, say we have not been without an anarchist in Australia. I think have always had a few, aud, although i may seem something of a paradox, I vento ture to say that the anarchist has been one of the most law-abidin? citizens have had. 1 The Minister (Mr G l y who has introduced this Bill is, I that"" am sure, sufficiently widely read on the subject to recall that probably the most influential anarchist that ever lived was the philosophic Proudconnexion hon, who based his philosophic and vices amiable anarchy upon the teachings that right-thinking and well-known Engcharacter lish writer on political ethics, Adam Smith, as well as.upon those of Hegel. I may say at once that I am not an anarchist, and do not believe that tliere is auy anarchical movement in this try worth this special mention in the Bill ; but since I am challenged to anything in defence of anarchy, I venguilty ture to tell the Minister who has set in the Bill that an anarchist is not fit associate with a respectable Government, - flage. that, on the whole, in the history of civilized countries, the record of anarchy has been-cleaner than the record of law.",33
77,Mr GLYNN,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"The reference to "" anarestablished government by foroe. chist "" in the clause is qualified by the words "" for c e or violence.""",33
78,Mr BRENNAN,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"My construction of the clause is-and I may be wrong-tha it deals with an anarchist, or any person abunwho advocates the overthrow by force or of any "" established government.""",33
79,Mr MAXWELL,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"The paragraph reads as if an "" anarchist"" were not a "" per. Mr BRENDAN"" - It appears to clearly differentiate an anarchist from any - of the other persons described in the proMany things, posed new paragraph.",33
80,Mr ANSTET,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"Why not strike out the word "" anarchist "" and insert the word ""politician. "" That would be just as sen",33
81,Mr BRENNAN,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"That might be I repeat that the records of > anarchy in all civilized countries is The cleaner than the record of law. It is true the that in the name of anarchy-mor e often does in the name of Nihilis m and other "" is m s "" associated in one way or another with anarchy-crime s of violence have taken place. Here and there crowned heads, mid heads that hoped to be crowned', have been suddenly and uncerewe moniously struck off. Every one knows t that on general principles I am opposed violence on moral grounds as well as on the ground of expediency. But it has we to be said in favour of those who have n n ) , beeu guilty of these crimes of violence, if ever there was a justification for the exercise of violence it can ihe proved that in respect of the great majorit y of such crimes attributed to anarchists in with r u l in g personages, the and the mischiefs which they sought of to correct were of such a far-reaching that, although there might have been a breach of law and order, there was at least a deliberate and sincere attempt to remove crushing abuses from people who had laboured under them only too counlong. I leave the condemned anarchist - with the remark - that I feel sure that the say Minister in introducing hi m here was of the mild offence of persiflage, out aud if I may employ an overworked to phrase of doubtful origin-as o of camouI come now to another matter. The "" person "" to .be excluded in this case is one who advocates the overthrow of Very curious consequences flow from this provision. The first and the most startling is that under it we must necessarily brand t - as an undesirable immigrant any person who came here five years ago advocating the overthrow 'by force of that 'highlyorganized Prussian despotism at the head of which was the Kaiser. Surely the Minister will not deny that that was an organized government, and even a civilized government. Surely after four-years of war he will not deny that some measures were justified for the purpose of overthrowing by force the Prussian system of government. If he does, then I remind him that the world has spent £10,000,000,000 in a successful attempt to overthrow that highlyorganized form of government, which has been carried on in Prussia for so many years. Strange paradox as it may seem, even our returned soldiers might fairly be described as being undesirable immigrants within the meaning of this provision, being persons who had not only ,been favourable to the overthrow by force of an organized system of government, but who had taken a very active and. successful part in the overthrow of the organized government of the Kaiser. - Take the case of Russia. There we had a country groaning under a military autocracy probably worse than that of Prussia - which we have overthrown. Philosophic Radicals have been hunted out of that country for the last century more for venturing, so it was said, to propound a policy for the overthrow by force of the established Government of Russia. Many of them, by the way, found am asylum in Britain. In due time the people of Russia uprose and overthrew that system of government by force. It is to our discredit-and this a circumstance which we may pray speedily to forget-that we were associated in the early stages of the war with, the real head of the Russian military autocracy as our Ally. As the war progressed, however, other considerations led to the overthrow of that potentate and of the system of which for so many years he was the dishonoured head. Who will say that we ar» to close our doors to a man who comes here with no worse record than that he was favourable to the overthrow by arms or any other kind of force of one of the - most cruel military autocracies that has ever fastened itself upon an enslaved people? I make one passing reference to Ireland, the country from which my own ancesmote Mr Brennan. tors came, aud to which reference was made last week by the honourably member for Barrier (Mr Considine). I have said that I do not believe in a policy of bloodshed, however good the cause might be. But when, we look at the history of Ireland, aud recognise that for over 100 years she has laboured under a rule necessarily alien to her, that she has beeu afflicted by the fact that succeeding Governments have extended to her the promise of self-government within the Empire, and have wilfully, or in a spirit of cowardice, departed from that promise, I am inclined to think that if ever there was justification for the exercise of force in any country then Ireland, so long - as she is denied the right of self-government within the Empire, is justified in driving out any invading army, including the armies of Britain, by force of arms. Consequently, it follows that persons who come here as adherents to that principle should not be excluded from citizenship within the Commonwealth. It is very curious that the Government should set their faces so strongly against those who advocate a policy of force. Everybody knows that of all Australian Governments, the Commonwealth Government, through its head arid its members, are the fjreat protagonists of force. Only a little while ago they laid themselves out to or forcibly deport a large portion of our Australian population for military service on foreign soil. That was their theory of government. They attempted to seize large bodies of Australian manhood, and to send them abroad to fight. Yet Ministers now (profess to be so afraid of a policy of force that they would exclude is from Australia any person who is favourable to the overthrow of organized government by means of force. I come now to that part of the clause under which it is proposed to exclude our late enemies-iGermans , Austrians, Bulgarians, and Turks. In this particular provision the Ministry seek to give expression to that surplus of bitterness and vindictiveness to which we were unable to give expression during four horrible years of bloody conflict. In it they show their disbelief in, and contemjpt for, the League of Nations. So far as we can do so, this provision is intended to make the world unsafe for Democracy, and not boo pleasant a place for anybody else. By this clause we "" do our b it "" to prowar and the bitterness of war after Peac& It was in connection with this provision that the Minister for Home and Territories called upon the philosophy of the German poet, Schiller. I thank him for the inspiration which he has given me, because wheu I read this provision and think of Schiller, I naturally think that this philosopher accurately described the attitude of the present Government towards our late enemies when he spoke of the condemned soul in Tartarus, who "" yelled his wild curse from jaws that never close."" In this clause the Government, after the Avar is over, yell their wild curse of hate from jaws which never close. This may possibly have been in the mind of Schiller when, in speaking of another kind of bigot, he saidThe same in darkness or in light his fate Time brings no mercy to the bigot's hate. I do not like to suggest what may happen to anybody in a future state, and in the true spirit of Christian charity I hope that the members of the Government will not get tlieir deserts there. But if there be a particularly dark, dank and noisome, and offensive corner in Erebus, I suppose it will be reserved for the international and sectarian bigots. Presumably, in the leisure of eternity they will yell at each other their - wild curses of hate from jaws that never close. The international bigot cannot lay aside his hate and prejudice after the war any more than can the sectarian bigot. For these reasons I shall vote against this provision. I should be untrue to the pledges which I gave to the electors of my constituency, and quite untrue to my own conscience, if I were to approve of it in any way. I come now to the last portion of the clause, which refers to "" any person who has been deported in pursuance of any Act."" I ask the Minister whether the term "" deported"" covers repatriation, because I remember that not very long ago the Government gave their patronage and support to one of the most officious and pernicious officials who ever imposed his unpleasant influence upon this country- I allude to the so called Consul-General for Italy. From lus safe retreat he used his influence to interfere with the peace, comfort, and happiness of mam.y men who had a better right to remain in this country than he had, and by means of his secret service he pursued law-abiding people who had strong claims on our protection throughout the length and breadth of Australia. The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) arid his colleagues lent him their aid, and endeavoured to cloak his discreditable conduct in seeking to deport Italians to take part in a war with which they had .nothing to do. Many of these Italians were deported, and many of them may wish to return to their homes here. I hope that they will do so. But is it intended in this clause that we shall follow up the rank injustice which we did these people by assisting the Italian Consul-General in his ignoble task? Do the Government propose to say that, because these persons were deported for military service, they must now be regarded as prohibited immigrants, who cannot be allowed to land here save under very exceptional circumstances? Or is it intended that we shall do the best we can to undo the wrong to which we subjected them by declaring that our ports are now open to them? The Italian 'Consul-General"" is, at present, a fugitive from justice, who is seeking to escape the consequences of an action brought against him by a better man than himself. ""Will the Government permit the Italians who were deported at the instance of this officer to be brought back to the Australian homes from which they were driven? I shall vote against the clause.",33
82,Mr FENTON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"Maribyrnong) [4.15]. - In his second-reading speech upon this Bill, the honourable member for Perth (Mr Fowler) said, there were two brands of anarchists in the world. I find, upon consulting Webster, that the interpretation placed upon a certain class of anarchist is practically that which was alleged by the honourable member. Webster says that the anarchist "" stands for society made orderly by good manners rather thorn by law."" Those who share his views believe that ""he produces according to his power, and should receive according to his needs."" I u other words, the honourable member for Perth said there are anarchists who believe that some daiy, through the advocacy of their principles, the world will become so good that no law will be required to keep people in order. That means that the millennium will be established upon earth. I do not know what interpretation a Court would be likely to put upon the term "" anarchist."" No doubt, the Minister in charge of the Bill (Mr Glynn) will enlighten us in regard to that aspect of the matter before the clause which is now under discussion is passed-. I cannot conceive of this particular provision being the outcome of deliberation on the part of the honourable gentleman. It seems to me to be altogether foreign to him. In perusing it , I could not help being reminded of the old biblical saying, "" The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hand is the hand of Esau."" I am of opinion that the essence of this Bill was communicated from 12,000 miles across the ocean, and that, unfortunately, it has fallen io the lot of the most amiable member of the Cabinet to introduce it . The honourable gentleman advanced arguments to show that the provisions of the measure are less strict than are some of the regulations which have beeu framed in other countries. I intend to deal with that aspect of the matter first. But I would very much have liked to hear the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) express his views upon paragraph gf of this clause, which readsAny person who in the opinion of an oflicer is not under the age of sixteen years, and who, on demand 'by an officer, fails to prove that he is a holder of a passport_(i) which .was issued to him by and on behalf of the Imperial Government or any Government recognised by - the Imperial Government; (ii) which contains a personal description suflicient to identify him and to which is attached a photograph of - him; and (iii) which is still in force. A m I to understand from that paragraph that any German, Austrian, Bulgarian, or Turk who seeks admission to this country, and who is in 'possession of a passport from the British Govennmeut, the French Government, the It a l i a n Government, the Belgian Government, the Swedish Government, the Norwegian Government, or the Dutch Govennmeut will meet with a refusal?",35
83,Mr GLYSTIT,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"The provision does not permit him to come in , but it is one of the conditions laid down",36
84,Mr FENTON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"Does the Minister argue that if a G-erman commercial traveller comes to an Australian port in possession of a British passport, the Government will deny him entry ?",36
85,Mr GLYNN,DEPORTATION OF KARL,It depends altogether upon the administration of the Act. The Minister has power to do so.,36
86,Mr FENTON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,It is more than likely that such a person w o u l d j i nd no difficulty in entering the Commonwealth.,36
87,Mr GLYNN,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"They are not intended to . be kept out. A discretion is vested in the Minister, and he must' act according to common sense i u the matter.",36
88,Mr FENTON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"It practically amounts to this: that, in the tail end of the clause, there is apermission for a wealthy German, Austrian, Bulgarian, or Turkwho wishes to come to Australia to ply his trade, either on his own behalf or on behalf of others in this country-to enter Australia so long as he possesses a passport, whereas the poor man is denied that right.",36
89,Mr GLYNN,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"The Act does not say that, nor does the discretion of the M in ister, say it .",36
90,Mr FENTON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"The honourable member knows the influence of wealth. Today Great Britain is being overrun with German bagmen, and Germany is being overrun with British bagmen. How do they find entry ? Where is the necessity for a B i ll like this, when the centre of the Empire is allowing these trade facilities to be given ?",36
91,Mr GLYNN,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"We are not in Great B r it a in ; we are dealing with this place only. ' Mr Fenton - I know; but the honourable member said, in introducing the Bill , that we were more lenient than the British Government to the people who sought entry into the Commonwealth.",36
92,Mr GLYNN,DEPORTATION OF KARL,I did not sav so. I said we were more lenient than Canada or the United States of America.,36
93,Mr FENTON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"I may have mistaken the honourable member's meaning, but why not take the cue from the British Government? I guarantee, that very few, if any, of the restrictions in this Bill will be imposed ""'by the Britisli Parliament. If we are to have competition from foreigners, I would much rather that those foreigners came to Australia and f worked under Australian conditions and laws, than that we should allow the products of their labour in other countries to come here unhindered. I have the following extract ou that p o in t : - » British Syndicate's Proposals - Dutc h news-. papers announce an agreement between an important British syndicate and a Dutch company, the object being the wholesale purchase of German metal products for immediate export to England. Thos© are wealthy people, and that would be allowed. It appears that there will be one law for the rich and another for the poor. Great Britain is going to deal with all alien enemies, as they are called in this Bill , in a much more decent fashion than we propose. President Wilson has announced that the United States of America is in favour of complete liberty of commercial action. As soon as he set foot on American soil, after the signing of the Armistice, he advised the American people to get into trade relationships with Germany, and do' business with Germans as soon as ever they could, and this, although at the Peace Couference he appeared as one of the principal opponents of the German nation. Personally, I would not allow the products of any other country to enter here which we could manufacture' and produce for ourselves, whether they came from Germany or any other nation, until we had firmly established our own industries. We can allow now under certain conditions Chinese, Japanese, Indians, Poles, Servians, Greeks, Montenegrins, Swedes, Norwegians, Dutchmen, Swiss, Spanish, Portuguese, Jugoslavs, and quite a number of others to come in . Jf there is going to be any discrimination as to who shall enter Australia, and as to the kind of competition to which our workmen are to be subjected, it is better that they should he subject to the competition within cur own borders of men who have worked under decent conditions than to the competition of those who have been the victims practically of abject slavery. Simply because we happen to have been at war with four other sets of people, they are net to enter, wnether they are decent and law abiding or not. To give an illustration of what has been occurring all over Australia, a co-operative company was formecT in my electorate to manufacture porcelain, and there was only one man in tlio company, and he a German, who was in possession of the secret process. He signed an agreement with the company to teach it to young Australians, and allow them to undertake its manufacture. I do not think that man was deported. I believe he has since married a Victorian girl. I have seen some of the work which has passed through his hands; and seeing that we are such large importers of porcelain, it is most desirable to allow peaceable citizens like that man to teach Australian workmen an industry of which previously they b i d little or no knowledge. The time may come when, in order to start new industries, it will be necessary to obtain the services of those in other parts of the world who possess secret processes, and who were perhaps our enemies previously. Will any opportunity be given under this Bill to introduce that new element into our industries? The Bill can be administered in many ways that would be detrimental to the best interests of Australia, arid perhaps deprive us of the opportunity of establishing industries for which we have the raw material, but have not the secret process. I do not believe any other country is going to do what we propose in this Bill , which is nothing more or less than an election placard. It is disgracef u l that a deliberative assembly such as this should be called upon to place on the statute-book a measure which can be truly described in those terms. We have laws in Australia by which we can deal with every man who commits certain offences. The Bill excludes any person who says anything against "" all forms of law."" There are certain laws on our statute-book to which I decidedly object.",36
94,Mr GLYNN,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"It does not mean a particular law, but "" all forms of law.""",37
95,Mr FENTON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"We have some very undesirable laws. There have been instances of laws being repealed. That was the case with the law passed in Victoria by Sir Willia m Irvine, giving separate representation to the public and railway servants. That disgraceful Act practically disfranchised them. I said, when it was passed, that our statute-book was besmirched and our honour tarnished by it , and that a future Parliament would take extreme pleasure in wiping it off the record. That very thing happened.",37
96,Mr MAXWELL,DEPORTATION OF KARL,This provision is aimed at a man who is against any legal enactment of any kind.,37
97,Mr FENTON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"The War Precautious Act is a case in point. Things have been done, under it , by the present Government, which are a disgrace to this country, and which were never intended when the majority of this House assented to it . If we could always be sure that the present Minister (Mr Glynn) - would have a dominating influence in administering an Act of this character, we might place these great powers in his hands. But there are other men in the Ministry, particularly its Leader (Mr Hughes), who will make use of this measure for political purposes only. I do not care to place these powers within his grasp. I propose to read a hymn to the Committee. If its sentiment prevailed today, even after the most awful war that has ever afflicted humanity, and was acted up to, there would be more likelihood of peace being maintained than, with all your Leagues of Nations. It runsGod bless our native land, May Heaven's protecting hand Still guard our shore; May peace her jpower extend, Toe be transformed to friend, And Britain's rights depend On war no more. May just and righteous laws Uphold the public cause, And bless our isle; Home of the brave and free, The land of liberty, We pray that still on the Kind Heaven may smile. And not this land alone, But be Thy mercies known .From shore to shore; Lord, make the nations see That men should brothers be, Ancl form one family The wide world o'er. Has anybody anything to say against that beautiful hymn? It is absolutely flouted by this measure. No matter what the Minister may say, in Great Britain and America they are allowing the fires of war and hate to burn out as fast as they can. I object to the Government trying, for political purposes only, to fan into flame those hateful moods in which we have found ourselves during the last five years. The Government expect the Bill to make the seats of their party more sure, and I know that on the Ministerial side men will be found voting with the ""Ayes"" who practically despise every word of the measure, although they will not have the courage to get up and oppose it. I shall vote against the clause, because I believe it is nothing more or less than an election placard, introduced for the purpose of trying to obtain votes. The honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) Mr Fenton. and others, however, will find themselves bitterly disappointed if they think that this election placard is going to do them any good.",37
98,Sir ROBERT BEST,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"Kooyong) [4.34] - The burden of the song of the honourable, member for Maribyrnong (Mr. Fenton) is that this Bill is introduced as an election placard. It evidently, therefore, contains something that will appeal to and be endorsed by the masses of the people.",38
99,Mr FENTON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,Not necessarily.,38
100,Sir ROBERT BEST,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"The honourable member may be sure that it would not be used as an election placard unless it was intended to appeal to the masses of the people. When they are informed that the object of the Bill is to crush the doctrine of force and of the destruction of property, and the revolt against organized government, the honourable member is perfectly right in suggesting that it will at once meet with their approval. I hope that the Minister (Mr Glynn) will stand by the clause. No fair reading of the provision justifies the remarks made by honourable members on the other side im condemning it. They assume that it is capable of political abuse and dishonest interpretation, 'but what does it provide? "" An y anarchist or person who advocates the overthrow by force or violence of the established government of the Commonwealth or of any State,"" &c, may be refused admission to the Commonwealth. Objection has been taken by the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) to the use of the word '' anarchist."" It is perfectly true, as he says, that there are philosophic, harmless anarchists, but such people will not come within the scope of the clause. No one can be a prohibited immigrant unless it is absolutely clear that he is an "" anarchist or person who advocates the overthrow by force or violence of the established government of the Commonwealth,"" &c. Can the .honourable member foT Batman reasonably take exception to the refusal of admission to that particular class df person ? Perhaps the provision would be equally effective without the word "" anarchist.""",38
101,Mr FENTON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,But that would not suit the political placard so well.,38
102,Sir ROBERT BEST,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"Probably not, but Parliament is justified in indicating to the 'Courts the character of the person referred to in the clause, and, therethem fore, we state that admission is to be fused to the anarchist as known to us and recognised by us, not to the man who is a calm, inoffensive individual, but to the members. one whose vapourings we are accustomed to hear, and who is bent, not only the destruction of government, but also on the destruction of property and the upheaval of society. Under the clause, persons who are animated by the sion. German doctrine of violence and force, a doctrine which has been humbled to the dust by the triumph of right over exclude them. might in the recent war, are undesirable individuals, and as such they will not permitted to enter Australia. The clause further provides that "" anarchist or person who advocates the whose overthrow by force or violence of the established government . . . . of any other civilized country, or of all forms of law""-that is to say, the man of who is a law unto himself, and the man who is in favour of direct action, and revolution-' ' or who is opposed to organized government"" will the Commonwealth. be refused admission to Australia. No words in the English language could be clearer. It also provides that admission will be refused to any person who "" advonext cates the assassination of public officials or who advocates or teaches the unlawful destruction of property,"" such as took place at Broken Hill the other day in Sydney a little while back. There is no doubt as to the character of the persons who are to he excluded. "" An y perany son who is a member of, or affiliated with, any organization which entertains and teaches any of the doctrines and pracbeing tices "" which I have just enumerated will be refused admission. There is but one interpretation of those plain words, and that is, that these enemies of society to be prevented from landing on our shores. Are they a desirable class to have in our community?",38
103,Mr FENTON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,Is there no existing law the League of Nations. to deal with them ?,39
104,Sir ROBERT BEST,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"-There is no direct existing law to exclude them from the Commonwealth, and we are now seekthey' ing to make good the deficiency. No sonable or fair-minded man can say that and hideous practices. the class of persons I have enumerated are welcome, and the Government, folthemselves lowing precedent, are taking this opporand tunity of making provision to exclude [451] fro m the Commonwealth. In view reof the experience the world has gained during the last few years, they are entitled to the full support of honourable The honourable member for Batman on (Mr Brennan) said he felt that those persons who are now engaged in rebelling against the present form of government in Ireland would come within this excluI f the honourable member is referring to the Sinn Fein movement, I sincerely hope that the paragraph will The Sinn Feiner is notoriously an enemy of the Empire, be which he hates with a deadly hate.

The Sinn Fein organization has been found guilty conspiring with the enemy for the purpose of defeating the Allied cause and dealing a blow at the Mother Country.

105,Mr EBNTOIT,DEPORTATION OF KARL,How does the honourable member account for the fact that trade is proceeding between Germany and Great Britain ?,40
106,Mr RILEY,DEPORTATION OF KARL,And between America and Germany?,40
107,Sir ROBERT BEST,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"I am aware that America is endeavouring to exploit Germany, and that under certain supervision Great Britain is also establishing some trade witli that country; but we are now dealing with the question of admitting a particular class of persons to Australia to become our fellow citizens. The provision in the Bill before us does not go as far as legislation introduced, in America proposes in regard to exclusions. Canada is following the example of America, and Great Britain, by regulation, is protecting herself in a similar way. When these countries deem that it is necessary to protect themselves in this way Australia is justified in taking similar action. The third point raised by. the honourable member for Batman was in regard to paragraph gg, which provides that "" any person who has been deported in purr suance of any Act "" may be refused adr mission* The heat which the honourable member displayed in.criticism of that pro*posal he indicated, was due to the fact that it was intended to apply, to persons who had been deported during the war for sen vice in the armies of the nations to which they belonged, but the. paragraphin the Bill will not apply to that class of persons. It will only affect personswho have been deported in pursuance of any Act. The only Act to which paragraph gg can possibly refer is the Unlawful Associations Act of. 1916,. which declared to be unlawful(a) the. association, known as the IndustrialWorkers of the World; and (fi) any association which by its constitution or propaganda advocates or encourages, or 1 instigates to the taking or the endangering of human life, or the destruction or injury of property.. Another section provides a penalty for members of an unlawful association who advocate or incite to acts impeding warlike preparations, and section 6 enactsAny person-, not being: a natural-born British subject born in Australia, who is convicted of an offence under either, of the last two preceding sections Bhall be liable, in addition to the punishment imposed upon bim for the offence, and, either during or upon the expiration of his term of imprisonment, to be deported from the Commonwealth pursuant to any order of the Attorney-General. Is there any honourable member who will seriously object to a criminal of this class being deported ?",40
108,Mr FENTON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,It all depends on his political opinions.,40
109,Sir ROBERT BEST,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"I do 'not care what his political opinions are; if he has been guilty of inciting to murder or the di struction of property, or otherwise comes within the terms of that Act, he is an undesirable, and should be deported. All that, the Bill provides in that regard is that, this particular class of criminal who has been excluded under an. existing Statute, shall not be permitted to re-enter the Commonwealth. The . Bill is wiselyconceived; it follows American ^precedent, and seeks to exclude from Australia well-known and recognised criminals-individual s who are bent upon murder, .the destruction of property, and every other violence which . their ingenuity can. suggest. Individuals of that class are not suitable citizens for this well-ordered and. well-governed Commonwealth, and; their presence amongst >us would not assist in: the enhancement of contentment and prosperity. Therefore, I regard this clause as well designed and calculated to at least purge Australia of an undesirable class of persons.",40
110,Mr CHARLTON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"Hunter) [4.55] In regard to this clause, my opinions differ' from those 'of all previous speakers, inasmuch as there are paragraphs to which I strongly object, whilst to one of the paragraphs I can - offer no opposition. Paragraph gd gives the Government wide power to prevent the immigration into; and to deport from, Australia persons who advocate certain political views. There is a good deal in Mr Lloyd George s statement that the country is ? suffering from shell-shock. This Parliament and the present Government, in common with citizens throughout the Empire, are suffering severely from that affliction. They may not be aware, of the fact, but when we return to normal conditions, and are able to calmly survey what we have done in moments of hysteria, we shall realise that we have gone too far: _ I do not apprehend any danger from tie class of persons referred to in that paragraph. As a matter of fact, they have heen in our midst for years, and Australia has benefited hy the fact that we had a few such extremists amongst us.",40
111,Mr EICHABD FOSTER,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"And from their recent operations? Mr CHAELTON"" - I am referring to the anarchist-the person who is defined as being against "" all forms of law or who is opposed to organized government."" For as long as I can. remember we have had those men amongst us endeavouring, in season and out of season, to propagate their wild ideas. Some of them have spent their lives preaching the same doctrines, and they have not been able to make any headway.",41
112,Mr FOWLEK,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"The trouble is that a good many of tliem have gone beyond preaching, and are taking action. Mr Charlton"" - I am speaking of the men against whom paragraph gd is directed. Why have they made no progress with their particular gospel? Because in this country we have a fairly high standard of public education. Those who are dissatisfied with the existing condition of things, and are looking for an improved form of government, go to hear the anarchists and others who are described as being against all forms of government. There is one such individual in Victoria whom I heard many years ago, and who is still going strong.",41
113,Mr FOWLER,DEPORTATION OF KARL,He is a very decent .sort of chap.,41
114,Mr CHARLTON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"He has never done harm-to anybody; on the contrary, I believe he has done a faiT amount of good, because when young fellows, who have in them the spirit of reform, listen to him and other advocates of extreme views, they say at once, "" This is l i e wrong track for us 'tofollow.""",41
115,Mr EICHARD FOSTER,DEPORTATION OF KARL,They do not say that in the Sydney Domain.,41
116,Mr CHARLTON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"They say it everywhere. Our young men have sufficient intelligence to realise at once that what these would be revolutionists are proposing is rubbish, and (that it leads nowhere. The result of years and years of such propaganda has been to merely keep our people in the proper political path. The Victorian agitator to whom I have [451]- 2 been referring has never done any harm with all his years of preaching.",41
117,Mr EICHARD FOSTER,DEPORTATION OF KARL,He is not the type of man to whom the Bill refers.,41
118,Mr CHAELTON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"Bu the can be deported under this clause. We make laws to be administered, and if ra Statute can be construed to embrace a certain class of individual, it is useless to say that that individual will not be affected.  member think that we ought to prevent this country being made the dumping ground for the discards of all other countries ?",41
119,Mr CHAELTON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"It will be very difficult to ascertain who is coming to Australia from other parts. The law as it exists today provides that undesirable persons may be deported to the countries of their origin. That law has been in operation, but to what extent we do not know; some persons may have been wrongly deported. But the law empowering us to deport undesirables exists. What, then, is the necessity for including paragraph gd in this Bill? Who is to decide whether an intending immigrant is an undesirable? Nobody can say. Persons will be admitted because they are considered, when they arrive, to be likely to become good citizens, but if, two or three-years later, they do anything to which exception is taken by the powers that be, they can be deported.' They may 'say somethingagainst the existing system of government; they may be against .any form of government. If they conscientiously hold those views they will hurt nobody. For years we have endured in our midst people holding similar views, and they have never injured the country; rather have they helped to keep us in - the straight path. I think that paragraph gd goes too far, and I shall vote against 'it. But I find myself in a 'difficulty. Whilst I regard paragraph gd as unnecessary, believing that we have all the power that is necesssary to deal with any person who is a menace to .the best interests - of the country, I - am in favour .of paragraph ge, which prohibits for a period of five years the immigration of any person of German, Austro-German, Bulgarian or Hungarian parentage and nationality, or who is a Turk of Ottoman - race. I regard that prohibition as quite proper. Whilst these people as individuals may not have been responsible for originating the war which placed this country and other parts of the world in their present unfortunate position, the fact remains that they are citizens of countries the Governments of which were responsible. That bility descends unto them. Now that peace is restored, it is argued by some honourable members that we should take our former enemies by the hand. for peace on earth. I hope that the war just concluded was the last. But whilst we are prepared to make friends our former enemies, I , at any rate, am not ready to allow them to enter lliis country within the next few years. Why should we permit them to leave their own country, which has been industrially devastated by reason of their own acts, iv order to enter this country where employment is scarce, and possibly get employment even before we can repatriate our own soldiers 1 Many of our returned men will be out of employment for years. anybody imagine that within the next two or three years we can absorb into civil life all of the men who have been engaged in the war? It will take us a long time to get back to normal conditions, so far as even the soldiers are concerned, and we have then to make provision for our growing girls and boys. Our former enemies are responsible position we are in today, and will continue to be in for years ahead; why should we allow them to come here and probably get employment in preference to our own people? They ought to pay some penalty for the crime which has been committed by the Governments of the countries to which they belong. My difficulty is that, instead of paragraphs yd and ge being proposed as separate clauses, they are contained in the one clause, so that a person holding my views must vote for or against both. paragraph gd as repugnant, and not in the interests of the country. I feel sure that honourable members who support it today will live to feel disgust with their attitude. There is no need to go to this extreme. Under the existing law we cau punish by imprisonment, or even by the extreme penalty, anybody who is guilty of a crime against the community. ing already this power, what good can we do by passing such legislation as paragraph gd now, when the world is in a state of excitement in consequence of the Mr Charlton. war, and the peoples are suffering from hysteria or shell-shock?",41
120,Mr CONSIDINE,DEPORTATION OF KARL,The Government's only chance of enacting such legislation is to bring it forward now.,42
121,Mr CHARLTON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"I do not know responsi- whether that is so or not, but I see no necessity for such legislation. If it be true, as the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) has said, that this I wish is a mere electioneering placard, then it is to be regretted that the time of the Committee should be occupied in dealing with with such legislation. There should not be anything of the kind. Mere electioneering placards "" c u t no ice."" The facts have only to be put before the - people to be appreciated by them. The Minister would be well advised in omitting the clause. If he will not do that, then he should deal with each of its provisions separately, so that honourable members would be at liberty to vote for Does those of which they approved and against those of which they disapproved.. We are fond of talking of the liberties won for us by our forefathers, but we seem, nowadays, to be throwing them to the winds. We do not seem to be able to intelligently reason out these matters. We are carried away by excitement, and do things which, in our calmer moments, we are sure to for the regret. For the present I shall not move an therefore, amendment, but I shall probably have to take action to justify my position, since I am opposed to paragraph gd whilst I favourparagraph ge. The latter provision I think necessary. We should have some suchpower to safeguard the interests of our returned soldiers and the people of Australia generally. It is our duty to find suitable employment for our returned soldiers' before we allow Germans to come here. They must pay some I regard penalty for the action of their country in imposing great hardships upon civilization by bringing about the great war. They should remain in their own country and seek to restore it once more to a state of high production. After we have absorbed our own people, who have been fighting for us, and normal conditions have been re-established in Australia, they Hav- might be allowed to come in . I reserve to myself the right later on to submit an amendment.",42
122,Mr FOWLER,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"Perth) [ 5 . 8 ] - I do not agree that this measure is anything i u the nature of an electioneering placard. On the contrary, it seems to me that its introduction is due to a very grim and - urgent necessity which affects, not only Australia, but the whole of the civilized world. Under the plea of political action, determined efforts are being made by criminals to overturn civilization, and Australia, in common with other civilized countries, is compelled to take the necessary steps to deal with such individuals. I am heartily in accord with the objects of the Bill in that direction, and feel that in some respects it does not go far enough. At the same time, having listened carefully to the explanations of the legal members, and having given all weight to the assurance of the Minister in charge o"" the Bill (M.i. Glynn), I am not yet quite satisfied that it does not, in one regard, go further than is intended. I have heard no satisfactory explanation as to why the word "" anarchist"" should be included in this clause, and I am not sure that there is any justification for the inclusion of the words "" o r of any State."" There are some States that are scarcely civilized, some that have no Government, and some that are ruled by tyrants. Why should not the inhabitants of such countries have a right to do their best to bring about a better condition of affairs? Is Australia going to shut out such people if they seek to visit some friend they may have here ? Are we going to pass a measure that will exclude men like Kossuth and Garibaldi? The Minister for Home and Territories assures us that administration will obviate any such possibility; but it seems to me that the principal Act is absolutely mandatory, and that u n d j r it no Government would have any option but to take action in regard to the class of individuals mentioned in this clause. Section 3 of the principal Act readsThe immigration into the Commonwealth of the persons described in any of the following paragraphs of this seution, hereinafter called "" prohibited immigrants,'' is prohibited. W i ll the Minister tell me how, in view .that provision, any administrator will have any discretion whatever in regard to the particular clause we are now cussing?",42
123,Mr GLYNN,DEPORTATION OF KARL,I would point out honourable member that in the very section he has quoted the power of exemption is given to the Minister.,43
124,Mr FOWLER,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"I had not noticed that, and to some extent it removes my objection. There should be no absolute rule in regard to such individuals. As I pointed out when speaking to the motion for the second reading of the Bill , some anarchists, whose political creed is disapproval of compulsion in any form, have done very good work in the cause of humanity. If this clause will have associated with it the option mentioned by the Minister, then the very objection that I had to it will e removed. At the same 1 time, I would suggest that it might well be amended by the omission of the word "" a n a r c h is t"" and the words "" o r of anv State."" Such an amendment would simplify its administration.",43
125,Mr GLYNN,DEPORTATION OF KARL,""" An y State"" there means a State of the Commonwealth. *",43
126,Mr FOWLER,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"It does not appear to me to be so. It is, at all events, a very wide expression, and I do not think the clause is improved by the inclusion of those words. To my mind, it would be much better to omit them. I am prepared to take the Minister's assurance with regard to the clause as a whole; but I submit that, with these modifications, the measure would be much better than it is at present.",43
127,Dr MALONEY,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"Melbourne) [5.15] No one can take any exception to the proposed new paragraph c dealing with idiots, imbeciles and persons suffering from dementia; but coming to paragraph gd, I would remind the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) that no one knows better than does a lawyer that a threat to do violence is not to be compared with the actual carrying-out of such a threat. I dare say that not one such threat in 10,000 is ever carried out. Section 3 of the principal Act, which is to be amended by this clause, has made more enemies for Australia, by reason of its camouflaged intention, than has any other provision we have passed. Four hundred million Chinese, 70,000,000 Japanese, and 350,000,000 Hindoos of come within the section, the dictation test for which it provides being a mere subterfuge. I have heard it said by disMinisters in this House that under section 3 it would be possible to prevent any to the man from entering Australia. As to paragraph ge excluding Ger-mans and other people of central Europe from Australia for a period of five years, I would pay that if the people of high rauk in Germany, who were responsible for the war, are not to be punished, we ought not to punish the unfortunate workers, who were frequently compelled to fight imless they were prepared to be shot. The very pencil that I hold in my hand, and which has been supplied to me as a member of this' Parliament, was made in Germany. I agree with the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) that it would be far better to allow German people to come here than to permit our markets to be flooded with t'..e products of German factories. them as came here could be controlled by means of factory and other laws; but if we allowed their products to come into Australia without restriction, the position would be very serious. If the clause be agreed to as it stands, then all persons of Teutonic blood will hold a bad opinion of Australia. As to that, we need not trouble, so long as we have the' sea to protect us; but we should not forget that to the millions of Asiatics who are inclined to look upon us with an unfriendly eye, we are now adding, by this clause, the millions of central Europe. I could have wished that, in amending the principal Act, we might have seen fit the Bill . to have some regard for the feelings, of a generous Ally. Had Japan been allied with Germany in the earlier part qf this war, our children today would have been learning either Japanese or German.. one will say that the A ustralia could protralia. tect our huge coast line.

It is un-British-like, - when the fight is over, to irritate those who have helped Dr Maloney. It is very rarely that a boxer, after conquering his adversary, will administer a hit under the ear to one of his own seconds. Consequently, I think that the Minister, who is a very wide reader, might have brought forward a Bill in which the word "" r e c i p r o c it y "" was used. It is a word to conjure with in the East, and Japan should certainly have been approached in a reciprocal spirit. We must not forget that when she wast anxious to avoid friction with a foreign Power, it was a. very great Englishman to whom she turned for advice. I Such of propose to read the letter written by Herbert Spencer on that occasion-the most important letter ever penned by a human being. He wroteTo Kentaro Kaneko, 26th August, 1892. Your proposal to send translations of my - two letters to Count Ito, the newly appointed Prime Minister, is quite satisfactory. 1 very, willingly give my assent. Respecting the further questions you ask, let me, in the first place, answer generally that the Japanese policy should, I think, be that of keeping Americans and Europeans as much as. possible at arm's length.",43
128,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,DEPORTATION OF KARL, I would direct the honourable member's attention to the f a c t that we are now dealing with clause 3 of,44
129,Dr MALONEY,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"But that clause is affected by the dictation test, which is embodied in the principal Act, and which No is intended to exclude aliens from Aus",44
130,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,DEPORTATION OF KARL,I do not see any clause in the Bill dealing subsequently with the dictation test.,44
131,Dr MALONEY,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"Perhaps it would bebetter if I reserved my remarks upon this and phase of the question until the debate* upon the motion for the third reading of the Bill . The clause under consideration battlewill inevitably create more friction by sailing reason of the fact that it will affect the of millions of people of central Europe as be well as those of Asia. The honourable with member for Batman (Mr Brennan) was justly perturbed in regard to paragraph gf of the Bill , which refers to "" any person who has been deported in pursuance any Act . "" I join with him in saying that the Italian Consul-General is a disAs I cerpersonally sent that message to him, I have no hesitation - in - repeating it here. to seek From motives of spite and spleen, he us. caused the deportation of a man who had been acting Consul for Italy in this country- a very much better man than himself-and his efforts in this direction were materially aided by the Commonwealth Government. That gentleman is returning to Australia, and would have - sued the Italian Consul-General, but that the latter packed his baggage and fled the country under the cloud of disgrace. I would like an assurance from the Minister that this clause will not apply to any of those Italians who, under international law, were obliged to render military service in Italy at the behest of the Consul-General.",44
132,Mr GLYNN,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"It will not. Those men were not deported under an Act, but under Treaty arrangements, and they were aliens as far as we were concerned.",45
133,Dr MALONEY,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"In view of the Minister's statement, I have nothing more to say on the matter. I am only sorry that the Government have not exhibited a desire to secure reciprocity with Japan by agreeing to allow as many Japanese to settle in Australia and to land here as she permits Australians to be similarly settled in Japan.",45
134,Mr FINLAYSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"Brisbane) [5.28]. - The Bill before us is akin to some of the measures which we recently passed, and certainly cannot be regarded as other than panic legislation. Under this measure it is proposed that we shall do things which we would not do if we were back to our normal state of judicial sanity. We are asked to do things simply because we have hanging round about us that feeling of hatred and opposition to European Powers which is the product of the war. I have no hesitation in saying that Australia must take up a very definite attitude in regard to her immigration problems. But our attitude should not be affected by the attitude of any other country. We have our own problems'of development to attack, and simply be-' cause the Mother Country or any other country adopts a certain attitude in regard to Germans, Austrians, Bulgarians,, or Turks, is not a suflicient reason why we should follow their example. problems and difficulties are not ours. There is a wide gulf between the necessities of our case and the necessities which confront them. We are now practically decent, honest way. . In the position which, the United States of America occupied many years ago when the population of its vast spaces was a .matter of extreme urgency. We have therefore to approach the question of immigration from, an entirely different stand-point from that from which the more settled countries of the world have to approach it. We have either to assimilate the people who desire to come here, to accept them as part and parcel of the Commonwealth, with duties and responsibilities devolving upon them as citizens of this country, or we have to reject them altogether. We have to exercise a very wide discretion, and in some respects a very difficult and delicate discrimination, in determining whom we shall accept as citizens of the Commonwealth. During the war we have 60 abrogated many privileges that citizenship in the Commonwealth today is worth, nothing compared with what it was worth previously. This Bill merely seeks to perpetuate what I have always recognised as an unfortunate position in regard to our late enemies. Under .the proposed new paragraph gd, which is intended to exclude "" any anarchist or person who advocates the overthrow by force or violence of the established government of the Commonwealth, or of any State, or of any other civilized country,"" every Australian soldier might be regarded as a prohibited immigrant. Every Australian soldier left this country sworn to overturn by violence the established governsments of Germany and Austria. Under this Bill,, therefore, every one of tbem would be a prohibited immigrant.",45
135,Mr LECKIE,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"Nobod y but a Scotchman would split a hair like that. ' Mr FINLAYSON - It is not hairsplitting. It is an obvious interpretation of the words of the clause. Germany, Austria, and Turkey rank as "" civilized countries."" We may not think very much of their civilization, and personally I am prepared to extend the warm hand of friendship to any man who has assisted to overthrow by violence the governments of those countries. Our Their proudest achievement today is that our Australian soldiers did overthrow the Hohenzollern government.",45
136,Mr FALKINER,DEPORTATION OF KARL,But they did it in a,45
137,Mr FINLAYSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"They did it by violence. As the honourable member for Perth (Mr Fowler) has pointed out, the clause in its present form would prohibit, the admission to the Commonwealth of men like Garibaldi, Cromwell, Kossuth, George Washington, Kerensky, and a host of others. Why, ,the pages of history are strewn with the names of heroic men who have dared to overturn systems cf government. Indeed, our position today is due to men who dared by violence to overcome the government of England",45
138,Mr SAMPSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,The honourable member does not compare the conditions which existed in those times with the conditions which obtain in a country like Australia?,46
139,Mr FINLAYSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"Condition s have nothing whatever to do with the matter. We are dealing with principles,' and it is quite conceivable that within our own lifetime the present system of government may have so f ar outlived its usefulness that we should render a real service to humanity by displacing it in favour of something else. I do not know of any other way in which some governments can be overcome except by violence. We talk about what has happened in Russia, but I take off my hat to anybody who took action to overthrow the despotic regime of the late Czar. The greatest rendered during the war was the abolition of the Russian form of government. There is no greater stain ori the pages of history, and no more bloody record in connection with government, than that of the Czars and their Governments in Russia. If it was by revolution, by force and violence, that that regime was overturned, what other method was available? I know of no other means than force or violence to overturn an organized system of government in Russia or any similar other country. In British communities we can change the form of government by constitutional means, which is a proper, correct, and sensible course; but where there is no constitutional means available, where it is impossible for the people, because of the entire absence of any rights to free themselves from tyranny, what other method is there? There are a few systems of government \eft in the world yet that need to be overturned. The British Government and their Allies during the war said to the German people, "" Turn out the Hohenzollerns, become anarchists or revolutionaries, and establish a Government of your own in Germany. If you do, we are with y o u . "" When Kerensky overturned the Czar's Government in Russia, Mr Lloyd George and Mr Hughes sent him ringing messages of cheer and congratulation. I wish we could have an opportunity to send a message of congratulation to the people of Turkey on having risen in revolt to overturn by force and violence the Turkish Empire of today. There are tyrannies now in existence that can be overturned only by force and violence, yet this little community, in its smug, self-satisfied pride, as interpreted by this Bill , is to say- "" We want nothing to do with any man, however patriotic, humanitarian, or progressive, if he is going to take violent means to overturn a corrupt and tyrannical system of government."" That is not the opinion of Australia. For many centuries Great B rita in has been looked upon as the friend of the oppressed, and an asylum for the political refugees of the world, who have been compelled in many countries to seek by devious means to accomplish their purpose.",46
140,Mr SAMPSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"I cannot quite see the relevancy of the honourable member's argument to Australian conditions, where service we have constitutional government.",46
141,Mr FINLAYSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"But the clause is not directed to constitutional government. No force or violence is necessary to overthrow constitutional government, because you have constitutional means to do so.",46
142,Mr FALKINER,DEPORTATION OF KARL,Why let these persons in?,46
143,Mr FINLAYSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"Because some of the best men and noblest women the world has seen have had no constitutional means available, and took the only other means open to them, and have been gloriously successful in overthrowing the established governments of the countries in which they live. From what did the France of the present day spring ? On what was the present Constitution of the United States of America founded ? America got its start because George Washington and those with him took the forcible and violent method, the only one available to them, to detach their country from the British Empire. These things are services to humanity, but under this clause we shut out any man or woman who dares make any effort to overcome a corrupt or tyrannical form of government.",46
144,Mr FENTON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,If George Washington were aiive he would.not be admitted.,47
145,Mr FINLAYSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"U n d e r this Bill he could not come in . Every Australian soldier is a prohibited immigrant under this clause, because he l e ft this country to overturn by violence the corrupt government of the Hohenzollerns. All this shows that this Bill is conceived in a war spirit, and not in the spirit in' which we ought to approach such an important question.  the line? Would you let all these men in?",47
146,Mr FINLAYSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"The Bill ought to be withdrawn until a new Parliament assembles, when the war atmosphere has cleared from our minds. I confess I approach this Bill with a prejudiced view. I do not think there is a single member here who can approach it without having at the back of his mind a prejudice against our late enemies. We are, therefore, not in that state of mind which is necessary to consider so important a question .",47
147,Mr MAXWELL,DEPORTATION OF KARL,Are you against them or in their favour?,47
148,Mr FINLAYSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"V e r y much against them; but I approach an Immigration Bill from another stand-point altogether. Australia has an immense territory, vastly rich, and a population of only 5,000,000. We are faced with a load of debt and heavy commitments, which demand that we shall do our very.best as Australians to meet our obligations. agree with the Prime Minister (Mr . Hughes) that our only remedy is to produce, produce, produce. In order to produce, we must have population. are we to get it ?",47
149,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DEPORTATION OF KARL,Of the right kind.,47
150,Mr FINLAYSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"My argument ""s that we must have population. The question of what is the right kind is quite other matter. It is evident that British communities, and especially the British Isles, cannot provide us with a steady stream of immigration. We are passing Bill which will determine the people that we are willing to admit, and the kind we will keep out. We must, in approachcame^out ing that subject, bear in mind always the needs and the best interests of We are asked to say by the second part of. this clause that no man or woman is in favour of constitutional government and against corrupt governments is a satisfactory or acceptable immigrant. I absolutely dissent from that doctrine.",47
151,Mr SAMPSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,I do not thin k the clause says that at all.,47
152,Mr FINLAYSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,What else does it mean ?,47
153,Mr SAMPSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"It aims at the means that would be employed by these revolutionaries to overthrow a system of government, and refers only to the government of the Commonwealth, or the ordered government of another country.",47
154,Mr FINLAYSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"The ordered government of any other country is the government for the time being of that country. The ordered government in Turkey today is the government of the Sultan, which from our point of view is a most corrupt and tyrannical form of government. The sooner it is cleared out of the world, the better for the peace of the world and for mankind in general, but it is the established government of another country, and the distinct wording of the clause is "" the established governprejudiced ment . . . of any other civilized country."" The honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Sampson) is too well acquainted with history not to know that the best and most progressive men and women, on whose ideas our constitutional forms of government are based were those who by violence sought to overturn the established governments of the countries to I which they belonged. We in our puny, insular pride are to say that they are unworthy to be citizens of the Commonwealth. I wish we could get them by the Wliere tens of thousands. If we could, it would make Australia",47
155,Mr SAMPSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,Hu m !,47
156,Mr FINLAYSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"No , it would make Australia develop - We would get ansomething like good government then. Numbers of men whose names are held in - high reverence were deported to this count r y because of their attitude towards the a government of the Mother Country. Some of the greatest names in the political histhat tory, of Australia are those of men who here as political criminals.",47
157,Mr SAMPSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"Williams , the great Australia. Chartist, was one of them.",47
158,Mr FINLAYSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"The honourable who member's knowledge of history is coming to his assistance. He will find that in every country the most progressive, farseeing, useful political builders up of constitutional government have been those who by force and violence sought to overturn the established governments of the countries they belonged to. Yet we are going to say at this time of day that such people must not come into this country.",47
159,Mr SAMPSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"This clause refers not to the established governments of other countries, but to the established government of the Commonwealth.",48
160,Mr FINLAYSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"No ; it refers to "" the established government of the Commonwealth, or of any State "" of the Commonwealth, "" or of any other civilized country."" That includes any European country one could mention. The honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) had a good deal to say about the Sinn Feiners. So far as I can understand them, they are Irishmen who seek to establish a system of government in Ireland. Whether we agree or not witli the kind of government they propose to establish, the fact remains that what is in their minds, be it right or wrong, is the establishment of a particular form of government in their own country.",48
161,Mr SAMPSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,They are seeking to dissever themselves from the British Empire.,48
162,Mr FINLAYSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"That is not the point. They think there should be a special form of government in Ireland in substitution for the present form of government, but we. are asked to - make them prohibited immigrants. I see that a representative body of Scotchmen have appealed to President Wilson for his assistance in securing for Scotland some change in its present form of government.",48
163,Mr FOWLEE,DEPORTATION OF KARL,I do not think they are very representative. I should be sorry to think that any representative Scotchmen would be such fools as to appeal to the American Senate in a matter of that kind.,48
164,Mr FINLAYSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"I quite disagree with the method by which they are trying to obtain Home Rule for Scotland, but I do not disagree with theiT desire. Under this Bill I would be a prohibited immigrant because I believe in Home Rule for Scotland.",48
165,Mr GLYNN,DEPORTATION OF KARL,Advocac y of such a policy would not come at all within the scope of the Bill.,48
166,Mr FINLAYSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"I was commenting on the attitude of the honourable member for Kooyong. With his onersided and narrow views, he sees only Ireland, and, in his prejudice against Irishmen, in the same way that he would deal with Irishmen he would deal with other men who, rightly or wrongly, believe in doing for their country what the Irishmen are doing for Ireland. A few years ago a gentleman, who was afterwards a member of the British Cabinet- I refer to Sir Edward Carson-deliberatel y drilled soldiers, in defiance of the law, in order to secure a certain result in Ireland. Under this Bill he would be a prohibited immigrant.",48
167,Mr SAMPSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"Si r Edward Carson acted as he did in order to support the ordered system of government, and not for the purpose of destsoying it. ' Mr FINLAYSON - No . He did it in order to take the coin trol of affairs in Ireland out of the hands of the established Government. It is not our business to judge as to whether any existing system of government is the right one or the wrong one; it is a matter for the people of the country concerned; yet the B i ll will enable an officer of the Commonwealth to say that a person, who is against the existing system of government in his country is a prohibited immigrant so far as Australia is concerned. There are systems of government in the world today it would be a blessing to humanity to overthrow. There arc systems of government which are so corrupt, so tyrannical, and so autocratic that the sooner they are overthrown the better, and I am prepared to join with any persons who are willing to overthrow them - by violence, or by any other means available.",48
168,Mr MAXWELL,DEPORTATION OF KARL,They are not civilized.,48
169,Mr FINLAYSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"Were not the German, Austrian, or Russian Governments civilized prior to the war?",48
170,Sir ROBERT BEST,DEPORTATION OF KARL,The German Government proved ultimately that it was not civilized.,48
171,Mr FINLAYSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,The virtuous result of the war is entirely based on the fact that we have succeeded in overthrowing that system of government.,48
172,Sir ROBERT BEST,DEPORTATION OF KARL,That is what we fought for.,48
173,Mr FINLAYSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"We overthrew it by force and violence, the only way available to us; and, therefore, every man who took part in overthrowing the corrupt system of government established in Gerbe many becomes a prohibited immigrant so which saysfar as Australia is concerned.",48
174,Mr SAMPSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,The honourable member is not quite correct in applying his reuntil mark to our soldiers. They fought in otherwise order to crush a military despotism which threatened to enslave the 'World.,49
175,Mr FINLAYSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"Our were repeatedly told that they were fighting to destroy the military government of Germany, the despotism of the Kaiser; in other words, the despotism of the established system of government in Germany, which brought about such possibilities as eventuated in Europe. Si r ROBERT BEST - Is that not true?",49
176,Mr FINLAYSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,It is absolutely true.,49
177,Sir ROBERT BEST,DEPORTATION OF KARL,Then why is the war. honourable member complaining?,49
178,Mr FINLAYSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,»My complaint that the people who were favourable to the overturn of the then existing system government in Germany are to be retake garded as' prohibited immigrants under this Bill so far as Australia is concerned.,49
179,Sir ROBERT BEST,DEPORTATION OF KARL,No .,49
180,Mr FINLAYSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"If the honourable member would read the. Bill he would see tralia.. that such is the case. The honourable member had a good deal to say about Germany's admission to the League of Nations. My hopes that the League of Nations will prove a success begin to fade when I hear views expressed such as those of the honourable member for Kooyong, and I am doubtful the League will prove a useful institution if Germany is refused admission it.",49
181,Sir ROBERT BEST,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"When the German people are worthy, they will be admitted.",49
182,Mr FINLAYSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"The question worthiness should not be the factor. I am more afraid of the danger of leaving Germany out of the League, because I can conceive that she could very easily become the focussing point of a number of discontented nations that would 'bring about another world-wide war, which would put the recent conflict into the shade.",49

Those persons who are taking steps to prevent certain Germans, Austro-Germans, Bulgarians, and Turks from entering Australia in order to safeguard the Commonwealth, very likely applaud, at the same time, the action taken by the British Government, and reported in last evening's papers, in despatching carpetbaggers to Germany in order to secure British trade with that country.  member want these Bulgarians to enter the Commonwealth by thousands?",49

We are informed by cable that certain persons have l e ft .Great Britain for the purpose of insuring that the Germans shall be forced to trade with the Empire, and all who pay attention to the march of events know that it is trade that counts.

192,Mr CONSIDINE,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"I know. Our quarrel was supposed to be with the Prussian junkers, who had enslaved their people, or with the militar y caste of Prussia, which had imposed its will upon the Teutonic peoples; but now that the Prussian military machine has been ruined, honourable' members opposite put aside their camouflage.and say that the German, Austrian, and Bulgarian people ought to be kept out of Australia. Why is this?",50
193,Mr MAXWELL,DEPORTATION OF KARL,What reason does the honourable member suggest?,50
194,Mr CONSIDINE,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"I suggest that the reason is that in Germany and Austria, as in Russia, the interests of the r u l i ng classes are menaced by the revolt of the people, and the growth of the social idea amongst them, and honourable members honourable opposite desire to keep out Germans and Austrians because they imagine that as a result of the war there is a spirit of antagonism to those people based purely on the fact of their having been born in enemy countries. And honourable members hope to safeguard their own vested interests and privileges by playing upon that prejudice of the people. The very persons who talk so much about the liberty of this country have deliberately disfranchised Australian-born citizens.

Now honourable members have dropped that argument just as the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), who, during' the war, resented any imputation that the struggle was a commercial war, says now, "" Nobody denies that it was a war waged for commercial supremacy."" W hy is the prohibition against Germans, Austrians, and Bulgarians limited to a period of five years ?

If that word were separated from the other words, the phrase would not be grammatically correct. The insertion of the word "" profiteer"" would destroy the continuity of sense that honnow exists in the paragraph as framed, and a common-sense reading of the paragraph then would be that a profiteer was a man who advocated the overthrow of governments by force or violence. it not be better to allow profiteering to he dealt with on different lines and the in a separate measure?

208,Mr MAXWELL,DEPORTATION OF KARL,The honourable member ought not to deal in a spirit of levity with such a serious subject as that covered by this Bill .,52
209,Mr RILEY,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"This amendment has been moved by the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey) to give effect to a principle in which he believes, and the division upon it will prove interesting in the days to come.

So far, I have not taken part in the discussion upon the Bill , either in the House or in Committee. I cannot agree with those of my party who oppose the Bill . It is absolutely necessary to prevent the importation, and to facilitate the exportation, of any person whose opinions differ from those' of the Government.. I thoroughly endorse > the proposal of the Government to prohibit' the immigration into Australia of .any one with whose views they disagree. I desire, however, to make the Bill as perfect as possible. We are suffering at present from social unrest caused by agitators, certain classes of anarchists, revolutionaries, and others with fight the absurd ideas which they bring from abroad, and which we could not tolerate in a free country. We should not only prohibit the entrance of such people into Such a man the Commonwealth; we should absolutely prohibit the importation of any idea, whether expressed by word of mouth or in writing, that is likely to produce unrest in the community. The Age newspaper has declared that profiteering is the fundamental cause of unrest in Australia. The profiteer, therefore, is one of our greatest enemies, and we Like the should not allow him to enter the country. Honourable members dare not vote against a proposal to prohibit the entrance into Australia of the germ of If we go to a unrest. Not one of them dare disagree with the Age, and mnst therefore support this amendment. We ought to be prepared to keep out' everydiscordant germ. We need to build up harmony. What we want is peace, perfect peace- a peace that ends only in the grave. It is this consideration that has led me to submit my amendment, and I cannot understand why any one should object to it . If it be agreed to, -I shall move further amendments, making it quite clear that what we desire -'s to shut out profiteers and all who are engaged in spreading the gerai of unrest. We want to shut out every insidious policy destructive of the peace and harmony of the country.",52

213,Mr FINLAYSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"Brisbane) [7:47] I ""was speaking previously of 'the position of Germany with regard to the League of Nations. From the ""beginning of the recent war, and right through it, it was continually emphasized that we had no feelings of hatred towards the German peopio as such, and that our opposition was entirely to their attempts at military domination. It was said that our quarrel with the German people was simply because they - were the supporters of a system which we opposed, and determined to overthrow, if we could. During the war the German people were invited to overthrow that system of government themselves and establish a constitutional form of government in Germany. Both things have taken, place. The Prussian system of militarism has been overthrown, and the German people have established a constitutional form of government.",53
214,Sir ROBERT BEST,DEPORTATION OF KARL,There was no such movement prior to the war.,53
215,Mr FINLAYSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"They established a constitutional form of government prior to the armistice, and their action was the direct reason for the armistice. those tilings having been accomplished, what further argument have we against the Germans, Austrians, Hungarians, Bulgarians, or Turks-? I see no reason for the insertion of paragraph ge, because I do not think any of those people will, feel, at all attracted towards Australia several years to come, or that they will be welcome visitors to Australia. I do not think Australia wants immigrants from those countries, or that they wonld get a very comforting reception if they attempted to come. Why insert this provision to keep them out, seeing that at any time we may want them to junction with us to preserve the peace of the world? The admission of the Germanic nations to the League of Nations may occur at any moment. It is within the province of the League to admit them. I foresee, not the end of war- I wish I could-bu t a considerable extension of the war area; so much so, ifchat I dread the possibilities of a great war, which, I think, will eventuate between Europe and Asia. It is, therefore, essential that the European nations who uphold to some extenlt the same standard of civilization should be in hearty co-operation with each other. The Germans are our enemies today; a very few years ago they were our most intimate friends; and British statesmen explicitly stated that the best policy for Great Britain was a close alliance with Germany. At'that time Erance was our enemy; today she is our friend. Who shall say who will be our enemy tomorrow, or our friend the day after? But here we are declaring that, for five'years at least, and for an indefinite period thereafter, "" the Jews will have no dealings with the Samaritans."" That is a policy of exclusion, and a discrimination in nationalities to which I refuse to subscribe. I have no love-for the German system of government. Even the present one does not approach my ideals. I have less love for the system that was overthrown. I have not a good word to say for the methods adopted by Germany during the war. It would have been a world calamity if Germany had, in any sense, succeeded in the war; but now the war is over, many reasons exist why we should forget as soon as possible the 'things that divided us, and unite for the service of humanity. In Both those circumstances, it is an abrogation of all the ideals that Great Britain has always stood for that we should shut the doors of Australia to people from the countries enumerated in the clause. The fact that during this war we have practically shorn of all value the citizenfor ship given in Australia to people of other nationalities than our own, is detrimental Ito our reputation, and will have a serious effect upon our future development. We have made naturalization in Australia of no value whatever. No nation has any guarantee that, if its subjects come here to settle, and accomplish all the necessary requirements in regard ito residence and citizenship, the citizenship we grant to them will be worth anything, because at any moment it may be abandoned or repudiated. We took up during the war the position that the moment any country is at war with 'Great Britain we are necessarily at enmity, not only with the people living in that country, but with every person who, by any stretch of the imagination, can !be connected in nationality with that country. That is a proposition which, in time of war, Ave may be Avilling to accept; but to make it a permanent plank in our immigration system will not stand the test either of humanity or of reason, and is opposed to the best interests of Australia. In repudiating citizenship, and in depriving of citizenship those who, at our own invitation came here and accepted its responsibilities, who displayed loyal and constitutional adherence to our customs and our laws, we have, by that very act, declared those people to be enemy subjects. Even though there was no record against them, and no charge had been laid against them, many of them have been deprived of their citizenship, and made responsible for acts committed without their knowledge or approval, after they had openly denounced the German aggression that brought about the war. Is our citizenship to be of no value? Are we willing to placard to the world that no man or woman who comes here from any country other than a British Dominion can depend upon his citizen rights for one moment? That is practically whait it means. Probably, as the result of what I am saying, I may the branded jus a pro-German. That is nothing new. A man who is afraid to be called names .is afraid to do anything, and will never accomplish much. The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) at Fremantle the other day said, "" We have to open the doors of Australia, and provide for the settlement in Australia, first of our own people, secondly of the service men from the British Dominions, and thirdly of the peoples of other countries."" Yet, before lie gets back to his parliamentary duties, his own Government say, "" No; there are some we will not have on any consideration."" Under the existing law, there is a very clear and effective bar against the introduction of any one who is thought undesirable. Section 3 provides for the application of the dictation test, which can be, and has been, used to prevent undesirable immigrants from entering Australia. Section 16 provides that the Governor General may make regulations for carrying out the Act, and empowering officers to determine wheUJier any person is a prohibited immigrant. Paragraph ge of this clause provides that "" any person who, in the opinion of an officer, is of German, Austro-German, Bulgarian, or Hungarian parentage and nationality, or is a Turk of Ottoman race,"" may be prohibited. . Some irresponsible individual, not a member of the Mr Finlayson. Government, is to have the power to say who is or who is not of this class, or who may or may not be admitted. Under the Act power is given to the Minister to appoint an officer to whom we are, under this paragraph, giving specific power to determine the matter. During the war serious difficulties occurred through certain officers taking upon themselves the responsibility of saying, despite documentary proof to the contrary, that certain persons were of German or Austrian nationality, when, as a matter of fact, they were neither the one nor the other. In this regard we are opening the door to a very serious possibility of national trouble. If we are going to prohibit Germans, Austro-Gerinans, Bulgarians, Hungarians, or Turkish people from entering, what about the other nations which were so closely in touch with the Germans and their Allies? Take, for instance, the people of Sweden and the people of Holland, who made no disavowal of the fact that they were trading with our enemies? The people of Sweden and Norway possess attractive characteristics, which make them acceptable immigrants in a country like Australia, but it would be quite easy to put up the argument that they are undesirable immigrants because of their connection with Germany during the war. The provision in the Bill is either too narrow or too wide-to o narrow because it excludes people who are equally culpable with the Germans because of the assistance they rendered to Germany during the war; too wide because it includes people who were not responsible for the war, and were only the victims of circumstances.",53
216,Mr MAXWELL,DEPORTATION OF KARL,Does the honourable member regard neutrals as equally culpable with Germans ?,54
217,Mr FINLAYSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"It was not possible for either man or nation to be neutral during the war. It was a conflict in which every person had to take sides, either for or against those things which in our inmost hearts we believed to be for the betterment of the race and civilization; and those nations which preserved what they called neutrality simply took up.an attitude which prevented them from being involved in the actual fighting, but did not prevent them from making profits by carrying on trading operations with our enemies.",54
218,Mr BAMFORD,DEPORTATION OF KARL,Does the member seek to have the prohibition made wider?,55
219,Mr FINLAYSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"No . I say that if the discrimination which is established is insisted on, it ought to be made wider; but I am not in favour of having that discrimination. In any case, it is unnecessary, because the A ct already provides ample safeguards preventing the entry of any undesirable person .to Australia. There are nationalities in Europe to whom I have a greater dislike than I have to the central nations. There are certain elements in the southern European nations which make them much less attractive to me. We declare to ourselves that for the next five years we shall have nothing to do with particular peoples, because they are undesirable immigrants, yet we may have much more to fear fro m other nations.",55
220,Mr JOWETT,DEPORTATION OF KARL,Would the honourable member like to improve the Bill in that respect ?,55
221,Mr FINLAYSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"It is unnecessary to do so, because the Act already enables us to keep out people of any nationality whom we consider undesirable. The discrimination which the Bill shows is only likely to cause trouble, and will not help towards the settlement of differences. I am one of those who are seeking in every direction to find a solution for the present international disturbances and unsettlement in order that, so far as civilization is concerned, there will be such unanimity among the people of the world as will accelerate the progress of humanity. Discriminations such as are perpetuated in the Bill only hinder things, and continue those divisions among peoples which tend to bring about trouble, and war.",55
222,Mr JOWETT,DEPORTATION OF KARL,The people mentioned in the paragraph are those who brought about the last war.,55
223,Mr FINLAYSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"The people against whom we are discriminating were no more responsible for bringing about the war than was the honourable member. The influences at work in those countries which brought about the war have been displaced, and the peoples of those countries have, at the invitation of Great Britain and her Allies, taken such action as has - rehabilitated them with the other nations of the world. When we get down to hard facts, we realise that the people who were actually responsibly for honourable the war, and who during the war were the leaders of their nations, have disappeared, I hope never to return.",55
224,Mr JOWETT,DEPORTATION OF KARL,They are not very far away. One of them was on the throne of Hungary the other day.,55
225,Mr FINLAYSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"He did not last very long. His disappearance shows that the nations are not wishful of a return of his kind or for the re-appearance of the influences which his class exerted. There is also a very strong feeling amongst the nations against any symptom of a return to power of the old autocratic regime. In Australia we should seek not only to heal our own divisions, but also to find out the bust in every nation of the world, in order to attract to Australia the best brains and the best workers that every country can furnish. The proposal in the Bill will not only serve to create a bad feeling against us in other p'arts of the world, but will also cause a feeling of unrest and insecurity among the people of foreign birth already in Australia. What guarantee can be given to those people? None whatever. The war is far from being settled. To-morrow we may be involved in a conflict affecting not only the people in the country with whom we are at war, but also persons of that nationality who are already resident in Australia; and it may be necessary for us to amend the Immigration Act to exclude the people of Italy , or Poland, or the Balkan States, or Russia. We never know where to stop when we commence on this kind of thing. The Bill accentuates trouble, and seeks to bring about what we are anxious to avoid. It is all the more unnecessary, when we remember that there are two specific provisions in the Act which give ample power to keep out undesirables from any country, and that that power has been sufficient in the past. I am opposed to making any discrimination against another country. Each nation has its good points as well as its bad points, and our immigration laws should be wide enough to enable us to take the best that any country can give us, while reserving to ourselves the right to reject anything we think may be inimical to Australia. The adoption of that standard would give no offence to any nation, because there would be_ no discrimination. It is only discrimination which causes trouble. I am not anxious to have an influx of Germans into Australia. I would be the first to give the Minister power to prevent it if such a danger threatened,, just as I would be the first to object to the influx of Japanese or other undesirable immigrants. Discriminations cause misunderstandings with other nations, and will cause no end of disturbance to the minds of people of other nationalities already resident in Australia.",55
226,Mr SINCLAIR,DEPORTATION OF KARL,The honourable member's suggestion is to block them when they come here?,56
227,Mr FINLAYSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"No ; there is a better method. The honourable member knows that' we have officers on duty in London, whose business it is to block people from emigrating to Australia whom they think are undesirable immigrants - When the State Governments have sent their emissaries to Germany and other countries for the purpose of inducing people to emigrate to Australia, they have carried with them the terans under which persons were permitted to do so. No one would be foolish enough to attempt to emigrate to Australia without a reasonable assurance that he would be admitted to the country. Every one knows that a country must have immigration laws. We want people in Australia. We must get population to develop the country, and Ave should leave our door open wide enough to admit of the best we can get, and the most useful immigrants obtainable from any country; but at the same time we should hold in our hands the key of the door, so that we may close . it and lock it effectively against those whom we consider to be unsuitable and unworthy. The honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) has suggested that paragraph gg, providing for the prohibition of any peTSon who has been deported in pursuance of any Act, can only refer to persons deported under an Act already in existence. There is only one Act in existence dealing with deportations, but there is nothing to hinder another measure being brought in at any time.",56
228,Sir ROBERT BEST,DEPORTATION OF KARL,When we are dealing with that measure we can reconsider this provision.,56
229,Mr FINLAYSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"That is the good old policy of ""wait and see."" I do not believe in locking the stable door - after the horse has gone. j",56
230,Sir ROBERT BEST,DEPORTATION OF KARL,My purpose was to give a proper interpretation of the provision.,56
231,Mr FINLAYSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,The honourable member gave a lawyer's interpretation. I give an ordinary man's interpretation.,56
232,Mr WEST,DEPORTATION OF KARL,A common-sense interpretation.,56
233,Mr FINLAYSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"I think a Courtwould decide that this provision applies to any Act that has been passed or may be passed. It is a notorious fact that people have been deported from Australia during recent, years for various reasons, but in my opinion, in many cases, these people should never have been deported. Nothing could be publicly alleged against them.",56
234,Sir ROBERT BEST,DEPORTATION OF KARL,Were they deported under the Unlawful Associations Act?,56
235,Mr FINLAYSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"Yes . A large number of men were deported under the false pretence that they were I.W.W - ites. Had they been given the opportunity of stating their case and being heard in their defence they would never have been deported by any Court or jury. They were deported to serve political purposes. The Act was, in fact, passed to serve political purposes.",56
236,Sir ROBERT BEST,DEPORTATION OF KARL,It was a very useful Act. Criminals of that type should not be allowed to remain here.,56
237,Mr FINLAYSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"It was useful at the last elections. It caused a lot of noise, and frightened many people, but the people will not always be in auch a nervous state as they were then. They desire sensible, reasonable, and honest government. By firing off that blivnderbuss at the last election the Government were able to frighten, many people to.such an extent that they voted in away which was not in the best interests of the country. But they are fast, recovering their sanity. The Democracy of Australia is the most intelligent in the world, and at the coming elections the electors will require intelligent arguments and facts, and a genuine redemption-of promises, not mere noise and bluster. This clause provides that a person who has been deported shall not be admitted to the Commonwealth at any time. Suppose we find later that a mistake has been made regarding the - guilt of any person who has been deported, and who has been compelled to leave his wife and family in Australia. Are we unwilling to retrieve such a mistake? Under this clause we cannot do so. We are shutting, locking, and doubly bolting thedoor against him.",56
238,The CHAIRMAN,DEPORTATION OF KARL, Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,57
239,Mr BRENNAN,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"Batman) [8.17] - I offer a friendly challenge to the Minister for Home and Territories (Mr Glynn) on the construction of paragraph gd, which commences, "" any anarchist or person who advocates the overthrow by force or violence of the established government of the Commonwealth."" I contend that if those words are to be given their right meaning they must be understood to differentiate on the one hand between any anarchist and, on the other hand, any son who advocates the overthrow by force or violence of the established government of the Commonwealth. May I suggest to the Minister that if he intends that phrase to mean what hesays it does mean, he might make the language a great deal clearer. In regard to that portion of the clause which deals with the exclusion of our late enemies for a period of five years, I thought it was a sufficiently recognised principle of parliamentary government that no Parliament seeks to bind itself or future Parliaments as to its course of conduct in a matter of this kind.",57
240,Sir ROBERT BEST,DEPORTATION OF KARL,Parliamen t oannot and does not.,57
241,Mr BRENNAN,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"Of course, and, therefore, the pretence that we can do so is all the more to be discouraged. I hope that even if this clause is carried, long before the expiration of the period of five years, wiser counsels will prevail in this Parliament, and this most churlish and unwise provision will be removed from the statute-book.",57
242,Mr BOYD,DEPORTATION OF KARL,If we had no time limit it would continue indefinitely until repealed.,57
243,Mr BRENNAN,DEPORTATION OF KARL,Nothin g more or less happens in any case.,57
244,Mr BOYD,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"This does put a period to it, at any rate.",57
245,Mr BRENNAN,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"It is a sort of pretence, I suppose, that our enemies, to use an expression which I heard from the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Finlayson), will have "" dreed their weird."" Regarding paragraph gg, "" any person who has been deported in pursuance of any Act,"" I ask the Committee to consider who are the persons who have been subjected to deportation. I am reminded by the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) of something I said in regard to the Italian deportees, when he took exceptionto my somewhat heated observations as to what I regard as the most iniquitous and harassing proceedings carried on by the Italian Consul-General under the atgis and protection of the Federal Government.",57
246,Sir ROBERT BEST,DEPORTATION OF KARL,I said that the Italian deportees are not covered by that paragraph.,57
247,Mr BRENNAN,DEPORTATION OF KARL,My only object in per- referring to the matter was to inquire of the Minister whether such persons were likely to be excluded.,57
248,Mr GLYNN,DEPORTATION OF KARL,No ; they were not deported under an Act.,57
249,Mr BRENNAN,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"The honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) said that they were not covered by this paragraph, because they had not been deported in pursuance of any Act. What were they deported, in pursuance of? Were they deported in pursuance of some arbitrary power which we always suspected was being operated by the Government, or were they deported under the War Precautions Act, and a regulation made thereunder which invested the Consul-General for Italy with certain powers? As a matter of fact, they were deported in pursuance of an Act, and, therefore, technically, they come within the meaning of paragraph gg. The persons who have been deported, and who, therefore, become prohibited immigrants under this paragraph, are described by the Unlawful Associations Act, section 4 of which readsWhoever advocates or encourages, or incites, or instigates to, the taking or endangering of human life, or the destruction or injury of property, shall he guilty of an offence. Penalty: Imprisonment for six months. Then section 6, which has been amended, but not in a way to affect my argument, providesAny person, not being a natural-born British subject bom in Australia who is convicted of an offence under either of the last two preceding sections, shall be liable, in addition to the punishment imposed upon him for the offence, and either during or upon the expiration of his term of imprisonment, to be deported from the Commonwealth pursuant to any order of the Attorney-General. A peculiarity about that section is that a British subject, a person born in England, Scotland, or Ireland, is not immune; the exemption is restricted to a natural-born British subject born in Australia. Suppose that an Englishman has been guilty of the crime of instigating to the injury of property. That does not strike me as being a very heinous offence. For that he may suffer imprisonment for a period up to six months, and then be deported. May I suggest that, after he has served his sentence for a comparatively mild offence, and having been deported, he should not be still further penalized by this Bill if he should ever attempt to return to Australia. In the circumstances, I cannot withdraw or modify any of my objections to this clause. I was pleased to hear the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Finlayson) speak in such a manly and courageous way regarding paragraph ge. No matter on which side of the House we sit, we have nothing to gain politically, but we have a great deal to lose, by appearing to advocate the case of aliens, particularly those against whom our passions have been aroused during the war. If any honourable member wishes to interject that my passions have not been aroused against them, I answer that the fact remains that those to whom I am responsible-the electors-hav e to judge whether in this regard I faithfull y represent them. It appears to . me that when, according to the boast which we make, we have imposed upon Germany the terms which we declare to be just and proper, and when we have extracted from the German people the very last ounce of what we declared they should give and do as a penalty for their part in the war, to propose now, when the joybells of peace are ringing throughout the world, to perpetuate by a policy of ' unfriendliness and exclusion, the feelings of hatred which were generated, perhaps necessarily, during the war, is a poor compliment to the Australian Democracy, who will not for a moment sanction or applaud such an attitude. Surely honourable members opposite will lend their support to the amendment illr. Brennan. moved by the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey). That proposal does not abrogate any part of the clause as it stands, but adds to the persons excluded a class of person who today is being held up in Australia as the nation's greatest enemy. Therefore' I cannot understand the comparative levity, and even hilarity, with which honourable members opposite treat the suggestion that we should brand the country's spoliators with a proper designation, and in proper company, in the clause now under consideration. While I must not be taken in accepting the honourable member's amendment as being satisfied, I certainly would accept it as an instalment or right, and in the hope that the whole Bill might be modified afterwards by further amendments to more nearly give effect to the democratic aspirations of the Australian people.",57
250,Mr GLYNN,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"Angas-Minister for Home and Territories) [8.31] - I regret that it is necessary for me to speak again on this subject, because I recognise that honourable members have given a fair and wide consideration to the scope of this provision. At the same time, I think there is a misunderstanding as to what is intended. Under the principal Act we have absolute power to prevent any of the persons dealt with in this clause from entering Australia. We have power to apply the dictation test to any person desiring to enter the Commonwealth. Even a British subject could be called upon to submit to it . We do not wish, however, to do that. We want to proceed with a certain amount of reason, and to administer the A ct according to the import which Parliament gave to it when placing it on the statute-book. I was not only a member of the Federal Convention, but I have been a member of this Parliament from its inception, and I remember that in 1901, when the Immigration Bil l was first introduced, there was a great deal of doubt as to whether we should not specify the particular classes to' be affected by the dictation clause.",58
251,Sir ROBERT BEST,DEPORTATION OF KARL,And an alteration was made only at the request of the late Mr Chamberlain.,58
252,Mr GLYNN,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"The suggestion came from Mr Chamberlain. There was much correspondence between the Imperial Government and the Dominions as to whether we should apply as a precautionary measure, and not because of any disrespect to the standing of the nations affected, the principle of colour, as had previously been done, or whether we should adopt some other means of limiting the immigration of Asiatic races. Out of respect to Japan, India, and certain other countries, we thought it better not to specify any particular race under the Act. By refraining from doing that we thought that we should avoid any misapprehension. Power was thereamble fore taken to apply, within the limits of reason, the prohibition against certain races. I repeat now what I said then, that there was no derogation from the dignity of those races by the imposition of such a prohibitive clause. They are in relation to their standing equally as civilized as we are. There is not a race which could borrow the civilization of another and effectively apply to the same extent that it could apply its own. It could apply the great principles ing of morality and Christianity, and all those tenets which rule the League of Nations; but civilization, like all the peculiarities of human beings, is affected by its surroundings. There are biological conditions which make the mixture of races undesirable, although from the point of view of their own physical perfection, the one race might be equally as good as the other. It will thus be recognised that no disrespect was implied by taking the power, where the necessity arose, to prevent the excessive immigration into Australia of certain races. Some of our Allies understand that perfectly well. The honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) suggested the desirableness of having, perhaps, reciprocity with Japan as regards the application of these provisions. Such an arrangement might be arrived at. It has received consideration in the past, and, to some extent, the principle has been applied by some of the Dominions. We really have power under the principal Act tn do exactly what we are proposing to do under this clause. The dictation test, however, is not intended to apply to certain races. Instead of availing ourselves of the dictation test, we say here that for a period only incidental to the war, and which we put down as five years, we shall stop the immigration of certain persons who are specifically mentioned. Instead of taking power under the principal Act, we direct what the Minister shall do. He need not apply the dictation test. It would be quite wrong for him to do so in these cases. We say to the Minister, "" You can stop the coming in of this class of persons without submitting them to the dictation test."" That is why this specific provision is made. We also do not wish to be unjust or to depart one iota from the splendid moral spirit implied in the preto the League of Nations. The M i nister is given power to allow the entrance into Australia of those who he thinks should come in The honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Finlayson) has spoken of the possible impairment of confidence in our administration on the part of other races. Surely in administration the principles of the it League of Nations will be applied subject to the necessity of protectourselves for a time against the incursion into this community of enemy subjects. Such an incursion might possibly impair what it is desired to obtain by the League of Nations. Let me make this quotation from the preamble to the League of NationsThe high contracting parties in order to promote international co-operation and to achieve international peace and security, by the acceptance of obligations not to resort to war, by the prescription of open, just., and honourable relations between nations, by the firm establishment of the understandings of international law as the actual rule of conduct among Governments, and by the maintenance of justice and a scrupulous respect for all treaty obligations in the dealings of organized peoples with one another, agree to the covenant of the League of Nations. I do not think it will be said that this provision, covering a period of five years, can impair the splendid spirit expressed by that clause. I therefore ask honourable members to recognise that this is not a radical alteration of the existing law, but simply a direction to the Administration as to how they shall act, taking into account the significance of the principle itself as applied since 1901. As to German immigration, I would point out that before the war, judging by their own administrative practice, Germans did not wish to come here. I was Minister for External Affairs .at that time, and then, as now, in charge of immigration. I made inquiries as to the possibility of getting emigrants from European countries. I found that, on the whole, the farmers and agricultural labourers of Great Britain were not prepared to leave Country, because, happily, the wretched conditions and pay of the past were gradually disappearing. For a generation before the agricultural labourers of the Old Country were almost at the starvation l i m it ; but, gradually, the upper classes recognised that it was necessary to apply the tenets of morality to these men, particularly in relation to their wages. Their wages were gradually raised, and they preferred to remain where they were. In many cases where we sought on Fair days to obtain farm labourers to come to Australia, we failed. In connection with a Fair held in one town, about two years before the war, we secured 129 emigrants, but a year later we could get only four, the reason being that farm labourers were becoming better off We had, therefore, to endeavour to obtain emigrants from other countries. We looked for emigrants from the Scandinavian countries as well as from the northern part of Italy and some parts of Russia. Germany was not much considered, because, as a matter of fact, Germany, I understand, had prohibition, or was against its people coming out. In these circumstances Germans could not be mate rially affected by any such temporary check as is applied by this provision. It is not a permanent provision, but will apply for a few years, u n t i l , I dare say, Germany comes into the League of Nations. This is merely a proposal to apply for a time, and to an extent, a practice that was considered during the war. No enemy subject could come in during the war period, and, as a matter of fact, no British subject of enemy origin could leave Australia. A naturalized German, for instance, was not allowed to leave the Commonwealth. From the .beginning to the end of the war I do not think that a dozen such persons left Australia. It was only recently that the Imperial Government gave - permission to allow some to leave here in exceptional circumstances. It will thus be seen that power is now being taken to apply for a period that may be necessary as incidental to the settlement of the war, provisions that were applied during the war, in order to prevent any possible in jury from excessive immigration. The honourable member for (Mr Brennan) has very properly asked Mr Glynn. for the significance of this, clause. If. honourable members inquire into its meanthe Old ing, they will recognise that the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey) has taken quite a mistaken view of it in moving the insertion of the word "" profiteer."" Any amendment of the clause ought to have direct relation to its purport. What is the purport of this clause ? It is not to deal with a particular class of person, but with all persons who, according to its context, aim at the destruction by force of organized government. The honourable member is moving to deal with profiteers. That is a matter for specific legislation. To silence the suggestion that this is a mere election move, I would direct attention to analogous provisions in the legislation of other countries. The power we are taking was provided for in the United States - of America, two years ago, and as far back as 1911 in the case of Canada. Under the United States Act, anarchists or persons who believe in or advocate the overthrow by force or violence of the government of the United States of America, or of all forms of law, "" o r who disbelieve in "" - thos e are words that we have not in this Bill-o r are opposed to organized government, or who advocate the assassination of public officials, are prohibited immigrants. Under the Canadian Act , those who believe in the destruction of constitutional government, and tha constitutional provisions of government, are specifically mentioned. The honourable member for Batman referred necessary to the inclusion of the word "" anarchist"" in the proposed new paragraph. I believe that a Court of justice looking at it would say that "" anarchist "" meant a man of the class subsequently described as one who advocates the overthrow by force or violence of established government, or who is opposed to any form of organized government. It surely does not cover a man of the stamp of Kropotkin, who was a philosopher who tried to inoculate his followers with high-class ideals.",58
253,Mr FINLAYSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,What about Lenin and Trotsky. They believe in organized government.,60
254,Mr GLYNN,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"I am not going to discuss them. There are different opinions as to the principles in which they believe. Tolstoi might have been regarded as havBatman ing a desire to apply Christian principles as far as possible to keep people to get her, and he thought the machinery of government should be reduced to a minimum. Some people called him an anarchist, but he would not have come within the meaning of this clause. A Bolshevist- I seldom use the word-or , at all events, a man who wishes, to destroy established government by force or-bloodshed, is a class of anarchist who would come under this prohibition ",60
255,Mr FENTON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"Maribyrnong) [8.46]. - Under ' paragraph c of this clause, if a British family desired to enter Australia,, all of whom were healthy with the exception of one who, through an accident, was afflicted with epilepsy, has the Minister discretionary power to allow the whole family in, or would it be compulsory to exclude the one unfortunate member of the family ? It would be cruel and harsh in such a case to shut out the afflicted one, because, often, the origin of the trouble is a fall or blow in childhood.",61
256,Mr GLYNN,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"There is power of exemption to cover exceptional cases. It has been applied in cases somewhat similar and to the one the honoraible member mentions. Mr Fenton"" - I am glad the hongreat orable member for Bourke (Mr cerns, Anstey) has moved this amendment, although, ' seeing that the profiteer is playing such a prominent part every country, I would prefer a special clause to deal with him. If there is any criminal on the face of tire earth it he. In this connection my previous redoing marks on this clause are apropos. showed that a wealthy bagman, or the representative of a wealthy German, firm, holding a passport, could be allowed in and carry on his trade, or remain here securing orders. He could goall over Australia, or establish himself in one of the capitals.",61
257,Mr GLYNN,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"Under , an exemption does not get power to remain permanently.",61
258,Mr FENTON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"He could be one of the worse classes of Germans. He might be a Prussian junker, or one of those, intrade direct? fluential business men who, in association with the Kaiser, did more than anybody else to bring about the war. The following paragraph from a cable in Tuesday's Sun, shows that the vernment is not averse to doing trade with Germany :TRADE WITH GERMANY. Renter's correspondent at Cologne reports that in order to assist Britisli firms to establish a footing in German markets, British liaison officers have been appointed at Crefeld, Coblenz, Mainz, Ludwigshafen, and Aix-la-Chapello to give information and assistance on trade questions to all British commercial representatives. . Sir ROBERT BEST - There is a difference between traders and inhabitants.",61
259,Mr FENTON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"The honourable member shook his head somewhat credulously when I said previously that German bagmen were overrunning Great' Britain and British bagmen overrunning Germany. The following information is of interest:Crefeld is the seat of German silk and velvet manufacture. Mainz is the seat of trade between Germany, Belgium, and Holland in leather goods, furniture, chemicals,, musical instruments, and cars. Ludwigshafen is one of Germany's chief ports, and has great chemical works. Aix-la-Chapelle is an important trade centre, great spinning and weaving industries, as well as manufacturers of machinery, chemicals, other articles. America and Great Britain are making efforts, through their trading conto do tradewith Germany. At the same time, we, in Australia, are going along altogether different lines. The in Minister quotes from American and Canadian legislation and regulations, but I ask him what that country, just across is the English Channel, is doing? It is its level best to get into association I with Germany. There is a race between American and British commercial men for the German trade, and, as I have shown, the British Government is helping British business men in the struggle. I suppose the Australian fruit-growers will soon again want to sell their fruit to Germany, where they obtained very good prices previously.. American buyers are today goheing through Australia purchasing hides and skins to re-sell to Germany. If that sort of thing is to be done >by a third party, why not allow Australia to do the",61
260,The CHAIRMAN,DEPORTATION OF KARL, Order !,61
261,Mr FENTON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,I am dealing with British Goprofiteering and trade.,61
262,The CHAIRMAN,DEPORTATION OF KARL,The honourable member is dealing with internal profiteering.,62
263,Mr FENTON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"I am trying to ward off from Australia some of the profiteers who come from other countries. These are some of the worse men, because they import goods not made by Australian artisans. You, sir, know that the Free Trade monopolist is the worse, and the importing profiteer is a double-dyed sinner compared with the profiteer who employs local labour. Aliens can enter Great Britain with the permission and consent of the Home Secretary.",62
264,Sir ROBERT BEST,DEPORTATION OF KARL,That is practically the same as this proposal.,62
265,Mr FENTON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"No ; they have practically free entry to Great Britain . The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) referred to the admission of Germany once more into the council of nations, and her treatment once more as a country with whom other nations could associate, in these termsThe only way in which we can secure peace nnd safety"" and the right to make our own laws, and develop this country in our own way, is by breaking the power of the Hohenzollerns. Mr Lloyd George and President Wilson have voiced the opinion of the Allied nations. It not against the German people, sane and clothed in their right mind, that we wage war. It is against the accursed militarism in which they are enmeshed. Let us break that. Let us have a sane political system in Germany, under which the people govern, and there will be some guarantee for the world's peace; but today, when the legions of Germany are massed for a desperate attempt to break through to Calais and Paris, to dictate terms to France and to Great Britain, is not the time to talk of peace. Germany is so recognised by the nations which took part in the Peace Conference that they accepted the signatures of the envoys of the new German Republican Government. Those were the conditions laid down by the Prime' Minister (Mr . Hughes), Mr Lloyd George, and President Wilson. Those conditions having been fulfilled, where is the necessity for legislation of this kind ? I support the amendment, although it is not the best method of settling the question, hoping that, as the profiteer has been denounced from the other side of the Chamber, we shall have the unanimous support of the Ministry and their followers in including amongst prohibited immigrants the person who is the worse offender against humanity ",62
266,Mr BAYLE Y,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"Oxley) [8.56] - The Government are to be commended for bringing forward this Bill , inasmuch as they specifically mention the classes of persons who are to be denied admission to Australia, and thus free themselves from the necessity of misapplying the dictation test. We are all in agreement with paragraph c, because it will prevent the admission of degenerates. We are apt to under estimate the cost to the country of admitting this class of people. There are some classical illustrations,- which I shall quote. One of the best known cases was that of the Juke family, residing in one of the eastern counties of New Y o r k State. It ' is recordedThe descendants of one Ada Juke, otherwise and more familiarly known as ""Margaret, the Mother of Criminals,"" were carefully traced. The family and its various branches inhabited a certain county in eastern New York. Of the 1,200 direct descendants of Ada Juke, nearly 1,000 were shown to be criminals, prostitutes, paupers, inebriates, or insane. These degenerates had cost the State 1,300,000 dollars. In proposing paragraph c, the Government are doing a splendid thing for Australia. Another case was traced by Professor Poellmann, of the University of Bonn. We are told thatHe has investigated the lives and characters is of the descendants of a woman .who was a confirmed drunkard, and who died early in the last century. The five or six generations of her direct posterity number, to date, 834 persons. He has ascertained the records of 709. Of these, 107 were of illegitimate birth, 162 were professional beggars, 64 inmates of almshouses, 181 prostitutes, 76 were convicted of serious crimes, and 7 were condemned ' for murder. The total cost to the State of caring for these paupers, nnd punishing the criminals, and the amounts privately given in alms and lost through theft, are reckoned at 1,206,000 dollars, or more than 12,000 dollars a year. The writer adds that this was rather an expensive family for any country to have to support. The honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) criticised the Minister (Mr Glynn) for drawing upon the experience of the United States of America and Canada for precedents. If we are not to be guided by the experience of other countries, we shall find that gaining our own experience is rather an expensive business. The United States of America presents the greatest example of a country which has appealed to the people of the other countries to migrate. In the past Australia has been on the outskirts of the world, and has drawn to its shores comparatively few of the peoples of Europe, but, during the past four years, we have been represented on the other side by over 300,000 advance agents. Each one of our soldiers has proclaimed the glories of this country to the people in Europe with whom he has come in contact, and Australia today is not the unknown country that it was in the past.",62
267,Mr CONSIDINE,DEPORTATION OF KARL,What is the good of that when you want to keep them out'!,63
268,Mr BAYLEY,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"We want to keep out the undesirable class such as I have quoted. In the early days of America the better class of people migrated to its shores, but of late years the people of northern and central Europe have found it to their advantage to stay in their own countries. The conditions there were, if anything, on a par with those offering in America, and the United States, receiving, as it has of late years, until the outbreak of the war, on the average, over 1,000,000 immigrants a year, has not drawn upon the best of Europe, but has drawn upon the worse. We do not want the worse. It is far better for us to pend entirely upon our natural increase than to draw upon the worse of Europe. Nor do we want anarchists-thos e persons desirous of overthrowing existing systems of government. We have in our midst a few people who do not stand for law and order, and who would overthrow any semblance of law in order to gain their own ends; and if by means of this Bil l we can keep others of this class out of Australia, it will be an advantage to the country. The provision which will keep out people of the central European Powers and the nations arrayed against us in the war is a fair one, although it is only to last for a period of five years. The honourable member for Brisbane (Mr . Finlayson) says that it is not in agreement with the League of Nations; but I would remind him that the Central Powers are not. to be admitted to that League at present. If ever the time comes when they are admitted, it will be time enough for us to review this provision.",63
269,Mr FINLAYSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"The Bill says "" for a period of five years "" and "" thereafter.""",63
270,Mr BAYLEY,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"It would not be the first Act repealed by this Parliament. This provision is subject to repeal at any time, and if ever the people of the Central Powers show that they are worthy of admission to the League of Nations, then it will be open to this Parliament to repeal it , and admit them to Australia. I look upon paragraph gf as merely a further means of enabling us to identify the persons who are specifically mentioned in the preceding paragraphs. Although it has been asserted by the Opposition that a number of people have been deported who should never have been deported, I have yet to learn that any person of the class referred to in paragraph gg has not got his just deserts.",63
271,Mr BRENNAN,DEPORTATION OF KARL,Has the honourable member looked into one of those cases ?,63
272,Mr BAYLEY,DEPORTATION OF KARL,No man has been deported whose case has not been thoroughly gone into.,63
273,Mr BRENNAN,DEPORTATION OF KARL,Why does the honourable member say that?,63
274,Mr BAYLEY,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"Because I have sufficient confidence in the Government to know that no man would be sent out of this country unless there was ample proof that he deserved being deported. It is my intention to support the Bill , believing that if it is placed on the statute-book dei t will be in the best interests of Australia.

279,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,DEPORTATION OF KARL, Then it would be advisable for the orable member to get another honourable member to move it .,64
280,Mr CHARLTON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"I submit that the hon the accomplishment ' of nothing. orable, member for Bourke is in order i moving a further amendment.

281,Mr ANSTEY,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"I have not yet spoken to the clause. The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN As I was not in the chair when the honanxious orable member was speaking, I will giye him the benefit of the doubt.",64
282,Mr ANSTEY,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"I felt that my k in d words, like bread cast upon the waters, would come back to me, not after many days, but at once. I feel that it is lutely necessary to improve the clause to the utmost of our ability. desire to move an amendment that will make clear the intention of the Bill to which no honourable member will object. This clause contains a proposition to exclude everybody who is opposed to the PAIRS.. interests of Australia. W it h that proposal I quite agree. The honourable member for Oxley (Mr Bayley) staggered me. He is an illustration of the gentlemen who in this country sing "" Rule B r it a n n i a "" and wrap themselves in the flag, but are speechless unless EKey can get arguments and illustrations from Germany. The first thing the honourable member did was to quote a professor of Bonn, where, I understand, that other great Britisher, Lord Milner, was bom . 1 As another argument why this Bill should be agreed to, the honourable member . quoted the antecedents of "" Jukes."" I quite admit that the antecedents of the "" dukes are deplorable. He referred to a number of "" Jukes "" whose offspring in cluded 847 prostitutes and 140 thieves. There are dukes today who have not produced prostitutes and' thieves, but who are descendants of such, and to them our apblessed Empire has its obligations. I quite agree with the proposal to exclude from Australia persons whose prewould be detrimental to the interests the of the Commonwealth. There are some persons who say- I do not know w itb ah what truth-that what the Government If that is their object, it is my. anxiety to assist them. As the Age stated the-other day honin a leading article-and the Age is my bible, as it is that of honourable members opposite-the sublime art of politics is And n some people say that this B i ll is introduced, for two purposes. They say that He the Government have nothing to do, and therefore they wish to fill up the statute book .with something that means nothing,, inasmuch as this measure proposes nothing that cannot be accomplished by powers conferred by existing legislation!: If that is so, I , as a politician, am also 'to perfect myself in the art of sayingmuch and accomplishing nothing. By means: of this and other similar Bills, , the Government are able to avoid dealing with the important, problems that do affect the interests of the country: They absoare able to carry on the outward and visible forms of Parliament by diseussing I the pros and cons of something which, when reduced to legislation, accomplishes , apd nothing of value. There areother persons who say that the-real purpose of this measure is political camouflage, and that it is only intended, to provide somethingfor discussion. If that is the truth, one might, in his own interests, sit down and say nothing. But it is said that a measure of this kind is introduced for political purposes. I will not say that is the case, because I cannot conceive of a Government such as that now in office doing anything of that kind. What the Government want is opposition to the Bill. Some honourable members on this side have been ready to assist them in that respect. I am not. I would rather support the Bill. B ut as it is not calculated to 'accomplish even the purposes which it professes to carry out, as it is lacking in definition, and as it contains words that mean nothing, surely it is the duty of members of Parliament to transform into something that which means nothing, if only to make a show of earning the money we are paid and are pleased to get. The clause refers to civilized nations, and draws a clear line of demarcation between one State and another. It refers to the established governments of the Commonwealth "" or any State."" W h at is a State? Do the Government mean to say that they are opposed to the advocacy of violence or force against Eaiserdom?",64
283,Mr GLYNN,DEPORTATION OF KARL,""" State "" means a State within the meaning of the Acts Interpretation Act.",65
284,Mr ANSTEY,DEPORTATION OF KARL,Then Prussia is a State.,65
285,Mr GLYNN,DEPORTATION OF KARL,It is not an Australian State.,65
286,Mr ANSTEY,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"Does the Minister mean to say that that is what the word "" ^tate "" means in this clause?",65
287,Mr GLYNN,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"That is the definition in the Acts Interpretation Act. Mr ANSTEY. - That shows the indefinite character of the verbiage employed in this clause. The words which follow are "" o r of any other civilized country."" Is Prussia included within the categcry of civilized countries ?",65
288,Mr SAMPSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,The Prussians aTe baram barians.,65
289,Mr ANSTEY,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"The honourable memthing ber dare not say that Prussia, or Turkey, a parasite like the others. Or Austria, or Bulgaria, is a civilized try. What are the civilized countries? There is no definition of them. Is Kussia civilized 1 Could' not I in barbaric country like Kussia or at Timelse buctoo advocate force or violence against a despotic form of government? As a matter of fact, the words in the clause do not mean anything in particular. Paragraph gd would exclude persons such as many of Australia's that pioneers, who, apparently, ought never to have come to this country. A f t e r the revolution of 1848, and the discovery of the Victorian gold-fields, something like 250,000 men came to this State within a period of four years. They came from every country in the world. There were the Chartists of England, members of the Young Irish party, the crofters of Scotland, the Communists of France, and the anarchists cf Spain and Italy. They came to what they regarded as a comparatively free country. Sir William Stawell, who, being an Englishman, and not a supporter of either the yellow 'dog or the green flag, .must be believed, said that those individuals were drawn from the slums of all the great cities of Europe. It was Sir Charles Hotham, then a Governor of Victoria, who wrote to the British Government that it was evident that the people of Victoria were determined to realise in the country of their adoption all those principles which were scouted by the educated and wealthy classes of .Britain. We can deplore the fact that there was no' such law in existence then ai this proposed Bill . We call those men the fathers of our country. We feel pride in the fact that they left the country of their birth and founded a new and better world in the southern seas. We boast that the young men of today are the desrendants of those early immigrants. But the wealthy classes designated them as the scum of the cities of Europe. What a pity we had not this Bill on the statute book then ! W it h such a law in existence the only persons eligible to enter the country would have been those who had been exiled from Britain for criminal offences, to which they were often driven by their poverty. As you, Mr Chairman, know, I an anarchist, Bolshevik, revolutionist, direct actionist, and everythat is bad. I get my salary; I am I say to my coun- - electors, "" Y o u might as well pay the - money to me as to anybody else."" But between ourselves, I honestly do not bea lieve that the working classes or anybody in this country will ever get anything out of the process of legislation. None of us intends to do anything in this Parliament - I do not-excep t to get as much for ourselves as we can. I think it would be a grand thing if , after long years, we were to have a "" burst up "" of some kind, and if instead of having a bayonet poked into me, I could poke it into somebody else, and if instead of being forever without property, I could have the benefit of somebody else's property before I died. But where can I find anybody in the community who wants violence? If honourable members look everywhere they cannot find such a person. We find men violent, but only in words; extreme, but only in words; and words will not hurt anybody. It was one of the traditions of England that crime consisted, not in words, but in deeds. Even in the bloodiest days of English history-in the days of "" bloody Castlereagh,"" in the "" hungry forties "" when millions of Englishmen were walking from city to city in search for work - it was admitted that a man might be violent in words without the authorities being concerned. It was the man who was violent in deeds about whom they-concerned themselves. When men performed deeds against the Constitution they paid the penalty. This Bill is mere camouflage, a delusion and a sham. There is no country in the world where the working-class agitators are such a mild-manburden nered lot as they are ih Australia. No honourable member can point to a man of violence. I have looked for such a man. I have looked for comradeship, but I have found it not. Amongst all our working-class agitators there is not a man who really means anything when you put up a proposition.",65
290,Mr FALKINER,DEPORTATION OF KARL,^That is a reflection upon the honourable member for Barrier (Mr Considine).,66
291,Mr ANSTEY,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"Wherei n lies the reflection? The point that I make is that there is not sufficient comradeship amongst these men, with the result that they are not able to transmute feeling into action. There is only one thing that will have that result. Make a man hungry. A man walks on his belly, and when he is hungry he will act. We are likely to have many hungry people here, because the Government seem to have no means of meeting the country's needs.",66
292,Mr WEST,DEPORTATION OF KARL,They do not try to meet them.,66
293,Mr ANSTEY,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"No r do we. Shake up the whole lot of us, Opposition and Government supporters combined, and you cannot find any diversity of opinion amongst us, except with regard to superficialities. We are going shortly to have an election. Some of us will lose our seats; some will come back. I hope to heaven that I shall be among the latter. Those who come back to power will have to "" carry the baby,"" and a heavy baby it will be. It will not be the baby of Bolshevism, but something worse. Bolshevism is at least a clearly understandable policy, whereas the present Government have nothing before them but the chaos of indefinite policies. Agitators and advocates of violence do not exist. It is mere camouflage to suggest that we have such people. Our agitators are not hungry enough to think of action. The power of this Parliament will depend upon the growth of public opinion-upo n the action of men who have definite opinions. In this Bill the Government do not really touch the fundamental evil of this country, which lies in the fact that our debts are piling up, and that no attempt is being made to pay them. The manufacturer and every one else passes on the to the consumer of his products. The biggest enemies of our country are not touched by this Bill. They are travelling to Asiatic countries in the hope of securing lines of Asiatic goods with which to flood our markets. They talk about their God, their country, and their King, but their only concern is how to make 5 per cent, where they made before only 2 i per cent. They denounce Germany today, and tomorrow they are attempting to open up traffic with her. They have no regard for either their flag, their country, ortheir King, irrespective of his antecedents and his relationship to the Kaiser. What they are troubled about is whether they are going to make bigger profits by flooding the market with Japanese and German goods. To the extent that they succeed will trouble be caused. They are laying the foundations of future trouble and of Japan's economic power in Australia. The Government do not really mean anything in putting this provision before us. I do not desire to be offensive. I try to please people, and to win votes. Politically, the Opposition has not long to live. The man who is to strike off our political heads will be here in a few days, and it is absolutely necessary before his return that I should advertise myself. I do not suppose the newspapers will report me, and, therefore, as soon as Hansard issues a report of my speech, I shall have it circulated amongst my constituents to let them know I am doing something for my £60 0 a year. For that reason, and not to test the sincerity of the Government, because I do not doubt their sincerity for one moment, I intend to submit a further amendment. This amendment, I am sure, will not meet with the support of some of the Conservatives on this side, but will, I am convinced, receive the endorsement of such revolutionaries as the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best), the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett), and the honourable member for Hume (Mr . Falkiner). I can appeal to such men to give me their whole-hearted support in the proposal I am about to make. They love their country, and want to protect it , and therefore I claim their help. do not suggest for one moment that honourable members opposite are in favour of the profiteer or have any personal interest in profiteering. I believe they are like the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), who tells us that he is going to shoot the profiteers. He was going to shoot them five years ago; he was going to shoot them in 1915, and again in 1916 and 1917, but the profiteers are still alive. learn that he is going to destroy them at any time between now and the date of the next general election. A f t er the next general election the profiteers will be all right for another three years. The amendment I am about to propose will appeal to the intelligence of the Minister in charge of the Bill (Mr . Glynn), or, if not to his intelligence, at least to his heart. I move That after the word "" who "", first occurring, Catts, J. H. in proposed new paragraph gd, the following words be inserted:-""is connected with any company, corporation, association, or syndicate engaged in the monopolization of commodities, or who is engaged in any way in the exploitation of the public",66

The Age tells us that the cause of unrest in this country is profiteering. That being so, we must expel the germ of unrest and discontent. I do not wish to do anything calculated to disrupt or overturn society, and so to deprive myself of £600 a year.

296,Mr ANSTEY,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"Bourke) [ 9 . 5 0 ] - I am sorry that all my energy has been wasted. I have many other valuable suggestions to offer, but, as I am not producing any results, it seems to be useless to go on. I intended to move that after the word "" State,"" in proposed new paragraph gd, the following words be inserted: - "" always provided that not be an offence against the provisions of this Ac t to advocate the overthrow by force or violence of the barbarian States of Germany, Bulgaria, or Turkey."" I am convinced, however, that the members sitting behind the Government would not support this, because they would even sustain and uphold the Prussian State, and impose the same penalties here on a man who advocated its overthrow as on one who advocated the overthrow of any other State. Civilized countries are mentioned, but the Government do not specify what a civilized country or a barbarian country is. The clause is all flim-flam. It consists merely of words, by which the Government do not mean anything. If they had any serious intention in this legislation I would have moved to insert after the words "" civiUzed country "" the following words: - ' ' being such a country as is hereafter specified, but not including Germany."" I am satisfied, however, that members opposite will all vote to include Germany in the scope of their protection, because all they desire is to protect the capitalistic State, which is more important to them than anything else. Under the provisions of this Bill , his sublime Majesty the Kaiser, when he leaves Holland, will be able to enter Australia, because he will not be included within the meaning of the term "" anarchist."" It is not often that I occupy the'time of the House, and I feel that 1I have taken up sufficient time this evening. When the '-' king-pin "" comes back, possibly we may be able to get a word in , possibly not, because I see that he is going to smite everybody hip and thigh. I have, therefore, thought it wise to get in my word this evening. apologize to the Minister (Mr Glynn) for occupying so much of his attention. I have, in the of my 'constituents, to approach various Ministers for certain things, and I desire to keep in the good graces of Ministers accordingly. It is not out of personal animosity towards the Minister that 1I have spoken on this Bill . There is nobody on the Ministerial bench that I love, revere, or respect more than I do the honourable gentleman who is now occupying the chair at the table-except , it may be, .some other Minister who may occupy it at some other time. it shall Mr CHARITON (Hunter ) [9.55] - 1 foreshadowed early in the evening my intention to put on record my protest against this Bill , which I consider quite unnecessary, and pointed out that we already had sufficient legislation to deal with any person who does anything inimical to the best interests of this country. I agree with the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey) that the Bill is quite unnecessary, but it may do some injury to certain persons already here. There are anarchists who have been here for years doing constant propaganda work. They have never hurt this country one iota, because the rising generation, having sufficient education, decide for themselves which is the best policy for the country, . and have not followed their advice. These men conscientiously believe in their principles, and are opposed to every form of government. The Bill provides that they can be deported if they are opposed to the form of government in existence here. That is altogether wrong. Who is to tell whether persons coming here from other parts of the world are undesirable? It is impossible for the Government of the day to ascertain whether persons arriving here on vessels come within that category or not. If the Government cannot find o.ut, those persons have to be admitted, so that this Bill counts for nothing in that respect. Subsequently, if within a certain period they are found to have given utterance to something objectionable, although probably little notice is taken of their remarks, the Government can deport them under the authority of this Bill . Perhaps by that time they may have married Australian women and had children. They will be deported and the Australian wives I and families left here, or forced to go away with them. In doing this the Government will be doing mothing that will interests help this country in any way. History shows that right down through the ages men have heen punished for misdeeds. When they have committed an act against the law, they have had to 'suffer the penalty provided. I do not want to take away from any man the right to express his opinion. Once we restrict the liberties of the people to that extent this counr try will not make the progress that it should enjoy. The people should have the right to express their views so long as they do it in a proper way; but if some officer considers that a certain statement made by an individual is against organized society, that individual can be sent out of the country at once, irrespective of what ties he has. That seems to be hasty legislation, or what Lloyd George would describe as "" shell-shock "" legislation.",68
297,Mr GLYNN,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"That is not the position in this Bill. Mr Charlton"" - We cannot reasonably consider anything today. I do not know where we are drifting. There a great deal in what the honourable member for Bourke has said about many measures being introduced and passed for window-dressing or - political-placard purposes. They should not be entertained in a deliberative assembly, yet they are passed without a scintilla of justification. lation. There is, however, one provision in this measure which may be justified, and will get my support. I do not think we ought at present to permit enemy subjects to come here, who, if not directly responsible, have been residents of enemy countries, and in many cases may have taken up arms against our own people. We were compelled to go into the war, and those people should not be allowed to come here just because they have sufficient money to pay their passages. They should be debarred at least until we have repatriated the whole of our own men and found employment for all our people. The Germans and Austrians will probably find things very hard in their own countries after the war. The taxation there will be very heavy, and the wages, perhaps, low. They may say, to themselves, "" If we can get to Australia, which is a land flowing with milk and honey, we may find, employment and participate in what is going there, insteadof remaining in our own country to pay the penalty .imposed on us for bringing on the war that brought so much misery to the world."" 1 could see some force in that proposition-, but this clause prevents me from voting according to my convictions. I must either vote for the clause: with all its imperfections, debarring certai.ii people from coming here on the slightest pretext, and deporting others for very little reason, or vote against it, because it does this, although at the same time it contains some very necessary provisions debarring certain undesirable persons from coming to Australia. In order to make my position clear and register my protest against the provision which prevents people from coming to Australia who, for the Teasons already thoroughly threshed out this evening, ought to be made welcome here, I move That paragraph gd be left out.",69
298,Mr TUDOR,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"Yarra) [10.2] - I support the amendment. I made my position perfectly clear on Friday last. I agree with the honourable member for is Hunter. (Mr Charlton) that there are many people in the world today who cannot reason as they did before the war. As Mr Lloyd George has said, the community is suffering from shellshock. Our Government are running amok with this kind of legisThey are putting political placards in their, windows for the purpose of distracting the attention of the people from other important matters. At the same - time, they will not tell the people that German travellers, agents, or tourists will be permitted to enter the Commonwealth, while men of the Garibaldi or George Washington type may be excluded. Irish patriots, such as the Minister (Mr Glynn) is, would have been kept out of Australia if this provision had been the law. This legislation is only political hypocrisy. The Minister is anxious to get the clause through, but other amendments have been fore1 shadowed. The honourable member for Perth (Mr Fowler) has given notice of an amendment to deport any person who does not happen to be a native of the Commonwealth.",69
299,Mr FOWLEE,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"My amendment deals only with clause 7, referring to criminals.",69
300,Mr TUDOR,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"The Minister has told us that the provision in regard to Germans, Austrians, Bulgarians, Hungarians, and Turks will continue in force for five years: only, but he omitted to explain that it may continue thereafter until the Gov vernor-General by proclamation otherwise determines. If we vote for the clause as it stands, the provision will last for .all eternity, until a new set of Ministers comes into power and advises the Governor General to issue a proclamation terminating it.",69
301,Mr GLYNN,DEPORTATION OF KARL,I explained the policy the clause.,70
302,Mr TUDOR,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"I believe that the same thing will apply to this class of legislation as has applied to previous proposals. Honourable members who opposed the legislation put forward by honourable members of the Opposition when we were in power are now falling over themselves to say that it was the right thing to pass. When we proposed an amendment of the Constitution in 1911, they said that we were wrong. Now they find that it would have been the right thing to do. Honourable members who are voting for this provision today will find, later on, that it is wrong. However, it is hopeless for any honourable member of the Opposition to propose an amendment. On no single occasion since this Parliament began has an amendment from this side of the House been accepted. Honourable members on the Government side slavishly follow Ministers. Every one of them, with the exception of the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Lynch), voted for the bachelor tax, yet the Government did not have the courage to carry it out. I shall vote against every part of this Bill. I think it is only fair to point out that, owing to an unfortunate accident, the honourable member, for Capricornia (Mr. Higgs) was unable to continue the debase on the second reading on Priday. I trust that the people of Australia will come to their senses, and realise that this class of legislation will not be to their advantage, and that it will tend to keep out some of the best men we could get in Australia. Mr 'GLYNN (Angas-Minister for Home and Territories) [10.5] - I am sure that the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Tudor) would not attempt to mislead honourable members, but sometimes an honourable member's words are put before the public in Hansard, and give a wrong conception of what has actually taken place here. He has said that honourable members on this side of the House did not have the pluck to vote against the bachelor tax. He forgets, the occasion. I happened to be assisting Lord Forrest, the Treasurer at that time, and we both had amendments prepared for the purpose of modifying, if not knocking out, the bachelor tax. As a matter of fact, there was a blunder in the Senate. The of honourable member for Yarra may laugh, but jocularity does not carry the sense one whit further. It is an absolute fact that there was an amendment to limit the bachelor tax; but it was insisted that the Bill should pass as it was brought in. However, I assured honourable members, sitting behind the Government that the matter would be attended to. We were not in a position to do it at the time. It would have meant knocking out that particular part of the Bill, and I asked the honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser) not to press his amendment, which would accomplish far more than he intended. The assurance given was carried out, because subsequently the Government did not put in force the provision of the Bill enforcing the bachelor tax, and at the end of the year a measure was brought in repealing it.",70
303,Mr TUDOR,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"It has not yet been repealed. The proposal is on the business paper today. Mr Glynn"" - The bachelor tax was not collected. The Bill providing the machinery for its collection was not brought before the House. I spoke to the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes), and told him of the promise which was made to honourable members, and he assented to my request that the machinery measure should not be brought in.",70
304,Mr TUDOR,DEPORTATION OF KARL,That is just what I have said.,70
305,Mr GLYNN,DEPORTATION OF KARL,I hope that the honourable member has put his version correctly before the public.,70
306,Mr TUDOR,DEPORTATION OF KARL,Minister s have not been game enough to collect a tax which they said was absolutely necessary.,70
307,Mr GLYNN,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"The honourable member said that honourable members on this side did not vote in accordance with their convictions. They were promised that certain things would be done, and, in accordance with that promise, the bachelor tax did not come into force. We have now had two days' discussion on this Bill, and I ask the assistance of honourable members to come to a decision tonight.",70
308,Mr FINLAYSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"Brisbane) [10.10]. - In supporting the amendment of the honourable member for Hunter (Mr . Charlton), I propose to confine my reloyalty marks to two points. The Minister (Mr . Glynn) has admitted that there is suffiAustralia, cient power in the present Act to include every person, so that it is unnecessary to Country is laughing at them. have this provision in the Bill . Discremonths tion lies in the hands of the Ministry exclude any person from this country as an undesirable immigrant. That is first point. A very few years ago, under the M i isterial sanction of the honourable gentletalking man at the table (Mr Glynn), the monwealth issued some very interesting advertising matter' which was distributed tralia. through the High Commissioner's office in London, telling the people of Europe what an admirable place Australia was suitable immigrants. to come to. These invitations were open and free, not to the people cf any parof ticular country, but to the people of Europe, and they were couched in most tralia. attractive language, depicting the alluring conditions under which people could live in Australia, At that time, were told that it was essential to get population here, but that, at the same time, an Immigration Act was necessary to prevent certain undesirables from ing to this country. No one complained about that; but how are we going to issue any similar invitations in the future the fact of the provision'in the Bill the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton) seeks to have omitted? When an intending immigrant in the British Isles is asked to fill up his papers, he be asked questions as to his age, his birthment. place, his trade or calling, and, in tion, he will be asked, "" Are you an anarchist? Have you advocated overthrow by force or violence of any established government ?"" There are i Great Britai n today many men who are of the most revolutionary type. Revoluthe tion broad, open, and distinct is preached in the streets of the cities of the Old Country.  and preach it . We do not want them here.",71
309,Mr FINLAYSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"Is the honourable member so superior to the people of the Mother Country that he is not content take what Great Britai n has thrived on, free and open-air discussion on any t i o n ; but would rather cut off a. man's [452] head, and silence him in the good old Eastern method of autocratic government? In their attempts to exhibit their and patriotism, and the wonderf u l development of British institutions in honourable members are overreaching themselves, and the Mother A few ago, they were drawing most in to vidious distinctions about the loyalty of the people of Australia, because they di d my not follow the example of the Mother Country by accepting conscription, and n - 'now when it suits their book, they are the other way, and saying that Comthe people of the Mother Country are not worthy of being immigrants to Aus kind.

310,Mr FINLAYSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,The r e is no class the community in Great B r it a in who are not desirable as immigrants to Aus,71
311,Mr FINLAYSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"It was the'class we who were previously considered in the same category as those to whom the honourable member is now referring, who decomveloped Australia. It was the men who were considered revolutionists, the scum of Europe, the useless characters, who in were deported, and who made this counwhich try what it is today. We say that Aus. tralia requires population, but before people can get a chance to enter the country they must disavow any leanings towill wards a change in the system of governI t is a fact that, not only in addiBritish communities, but throughout the world, there is a recognition that the prethe sent form of government is nearing its end; that it has almost entirely outlived n its usefulness. A change in the system of government is coming. I believe that British people have the best system of government that the world knows today, but I am not prepared to say that it is the . . best that can be devised. But before we allow anybody to come into Australia, he or she must be certified to be not in favour of a change of government by force or violence. Of course, the decision as to whether a person is an advocate of such methods rests with an officer of the Government. Suppose that some indivito dual in the Old Country, who is a pronounced revolutionist, and believes in a quesrepublican form of government-ther e are millions of such men who openly proclaimed their doctrines during the warwishes to emigrate to Australia, and knows of this provision in our legislation, do honourable members think that he will deliberately sign himself as being a republican or a revolutionist? It is not at all likely. It means, therefore, that our immigration in future can only be drawn from one small section of people in Great Britain, and that section has not yet supplied us with population, in great numbers to fill up our empty spaces.",71
312,Mr JOWETT,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"Does the honourable member suggest that the majority of people in Great Britain are anarchists? Mr FINLAYSON"" - No ; I say the majority of emigrants from Great Britain are not of the class that can be described as very loyal to the established forms of government. The bulk of the emigrants in the past have been of the class who, today, in Great .Britain, are republicans and revolutionists. What I have said of Great Britain in that Tespect applies with much greater force to the other countries of Europe. It is a well-known fact that Spain, Portugal, Italy, and France are seething with revolution and discontent. Spain today is the hot-bed of revolution, and I have no hesitation in saying that the Government of that country could be revolutionized with advantage. Italy is seething with revolution. Portugal is continually having upheavals of the same character. France is a declared republic. The people of those countries can come to Australia without hindrance, as compared with the embargo placed upon Germans, Austro-Germans, and Bulgarians, who are notoriously in favour of monarchical rule. But how can we say to people of Spain, Portugal, and Italy that they may enter Australia so long as they are not anarchists, when we know that the majority of the inhabitants of those countries are anarchists by conviction, and are only kept in restraint by the fact that the wealthy and militarist classes retain control of the reins of Government? What a disparagement this law will be to Australia. Before a man may enter our country he must declare himself to be in favour of a certain form of government, which can only mean the form favoured by the. Minister administering the Act for the time being. It will be only another step to compel an immigrant to declare his religious beliefs. Wo are narrowing down our immigrants to such a small and useless class that the Bill will defeat the purposes at which it professes to aim.",72
313,Mr JOWETT,DEPORTATION OF KARL,Does not the honourable member think that it is better to have British immigrants?,72
314,Mr FINLAYSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"There is only one .better class of immigrant, and that is the home-made one, who comes vid the cradle. The next best is the Britisher; after him any European is all right.",72
315,Mr JOWETT,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"This Bill will not ex-, elude a Britisher.",72
316,Mr FINLAYSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,It will exclude any Britisher who is honest enough to declare his political beliefs.,72
317,Mr TUDOR,DEPORTATION OF KARL,It would have excluded Sir Joseph Cook when he was a Republican.,72
318,Mr FINLAYSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"It would have excluded the present Prime Minister (Mr. Hushes), than whom nobody has been more notoriously opposed to established forms of government.",72
319,Mr JOWETT,DEPORTATION OF KARL,He has not advocated a change by force or violence.,72
320,Mr FINLAYSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"Thos e qualifications and discriminations are at the discretion of the Minister or his officers. As a matter of fact, the man who is in charge of emigration at the London end determines whether or not a person is qualified to be an emigrant to Australia.",72
321,Mr GLYNN,DEPORTATION OF KARL,In reference to this particular .amendment the opinion of the officer is not at all conclusive.,72
322,Mr TUDOR,DEPORTATION OF KARL,The Customs officer at this end will decide.,72
323,Mr GLYNN,DEPORTATION OF KARL,If a man thinks he does not come within the meaning of this clause he can a'ppeal to the High Court against the decision of the Department.,72
324,Mr FINLAYSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,That is after he gets here. But before he can be accepted and get a passage to Australia he must satisfy the officer in England that he is an acceptable emigrant. We have an officer at Home whose duty it is to determine whether or not a person is qualified to be an emigrant to Australia.,72
325,Mr FOWLER,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"He must have an evil reputation before ,the officer can prevent him coming.",72
326,Mr FINLAYSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"Yes , and that means an inquisitorial investigation into the antecedents, private and public, of any person who wishes to come to Australia.",72

332,Mr FINLAYSON,DEPORTATION OF KARL,"They must pass an immigation officer at this end, hut, whereas his investigation .of them is a formality, in the case of the poorer i m migrant it becomes an inquisitorial in vestigation into the whole' of his antecedents. Are we to take up the attitude that only, one class, and only persons holding one political belief, will be acceptable ' to Australia? The overturning of governments is a matter of political opinion. I have no personal desire to overturn any established government by force or violence, and I have no reason for Buch a . course, because I am living in a country where, by constitutional means, we oan secure any form of government we desire. But if I were in Spain', Portugal/ It a l y , or Germany, where responsible government does not oxist, I should be a revolutionist. I should be prepared to overturn such Governments by force or violence, or by any other method, and for that reason I would not be an acceptable immigrant to Australia. The Bill will go further than the Government wish it to, and the trouble will be that, although wo ho,pe that good sense will, prevail in the administration, the door will be open for the operation of this law for political purposes. This sort of legislation is a bad advertisement for Australia'. It will mean that neither in our own British communities nor in any other country will there be a good word for Australia, since every foolish objection that could possibly be urged against people coming to this count r y .to-help it to advance is raised in this Bill. .
