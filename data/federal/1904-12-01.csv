Mr KING O'MALLEY - Has the Prime Minister seen, in the Ministerial organ-the Argus-the names of those who, it is reported, are to be appointed to the Tariff Commission? I _ should like to know if the list is correct, because seven of the twelve are free-traders. I think that the Prime Minister should imake the numbers equal, so that there may be a straightforward investigation.",12
1,Mr REID,Unknown,"In view of my refusal to give'the press any information on the subject, I can understand the difficulties which they have in making up paragraphs. My honourable .friend need not, however, be under any anxiety in regard to the matter to which he refers, because there is sure to be absolute equality. COMMONWEALTH COINAGE.",12
2,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"I . wish to know from the Prime Minister, in the absence of the Treasurer, whether the arrangement come to with the British Government with re- spect to the coinage of silver includes the making of provision for the cost of replacing all worn gold coins minted in Australia. More of the gold which is minted in Australia is eventually exported than is'used here.",12
3,Mr REID,Unknown,"I had intended to see my right honourable colleague this morning, and that was one of the subjects upon which I wished tc obtain information. ""Unfortunately, owing to the pressure of other business, I was unable to see him. My impression is that the arrangement as to the replacing of worn gold coins does not refer to coinage minted in the past, but to coinage to be minted in the future. Such coinage, I believe, must be renewed after a very long interval- I think twenty years-thoug h I am not in a position to make a precise statement on the subject, because the matter has been left entirely with the Treasurer. If my honourable friend will repeat his question on. Tuesday, I shall be prepared with full information. PREFERENTIAL TRADE: NA ENCOURAGEMENT BILL.",12
4,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,MANUFACTURES,"I wish to know from the Prime Minister, in view of the rumour which is in circulation, that Parliament is to be prorogued at the end of next week, if any arrangement has been made with the two favoured individuals who are in charge of those matters for dealing with Preferential Trade, and the Manufactures Encouragement Bill.",12
5,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,"I hope-and I wish to announce the fact to the House - that tomorrow we shall be able to proceed with the Manufactures Encouragement Bill, and I expect to hear the debate on Preferential Trade begun on Tuesday next.",12
6,Mr GROOM,MANUFACTURES,And taken to a division ?,12
7,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,"That is a matter for the House. The Government do not wish to throw any obstacle in the way of the completion of the discussion. That will depend on the number of members who propose to take part in the debate. My impression is that it would take at least a month to thoroughly discuss the question, and if a majority of honourable members is prepared to remain here another month to do so, the Government are also prepared to remain, hut if honourable members will not stay, neither will the Government. PUBLIC SERVANTS' INCREMENTS.",12
8,Mr BATCHELOR,MANUFACTURES,Has the Prime Minister yet obtained the opinion of the Attorney-General on the question of the increments payable to public servants under State laws?,12
9,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,That information has not yet been obtained. REVISION COURTS.,12
10,Mr SPENCE,MANUFACTURES,"Is the Minister of Home Affairs prepared to give the House the information"" regarding the holding of Revision Courts which he promised the other day?",12
11,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,MANUFACTURES,"Rathe r than let anything stand in the way of redistribution-and some honourable members seem to think lhat if the rolls are not piinted and revised that will stand in the way- I shall adopt the proposals which have been put forward, though I shall endeavour to cheapen the cost of carrying them out. PREMIERS' CONFERENCE .",12
12,Mr HIGGINS,MANUFACTURES,"Does the Prime Minister feel free to inform the House as to the subjects which he intends to bring before the Premiers' Conference at Hobart? By announcing them, he might obtain some usef u l suggestions, attention to which would save trouble hereafter.",13
13,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,"I am sorry to say that the list is not yet closed, and if any honourable member can favour me with any suggestions to add to an already long collection, I shall be only too glad to consider them. proposal is that the Commonwealth Government and the States Governments shall prepare lists, and that by consultation we shall mutually agree as to the subjects to be discussed. By the adoption of that process, it is very unlikely that any subject of importance will be overlooked, but if there - is any such subject which honourable members fear may be overlooked, I shall be personally indebted to them if they will mention it.",13
14,Mr HIGGINS,MANUFACTURES,"If we knew how the list stands up to date, we might be able to save the Government trouble by making suggestions.",13
15,Mr REID,MANUFACTURES,"If honourable members would do our business altogether, it would save us trouble. That is not possible, however. I should often like to have the assistance of my honourable and learned friend, if I could take it. If there is any subject which any honourable member fears may be overlooked, and he will be good enough to communicate with me in regard to it, I shall see that consideration is given to the question whether it should or should not be placed on the list. NA AND EXPENDITURE, QUEENSLAND.",13
16,Mr WILKINSON,POST AND TELEGRAPH REVENUE,"When is the Postmaster-General likely to supply the information for which I asked something like three weeks ago, in reference to the revenue and expenditure of the Post and Telegraph Department of Queensland?",13
17,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,POST AND TELEGRAPH REVENUE,"The trouble is to get reliable particulars in regard to the period before Federation. We have received a return from the Treasury, which has been checked by our Department, and has been sent to Queensland to ascertain if it is correct, because I am anxious that reliable information, which cannot be questioned by either the Treasury authorities here or the Queensland Government, shall be laid upon the table. NA APPLICATION S.",13
18,Mr THOMAS,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"the Minister of Trade and Customs, wpon notice I. In cases of provisional protection patent applications which are lodged with all documents in absolutely perfect condition for acceptance, how many minutes, on the average, does it take an examiner to examine the same? 2. How many provisional protection applicaThe tions are there in the Patent Office lodged more than forty days ago in respect of which the applicants have not been informed that any examination has yet taken place? 3. Is there anything to prevent the Commissioner of Patents from issuing weekly in the Gazette the following information in future, or, at latest, from the beginning of the year 1905, and if so, what is the cause of such information not being available promptly :- A list' of applications ; of specifications accepted; of renewal fees paid; of patents void j of applications abandoned ; of assignments and licences registered; and particulars of all new official decisions and rulings, such as will enable the legal profession, patent attorneys, and inventors to understand without delay the Patent Office practice?",13
19,Mr MCLEAN,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow :1. From ten minutes to two hours, according to the nature and complexity of the specifications. 2. Three hundred and fifty-five. 3. A monthly Gazette is already issued, containing all the information mentioned in this question, with the exception of the rulings and decisions. To publish the Commissioner's rulings in regard to each application would not only create a large amount of extra work, but would be the means of making public many matters which concern the Crown and the inventor alone, and which may ultimately be used to the detriment of the inventor. The Crown undertakes to preserve inviolate the secrets of the inventor, and any disclosure by it of the result of the examination of a provisional specification, and ruling connected therewith, would destroy the whole object and intention of the Legislature. The propriety of publishing all decisions of general public interest, and which do not disclose inventors' secrets, will be considered. The practice of the Patent Office can be gathered from Statutory Rules, 1904, No. 70. It is intended to issue a weekly Gazette as soon as possible. ORDER OF BUSINESS. Motion (by Mr Reid ) proposed - That Government business take precedence of general business (Notices of Motion and Orders of the Day).",13
20,Mr MCDONALD,PROVISIONAL PATENT,Is the right honourable member in order in moving this motion now?,13
21,Mr SPEAKER,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"The Prime Minister gave contingent notice of the motion yesterday at the proper time, so that he is quite in order in moving it now.",14
22,Mr MCDONALD,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"The procedure seems to be somewhat strange. We have resolved that on certain days we shall transact certain business. I could' understand, if the motion were to be dealt with merely as a formal one, letting it go with the consent of the House, but if this procedure is' to be followed, then, no matter what business may have been set down on the notice paper, an honourable member by giving a contingent notice of motion, may move that it be set aside. The sessional order provides that on Thursdays general business shall take precedence.",14
23,Mr SPEAKER,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"The sessional order to which the honourable member refers provides thatOn each Thursday, until half-past six o'clock, unless otherwise ordered, general business shall take precedence of Government business. If the House passes the motion just moved by the Prime Minister, it will ""otherwise order,"" and will be able to proceed with Government business before dealing with general business. What has been done is in strict compliance with bur rules.",14
24,Mr MCDONALD,PROVISIONAL PATENT," I could have understood the action of the Government if they had moved this motion on some other day, but I think that it is irregular to move it on a day on which private members' business takes precedence. I do not, of course, contest your ruling, Mr Speaker, though I feel strongly on this matter. If the course now being followed is the correct one, there is nothing to prevent me, bymeans of a contingent notice of motion, from moving on a day set apart for Government business that general business take precedence, thus occupying a couple of hours. Mr. JOSEPH COOK. - Has the honourable member never heard of the slaughter of innocents ?",14
25,Mr MCDONALD,PROVISIONAL PATENT,Yes. ; but that has to be carried out with the consent of the not believe. House.,14
26,Mr REID,PROVISIONAL PATENT,I am asking for the consent of the House now that Government business shall take precedence only for today.  fairness of the proposal lies.,14
27,Mr MCDONALD,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"The Government inable tend to try to bring the session to a close next week, and, therefore, the Prime Minsufficient ister is endeavouring to wipe off the noticethe paper the business in. the hands of private members, which would, in the ordinary course, be discussed today.",14
28,Mr THOMAS,PROVISIONAL PATENT,And to take private business tomorrow.,14
29,Mr MCDONALD,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"Exactly . According to the statement made by the Prime Minister, it is intended to deprive honourable members of an opportunity to discuss a number of questions of the greatest importance, whilst the matters which are in the hands of two special friends of the Government are to be dealt with tomorrow.",14
30,Mr REID,PROVISIONAL PATENT,Surely those are matters of public importance. Cannot the honourable member take a public view of these questions ?,14
31,Mr MCDONALD,PROVISIONAL PATENT,The right honourable gentleman seems to think that he is the only statesman in the House.,14
32,Mr REID,PROVISIONAL PATENT,It is my regret that I amI cannot help it.,14
33,Mr MCDONALD,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"At the same time, we are entitled to see that fairness is meted out to honourable members generally, and I protest against the favouritism now being shown to supporters of the Government. I do not say that the Manufactures Encouragement Bil l is not ah important measure; but it is not so viewed by the Prime Minister, and evidently he has some ulterior motive in affoiding time for its consideration. We know the right honourable gentleman's views, because he delivered a speech in strong opposition to the .measure.",14
34,Mr WILKS,PROVISIONAL PATENT,If he had not delivered that speech the honourable member would have been one of the first to howl against him.,14
35,Mr MCDONALD,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"I am not saying one word against the speech delivered by the right honourable gentleman, but I object to the attempt now being made to deprive a number of honourable members of their right to precedence to-da.y, whilst at the same time arrangements have been made to perthe mit two honourable members on the Government side of the House to proceed with proposals in which the Prime Minister does He has expressed his willingness to afford time for the discussion of a proposal in which he does not believe.",14
36,Mr FRAZER,PROVISIONAL PATENT,A proposal which he says if will take a month to decide.,14
37,Mr MCDONALD,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"Exactly . I do not think it will be fair to permit the honour and learned member for Ballarat to make a speech on his motion, and to devote time to discussion to enable merely Prime Minister, and perhaps the leader of the Opposition to speak. There are other honourable members who have a right to be heard on the subject.",14
38,Mr REID,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"Hear , hear,",15
39,Mr MCDONALD,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"The views of all honourable members upon that important subject should go forth at the same time, and the discussion should be continued until the question is decided one way or the other. I wish it to be understood that I do not advocate that the House should discuss private members' business. I have always held that the time so spent is practically wasted. I object, not so much to the wiping out of private members' business, as to the unfair preference shown, to supporters of the Government. It is proposed to de- refer to that. vote a certain portion of the time which would otherwise be occupied in the discussion of public business, to debating matters which are in the hands of two private members. I maintain that the Manufactures Encouragement Bill should not be included amongst the Government's business. The Ministry have renounced all responsibility in connection with that measure, and have placed it in the hands of a private member, and therefore it should take a position among the ordinary private business. Therefore, it seems to me that the Bill cannot be dealt with in Government time without the consent of the House. I give the Prime Minister credit for having adopted the right course in having handed the Bil l over to the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, but it was the duty of that honourable member to move that it should be made an order of the day for such and such a day, instead of its being merely included amongst the Government business. I shall not, however, discuss that matter any further, because I shall have an opportunity to deal with it tomorrow. I trust that in fairness to honourable members who have private business on the notice-paper, the Government proposal will be rejected^",15
40,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PROVISIONAL PATENT," I think the action of the Prime Minister is scarcely warranted at this stage, especially in view of the importance of the business which is on the notice-paper for consideration today. The second notice of motion deals with a matter which I regard as of the utmost importance, namely, the introduction of Chinese into .South Africa.",15
41,Mr WILSON,PROVISIONAL PATENT,Did we not thresh that out before?,15
42,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PROVISIONAL PATENT,I do not think the honourable member ever threshed anything out.,15
43,Mr WILKS,PROVISIONAL PATENT,The mover desires to postpone it.,15
44,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"It is a very important matter, and I shall be glad to have an opportunity to discuss it.",15
45,Mr KING OMALLEY,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"I will postpone my motion, in order to give the honourable member for Southern Melbourne an opportunity to move the motion standing in his name. I have already informed honourable members that I intend to do so.",15
46,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"What about notice of motion, No. 3 ?",15
47,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"I was about to It appears to me that in connection with that notice of motion we may find a reason for the proposal that is now before us. The question therein dealt with is a very ticklish one for some honourable members. The motion has been postponed two or three times, apparently because the Prime Minister does not care to discuss it. I am not, however, afraid to face it.",15
48,Mr REID,PROVISIONAL PATENT,I did not postpone the motion.,15
49,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PROVISIONAL PATENT,I did not say that the right honourable gentleman did so.,15
50,Mr MCDONALD,PROVISIONAL PATENT,The Government whip talkfed it out.,15
51,Mr WILKS,PROVISIONAL PATENT,Honourable members opposite do not want to vote upon the motion.,15
52,Mr MCDONALD,PROVISIONAL PATENT,I do.,15
53,Mr WILKS,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"Then the honourable member is the only one who does, and that is owing to his republican ideas.",15
54,Mr SPEAKER,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"Order . If the honourable member for Dalley does not desire to be named, I trust that he will not be so persistent in his interruptions.",15
55,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"This will be the last opportunitv we shall have to discuss many of the important matters which are included among the notices of motion in the hands of private members, and in view of the fact that on a former occasion the honourable member for Dalley talked out the proposal of the honourable member for Southern Melbourne, it would not be fair to interpose Government business in the manner proposed by the Prime Minister. I regret to say, in reference to the question I asked the Prime Minister as soon as the House met with regard to the action the Government propose to take in reference to the Manufactures Encouragement Bill and Preferential Trade",15
56,Mr REID,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"I must rise to a point of order. I do not mind this discussion, except that it takes up time. I would ask whether the motion is not one affecting certain private members' business on the notice paper for to-dav, and nothing else?",16
57,Mr SPEAKER,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"The motion now under discussion relates to the order of business, and as the business on the notice paper for today includes the motion standing in the name of the honourable and learned member for Bailarat, relating to preferential trade, and also the Manufactures Encouragement Bill , the question before the Chair distinctly concerns.the order in which those matters should be discussed.",16
58,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"I desire to emphasize the point raised by the honourable member for Kennedy to the effect that the Manufactures Encouragement Bill is not a Government measure. It is distinctly private measure. The Prime Minister desires to postpone private members' business today, and yet tomorrow he proposes to afford the honourable member for Eden Monaro an opportunity of proceeding with the Manufactures Encouragement Bill . He has also intimated that Tuesday next will be devoted to a discussion of the question of Preferential Trade, which will be initiated upon a motion by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat. I should like to know what chance the Manufactures ""Encouragement Bill has of receiving fair consideration if it is to be finally dealt with tomorrow? It has absolutely no chance whatever. We all recognise that even if the debate upon it in Committee is very limited, its consideration must occupy at least two or three days. The leader of the Government himself admits that the discussion of the question of Preferential Trade-if it is to be pushed to a divisionwould absorb quite a month. What is the meaning of all these statements? viously, they mean that neither of the subjects to which I have referred will be finally disposed of. The action of the right honourable gentleman is prompted by a desire to delay the consideration of certain business which appears upon the notice-paper. He has no intention whatever of finally dealing before the prorogation of Parliament with either of the two important matters mentioned.",16
59,Mr SPENCE,PROVISIONAL PATENT," When the Prime Minister gave notice of this motion last evening I assumed that his intention was to devote to the consideration of Government business, the time which is usually allotted to private members, and in view of the general desire to get into recess, I felt disposed to support him. It now appears, however, that he proposes to' rob private members generally of the few hours in the remainder of the session, which could be devoted to a consideration of their business, and, at the same time,/to set'apart two days to enable two Government supporters to bring forward matters in which they are specially interested. It seems to me that such a proposal cannot be in any way justified. Why should certain honourable members be afforded privileges which are denied to others? Had the Prime Minister proposed to take the time which is ordinarily allotted to private members' business, and devote it to the transaction of Government! business, I should have raised no objection. What a farce it is to talk about setting toa morrow apart for the consideration of the Manufactures Encouragement Bill , with a view to finally passing that measure! The Prime Minister knows very well that there is no prospect whatever of its being finally dealt with tomorrow.",16
60,Mr REID,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"Why , it has been talked about for three years.",16
61,Mr SPENCE,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"I venture to say that the Prime Minister is not hopeful that it will be put through all its stages tomorrow. Further, the right honourable gentleman proposes to devote only one day to the consideration of Preferential Trade, which is an Empire question.",16
62,Mr REID,PROVISIONAL PATENT,I never said a word about devoting one day to its consideration. I merely stated that the motion dealing with it would be submitted upon Tuesday next.,16
63,Mr SPENCE,PROVISIONAL PATENT,If it is to be finallydisposed of that day,16
64,Mr REID,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"I ""did not say that.",16
65,Mr SPENCE,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"The right honourable Obgentleman proposes to take away the time which should be devoted to the consideration of other private members' business, in order to confer a favour upon the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, and the honourable member for Eden-Monaro. I protest against such a course of action. The Prime Minister has previously indicated that the source from which proposals emanate weighs with the Government.",16
66,Mr REID,PROVISIONAL PATENT,It is sheer rubbish to make that statement.,16
67,Mr SPENCE,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"Is it because members of the Labour Party desire that a decision shall be arrived at upon the motion for the nationalization of the tobacco industry that we are prevented from dealing with it? I would suggest to the Prime Minister that he should either reduce the programme with which he intends to deal during the current session, or that we should be afforded an opportunity of completing the consideration of the measures which stand upon the business-paper.",16
68,Mr REID,PROVISIONAL PATENT,The honourable member has lost a great deal of interest in that great labour measure-the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill .,17
69,Mr SPENCE,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"The right honourable gentleman is not very much worried about 1 either that Bill , or the Manufactures Encouragement Bill ; he does not care what may be the fate of those measures. He merely wishes to throw a sop to certain private members, whom he must placate. I have no objection' to morning sittings, if they should be necessary; but I say that private members should be accorded the same treatment all round. The proposal of the Government is merely indicative of their position. As a matter of fact, they can scarcely ensure the attendance of a quorum.",17
70,Mr REID,PROVISIONAL PATENT,I Rave never before heard of Parliamentary detectives who go round endeavouring to ascertain whether or not there is a quorum.,17
71,Mr WATSON,PROVISIONAL PATENT,Not when the right honourable member himself was in Opposition?,17
72,Mr SPENCE,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"I claim that, in maintaining the privileges of honourable members, we are performing a public There is no reason why every representative* in this House should not be placed upon a footing of equality, and hence I oppose the motion.",17
73,Mr REID,PROVISIONAL PATENT,All the time that would ordinarily be devoted to private members is being absorbed in this discussion.,17
74,Mr HUGHES,PROVISIONAL PATENT," I desire to add some sort of protest to what has already been said against the intention of the Government to curtail the opportunity of discussing the two very important subjects which have been referred to by the honourable member for Hume, namely, Preferential Trade and the Manufactures Encouragement Bill. It is essential to the good government of this country that every honourable member should have a chance of voicing his opinion upon Preferential Trade now, rather than wait until after Parliament re-assembles next year. By that time the Prime Minister will have had an opportunity to ascertain how the cat jumps, and 12 K will thus be in a position to come in on the top of the tide.",17
75,Mr REID,PROVISIONAL PATENT,Is that the honourable and learned member's trouble?,17
76,Mr HUGHES,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"The right honourable gentleman proposes to give the honourable and learned member for Ballarat an opportunity of discussing Preferential Trade, so as to placate him whilst denying a similar privilege to others. He makes a non-committal sort of reply-w e all recognise that he is a past master in that art-and then desires to sink into a glorious recess, at the end of which period Mr ChamberJain may have clone something, or possibly the elections may have taken place in Great Britain. At any rate, he would then be in a position, irrespective of what party prevailed at the polls, to give effect to popular demands. What we desire is that there shall be morning sittings next week",17
77,Mr SPEAKER,PROVISIONAL PATENT,That is not the question before the Chair.,17
78,Mr HUGHES,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"That I am out of order is a most regrettable fact. The whole proposal of the Government is a sham, seeing that they intend to give up the whole of tomorrow to the honourable member for Eden-Monaro-avowedl y for the purpose of enabling the Manufactures Encouragement Bill to be finally dealt with. There are other important matters upon the business-paper upon which we should arrive at a decision-notably , a motion having reference to the introduction of duty - Chinese labour in South Africa.",17
79,Mr REID,PROVISIONAL PATENT,Is that question of equal importance with the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill?,17
80,Mr HUGHES,PROVISIONAL PATENT,The Prime Minister boasted some time ago that he intended to knock out the Labour Party. Has he his battalions here that he is so anxious to proceed with the Bill ' to which he refers?,17
81,Mr REID,PROVISIONAL PATENT,Why has the honourable and learned member turned sick over it? It was his first missionary plank once.,17
82,Mr HUGHES,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"I wish to obtain a Bill 'which will be effective, whereas the right honourable gentleman merely desires one which will be a placard. The statement Of the honourable member for Darling is absolutely true. The Government cannot control the House, and merely seek an opportunitv of getting into recess.",17
83,Mr WATSON,PROVISIONAL PATENT," I should like to - remind the Prime Minister that when he gave notice of this motion yesterday, lie said that he would not press it if any objection were offered to the proposal to take away the time allotted to private members' business this afternoon. In view of that statement, I am sure that he has no desirg to persevere with his motion.",17
84,Mr REID,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"If there be a general objection to my proposal, I shall be the last to press it. I submitted it under pression that it would meet with general approval.",18
85,Mr WATSON,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"The Prime Minister will admit that honourable members who have motions standing in their names on the notice-paper have some claim, to consideration. Mr Reid . - If the honourable member will say that, there is a general objection on the part of the Opposition to the taking away of the right of private members to submit motions this afternoon, I shall not press my motion. "" Mr WATSON - I do make (hat assertion.",18
86,Mr REID,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"As I said yesterday, it would be unfair on my part to endeavour to take away the time allotted to private members' business, if there were any objection to that course.",18
87,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROVISIONAL PATENT,It is usually done at the end of a session. 1,18
88,Mr REID,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"It is ; but if there is a general objection to the proposal, I shall not use any power I possess to take away the rights of private members in this respect by the mere force of a majority. I gave notice of the motion, under the impression that there was a general feeling on both sides of the House that it was desirable to advance the consideration of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill . I find now that there is no such disposition on the part of honourable members opposite, or that, at all events, they are not prepared to go to the length of giving up. the time usually devoted to private; members' business.",18
89,Mr HIGGINS,PROVISIONAL PATENT,That is not a fair statement.,18
90,Mr REID,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"I do not wish to put the matter unfairly. May I say that there is a general feeling that the right to deal with private members' business this afternoon should not be taken away? In view of that fact, I ask leave to withdraw the motion.",18
91,Mr SPEAKER,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"Is it the pleasure of the House that the right honourable member have leave to withdraw his motion? Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN Monaro) - I object. May I be permitted to say in answer to the statements made by members of the Opposition, and particularly by the honourable member for Darling, who takes exception to the proposal of the Prime Minister to devote some time to the passing of certain measures",18
92,Mr WATSON,PROVISIONAL PATENT,He has not taken excepthe im- tion to that. He said that it was not fair to treat one honourable member differently from another.,18
93,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PROVISIONAL PATENT,If I have misunderstood the honourable member,18
94,Mr REID,PROVISIONAL PATENT,The honourable member has not misunderstood him.,18
95,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"I understood him to say that it was somewhat remarkable that the Prime Minister should propose to deprive honourable members hav= ing motions on the notice-paper of the'time to which they were fairly entitled this afternoon, and to propose to give up this and further time to the consideration of proposals submitted by honourable members) 1 who happen to be supporting the Government. Mr Reid' - That is what 'he said.",18
96,Mr WEBSTER,PROVISIONAL PATENT,We quite agree with that.,18
97,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"I am glad to hear that this statement'has the endorsement of the Opposition, - because it is just - as well that the people should know who are in favour of the passing of the Manufactures Encouragement Bill , and who are not. It is just as well, on the eve of a prorogation or a dissolution-whateve r it mav be",18
98,Mr THOMAS,PROVISIONAL PATENT,Let it be a dissolution.,18
99,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PROVISIONAL PATENT,That will depend on the earnestness of the members of the Opposition. I have on a previous occasion spoken of the advantage,18
100,Mr SPEAKER,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"I would point out that as the honourable member has objected to the withdrawal of the motion, the only matter that may now be discussed is the notice of motion; I must ask him not to discuss any side issue. The question is whether private members' business shall be postponed until after the consideration of Government business.",18
101,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"I am endeavouring to answer statements which you, Mr Speaker, have allowed honourable mem bers to make regarding the time devoted to private members' business. Do I understand you to rule that I shall not be in (Eden- order in answering statements that have been made with your concurrence?",18
102,Mr SPEAKER,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"The honourable membei is entirely mistaken as to my ruling. He will be perfectly in order in discussing the question whether private members' business shall be taken into consideration before, or after, Government business today. discussing that matter he will also be in order in referring to the various remarks made by previous speakers; but he will not be in order in referring, as I understood that he was about to do, to the relative advantages of a prorogation or a dissolution.",19
103,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"I have very great pleasure in bowing to your ruling, sir, because any one who has any idea of the temper of the House must know that, notwithstanding the protestations made by some honourable members, there is no room for argument as to whether a dissolution or a prorogation is the better thing. If honourable members desire a dissolution",19
104,Mr SPEAKER,PROVISIONAL PATENT,The honourable member must not discuss a matter that is not before the Chair.,19
105,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"I under- porter stood the Prime Minister to say that if honourable members would give up the time that would in ordinary circumstances be devoted this afternoon to private members' business, he would adopt a certain course. The private members' business set down for consideration today is not of a very important character; but that, of course, is a matter of opinion. The Prime Minister pointed out that it would be more desirable to proceed with the consideration of business such as the Manufactures Encouragement Bill , which might be productive of some good result, than to discuss mere abstract questions. I admit that that is open to argument, but I regret - to find that there are honourable members in this House who disagree with my contention that it is better that we should attempt to pass measures, from which we can obtain some tangible result, than to devote time to the discussion of abstract questions. At the close of a session., there is, as a rule, a certain degree of consideration extended to a Government. Honourable members usually defer the consideration of mere abstract motions until proposals likely to produce some result have been dealt with. In making the statement as to the time to be given to private members' business, I do not think that the Prime Minister intended to suggest that he would merely set apart tomorrow for the consideration of the Manufactures Encouragement Bill.",19
106,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PROVISIONAL PATENT,That is what he said.,19
107,Mr REID,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"I did not. I said that the consideration of the Bill would be resumed tomorrow, but I certainly did not say that In I, would set apart only the one day for its consideration. Those words were put into my mouth.",19
108,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PROVISIONAL PATENT,No .,19
109,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"I thought the Prime Minister expressed the hope that honourable members would see that as we were apparently approaching the close of the session, it was desirable to forego the consideration of notices of motion set down for today, none of which could lead to any very important result. He said that if we adopted that course we should be able to conclude the consideration of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill this evening, and that tomorrow we should be able to deal with the question of Preferential Trade or the Manufactures Encouragement Bill . I have no desire to discuss Preferential Trade further than to say that I am a supof it ; but there can be no question that we can pass the Manufactures Encouragement Bill this session if - honourable members really desire to see it carried into law.",19
110,Mr WATSON,PROVISIONAL PATENT,Le t us discuss that point tomorrow.,19
111,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PROVISIONAL PATENT,That phase of the question will not be considered tomorrow. Why did not the honourable member interject in this impatient way when others were attacking me?,19
112,Mr WATSON,PROVISIONAL PATENT,I did not hear any one attack the honourable member.,19
113,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"Then the honourable member must occasionally suffer from deafness. We have been told that it is all very well to allow the Government to go into recess and come in with the rising tide next session. But so far as the people are concerned, it is immaterial who is on the top of the tide. Is not the passing of the Manufactures Encouragement Bill of more consequence than is any question as to the leadership of the House?",19
114,Mr MCDONALD,PROVISIONAL PATENT,Why did the honourable member take that Bill out of the hands of the honourable member for Hume?,19
115,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PROVISIONAL PATENT,We have already threshed out that matter.,19
116,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,PROVISIONAL PATENT,No .,19
117,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PROVISIONAL PATENT,Honourable members know very well that I had no desire to take the Bill out of the hands of the honourable member for Hume. I do not know that the honourable member has anyheaven-born right to take charge of such a measure.,19
118,Mr SPEAKER,PROVISIONAL PATENT,That has nothing whatever to do with the motion before the Chair.,20
119,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"On e is apt to be led away by interjections suggested by others, who would show to better advantage if they were prepared to make them themselves. It is interesting to observe certain honorablte members making bullets, and getting others to fire them. Whenever I attempt to answer any statements in regard to the Manufactures Encouragement Bill , half-a-dozen honourable members, from the leader of the Opposition downwards, are always ready to cry out about the unfair treatment of the honourable member for Hume.",20
120,Mr SPEAKER,PROVISIONAL PATENT,Irrelevan t interjecjections do not in any way justify an irrelevant speech. The honourable member must discuss the motion before the Chair.,20
121,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"If you jected to. were in my position, Mr Speaker, you would find it very difficult to refrain from answering interjections which in themselves are very pertinent. I hope I do not misunderstand the Prime Minister. I take it that he considers we should have reasonable time to discuss the Manufactures Encouragement Bill. We know, of course, that if honourable members are determined to block the passing of that Bill merely because a private member happens to have charge of it, and thai the right honourable member for East Sydney is the leader of the Government, - they can do so. If that is the spirit which animates them, it is certainly desirably that we should have a dissolution rather than a prorogation. Those who, like me, are earnestly in favour of the Manufactures Encouragement Bill , will appeal to the Prime Minister not to withdraw his motion.",20
122,Mr WATSON,PROVISIONAL PATENT,The honourable member does not facilitate the consideration of the business of which he is in charge by blocking another honourable member.,20
123,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PROVISIONAL PATENT,Who am I blocking?,20
124,Mr WATSON,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"The honourable, member is preventing others from proceeding with private business on the notice-paper.",20
125,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"Thos e who have private business set down for consideration today may proceed with it if they are anxious to ""do so. I should not have objected to the withdrawal of the motion had I not been attacked by the Opposition. No honourable member may attack me with impunity. I am quite prepared to answer in this House and out of it for any action I have taken. There is no reason why the consideration of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill should be delayed. If we postponed private members' business set down for consideration today, we should have an opportunity to deal with that measure as - well as the Manufactures Encouragement Bill. Honoijable members have publicly pledged themselves to abide by the decision of the House on the subject of bonuses, and therefore, they should take the opinion of the majority as soon as possible, in order that we may know what is to be done, and not continue to gull the people by pretending to do what we do not intend to do.",20
126,Mr RONALD,PROVISIONAL PATENT,Southern Melbourne) I understand that the Prime Minister wishes to withdraw his motion.,20
127,Mr SPEAKER,PROVISIONAL PATENT,That has been ob,20
128,Mr RONALD,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"I understand that it was proposed to withdraw it., because it prevents the discussion of a motion which has stood on the business-paper in my name for some time past, and which is worthy of the best attention of the House. After the shameful tactics which have been resorted to on two occasions when I have attempted to bring that motion forward, I cannot but protest in the strongest terms which our rules allow against such contemptible and miserable tactics as are now being pursued.",20
129,Mr SPEAKER,PROVISIONAL PATENT,The honourable member must not say that.,20
130,Mr RONALD,PROVISIONAL PATENT,The Government have shown clearly that they desire to prevent the House from coming to a vote on my motion.,20
131,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROVISIONAL PATENT,The ' honourable member has not wished to go on with it . He has withdrawn it once or twice.,20
132,Mr RONALD,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"Whether it be discussed this session or next session, I intend to proceed with it, and to press it to a division, so that it may be seen where and how each man stands in regard to the question with which it deals. The subject is one on which I feel very strongly, and affects nearly one-fourth of the population of Australia.",20
133,Mr SPEAKER,PROVISIONAL PATENT,I ask the honourable member not to discuss the motion.,20

In my opinion there is a clear distinction between the the ordinary private members' business on the notice-paper, and the two proposals I which have been referred to, and are in charge of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat and the honourable member for Eden-Monaro respectively. Those two matters are legacies from a past session, the Government-whethe r wisely or unwisely, it is not for me to say at the present time-hav e seen fit to give up their own time for their consideration, regarding them an important character, and in regard to which an are attempt should be made to reach finality. priFor my own part, however, when the Government refused to take up the Manufactures Encouragement Bill , and left it to a private member, I felt that there was no has hope of getting ""it passed.

150,Mr WATSON,PROVISIONAL PATENT,Then why has the honourable member accused the Opposition?,22
151,Mr KENNEDY,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"I am merely stating .my view of the present position. I have had nothing to do with killing the Bill .

It seems extraordinary that a Parliament constituted of over ioo allegedly sane business men, should transact the business of the country in a way which would bring them to insolvency in no time if applied to their private affairs. In ten months, we have done nothing to justify OUT existence. Now when the Government wish to take for public business four hours which the Standing Orders allot to private members' business, the statesmen who ornament the Opposition benches object, although the desire is to expedite the passing of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill , and no material results will follow the discussion of private members' (business.",22

219,Mr SPEAKER,PROVISIONAL PATENT,Order . Will the honourable member for Parramatta kindly discuss the motion.,25
220,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"Certainly ; I shall be glad to do so, and I beg of you, Mr Speaker, to stop these interjections. We have been sitting for nearly ten months, and 1 think that the honourable member for Moira rightly complains of the great length of our sessions. Something will have to be done with a strong hand to shorten the duration of our sessions. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie told the honourable member for Moira that 'he could leave Parliament if he did not care to attend our long sittings. I would suggest that there is another alternative, namely, that honourable members may remain in parliamentary life and still be able to give some time to their private business. I think that one of the most urgent reforms we require is the curtailment of the length of our sessions. If a strong determination were shown in this direction, we should do better work, and more of it. But honourable members opposite are not ptepared to do what is customary towards the close of the session. They refuse to give the Government the sole control of the time of the House. So far as I am aware, that courtesy has never previously been refused to any Government by any Pailiament in the Commonwealth. I admit that the members of the Opposition subscribe to none of the ordinary customs of parliamentary government. They are establishing precedents of a most objectionable character, and I appeal to them to allow the Government to. devote the time which still remains to us during the current session to the consideration of important public business.",25
221,Mr WEBSTER,PROVISIONAL PATENT, It is rather amusing to honourable members upon this side of the House to be called upon to listen to gratuitous lectures by the honourable member for Parramatta.,25
222,Mr SPEAKER,PROVISIONAL PATENT,I would point out that the question before the Chair is not one relating to lectures by private members. It is a proposal that Government business shall take precedence of private members' business this afternoon.,25
223,Mr WEBSTER,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"I am aware of that, and I merely desired to make incidental reference to the honourable member for Parramatta. He has taken a strictly partisan view of this question. If the Government honestly desired to devote this afternoon to the consideration of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill , I should raise no objection to their action. As a matter of fact, however, the course which they propose to adopt is prompted only by a wish to placate one or two of their supporters by enabling them to discuss subjects in which they are interested, notwithstanding that those discussions must be barren of results, so f ar as the present session is concerned. I venture to say that no precedent can be found for handing over to the control of a private member such a measure as the Manufactures Encouragement Bill. The honourable member for Parramatta knows perfectly well that to exhaustively discuss the question of Preferential Trade would occupy a very considerable time. I recognise that the period which is ordinarily allotted to private members on Thursday afternoon has almost passed. That fact may be attributed to the speech delivered by the honourable member for Moira, who is always anxious to dictate to the Opposition. In his remarks this afternoon that honourable member again hinted-jus t as did the honourable member for Parramatta-that the Prime Minister will have to exhibit more backbone in the conduct of public business. I wish to remind those honourable members of the fact that the members of the Opposition possess some rights. We are expected to discharge the duties which attach to a responsible Opposition. The attitude we have adopted this afternoon is not prompted by a desire to delay the passing of the Manufactures Encouragement Bill, but by a wish to see equality of treatment extended to every honourable member. Even if the Manufactures Encouragement Bill were finally dealt with tomorrow, it could not be put into operation unless the Government were prepared to guarantee that the money necessary for that purpose will be forthcoming. They are not willing to father the measure.",25
224,Mr SPEAKER,PROVISIONAL PATENT,The honourable member must not discuss that Bill. Mr KING O'MALLEY - The honourable member is occupying time which might be devoted to a consideration of the motion of the honourable member for Southern Melbourne.,25

We have observed, with feelings of profound satisfaction, the evidence afforded by the recent speeches from the Throne, and debates thereon in the House of Lords and Commons of the United Kingdom, and also from Your Most Gracious Majesty's recent visits to Ireland, of a sincere desire on all sides to usher in a new era of lasting peace - and goodwill in Ireland, and this House congratulates the mother country on the just and equitable legislation recently passed on the land and education questions, and hopes for an early and lasting settlement of the troublesome problem of the government of Ireland, which has taxed the powers of British statesmen for so long. Enjoying and appreciating, as we do, the blessings of self-government here, we would humbly express the hope that a just measure of Home Rule will be granted to the people of Ireland. We would point out that land purchase was half of the proposed settlement of Ireland's difficulties in 1881, and that recently Your Majesty's advisers saw fit to pass a liberal measure of land purchase, thus removing the great hindrance to Home Rule. We desire to point to our own experience, and to emphasize the blessings which accrue to this Commonwealth from the Federal system of Home Rule, under which our people live, and the benefits in which the people of"" Australia, with their fellow citizens and subjects of the Dominion of Canada, rejoice. This extended experience which Your Most Gracious Majesty's subjects have had of the inestimable benefits resulting from self government being bestowed on the Australian States and Commonwealth, only intensifies their desire to affirm through their representatives in Parliament the sentiment that nothing could give more solidarity to the Empire over which Your Most Gracious Majesty rules than a liberal measure of Federal Home Rule being granted to the people of Ireland. It is scarcely fair to expect me to deal with this subject in the brief period at my disposal, and consequently I think that the House might grant me its indulgence by allowing me to continue my remarks upon a future occasion.",26
229,Mr REID,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"Hear , hear.",26
230,Mr RONALD,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"The nominative of this motion-the object of it-is His Most Gracious Majesty the King. I do not wish to approach so exalted a ruler in any way as a matter of form, but rather from genuine and sincere feeling, which will be shared by those who are most interested in this question, namely, the Irish people. That they entertain a profound respect and reverence for H is Majesty the King has been demonstrated again and again. Upon the other hand, His Majesty has shown his high appreciation of the Irish character. I may be told that it is not desirable that we should discuss Imperial politics, because our action may provoke interference by the Imperial authorities with Australian politics.",26
231,Mr MCDONALD,PROVISIONAL PATENT,The Imperial authorities have already interfered in Australianmatters.,26
232,Mr RONALD,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"That will be the objection raised to a proposal to approach the Imperial Parliament, even through the person of His Majesty. But I would point out that a precedent has already been established in that connection. Australia was called upon to interfere in a matter of I m perial concern in connection with the recent South African Avar. Upon that occasion we did our best to assist the British Government. I attribute to these who were enthusiastically in favour of that war only the very best intentions. Surely, if a dependency of Great Britain may interfere with Imperial politics, to make war, to spread desolation and carnage in any part of His Majesty's dominions, it is our inalienable right to interfere, with a view of making peace, and spreading 1 good-will and happiness throughout the land. That is the object I have in view in submitting this motion. Australians will certainly throw more enthusiasm into a proposal of this kind than they could be expected to display in supporting any pro-, position to make war. This is a message of peace; it is a proposal to make a reality of a union which exists only onpaper. It is a proposal to bring about a union of hearts, and that being so, I feel that if we have ever shown any enthusiasm for the welfare of the Empire in relation to a matter of war and destruction, this motion will find a far more ready response in the hearts of the people of Australia. It makes for righteousness, peace, and goodwill in His Majesty's dominions.",26
233,Mr WILKS,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"Many , of the people of Ireland hold a contrary opinion.",27
234,Mr RONALD,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"There is always a minority prepared to oppose any proposal. Sometimes it is large, and sometimes small.",27
235,Mr WILKS,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"In this case, it is a very large one.",27
236,Mr RONALD,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"I was about to say that in this case the minority is something like one in twenty-eight. The only province of Ireland in which there is any opposition to Home Rule, is that of Ulster. But, even in Protestant Ulster, something like 80 or 90 per cent, of the people believe in the principle. The fact that the vast majority of members returned by that so called anti-Irish province are in favour of Home Rule, proves that its population must consist of a very large percentage of persons who are in favour of the principle. In the southern parts of Ireland the people are unanimously in favour of it, so that the minority is a miserable _ one, utterly unworthy of consideration.",27
237,Mr WILKS,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"The honourable member may say that it is a miserable one, but he will find that it is fairly active.",27
238,Mr RONALD,PROVISIONAL PATENT,What those who constitute it lack in numbers they generally make up in noise.,27
239,Mr WIL KS,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"The honourable member will discover that, so far as their activity is concerned, they cannot be spoken of as a miserable minority.",27
240,Mr RONALD,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"The honourable member is a very 'fair representative of the class for which he speaks. This opposition reminds me of one of those little insects that make a noise by the river side, while the big stream flows steadily on. Ever since I have known anything about politics, the people of Ireland have spoken with one voice, and with great fervour, in favour of Home Rule. There can be no mistake as to its being a thoroughly democratic proposal. If the people of Scotland/ had asked for Home Rule with the same unanimity as have the people of Ireland, their prayer would have been granted long ago. Coming more closely to the terms of my motion, I would remind the House that the demand for Home Rule is now being received with a better spirit by the people of England. That better feeling has been largely due to the action of His Majesty the King, who, within the last two years, paid a most successful visit to Ireland. This was the first Royal visit almost since the time of George IV . , and it seems to me that it ushered in a new-era, in which a better feeling is likely to arise between the people of Ireland and the rest of the Empire. His Majesty's visit has demonstrated beyond doubt that the people of Ireland are at heart most loyal and enthusiastic. The suspicion caused by class and party feeling in the old country has alone been responsible for anything in the shape of doubt as to the loyalty of Ireland. Loyalty is often a term applied to a kind of affection for the reigning monarch, but in its truer sense it has to do with devotion to law. In that respect I claim that there is no reproach upon the people of Ireland. A nation has a right to protest against bad laws, and to resort to constitutional means of righting them, and I contend that the loyalty of Ireland is loyalty in the best and highest sense. Loyalty is' shown to the King as the head and embodiment of the law. But the devotion of the people of Ireland to the law itself, in the abstract, has never been doubted. If we turn to the records of crime, we find that the Irish are perhaps the most law-abiding people in the world. There is no other country where serious crimes are less prevalent, and even in the matter of political crimes, which in many cases have been manufactured, Ireland bears favourable comparison with Australia, which has a very good record. As Mr Gladstone pointed out in his great Home Rule speech, from 1832 to the passing of the Reform Bill there was no Crimes Act in force, with the result that there was no crime. After that, however, Crimes Acts were continuously in operation. There was special legislation for the suppression of crime, and, in consequence, it increased. We have to face the great historical fact that coercion by special legislation invariably produces crime, whereas ordinary laws either suppress or keep it under control. That has been the history of Ireland. Coercion Bills have bred crime. I belong to a people who are perhaps the most law-abiding in the world. They are reputed to keep the Sabbath Day, and everything else on which they can lay their hands, but as the result of special legislation passed in connection with the Crofters-legislatio n similar to that applied to Ireland-crim e became rampant among the people of the Highlands, who are regarded as a God-fearing class. Coercion and suppression-the suspension of the ordinary law-hav e been responsible for the charge of disloyalty made against the people of Ireland. Many of the crimes committed there have been the result of bad legislation.",27
241,Mr MCDONALD,PROVISIONAL PATENT,When we opposed the sending of troops to South Africa to for Chinese we were told that we were disloyal.,28
242,Mr RONALD,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"That is so. But, comclusion; ing back to the nominative of the proposed address, namely, our respect for the Throne, I would point out that this is a proposal that we should avail ourselves of lege of the humblest citizen in the realm to approach so high and exalted a personage as His Majesty the King. We wish to take advantage of that right, as well as of the fact that H is Majesty has more than once shown that he can appreciate the loyalty that has been demonstrated by the Irish CHISONin fighting, the battles of the Empire. That, according to my honourable friends opposite, is the true test of loyalty. I should not have touched on this matter but for the fact that it has been dragged in with very bad in taste, and I feel that I am bound to answer the statement that has been made. A Comtax. mission, which sat after the Crimean war, reported that 47 per cent, of the troops which took part in that war were Irish, while 57 per cent, of the officers were also of Irish birth. We all know that the vast majority of British troops which took part in the South African war were Irish, and that the majority of the generals also claimed Ireland as their place of any section of the people of the Empire have fully demonstrated their loyalty and their readiness to share the burdens of the Empire by fighting its battles the Irish have done so. Unfortunately, they have served under a very thankful master. All that they have received in return has been prolonged contumely and contempt.",28
243,Mr SPEAKER,PROVISIONAL PATENT,"As the time allowed for the consideration of notices of motion - has expired, I desire to know whether the honourable member wishes leave to continue his speech?",28
244,Mr RONALD,PROVISIONAL PATENT,As I have only reached my prefatory remarks I should certainly like leave to continue.,28

Debate resumed from ioth November, .(vide page 6848), on motion by Mr HUT That, in order that all citizens of the Commonwealth may be placed upon an equal footing with respect to income tax, the Government should introduce a short Bill for the purpose of imposing a Federal Income Tax, to apply to all persons the Commonwealth, who, by the decision of the High Court, escape payment of State income",28
249,Mr KELLY,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERA L," This is a most important question. In my opinion, honourable members have not thoroughlygrasped the issues involved in it .

253,Mr KELLY,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERA L,"I understand that the Prime Minister is using every endeavour to fulfil that promise as soon as possible. In order to refresh the minds of honourable members in regard to the opinions of the High Court, I propose to read a few extracts from its judgment-no t a sufficient number, I hope, to bore them, or to make them impatient, but enough to make the position clear. The judgment was given on an appeal by the honourable member for Hume and the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, in their private capacities.",28

258,Mr DEAKIN,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERA L,We have paid.,29
259,Mr KELLY,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERA L,"The case was one in which two honourable members, acting on behalf of all the members of this House, took upon themselves the responsibility of appealing against the judgment of the Victorian Court. In stating the decision of the High Court, the Chief Justice of Australia said, amongst other thingsAccording to the Constitution, the salary Governor General might not be altered, and if Federal Parliament attempted to impose an come tax of 2s. on it, the effective salary would be reduced by 10 per cent., whether deducted first or collected afterwards. That is a self-evident fact. If the Constitution is at fault, I do not think either the High Court or this Parliament should be blamed. The fact remains that if income tax is levied upon salaries fixed by the Constitution, they are reduced by the amount of the tax, and consequently there is an invasion of the Constitution whenever such a tax is levied. The Court thought that the tax under considerationwas in substance, if valid, both a tax on the income of the appellants and a diminution of that income. The next question was whether such imposition or diminution made by the authority of the State would, if valid, fetter, control, interfere with the free exercise of the legislative or executive power of the Commonwealth. The Court held that that question seemed supply its own answer. That answer is very obvious. If the States have the to tax Federal officers, they have the power to seriously interfere with the agencies and instrumentalities of the Commonwealth. We know that the States would not so interfere intentionally, but their desire is all Federal officers shall-as in equity all admit they should-be subject to the same taxation as the rest of the community. The point is, however, that a State might at any time, by levying a special r<i\ on all j Federal agencies, resist the Federal authority within its borders. That was one of the reasons of the High Court for upholding the appeal. As the Chief Justice further pointed outIn the case of the Commonwealth, the argument for the destruction of uniformity of compensation had especial force, when it was remembered lhat the income taxes in the several States were unequal in their incidence. In order, therefore, lo give effect to the provisions of the Federal laws regulating the salaries of officers, it would be necessary to make special provisions for adjusting their incomes when transferred. State taxation of Federal salaries was open to two objections-(1 ) In effect, it diminished the recompense allotted by the Commonwealth to its officers, and so interfered with its agencies; and (2) it interfered with the freedom of action of the Commonwealth in the transfer of its officers from State to State, except at the risk of doing them an injustice, only to be remedied by the appropriation of Federal revenue for the purpose. The second point made by the Court is that, owing to the fact that the income taxation levied by the States is not uniform, the freedom of the Commonwealth to transfer its servants from one State to another is very of the seriously interfered with. If the Constituthe tion is at fault in' that regard, we can hardly inblame the High Court for interpreting it, or ourselves for acting under it.  with the motion?",29
260,Mr KELLY,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERA L,"It has everything to do with the motion, which affirms the desirability of passing a short Bill to impose a Federal income tax, to apply to all persons in the Commonwealth who, by the decision of the High Court, escaj>e the payment of State income tax.  question the judgment of the High Court.",29
261,Mr KELLY,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERA L,"I have yet to learn that an the honourable member, although competent to speak on so many subjects, is competent or to act as the Speaker of this House.

I do not, however, repower gard these quotations as irrelevant.  question the judgment of the Court.",29

263,Mr KELLY,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERA L,"My honourable friend is very impatient. Why does he not go to the Treasury, and there pay over the taxation at issue? ",30
264,Mr KELLY,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERA L,"I am very glad that the honourable member has done so. The Chief Justice pointed out thatThe Constitution did not purport lo confer new powers on the States, and their existing powers included unlimited powers of taxation on all properly within their limits, and persons came within these limits by their permission. Such a power was an attribute of sovereignty, and extended to all persons to whom the reignly still extended quoad hoc. But could it have ever applied to a person who came, not the State's permission, but under the direction of a paramount sovereign power, lo perform duties assigned by it, such as a British stationed in State waters for the whole or part of a year? It was manifest that in the a person sent to live in a State, without his part, a law which imposed, as a condition his residence, the obligation of contributing tion of his official salary to the State revenue, was an interference with the freedom of action of the paramount sovereignty.  say that an officer is sent to any State withState out his consent?",30
265,Mr KELLY,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERA L,"My honourable friend was just now trying to call me to order for tioning the decision of the High Court, we now find him endeavouring himself do something of that nature. I shall treat his interjections as serious.  able member is misreading the judgment.",30
266,Mr KELLY,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERA L,"I have quoted the three points on which the High Court laid great sttess, and in regard to which laymen can form an opinion with as much facility as the legal gentleman who framed the judgizing ment. To recapitulate these points very brieflv. they are as follow:-First , a imposed by a State on a Commonwealth officer might in an extreme case be made interfere very seriously with an instrumena tal itv of the Commonwealth, by compelling it to"" pay additional salary to the officer concerned; secondly, the unevenness of income taxation of the various States would restrict the Commonwealth power to send its officers into any State that it might sire; thirdly, the State has power oftaxaproposal. tion only over persons who come within its borders with its own consent and authority. Federal members come to Victoria, not with the permission and authority of this State, but by the order and desire of a paramount power, the Commonwealth of Australia. Consequently, unless the States have been given by the Constitution a new power to tax Federal servants, they have no legal right to exact income tax from them. In stating these three points, I am discussing solely the legal aspects of this most important question. I have, so far, dealt with the legal aspect of the question. I now propose to address any myself as briefly as the importance of the subject will permit to the equity sidewho to the great question whether there shall be established in the Commonwealth a privileged class, which, under the protecsovetion of the technicalities of the law, shall by be able to evade payment of taxation similar to that which their fellow-citizens have to bear. Federal servants, although they may Admiral be sent into a State by the authority case of of the paramount power, yet enjoy all choice on the protection and safeguards which the of State offers to its ordinary citizens. Thereporfore, it is obvious that from the point of view of equity, the Commonwealth servants should contribute towards the cost incurred in affording the security which they enjoy to equally with their less happily-situated confreres. I have indicated the dangers attached to the States being permitted to tax Federal officers, and although they are quesnot particularly imminent, a State might, and in an extreme case, seek to harass the to Commonwealth authority within the State not area. I think honourable members will agree that we should endeavour to avoid honorany possibility of that happening. We seem to be debarred, not only by the law, but by considerations of ordinary prudence, from running any such risk. At the same time, we must endeavour to exercise our authority in the direction of equalconditions, and removing the injustice which will be involved by the contax tinuance of the present state of affairs. The motion proposes that a short Bill shall to be introduced for the purpose of imposing Federal Income Tax, which shall apply to all persons in the Commonwealth Public so - Service, who, by the decision of the High the Court, escape payment of a State Income Tax. The proposal is that we should ourselves tax our own servants. We have already deheard the arguments urged in favour of that I now desire to discuss the objections to it. I think the greatest objection rests upon the fact that the direct taxation of Federal servants may be used in. the future, and inevitably will be used, as the thin end of the wedge of universal direct taxation by the Commonwealth.  member think that direct taxation is bad?",30
267,Mr KELLY,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERA L,"I shall show the honour the able member why I think that direct taxacitizens tion by the Commonwealth-no t by the by such means. States-is bad. . If the Commonwealth were to impose direct taxation it would have to avail itself of one of the means of raising revenue of which the States have at of the States? present the exclusive use. That would involve a duplication of authority in one of the avenues of taxation. We all know that when the Commonwealth came into the States agreed to give up their principal means of raising revenue, namely, Customs duties. We know also that they have retained, aimong other things, an unlimited right to levy direct taxation upon their own come Tax ? citizens. If we established a dual system of income taxation, we should depreciate the value to the State of that means of taxation, 'and thereby seriously interfere) with its opportunities for raising revenue. Honourable members know-eve n those who believe in the single tax-that there limit to the amount that can be extracted great danger. from the public by means of a tax. As matter stands at present, the States have absolute power to impose taxation to uttermost. If we exercise our authority the same direction, we shall limit the tunities of the States, and consequently interfere with the agencies ancl the powers of the States. As one who has always desired to safeguard and protect powers of the States, I find myself in extremely difficult position. How could answer to the States for the injustice would be done to them if we imposed a the Commonwealth Parliament. tax which would prove to be the forerunner of an attempt to interfere with their sent powers of taxation?  sition of an Income Tax upon Federal cers interfere with the powers of the States ? fellow-citizens.",31
268,Mr KELLY,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERA L,"I am pointing out that we passed any such enactment we should be introducing the thin end of the wedge for the imposition of direct taxation by liament. the Commonwealth. From the stand-point of the States, that is the first, and, I think, Federal Capital. the most serious objection to the Commonofficers wealth seeking to impose this form of tion.  evidently fears the imposition of a tax.",31
269,Mr KELLY,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERA L,The honourable member mistakes me. I do not fear anything of kind. I do not object to Land or honourable Taxes in themselves; but I wish the Commonwealth to refrain from interfering with rights of the States to exact from their the utmost amount they can raise  how an Income Tax imposed by us upon .our officers would interferewith the rights,31
270,Mr KELLY,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERA L,"We should interfere with their rights, because there is a limit to the amount of Income Tax that it is possible to being exact from the people.  exact Income Tax from Federal officers.",31
271,Mr HUTCHISON,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERA L,Why should we not impose a Federal instead of a State In ,31
272,Mr KELLY,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERA L,"That would be introducing the thick end of the wedge. I am endeavouring to point out that if an Income Tax were imposed by the Commonwealth without any restriction, either by constitutional process or otherwise, the rights is a of the States would be exposed to Any risk upon that the score, would, however, disappear if we decided that the income tax imposed by us the should for all time, be levied only upon in Federal officers. If that safeguard were opporprovided , I should welcome a proposal 1 such as that now before us. The Federal servants are divided into three classes. In the first place, there are the departmental the officers, who are resident in their own an States; secondly, the departmental headwe quarters'' officers resident in Melbourne; that and, thirdly, the members ancl officers of Speaking purely from the point of view of preequity, I do not see why departmental officers residing in their own States should not income tax to those States for the secuoffirity which they enjoy in common with their The departmental headi f quarters' officers, who are resident in Melbourne, are, in one particular; in much the same position as the officers of this ParThey are here as guests of Victoria, pending the establishment of the In the meanwhile these should not escape from the paytaxament of their share of taxation, but the question is, "" To whom shall they pay it ?"" The salaries of these officials are not being land paid solely by the citizens of Victoria. They are here as guests, and if an attempt were made by Victoria to extract taxation the from these officials for State purposes,, and Income not for those of the Commonwealth at State Taxation of [REPRESENTATIVES.] large, she would be taking up very much the same position as a person who invited another to stay with him, and who when the last train had gone, and no other accommodation could be obtained, endeavoured to extract payment for the hospitality he had extended. In conclusion, I should like to say that honourable members can, Avithout passing a Bill, overcome the difficulty by rushing the Treasury with offers of their conscience money. We may all do that, and thereby save a good trouble, and that is the course which I hope most honourable members will follow. I am content to believe that those honourable members who may oppose this motion are prompted to do so solely upon national grounds - I realise that people outside this House will be apt to' attribute all sorts of base motives to us when we arrive at an inevitable conclusion upon this motion, whether it be this afternoon or next session. But, irrespective of what view may be taken by the House, even if its decision is Opposed to my own view-and I hope; I have made it quite clear-that I am entirely in favour of the proposal under consideration. If , however, others oppose the motion, I shall credit them also with being actuated only'by a desire to act in the very best interests of the Commonwealth.",31
273,Mr DEAKIN,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERA L," From the first, the question which is now before us has been complicated by the action which was taken in this State when an attempt was made to collect income tax from Federal representatives resident in other States, who merely visited Victoria for the purpose of discharging their legislative duties. A number of honourable members felt that any tax of thaL character which might be payable by them was legitimately due to the State to which they belong. Privately I made strong representations to the Victorian Government- I regret to say without availthat any levy should be limited to the Federal representatives of Victoria. was that incident which first provoked the feeling antagonistic to this tax. next place the attempt to collect taxation upon the salaries of Victorian representatives in itself raised a constitutional question, and when attempt extended to salaries payable to the whole of - the representatives of the Commonwealth, it raised a veryserious question, of which, so far, no adequate appreciation has been evidenced in the columns of the press. So far as I am aware, it has not been observed that the Federal Agencies. very principle at stake in the endeavour to levy income tax upon the salaries payable to Federal officers is identical with that involved in the effort made in this Parliament to control the public servants of the States. It is the same principle inverted. I am aware .hat there are honourable members who maintain that the express language of the Constitution separates the case of the public servants of the States from any general prindeal of ciple. But, putting that technical contention upon one side, every one will admit that the Federal principle, that the spheres of action of the Commonwealth and the States should be preserved distinct-as was laid down by Chief Justice Marshall-the principle which forbade the Commonwealth to tax the servants of the Slates equally forbade the States to tax the servants of the Commonwealth. Consequently, we find thai critics outside, who were violently in favour of that principle when the question of interference with the public servants of ths States was involved, denounce it most severely when it is applied to Federal servants. When the question at issue' was whether the Federation could impose any burden upon the States, they were strong in their determination to stand by the Constitution, but when the question involved is whether the States can impose burdens upon Commonwealth officers, they adopt an opposite attitude. I maintain that if they accept the one application of the principle they must accept the other. Under the feeling which was generated in consequence of the attempt to tax representatives outside of Victoria, it was thought necessary that two members of this Parliament, on behalf of all the public servants of theCommonwealthwhether in the Legislature or elsewhere, for we are all public servants-shoul d be selected as defendants in order that test cases might be submitted to the Court. As It I was Attorney-General at the time, I could not refuse to allow myself to be nominated In the as one of the defendants, although, as a matter of fact , I have always, under protest, 1 paid income tax to Victoria. As Attorney General at the time, I was perfectly willing the to become a nominal defendant in these cases, brought in reality against all persons who received salaries from the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Hume, who was a member of the same Administration, also kindly consented to allow his name to be used to represent those public servants who do not live in Victoria, but who transact a part of their business-legisla tive or otherwise-withi n its bounds. As I have said, I paid income tax in this State under protest.",32
274,Mr KING OMALLEY,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERA L,And the Governabstinences ment will not return it.,33
275,Mr DEAKIN,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERA L,"The cases were (.on sidered by the Victorian Supreme Court, and finally, upon appeal, by the High Court, which gave a most important decision in the matter. Of this we have up the present time had an opportunity of ing only a fraction, which appeared in the public press. If I may be permitted to say so, that fraction appears to be based upon the soundest principles of Federal law, which it will be absolutely necessary for this Parliament to maintain at any cost. It is the all-sufficient principle that, in just the same way as we refrain from any interference with the States or with their public servants, so as not to pair the efficient discharge of their public duties, we demand that our independence shall be likewise preserved-, and that public servants and agencies shall be equally free from interference by the States.",33
276,Sir JOHN FORREST,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERA L,"We did not refrain from interfering with the public servants the States, when we included railway ema ploye's in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill.",33
277,Mr DEAKIN,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERA L,"When that Bill comes before the High Court, I am convinced position - in view of its recent judgment-tha will declare that provision unconstitutional. The same principle which has protected the public servants of the Commonwealth from interference by the States, will guard their public servants against interference from us. It has been represented in the press that this is a question f u l highly intricate, refined, and hairsplitting distinctions, which only lawyers can disbad. cover. Instead of that, it is the plainest common-sense principle, to which any two connection. legislative bodies dealing with the same people must resort. We each have a duty perform to the electors of Australia. In own a house. our Constitution we have distinctly specified the work which we are called upon to case. perform. Legislation in regard to everylic thing else remains with the States Legisladuties. tures, and is thus placed beyond our power. It would be absolutely impossible for the States to carry out the behests of the elecservants. tors, if we, sitting here and representing those electors, and also a great many more, were to trench upon their functions. So order that the Federation may do its work we must protect our own Government, and our own public servants against encroachments by the States. Without those mutual Federal government is impossible, and the Constitution is not worth the paper upon which it is written. Without them, no Federal spirit can be created, and no permanent work can be done. We deal with the fundamental basis of Federato tion when we say that the agencies of the readCommonwealth Government, its Members of Parliament, and its public servants as such, must stand outside the control of the States. If the States have power to impose taxation upon Federal servants, what is there to prevent them from increasing that taxation, until it becomes absolutely destructive of the income which they receive? There would be nothing to prevent them from destroying all the functions of government imwhich we are called upon to exercise. Similarly, we might destroy their authority. Consequently, I hold that, just as the Fedeour ration must keep within its own domainwhich is large enough, in all consciencethe States must be kept within their own domain. Under these circumstances, it appears to me that the judgment of the High of Coutt is absolutely sound. It constitutes declaration of Federal independence, and of the right of our public officers to act without interference by any State. We have put ourselves and them in a proper to enable us to discharge our duties t it to the people of this country.",33
278,Mr MCWILLIAMS,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERA L,Would the same principle apply to taxation of land ?,33
279,Mr DEAKIN,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERA L,"So far as I am aware, there is no question regarding the exercise of any Federal powers which would affect l of the private ownership of land. If there were, in my opinion the taxation would be I cannot conceive that the private ownership of land could be involved in this",33

281,Mr DEAKIN,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERA L,"He must pay in that We have to protect Federal pubservants in the discharge of their public Outside of that, they must obey the laws of the States in which they reside, because they are not then acting as public Of course, if a Federal officer were using a house or land for Federal purposes, the case might be altogether different. in The line of distinction is drawn between Federal public servants as such, and ral public servants as citizens. If liament should ever impose an income it will have no right to levy upon the salaries paid to the public servants of the States, because we shall not be able to impair ability to discharge their obligations their employers. But having defended just rights, we are brought face to with another question, 'which is a plain, simple, and practical one. Having established the fact that the. monwealth public officers are legally and necesarily exempt from interference by the States, what are our moral obligations? I submit that, so far they are concerned, there can be no question that this Parliament would doing itself justice and honour if it quired that each Commonwealth public officer should recognise the obligation upon to stand shoulder to shoulder with his low-citizens in bearing the taxation imposed by the State in which he resides. If vide for that by Federal law, as I think have power to do, we shall have at once removed all cause of complaint. We shall have put ourselves beyond attack, and at the same time have done all that justice demands. I admit that, it not as easy as it may seem at first sight to devise a legislative which this can be effected. I have privately called the attention of the Ministry to the matter from time to time, and have crimination ? made several suggestions, one of which, I think, should suffice to carry out our purtion. pose, at all events during the ten ye.us' period. We have merely to provide that the Commonwealth Government shall have the right to retain from the sum payable States ? . to any member of the Federal Public Service, or member of Parliament, ihe amount which would be levied under the income of the State in which he resides.",33
282,Mr FULLER,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERA L,What about the States in which there is no income tax?,34
283,Mr DEAKIN,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERA L,There would be no necessity to make any deduction from the come of an officer or member representing those States.,34
284,Mr GROOM,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERA L,Coul d we retain any of moneys payable to Ministers under the Conin stitution ?,34

I do not think, however, that if the provision I suggest is made, it will be necestheir sary to pass any law requiring Minto isters to discharge whatever they feel to our be their obligation to their States. If the face Federal Government took power to retain very from the incomes payable to Members of Parliament and public servants of the ComCommonwealth, the sum which would be payable in respect of each income tax, the result would be that-whil e the present system prevails which allows the surplus remainas ing after the deduction of the Federal expenditure to flow back to the States-the be amount so retained would go into the coffers reof the State in which it was deducted, without any further action on our part. It might him be necessary to pass an Order in Council felclearly defining the State Acts recognised, and making the deductions perfectly defiwe pronite. By an order of the Governor General we in Council, the Government would be able to retain from each member of the Parliament and each Federal public servant living in a State where an income tax was in operation the amount of the tax, and the monev is so retained would flow back to the State as part of the surplus, without any further scheme by act on our part.

296,Mr DEAKIN,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERA L,"I may be wrong, but I think not. If the course which I propose will not serve the purpose, there are other means of giving effect to our desire. I wish to emphasize the point that the Prime Minister should make an effort to find some way to overcome the difficulty before we go into recess. The sum involved, is trifling to the individual, but the principle at stake is important. The principle is that we, as citizens of the States, should shoulder the responsibilities which our fellowcitizens are called upon to bear; and as long as the collection which I suggest does not interfere with Federal functions, and is undertaken by Federal authority, we shall not impair the Federal Constitution.",35
297,Mr JOHNSON,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERA L,Member s of the Parliament do not receive salaries; they are paid an allowance.,35
298,Mr DEAKIN,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERA L,"In this case that is a distinction without a difference. Any sum paid to an honourable member, whether it be called an allowance or not, would come within the income tax provisions. If it would not, he would go free. I do not desire to elaborate my scheme, because, after all, it is merely a suggestion. I am perfectly willing to support any proposal in consonance with Federal law, but it is not easy to draw up such a scheme. I am told, on very fair authority, that for thirty years they have been endeavouring, without success, to pass such a law in Canada. I do not know that they are consumed with any burning desire to succeed. If they are not, that may have something to do with their want of success.",35
299,Mr MCCAY,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERA L,^-We do not wish this session to last for thirt>- years.,35
300,Mr DEAKIN,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERA L,"If the Government lasted with it, perhaps the Minister would . not object. I merely make this suggestion by the way, and lay no special stress upon it. What I wish to impress upon honourable members is that it is desirable in the interests of the Parliament and the Public Service of the Commonwealth that we should deal with this question before the recess. Provided that the Federal authority is preservedprovided that it is a result of our own act as a Federal Parliament, having authority over our public servants-w e ought to be not the perfectly satisfied to shoulder our. responsibilities as citizens of the States. What we fought for in the recent test cases was the great principle of the control of our own services and agencies, and we have been successful. What we are perfectly prepared to allow the States we claim for ourselves. We recognise as the .very foundation-stone of the Federation the declaration of Chief Justice Marshall that the States and the Commonwealth can only hope to operate on the same citizens, and do their work efficiently and practically side by side, if the sphere of each is clearly defined. It must be defined so that, without overlapping, without interference, without either impairing the right of the other, they shall be able to work together common weal. Justice demands that we shall do our duty as citizens of the States as well as citizens of the Commonwealth. By the decision of the High Court we have demonstrated our rights as citizens of the Commonwealth, and it now remains for us as citizens of the States to do our duties to the States to which we belong. Mr G. B. EDWARD S (South Sydney). - I believe that the honourable and learned member for Ballarat has correctly laid down the constitutional position. I felt from the first that the decision of the High Court was the only possible one; but the solution which the honourable and learned member has suggested is to my mind impracticable. Although we have established a sound constitutional principle, we are face to face with the fact that it has given rise to a feeling of injustice among the citizens of the several States. I shall not occupy the time of the House by dealing with t'his matter, as I might have done earlier in the session; but I should best express my view of what is the only solution of the difficulty by movingThat all the words after the word "" Commonwealth,"" line 6, be left out. I think that the only solution of the difficulty is that the Federal Parliament should collect the income tax. My experience is that such a tax is fraught with great evils, more particularly in the smaller States. Taxation of this kind would be far better in the hands of the Commonwealth than in the hands of a State. In the little island State of Tasmania several attempts were made to impose an income tax, but they had to be abandoned, because of the inquisitorial nature of such a tax when applied to a small community. Even in New South Wales, the tax has given rise to trouble, owing to the fact that it leads to the undue disclosure of private business matters.",35
301,Mr MCLEAN,STATE TAXATION OF FEDERA L," I may mention for the information of the House that this question has been considered on several occasions by the Cabinet. We are f u l ly impressed with the desirableness of the public servants of the Commonwealth bearing their fair share of the responsibilities of citizenship ; but I can assure honourable members that it is extremely difficult to determine the best method of giving effect to our wishes. There are constitutional difficulties in the way, and we have also to face difficulties in regard to distribution, as well as the fact for the that there is no uniform income tax in operation. The Government, however, are determined to devise the best means possible, and as soon as they arrive at what they believe to be a fair solution of the difficulty, they will submit their proposals to Parliament. If we are unable to deal with the matter before the close of the'session, that need not necessarily prevent Parliament from making any future legislation retrospective, so .that no one shall be able to escape any portion of a charge that can be legitimately levied upon him. Debate (on motion by Mr Wilks ) adjourned. NA AND SALE OF TOBACCO. In Committee (Consideration of Senate's Message resumed from 24th November, vide page 7423): Motion (by Mr Frazer) again proposed - That the Committee concur in the resolution submitted by the Senate.",36
302,Mr ROBINSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE," It has been alleged during the progress of this debate, and it was alleged in another place, that a certain combination controls the manufacture, importation, and sale of tobacco in Australia, and that therefore the Federal Government should take over the whole industry for the advantage of its citizens. I would point out, in the first place, that a combination such as is alleged to exist in the tobacco industry is not necessarily improper. During the past nine months we have heard in this Chamber an enthusiastic advocacy of combinations of workmen and employees generally, and if such combinations be justifiable, surely combinations of employers and manufacturers are also justifiable. Combination is hurtf u l only when it uses power and influence for unworthy ends, such as to gain profit by increasing prices and lowering the quality of the article it sells, by reducing wages, or by harassing the public, or interfering with the public health and comfort in other ways. Before we should be asked to take the tobacco industry under Government control, some more substantial reasons must be given than the alleged fact that a combination is now controlling that industry. The fact that certain persons in the tobacco trade have come to an understanding as to the prices at which they shall sell tobacco is not in itself a sufficient reason why the Commonwealth should take over the manufacture, importation, and sale of that article in Australia. I believe in the Government control of railways, waterworks, and other public services in regard to which, from the nature of things, competition cannot exist, and should therefore be under the control of the State. the production and manufacture of articles of food, clothing, and consumption generally, does not exclude competition, and therefore Government control is unnecessary and undesirable except in the last resort. The manufacture and sale of tobacco is not prima facie a subject for Government enterprise, because tobacco being an article which can be readily produced, imported, and sold, the industry gives scope for competition, and is primarily a subject for private enterprise. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie, and another representative of Western Australia, have quoted the example of the Republic of France in support of their contention that the Commonwealth should take control of the tobacco industry, but an investigation of the facts gives very strong reasons why we should not follow that example. French tobacco is notoriously the worse in the world, and English and American travellers on the Continent invariably take their own supplies of tobacco with them, to avoid having to smoke such a filthy and dirty compound. In support of what I have said about the character of French tobacco, let me quote from a book called The Soverane Herb, a history of tobacco, by W. A. Penn, published in 1901, in which, on pages 202 and 203, he saysCigarette factories are situated at Paris, Bordeaux, Marseilles, Mortaix, Nancy, Nantes, and Toulon, The tobacco, which has been aptly described as consisting of scorched linen flavoured with assafcetida and glue, is very coarsely cut, more so than for the pipe in England, and is very dark. The resultant cigarette is indescribably horrible. English smokers fail to recognise it as tobacco. Yet of these cigarettes France smokes some 300,000 millions a year; in any form but that of the cigarette it would be intolerable. An Englishman will face unmoved the armies of France or the howlings of her mobs, but from the cigarette he flies apace. In the Paris Figaro, a year ago, "" Nestor"" recounted his success with this horrible weapon. ""There are still too many Englishmen in Monte Carlo. Still, during my trip I had the pleasure of making one old Englishman's life a misery to him by smoking him out, with my strong French cigarettes, from the railway compartment in which he sat with me. He ' left the carriage half asphyxiated at Lyons, and I felt that Fashoda was, at any rate, partially avenged. Childish, no doubt, but one must do what one can."" Childish it was not, most certainly; France has no more terrible weapon than her cigarette. I will quote next from a paper called The Traveller, wherein it is stated thatOne of the greatest grievances of a traveller is to be deprived of his favourite brand of cigar'ette. A few years ago Foreign Governments But were very unreasonable on this point. Wherever you went you had to be content with the oroductioiis of the national regio-somethin g b'ack and strong-, which spluttered with saltpetre as you smoked. At last the French Government has admitted Egyptian cigarettes. Tobacco, a monthly journal published at Liverpool, says on the same subjectAs is well known, the products of the State monopoly of France, with the exception of its higher priced cigarettes and smoking tobaccos, are hopelessly inferior. French cigars of domestic manufacture are the worse in Europe-thos e of Italy alone excepted. The truth appears to be that tobacco manufacture in France has gotten into a rut, and there is not a man in the Republic who is strong enough to pull it out. For so rich a country as France, its Stale monopoly in tobacco is but a poor revenue producer. I would remind honourable members that in Italy, as well as in France, the manufacture of tobacco is a State monopoly. So much for the quality of the article manufactured under State control. Let me now give honourable members the reasons why the manufacture of tobacco was made a State monopoly in France. Louis XIV . , about the year 1674, was the first to establish a tobacco monopoly in France, but when the first free Parliament, which the French had had for about 200 years met, it at once abolished that monopoly, it was so seized of. its defects. The monopoly was re-established in 1810 by Napoleon Bonaparte, purely for political reasons. As honourable members know, he was the author of that bureaucratic system of Government which is carried to a further extent in France than anywhere else in the world, and under which as much power as possible is concentrated in the hands of the Ministry of the day. All who vend tobacco in France have to obtain licences from the Minister of the Interior, who has thus placed in his hands a patronage which is used for political purposes, with similar results to those which flow from the "" spoils to the victors "" system of the United States of America - the friends of the Government are those who are most likely to obtain licences, just as in America the friends of the successful political party are those most likely to obtain billets.",36
303,Mr BAMFORD,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,That would not apply in Australia.,38
304,Mr ROBINSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"It might apply here. In Victoria we have, time and again, seen a distinct pandering to one section of Government employees. That would be aggravated if another large body of workmen were placed under Government control.",38
305,Mr BAMFORD,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Would it not apply in - regard to the granting of licences of every description? .,38
306,Mr ROBINSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"No . If the tobacco industry were made a Commonwealth monopoly, every person engaged in the manufacture of tobacco, and in the wholesale and retail houses which now manage the tobaccotrade, would become a Government employee, which would put an amount of patronage into the hands of the Government of the day which I think would be harmful to the public interest.",38
307,Mr FRAZER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,What justification has the honourable member for saying that in France the monopoly was established for political purposes ?,38
308,Mr ROBINSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"It was established in France by Napoleon, whose desire was to obtain as firm a grip as possible on every detail of administration, and to centralize, as much power as possible in the Government. Probably, he also desired to obtain revenue. But what weighed more with him than any other consideration, as a study of his life and character will show, was his desire for unlimited power. I wish now to discuss the proposal of the honourable member from the point of view of the States. We have just had a debate on the effect of the decision of the High Court in regard to the non-liability of Federal officers for income tax taxation, and the injury thereby caused to the States. We are required by the Constitution to return at least three-fourths of the Customs and excise revenue collected until 1911. If the control of the importation and manufacture of tobacco, cigars, and cigarettes is taken over by the Commonwealth, the revenue collected upon those articles would not be returnable to the States, but ,would be entirely at the disposal of the Commonwealth Government. Thus great injury would be done to the States. In order to enable honourable members to appreciate the great importance of this industry, I would point out that tobacco, next to stimulants, is the most prolific item in the Tariff. From a return furnished at my request by the Collector of Customs in Victoria, I find that in 1903 the revenue collected from the duties upon tobacco, cigars, and cigarettes imported and manufactured in the Commonwealth amounted to £1,370,000. In New South Wales £ 5 9 5 , 0 0 0 was collected ; in Victoria, £ 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 ; in Queensland, £1.28,000; in South Australia, £ 8 0 , 0 0 0 ; in Western Australia. £ 1 3 0 , 0 0 0 ; and in Tasmania, £ 3 0 , 0 0 0 . I have given only the round figures. If three-fourths of this revenue were diverted to the Commonwealth, the States finances would be seriously depleted. Therefore, from this point of view alone the proposal should be very carefully considered.",38
309,Mr FRAZER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Is not the Senate the special guardian of State rights?,38
310,Mr ROBINSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Yes , and it pays about as much attention to them as does the honourable member. The proposed Government control of the tobacco industry would involve an amendment of the Constitution, because we have no power at present which would enable us to enter upon the manufactures of tobacco. I would remind the honourable member for Kalgoorlie of the opinion given by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat when he occupied the position of Attorney-General in the Barton Administration, in connection with the proposed establishment of ironworks by the Commonwealth At page 184 of the report of the Royal Commission upon the Bonuses for Manufactures Bill , the following letter appears: Commonwealth of Australia. Attorney-General's Department, Melbourne, 18th July, 1903. Dear Mr Kingston, You ask for my opinion, for the information of the Bonus Commission, as to the powers, if any, of the Commonwealth to establish ironworks. In my opinion no such power is included in the express g if t of legislative powers to the Federal' Parliament. The trade and commerce power, vast though it is, does not appear to extend to production and manufacture-whic h are not commerce. Commerce only begins where production and manufacture end. See Kidd v. Pearson, 128 US. 1, 20. Moreover, the fact that the trade and commerce power is limited to external and Interstate trade and commerce indicates that the power which the States undoubtedly possess to undertake Government industries witnin their own limits is not shared by the Commonwealth under this sub-section. UndeT sub-sections 1, 2, and 3, taken together (trade and commerce, taxation, and bounties), the authority of the Commonwealth over industrial development is of the largest; but though it allows of control, regulation, and guidance, it in no respect points to direct establishment or management of any industries. Nor can I find in any other part of the Constitution any express authority for the course gested. The implied powers of legislation remain to b° determined, but include (under sub-section 3g - of section 51) matters "" incidental"" to the cise of the express powers. The manufacture of iron may be incidental to the execution of many such powers, e.g., defence or the construction of railways. The Commonwealth might clearly undertake the manufacture of any goods for its own use; a i d probably i i it did so, and it were incidentally advantageous to the interests of the economical working of the undertaking that it should also manufacture for other consumers, such manufacture would also come within its implied powers. Except as above, it does not appear that any power to establish and conduct manufactures can be implied from the Constitution. Yours faithfully , If that is a sound opinion, it would apply with all the greater force to the present proposal. Under no conditions could the tobacco industry be regarded as having any relation to our defences, except in the sense that tobacco such as that manufactured in France may be used as a weapon of offence. The view taken by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat is sustained by some of the leading barristers in Melbourne and Sydney. An eminent KC. in Melbourne, and a gentleman who is second to none in Australia as a constitutional authority, declare that no power is conferred upon us by the Constitution to enter upon the manufacture of tobacco.",38
311,Mr FRAZER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Does not the honourable and learned member for Wannon think that the tobacco combine are interfering with trade and commerce between the States, when they insist that goods supplied in one State shall not be exported to any other State?",39
312,Mr ROBINSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I shall deal with the combine a little later on. In view of the fact that an amendment of the Constitution would be required, and that the Commonwealth control of the tobacco industry would involve a dislocation of the finances of the States, I contend that only the gravest reasons would justify the Federal Government in taking over the industry. Government interference in the industry might be justified upon some grounds, but the grave step of' taking over the whole and sole control of the manufacture and-importation of tobacco could only be justified in an extreme case.",39
313,Mr LIDDELL,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,It could not be justified on any ground.,39
314,Mr ROBINSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I should not go so sugfar as to say that; but certainly only the gravest reasons would warrant us in taking such a step. It is interesting to note exer- the reasons which have been advanced by Senator Pearce and the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. They allege that there is a monopoly in existence, which exercises almost complete control over the manufacture and importation of tobacco, cigars, and cigarettes; that the monopoly has resulted in the closing of factories, the reduction of the number of hands employed, and the lowering of wages; that the combine will not permit retailers to start in business without their .consent, that they dictate the prices at which their manufactured articles (Sgd.) ALFRED DEAKIN. shall be bought and sold, that they prevent the retailers from buying from any other firm but Kronheimer and Co., and that alt this tends to increase prices to the consumers. It is also claimed by those honourable members that the Federal Government by taking over the industry could make a profit, in addition to the revenue derived from the existing duties, of £ 6 7 3 , 0 0 0 , according to Senator Pearce, and £628,000, according to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. That is to say, ' that the Commonwealth Government could from this industry extract a revenue of about £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 annually. Finally, they say that this lovely plum of £2,000,00 0 per annum could be secured by the expenditure of £1,000,000. No doubt many of us have principles, but if we thought that by expending £ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 we could secure ,£2,000,000 per annum, we should drop most of our principles, and reach out for the £2,000,000. I think I can show, however, that each and every one of the statements I have enumerated is either a gross exaggeration or utterly baseless, that the estimates of the revenue the Government would secure are ludicrous, and that the estimate of the cost of nationalizing the industry is absolutely puerile. In the first place, it is alleged that the tobacco industry is controlled by the combine. I have gone into this matter, in considerable detail, and I shall be in a position to show that the firm of Kronheimer and Co., which, so to speak, is the very head and front of this offending, does not represent all the manufacturers of tobacco, cigars, and cigarettes in Australia. The following manufacturers are standing out of the arrangement: Tobacco manufacturers-Dudgeo n and Arnell, Melbourne; Dungey, Ralph, and Co., Adelaide; New York and Brooklyn Tobacco Co., Sydney; Birt and Co., Brisbane. Cigar manfactuiers-Snider s and Abrahams, Melbourne; De Beer ancl Feries, Screen and Moss, T. Bamewall, G. A. Carter. This Mr Carter has been giving some most extraordinary statistics to the Select Committee. I am very strongly of opinion that he is at the bottom of all this fuss. He supplied honourable members of the Labour Party with a pamphlet advocating the nationalization of the tobacco industry, and his attitude at the present stage is well worth noting. Years ago, in Victoria, we had what were called £ 5 licences for the manufacture of pigars. Mr Carter, with the assistance of some members of the Labour Party., established himself as a manufacturer, and he prospered, waxed fat, and kicked. Then he came to the conclusion that all cigar manufacturers should be charged a licence-fee of £ 5 0 - he then being in a position to paythat amount. Now he goes a length further, and proposes that the Government shall take control of the manufacture and sale of tobacco. The other manufacturers of cigars included in the list from which I was reading are :J. Roberts and many others in Melbourne; in Sydney-Hirsclunan , S. Levy and others, as well as firms in Adelaide and Fremantle. Cigarette manufacturers-Snider s and Abrahams, De Beer and Feries, Louis Coen, and other small makers in Melbourne and elsewhere.",39
315,Mr FRAZER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Will the honourable member tell us the source from which he has derived his information?,40
316,Mr ROBINSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I obtained my information from the fountain-head. mitted a list of queries, and my information can be verified on oath. The information given by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie was supplied by a gentleman who has listened at back doors and has put forward a number of garbled statements.",40
317,Mr MCDONALD,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,What is the value of the honourable member's brief?,40
318,Mr WILSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I rise to a point of order. I desire to ask if the honourable member for Kennedy is in order in reflecting upon the honour of the honourable and learned member for Wannon. by inquiring what is the value of the. brief that he holds?,40
319,Mr MCDONAL D,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I withdraw words.,40
320,Mr ROBINSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Honourable members who know me realise full well that an interjection of that character must recoil upon the head of its author. When I read the statements which have been made in .this Parliament, I put a number of questions to the persons who are alleged to be guilty of these crimes. I went further, and drew up a list of about fifty queries,, in which I sought information upon each point that had been raised, informing thf: individuals to whom I refer that I would expect their statements to be verified on oath before a Select Committee or a Royal Commission.",40
321,Mr FRAZER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,To whom did the honourable and learned member submit his inquiries ?,40
322,Mr ROBINSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,To a personal friend who has been in the tobacco trade all his life.,40
323,Mr FRAZER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Why not give his name?,40
324,Mr ROBINSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The information which I have obtained can be placed before the Select Committee which is inquiring into this matter, and can be verified upon oath. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie can-if he chooses-submi t my statements, which will be contained in Hansard, to that body, and call evidence to rebut them. As regards the import market, I find that the following brands of tobacco are not controlled in any shape or form by the alleged combine :-Taddy's , Copes, Ardath Tobacco Co., Craven, Gallagher, Watson and MCGill, Zimmer and Co., also Tuckett and Son, and others. The f o llowing cigars are also excepted:-Fros sard's, Ormond and Co., Tinchant and Co., Dresselhuys, Engelhardt and Biermann, S. Wolf and Co., Compania Generale,. Manila, as well as all other Manila factories, exceptI sub- ing one, all Havana cigars, excepting those of the Havana Commercial Company, such as Upmann, Partagas, Larranaga, Flor de Benito Suarez, La Excepcion, Figaro, Romeo and Juliet, and many other brands. In cigarettes, all Egyptian, ""Turkish, English, and American makers-exceptin g one in each of these countries-com e outside the operations of the alleged combine. It is not a fact that tobacco, cigars, and cigarettes cannot be sold in Australia without the consent of this firm. It is further alleged that this wicked combine has closed a certain number of factories, and thereby reduced employment. That statethe ment is practically without foundation. There is just a scintilla of truth in it.",40
325,Mr MCDONALD,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Hav e they not closed factories in Queensland?,40
326,Mr ROBINSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"No . The facts are that some years ago Messrs. Dixson and Co. established a number of branches of their Sydney factory. Prior to Federation they were obliged to pay the border duties upon any tobacco which they forwarded to the whole other States, but with the establishment Inter-State free-trade they found that it was more economical to manufacture under one roof. Accordingly, they reduced the number of their factories. It is true that one comwill pany in Melbourne-the National Cigarette portunity. Company-ha s closed its factory ; but it not be denied that there has been a very large increase in the number of persons who are employed in the tobacco trade. next allegation to which I would direct tention is that the firm of Kronheimer and Co. and others who are interested in tobacco trade upon a large scale pay their access to their books and papers. employees sweating wages, and generally inchallenge dulge in brutal treatment of them. I have here a copy of a letter which was written by the States Tobacco Company ProprieJ.P., tary iLimited to the President of the Trades H all , on the 23rd February last. It secretary of the readsDear Sir, The morning papers of the 21st inst. reports of a meeting of your Council held previous evening, which state that the following resolution was agreed to unanimously, namely"" That the Trades Hall Council render every legitimate, assistance to the Cigar-makers' struggle against the introduction of sweated girl - labour into Australasia."" Although the name this company is not specifically mentioned, reports of the discussion show unmistakably that the resolution has reference to the operations our Adelaide factory. Your council appears to have adopted this lution without any attempt at verification of facts, and to have taken the allegations as to "" sweated girl labour"" made by Mr Kirwanthe cigar-makers' delegate-as its basis. We request your council to investigate the same, with a view to obtaining proofs, justifying the above resolution, or, failing these, of rescinding the same as far as this company is concerned. That was a bold attitude for the company to take up. They continuedTo facilitate the investigation, and place result beyond doubt, we make the following posals :A 'tribunal of three persons to be appointed, one of whom to be nominated by your council; the other by us, 'and the third by these two nees-t-a decision of the majority of the members to be conclusive.

As it is important to us that the public suspend its judgment pending this investigation, we trust that you will have no objection to our handing a copy of this letter to the press, and that you give us a definite reply at your earliest opcanThat letter was published in the press. Having been accused of paying sweating wages to the girls in their employ, this comThe pany called upon its accusers to substantiate attheir allegations. They offered to bear the whole cost of the inquiry, and to allow the the tribunal appointed for the purpose free This was accepted by the Trades H all Council, and a tribunal was accordingly appointed, consisting of Mr F . H . Bolton, chairman of the Victorian Cigarmakers' Wages Board; Mr R. S. Walpole, Victorian Employers' Federation, and Mr R - H. Solly, president of the Trades H all Council. These gentlecontain men met, and their report, which has on a appeared in both the Argus and Age newspapers, throws a lurid light upon some of the allegations which have been made in Union in its another place. It reads thusSome weeks ago Mr Kirwan, representative of of the Cigar-makers' Union on the Trades Hall the Council, made certain allegations against the States Tobacco Company Limited, to the effect of that sweating was being carried on amongst the girls in the company's employ in Adelaide. The resocharges were challenged by the company, and the eventually they were remitted to a tribunal, consisting of Messrs. F. H . Bolton, R. H . Solly, and R. S. Walpole. The tribunal met yesterday for final consideration of the dispute. Mr Solly opened the proceedings by traversing the evidence given by the various witnesses, and quoting from various home authorities as to the meaning of sweating. In his opinion, this was based on the disproportionate wage paid to women in comparison with men employed on similar work. This, he considered, occurred' in the work done in the its Adelaide factory. After he had spoken for some prothree-quarters of an hour, Mr Walpole replied, pointing out that the question before the tribunal was a plain-cut issue "" whether or not there is any sweated girl labour employed in any of the nomiStates Tobacco Company's factories."" Mr Bolton, in giving judgment, stated that the question resolved itself into one as to whether the cost folof covering the machine-made bunches, as fixed is by the Wages Board, was too high a minimum, in comparison with the wages paid to cigar-makers for completing a cigar right through without machines. In his opinion, after seeing the wages in books of the States Tobacco Company as to what dewages an indifferent class of labour had made per week, he thought the price was too high in comparison with the earnings of the workman who made the cigar right through. He did not consider that the girls i i i the factory in Adelaide were being sweated, especially when one compared the wages paid for the small experience attained with those of other trades employing women. Thus we find that the allegation of sweating was absolutelv disproved.",41
327,Mr FRAZER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,What does the honourable and learned member regard as a sweating wage in the case of women and girls ?,42
328,Mr ROBINSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,That entirely depends upon the conditions surrounding the industry.,42
329,Mr FRAZER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Is the honourable learned member aware that Mr Jacobs stated that the average wage paid to women ancl girls in the factories of the company is 15s. 5d. per week?,42
330,Mr ROBINSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I could give the honourable member the wages which are paid in France, where the tobacco industry is a State monopoly. There some of the operatives receive about 2s. per day. The British Australasian Tobacco Company pay the girl employees in their Melbourne factory 15s. 6d. weekly for day work, and 24s. weekly for piece work. In 1904 the average day and piece work wage paid to women employed in the States Tobacco Company's Melbourne factory was £ 1 18s. 8d., while the average day and piece work rate for girls was £ 1 os. u d .",42
331,Mr FRAZER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Fro m what statement is the honourable member quoting?,42
332,Mr ROBINSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Thes e figures have been compiled from the books of the several factories. If necessary, those books can be produced.",42
333,Mr FRAZER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,How is it that the rates quoted by the honourable and learned member do not agree with the statement made by Mr Jacobs?,42
334,Mr ROBINSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The honourable member loses sight of the fact that I am referring to the average wages paid to women and girls in the States Tobacco Company's Melbourne cigar factory in 1904. It has been alleged that the monopoly has discharged Iiands and reduced employment. The only statement made in support of that assertion is that a certain commercial traveller was dismissed. It does one good to see honourable members of the Labour Party practically shedding tears over the position of commercial travellers. I should like, now, to put before the Committee a comparison of the hands employed in the factories of the British Australasian Tobacco Company in Melbourne and Sydney, as well as the Melbourne cigar factory of the States Tobacco Company during the last three years. In 1902 they employed 825 hands; in 1903, 848; and in 1904, 1,103. * fairness to n the honourable member who has submitted this motion, I should deduct from the last named total the number of persons who have : lost their employment as the result of the closing of the National Company's cigar factory in Melbourne. Fifty-eight persons lost their employment in that way, leaving a total of 1,045 hands employed in these factories in 1904, or a.i increase of 197 as compared with and the number employed in 1903. These figures show that the statements that have been imade as to the combine having reduced employment are as absolutely baseless as is the charge that it has reduced wages. As a matter of fact, the wages paid in the tobacco trade of Australia are higher than those prevailing in Europe or America. It has been alleged that the firm of Kronheimer Limited has boycotted retailers. No evidence has been submitted in support of that assertion, and I am assured that it is without foundation. Although those who make such an assertion have the protection of a Select Committee, they have not seen fit to submit evidence in support of it to that body. When one gives a moment's consideration to the facts of the case, he recognises that it is highly improbable thatanything of the kind exists. Kronheimer Limited supply retailers to only a limited extent. The bulk of their trade is done with wholesale houses, who are naturallyglad to sell to any one. The more customers they can obtain the better they are pleased. It has also been said that an attempt has been made to fix a minimum price. In dealing with that point, there are one or ' two considerations which we must bear in mind. No attempt has been made to prevent those engaged in the retail trade from obtaining as large a profit as they can from the sale of their goods. But honourable members' who reside in the suburbs of Melbourne know that in a number of trades competition has been so keen that tradesmen have been forced, in self defence, to agree as to the prices at which they shall sell their goods. In the grocery trade, for instance, prices have been cut so fine that many men have been forced into the Insolvency Court. The Tobacconists' Association of Victoria have for many years been endeavouring to secure the fixing of a minimum price for a number of articles so as to insure a living wage, and I believe that they have asked the assistance of the wholesale houses in that respect. Whether that course of action be justifiable or not, the combine is in no way responsible for it. I have known grocers and other tradesmen to keep a stiff upper lip in the face of cut-throat competition, and then go undeT, and in these circircumstances, I feel that there is a good deal to justify the making of an agreement to sell goods at a certain price in order that the retailers may make as much as they can. That course is followed in all the ordinary walks of life. Whether a man belongs to a trade union or any other body, he usually agrees not to sell his labour under a certain price. A further allegation has been made that, as the result of - the combine, the price of goods has been increased to the consumer. In reality, there has been no general increase. It is true that there has been a trifling increase in one or two cases, and a trifling decrease in others; but nothing more. For example, the price of "" Yankee Doodle "" tobacco in Sydney has been slightly increased, but that has been due to peculiarly local conditions. the vast majority of lines, the price to the consumer remains absolutely untouched. I shall not have time to deal with all my notes; but I desire to briefly discuss the alleged profit which, according to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, would he secured by a State tobacco monopoly. He did not give all the figures; but Senator Pearce, in dealing with the matter in another place, made a complete statement of what he thought to be the facts upon which he based his caluculations.",42
335,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Who prepared the honourable and learned member's brief?,43
336,Mr ROBINSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,That is a most improper Temark.,43
337,Mr KELLY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I rise to order. The honourable member for Bland has made a distinct reflection upon the honourable member for Wannon. He asks, "" Who prepared the honourable and learned member's brief?"" as if the honourable and learned member were uttering sentiments in which he did not believe.",43
338,The CHAIRMAN,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I fai l to see that any reflection has been cast on the honourable and learned member; but I ask him to say whether he thinks that the honourable member has reflected upon him.,43
339,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I did not intend to reflect upon the honourable and learned member. I observed that he had a mass of typewritten notes, and that prompted the query.",43
340,Mr ROBINSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I explained when the honourable member was absent that when this question was discussed in the Senate, I asked a friend of long standing, who is engaged in the trade, to supply me with a full statement dealing with the matter. He submitted a statement to me, and I then demanded a full and complete answer to forty or fifty queries which I put to him, telling him at the same time, that I desired to be placed in possession of facts which could not be gainsaid. I am assured that every statement. I have made with regard to this question can be verified on oath. The companies are ready at any time to produce their books in support of them.",43
341,The CHAIRMAN,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"As the time allotted to private members' business has almost expired, perhaps the honourable and learned member would like progress to be reported ?",43

Notwithstanding these declarations, however, he is now asking us to pass into law a measure which, if not materially amended, will, in my opinion, strike one of the most serious blows at trade unionism which it has ever received. Right back from the earliest history, as the workers emerged from slavedom, through serfdom, to their present position, trade unions and organizations have Been forced to secure reforms by political action. It is the trade organizations which have been behind every political reform brought before the public. They have kept reforms to the front until public opinion has been focussed upon them, and legislators have taken them up, and have supported the necessary legislation with all their strength. Long before there was trade unionism in Australia the trade unions played an important part in political reform in England. A few years ago, after the industrial struggles of 189T, the workers of this country were advised by the members of Parliament, the Judges, and other men in high positions in the States, to abandon the old barbarous method of striking, and to seek to obtain by constitutional means the redress of their grievances.",43
343,Sir JOHN FORREST,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"It is dearly laid down by all the authorities that when amendment is before the Committee the discussion must be confined to it . I submit that the honourable member, is now making a second'-reading speech.",44
344,The CHAIRMAN,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The Tight honoraole member was not here when it was agreed to allow a general discussion on amendments. o,44
345,Sir JOHN FORREST,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,That is most unusual.,44
346,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"It is irregular, but that was the arrangement.  right honourable member for Swan shows how little interest he is taking in this matter. Otherwise he would know that the Prime Minister dealt with the amendments in speech which traversed the whole question, and that other honourable members have lowed on the same lines. The effect of the advice given in 1891 is shown by the representation of the Labour Party in, only this Parliament, but every one of the States Parliaments. Now, however, we are asked to pass a measure which will take away the political rights of the trade unionists, and subject them to boycotting throughout Australia.",44
347,Sir JOHN FORREST,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Are men boycotted in Tasmania, South Australia, Western Australia, or Queensland now ?",44
348,Mr LONSDALE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The men, as well as the masters, have practised the boycott, as the honourable member knows.  vancy of the interjections. I know of many cases in which men.have been black-balled and boycotted throughout an entire State, because they have been the mouthpiece of their fellows-in order to secure some reform. If preference is not given to unionists when there are just grounds for asking for it, the industrial organization which is the machinery of the Bill will be a curse to trade unionists.",44
349,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I wish it were possible to prevent boycotting by legislation.  give preference to unionists will prevent boycotting. It is also proposed to deprive, trade .unionists of their right to engage in politics. Hitherto they have had the right to support the election of a candidate to Parliament, to hold political meetings, and to take other political action. But if the Bill is passed as it stands",44

351,The CHAIRMAN,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"If the honourable member will refer to the printed amendments, he will see that that question is not the Senate's before the Committee.  large number of honourable members have during the past two days been trying to arrange an amendment which willmeet every difficultv, but if we cannot discuss political aspect of the provisions now in the Bill their efforts will be wasted.",44
352,The CHAIRMAN,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I cannot give a rula ing as to some amendment which may be moved at a later stage, but in none of the folfour amendments now before the Committee, upon which a general discussion is being allowed, is there anything affecting not the political purposes of trade unions.  one of the amendments before the Chair is to insert in clause 55 the wordsAnd further provided that no organization shall be entitled to appear before the Court to oppose an application for preference by any organization, so long as its rules or other binding decisions permit the application of its funds to political purposes, or require its members to do anything of a political character. That being so, I think that my remarks are strictlv in order.",44

The honourable member was dealing with the political purposes of trade unions.  technical objection. I am not going into a long discussion of the subject, but I wish to show that the Bill, if passed as it stands, will take away rights which trade unionists at present enjoy, by preventing them from applying for preference if they have spent as much as it would cost to print a poster announcing the holding of a political meeting. That will do them considerable injury. There is no doubt lhat this measure was introduced primarily in the interests of the trade unionists. If , however, it is provided that no trade union shall incur expenditure in the direction I have indicated, even to the smallest extent, the measure, instead of proving a blessing, will be a curse.",45
354,Mr JOHNSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The measure is intended to secure the settlement of industrial disputes.  would never have been thought of but for the fact that trade unions have had to resort to strikes, which have inflicted, great loss upon the community. The Bill was intended to provide a peaceful means of settling disputes.",45
355,Mr JOHNSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,We have a right to insure that it shall not be converted into a political machine.  have no right to declare that trade unions which have been in existence for many years shall be denied an opportunitv to secure preference for their members.,45
356,Sir JOHN FORREST,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"They along very well without preference in South Australia.  lian Act is faulty, and has never been brought into operation. If once this Bill Is passed the whole of the trade unions will become subject to it whether they like it or not, and I am appealing to honourable members to divest the Bill, as far as possible, of its objectionable features, in order that it may be made acceptable to those who are most directly affected by it. I wish to say a word or two with .regard to the statements made by representatives of the employers' associations and others who are opposed to .the aims and objects of the Labour Party, to the effect that all the financial difficulties under which we are now labouring in Australia are due to the socialistic legislation which has been passed in the States and Commonwealth Parliaments. I can hardly conceive that honourable members believe that there is any truth in such statements. I appeal to the honourable member for Grampians, whether our present condition is not due to the very heavy losses which have been inflicted upon the community by the disastrous droughts of .the last few years. I find that, during the last ten years, the number of sheep in four States of the Commonwealth has been reduced from 102,000,000 to 61,000,000. If we assess the value of these sheep at the very low rate of 5s. per head per annum, we shall see at once that we have been sustaining a loss of £15,000,000 per annum for some years past. During the same period, our herds of cattle have been reduced from 11,000,000 to 5,000,000; if we estimate the value of these cattle at £ 2 per headit will be seen that we have sustained a loss of £.12,000,000 in that direction. We have also to consider the losses incurred by those who are engaged in the dairying industry, But it and in agriculture generally. Many of the wheat-growers in the State which I represent have cropped their land for seven years in succession, and have taken off very little more than enough grain for I seed. I cannot understand how, in the face ofall these facts, honourable members, and others, can say that socialistic legislation is at the bottom of all our troubles. Even if our legislation had proceeded along the lines which honourable members opposite most strongly advocate, we should have been no better off than we are at present. It is contemptible that such utterly unwarranted statehave got ments should be made in order to prejudice the minds of the public against a measure which is conceived in the interests not only of unionists, but of employers and the general public. Nothing can be more unsatisfactory to an employer than to know that his hands may knock off work and entirely dislocate his business at any. time. honourable member for Grampians referred to the great losses incurred by pastoralists during the shearers' strike, and similar disastrous results have followed other industrial disputes. ' Honourable members should be only too glad to perfect a measure which is designed to prevent the recurrence of the dreadful scenes we have witnessed during labour disturbances, such as those which resulted from the maritime strike, the shearers' strike, and the Broken Hill strike. I trust that honourable members will do their best to render the Bill acceptable to the trade unionists of Australia, who have been commended for doing that which no other workmen in the world have shown themselves prepared to do, namely, handing over the whole of the questions affecting their means of livelihood to the arbitrament of the proposed Court. I feel very strongly with regard to this matter, and I make an earnest appeal to honourable members to divest themselves of all party feeling and to direct their best energies to placing upon the Statute-book a measure that will do justice to all parties concerned.",45
357,Mr SKENE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE, I am quite sure that the honourable member for Grey never heard me say that all the losses to which he has referred were brought about by socialistic legislation.  it.,46
358,Mr SKENE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"No doubt many idle statements have been made. There is a very general feeling throughout the country that in view of the heavy losses and the hardships that have been incurred, we should avoid doing anything that would tend to destroy public confidence, or to prevent the free investment of capital. If we do anything that will injuriously affect the credit of the country, our recovery will be retarded. It was stated last night that the farmers and pastoralists were not so much exercised in their minds as some people represented with regard to the probable effects of legislation of this kind. I should like to read a telegram which has been addressed to myself ancl to the Chairman, and which shows that it is feared that the proposed legislation will operate against the common good. The telegram reads as follows :Avoca, ist December, 1904. Messrs. Skene and Salmon, House of Representatives, Melbourne. Am authorized by chairman of meetings held Avoca, Lexton, Amphitheatre, Mount Lonarch, Rathscar, Natte Yallock, Redbank, Moonambel, The of local branches Farmers, Producers, PropertyOwners Association, embracing all classes country workpeople, storekeepers, & c , to petition House of Representatives, through you, not to agree to include in Arbitration and Conciliation Bill farmers, farm labourers, and domestic work people; letter confirming, please announce House immediately. A. EBLING.  are not legislating for Avoca, but for the whole Commonwealth.",46
359,Mr SKENE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I think that I am doing my duty in putting forward the views entertained by my constituents. The honourable member is not slow to make known the opinions of the electors in his district.  large as New South Wales.,46
360,Mr SKENE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"My district is only a small one; but good things are often packed in small parcels, and I think that so far as value is concerned, my electorate would hold its own in the balance with that of the honourable member. I felt it to be my duty to place the views of my constituents before honourable members.  had better send a reply stating that a provision similar to that objected to has worked no injury in New South Wales.",46
361,Mr KENNEDY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,It has never been brought into operation.,46
362,Mr SKENE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I quite agree with the honourable member for Grey that socialistic legislation has had nothing to do with the hardships and losses which have been inflicted upon the community during the last few years. At the same time, I know that alarm is being felt-perhap s more than is justified by the actual facts, because extreme conditions must exist before the Bill could be brought into operation-and that it is feared that legislation of this kind will prevent that free exercise of enterprise which we all desire to encourage in this country.",46
363,Mr JOHNSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE," The arguments put forward by honourable members in supporting the attitude adopted by the Senate, have very largely traversed the ground covered during the former debate upon the Bill . No additional reasons have been adduced to justify honourable members in reversing their votes. I desire to call attention to the condition of affairs which has been brought about in San Francisco by the conflict between unionists and non-unionists, and which bears directly upon the question of preference to unionists, The following is a clipping from one or the Sydney daily newspapers:In view of the condition of things in Sydney, the action just taken in San Francisco fb meet the oppressive and unfair demands of labour unionists is of great importance. Driven into combination by the attitude of the unionists "" the Citizens' Alliance of San Francisco "" has been formed. The objects of the alliance are then set out. I do not propose to read them, but I wish to quote a brief summary of what is meant by the "" Open Shop."" The alliance contends that all citizens should be treated in the same way-that there should be no discrimination between unionists and non-unionists. Mr WATSON:-Unionist s will never give up their right to strike, unless they are granted a preference.",46
364,Mr JOHNSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I think that remark is an unfair and unjust reflection upon their sense of justice. I am entirely in sympathy with all the legitimate aims of labour. I have had opportunities of talking with a large number of unionists upon this particular clause of the Bill, and they have assured me that they do not want it. They are satisfied that so long as no unreasonable restrictions are placed in the - way of men gaining admission to the unions, the best men will join the unions, and by reason of their superiority as workmen, and their superior skill over their fellows, will naturally get the preference from employers. I object .preference provision, because it . is undemocratic. It is absolutely .posed to all <the legislative ideals of the Labour Party. The honourable member for Darling laid great stress upon the fact that he did not wish to countenance class legislation. But I would point out that this proposal constitutes not only legislation for 'a class, but legislation for a section of a .class. Although I credit honourable members opposite with a desire to do what is best in the interests of labour, I do not believe that a majority of unionists would insist upon a provision of this kind being - inserted in the Bill.",47
365,Mr WATKINS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The honourable member .knows that they will not have the Bill without it.,47
366,Mr JOHNSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I think that the honourable member is wrong in making that statement.,47
367,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"All the unions which have passed resolutions upon the subject, are strongly against the view which is entertained by the honourable member.",47
368,Mr JOHNSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Eve n if a majority of unionists are in favour of it, that fact will not make their demand a just one.",47
369,Mr WATKINS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I say that every unionist is in favour of it.,47
370,Mr JOHNSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The honourable member is mistaken. I can assure him of that, from my own personal knowledge.",47
371,Mr BAMFORD,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Honourable members opposite are continually affirming that unionists are entirely opposed to arbitration.,47
372,Mr JOHNSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I do not make that statement. I think that any fair Bil l which will bring about better relations between employers and employees is worthy of support. I have said more than once that provisions of this character cannot be productive of any permanent good. They do not strike at the root of things. I am compelled to oppose those portions of this Bill which differentiate between one class of citizen and another class, and to re-affirm the principle^ of equal opportunities for all, and special privileges for none, no matter to what class they belong. This is the fundamental basic principle of true democracy, and is now sought to be set aside by the Labour Party. Reverting to the question of the ""Open Shop,"" I should like to read a short summary which shows what it really meansFirst : It means that the right o i non-union and union men to employment is equal, else the equality of right and of opportunity is destroyed. to the That is the point which I have been emop- phasizing. In all legislation of this character, equality of opportunity-whic h should be preserved-is absolutely lost sight of, and a minority are deprived of the right to accept work, save upon certain terms. That is a denial of the very fundamental principle of democratic legislation.",47
373,Mr WATKINS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"That is not the position, and the honourable member knows it .",47
374,Mr JOHNSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"In spite of all that has been said by honourable members opposite, I fail to see that that position has been successfully assailed. The report continuesSecond : It means that union men have no right to coerce employers to discharge non-union men by boycotting or other measures taken to injure the business of the employer. The principle involved is necessary to the preservation of the civil liberty guaranteed by the Constitution and laws. That applies to our own position equally with that of any part of the United States. Whatever regulations may be made iby employers, the Legislature should not differentiate between one class or workmen and another. The summary proceedsGrant the power of union men to prevent non-union men from labouring, and the most offensive tyranny that ever existed will be established. It is now an every day occurrence that men who wish to work are refused admission into unions, and are denied the right to work because they are not union men.",47
375,Mr HUGHES,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,What newspaper says that?,48
376,Mr JOHNSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I am quoting an excerpt by the Sydney Daily Telegraph from the San Francisco files. It continuesI f a labour union is permitted to do this, bers of one religious creed may TJemand the discharge of workmen of another creed, and deny them the right to work at all.",48
377,The CHAIRMAN,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Order ! Does the honourable member think there is any connection between his remarks and the amendments proposed by the Senate?,48
378,Mr JOHNSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I think that the extract which I have read bears directly upon them. It also confirms the statements which I made when addressing mvself to the Bill itself.  fore. Let us come to a vote.,48
379,Mr HUGHES,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I rise to a point of order. The honourable member is quoting the summary of an article which refers to what labour unions are doing in the United States - As there is no law relating to compulsory arbitration in existence there, the extract which he is reading cannot have the slightest bearing upon what unions would do under the operation of a Compulsory Conciliation and Arbitration Bill here. If the scope of the debate is to extend to the United States, we shall not finish this discussion by Christmas.",48
380,The CHAIRMAN,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I have already drawn the honourable member's attention to the fact that I do not see any connection between the extract which he is reading and any of the amendments made by the Senate in this Bill . I shall be glad if he will show me in what way they are connected.,48
381,Mr JOHNSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I am dealing particularly with clause 40, in which it is proposed to omit certain words.",48
382,Mr FOWLER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I wish to ask whether the honourable member is in order in quoting conditions which may or may not exist in the United States, but are clearly not included within the scope of the measure under consideration. No proposal has been made the adoption of which would enable trade unions to restrict the numbers of their members.",48
383,The CHAIRMAN,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"That is quite correct. I understand, however, that the honourable member for Lang desires' to give reasons why the preference clause should not be amended' in the form desired by the Senate. I shall be glad if the honourable member will strictly confine himself to .that aspect of the question.",48
384,Mr JOHNSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"If there be any objection to such arguments, exception should have been taken to those aspects of this memquestion when they were referred to by honourable members opposite. As long as it suited their purpose to refer to them, no objection was taken.",48
385,Mr FOWLER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,We have not argued that the unions should be restricted in number.,48
386,Mr JOHNSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I shall not conclude the quotation, since there seems to be .1 doubt as to whether or not it is in order. I do not desire to strain the Standing Orders, nor to strain the patience of honourable members. I am suffering from a severe cold, and am therefore speaking under great difficulties. I can only say that many of the arguments which have been urged' in support of the acceptance of the amendments made by another place seem to me to be only a recapitulation of the speeches which were made when these questions were previously under our consideration.",48
387,Mr KENNEDY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE," I do not propose to enter upon a general discussion of the several amendments made by another place, but I wish to say a few words with respect to the amendment, bringing agricultural and horticultural labourers within the provisions of the Bill. I am more than ever convinced that we have started on wrong lines. When the Bill was first in troduced. I said that if we desired to pass an effective measure, we should restrict it to half-a-dozen or more industries of a purely Inter-State character. Instead of doing so, we have sought to apply the provisions of the Bill to the whole industrial life of Australia. The attempt to extend it to agricultural labourers demonstrates the absurdity of the position. We have been told by the honourable member for Bland, the honourable member for Grev, and others, that the Conciliation and Arbitration Acts of New Zealand and New South Wales apply to this class of labourers. But it is strange that, notwithstanding that the New Zealand Act has been in operation for something like eight years, no attempt has been made to obtain an award of the Court in respect of them.  there has been no attempt to repeal the provision in question.",48
388,Mr KENNEDY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"It would be time enough to take such a step when an effort was made to bring this class of labourers under the control of the Court. The same remark applies to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act of New - South Wales. It would be absolutely impossible to apply such a provision as this except at the instance of some agitator, and one reason why the farmers object to the proposal is that they fear the interference of such men.  called an agitator..",49
389,Mr KENNEDY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"There are agitators and agitators. I wish to impress upon honourable members the impossibilitv of applying such a measure as this to . agricultural labourers. It is strange, but true, that the farming community entertain the opinion that they can manage their farms more effectively on their own lines than they could by acting upon the theories of the Labour Party. I am inclined to agree with them. ""It is singular that those who are prepared to theorize in this Parliament about the possibility of securing uniformity in the matter of the conditions of farm labourers, are not prepared to go on the land themselves. They could not be drawn on to a farm by a traction engine, yet they are prepared to indulge in beautiful theories as to the right course for farmers to pursue. ",49
390,Mr KENNEDY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"There are many persons who farm the farmers instead of the farms.  tactics have been disclosed by the Butter Commission. ' Mr KENNEDY - That is another matter. I venture to say that it would be impossible to secure uniformity in the conditions of labour on half-a-dozen farms, not to speak of the farming districts of the whole Commonwealth. Would it be possible to apply the same conditions to milkmen in the northern and southern districts of Victoria? Certainly not.",49
391,Mr RONALD,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Why ?,49
392,Mr KENNEDY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"In the district in which I reside dairying is carried on considerable extent, and those engaged in 12 L the industry employ a number of milkmen. The ability of these men to milk is only a secondary consideration; but in the southern districts of Victoria it is of the very first importance. The same remark will apply to the position of harvesters in different .distrijcts. The honourable member for Bland has told us of a strike which occurred last year in his own district, but I have yet to learn of a case in which agricultural labourers as a body liave had occasion to strike because of the conditions under which they were called upon to work.",49
393,Mr RONALD,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,They have never existed as a body.,49
394,Mr KENNEDY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I have yet to learn of any other industry in which so many men have risen from the ranks of labour, and become employers. No other industry in the Commonwealth can show somany who have risen in this way. Why is that?",49
395,Mr RONALD,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Because it is so easy.,49
396,Mr KENNEDY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"If that be the case, why should the honourable member bewail the conditions under which farm labourers aire called upon to work? It would be well for him, and other honourable members of the Opposition, to know something of the general condition of employees in agricultural pursuits before they speak in this way. We have been told that in some parts of Victoria agricultural labourers are working for 7s. 6d. a week. I am sorry for their unfortunate employers.",49
397,Mr WATKINS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The honourable member is not sorry for the workmen?,49
398,Mr KENNEDY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I am not sorry tor the farm hand who is prepared to work for 7s. 6d. a week, because I think he ought to devote his attention to something else. Any one worthy of being called an agricultural labourer can obtain a much higher wage.",49
399,Mr TUDOR,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,HOW much' more?,49
400,Mr KENNEDY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I cannot say generally, but in the Goulburn and Murray Valley districts, with - which I . am familiar,- a man worth keeping on a farm all the year round receives £ 1 per week and his board, exclusive of the harvest reason. ",49
401,Mr KENNEDY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I havenothing'to say on that point. These farm hands, whoreceive jQz per week,' have their' wages raised' to 36s. or 35s. per week during the. harvesting season,' which lasts from six to ten weeks'.' What mechanic in the city can 'save to a as much in 'a year as one 'of these men 1 tan do? These are points 't'o whioh' I invitethe special consideration of the Comwhat mittee. I would impress upon honourable ber of hands to take off his crop, would'he members that it would be impossible to cure uniformity and equality in the condering ditions under which farm labourers are employed, so as to enable the Court to oblabour tain information for its guidance in deI termining the rates of wages and hours of labour to be fixed. It would be cessary in the first instance to show that these labourers suffered some injustice. every manufacturing industry, it is an matter to ascertain the cost of production. A man who attempts to manufacture a piece of cloth in Australia can readily ascertain the cost; but no farmer can foretell the of raising a thousand bags of wheat. His experience counts for nothing. He has to incur the cost of buying or leasing the land, and of putting in his crop; but it impossible for him to say, until the last, what is the cost of production. He does not know until the harvest season apitself proaches whether he will obtain a single bushel of wheat from the area which has put into cultivation.  inclusion of farm labourers in the State Act entailed upon the farmers of New South Wales ?",49
402,Mr KENNEDY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The Act has never been applied so far as farm labourers concerned.  for several years.,50
403,Mr KENNEDY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The honbrable memadvise ber for Grey would have men go to bed risk. by Act of Parliament, and rise again accordance with 'the same rigid rule. Has any request been made by the agriculdorse tural labourers,' or the farming community generally, for inclusion in this Bill? Dethe cidedly not. The honourable member for Bland told the Committee last night that the measure would protect the farmers from the danger of a strike in the har.vest field. They would, however, never make applithe cation to the Court until they wanted the men, and then it would be too late.",50
404,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,They could make applifrom cation months before.,50
405,Mr KENNEDY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Of course they could, and then they might have no work for thfc men to do.",50
406,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The honourable member ly, did not follow my remarks on the subject.",50
407,Mr KENNEDY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I followed them as closely as it was possible to do. farmers were brought under the Bill , and a farmer had made application to a union he considered to be a sufficient num> r sein the event of the weather conditions renit necessary to employ immediately a larger number of hands, and non-unior* offering, refuse to accept that labour ? think that he would rather disregard the. law than waste the time necessary to apply neto the union secretary for more unionlabour, and thus lose his crop, even though In that secretary might be in the next town. easy When farmers realise the possibility of occurrences like that, they feel resentment against the Bill as a whole, although its provisions in other directions may cost be just. It is true that the community earnestly desires the prevention of industrial disputes; but there is no justification for doing what is uncalled for in order is to secure what is right and proper. This Parliament will have enough to do f o i a generation to come if it confinesto necessary legislation, without reaching out towards the impossible. Knowing he what has happened in New Zealand and New South Wales, and having a practical knowledge of farming, I say that there is nojustification for applying the Bill to agricultural labourers, and that they have nodesire to come under it.  are South Wales received anv injury through being brought under the State Arbitration",50

I have received"" numerous communications on the subject farmers, and day after day meetings, of farmers protesting against the proposal are reported in the press.

Senate's Amendment.,- Leave out ""excepting only persons engaged in domestic service, and persons engaged in agricultural, viticultural, horticultural, or dairying pursuits,"" lines 23 to 25. Motion (by Mr Reid ) proposed - That the amendment be disagreed to.",52
434,Mr MALONEY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE," I indicated on a former occasion that I advocated the inclusion of domestic servants within the scope of the Bill, in order that no distinction might be made between citizen and citizen. Since the Federal Parliament in its wisdom has conferred the disfranchise upon domestic servants, male and female, I maintain that they are entitled to the full rights of citizenship, and 35 that they should not be treated as a class 26 apart. The Prime Minister made a statement to the effect that there were no unions of agricultural labourers in AYES. Queensland, New Zealand, New Soutli Knox, W. Wales, or Victoria. So far as Victoria is concerned, the right honourable gentleman's statement was correct, but I am in a position to show that he entirely misstated the facts in regard to New Zealand. A large number of agricultural labourers are registered in that colony as members of unions. J- I shall first quote from the Tocsin, which of all the journals published in Victoria, has fought longest in the labour cause. That journal contains the following statement:During the debate on the Arbitration Bill on Tuesday night, Mr Reid, with all confidence, Tellers: . declared that "" not a single union was in existence in connection with^the rural industries"" in New Robinson, A. Zealand. This is incorrect. Not only is the Otago NOES. Agricultural Labourers' Union registered, but in October last the union obtained an award of the Arbitration Court against the Threshing-Mill Owners of Bruce. A summary of the judgment appears elsewhere in this issue. The summary is as f o l l o w s : The award of the New Zealand Arbitration Court in the dispute between the Otago Agricultural Labourers' Union and the - Threshing-Mill Owners, contains the following provisions :-The hours of labour shall be left to the discretion of the mill-owner; but he shall not, except in cases of emergency, require employees to work by lamplight or artificial light. That the wages be g%d. per hour and found, or is. per flour, men finding themselves. A band-cutter or feeder shall receive is. per PAIRS. hour. There shall.be no distinction between members of the union and non-members, and both shall work together in harmony and under the same conditions, and shall receive equal pay for equal work. Wilks, W. H . That affords clear proof that the statement made by the Prime Minister, and also by the honourable member for Bland was in'correct. As the. majority of honourable members opposite may not care to accept the Tocsin as an authority, I shall quote from the Otago Liberal, of 29th October last, page 6, in which the following ment is made: The Arbitration Court has forwarded its award in the matter of the dispute between the Agricultural and General Labourers' Union Workers (Milton), and the Threshing-Mill Owners of Bruce county. We make the following extracts :-Hour s of Labour-The hours of labour shall be left to the discretion of the mill-owner; but he shall not, except in cases of emergency, require employees to work by lamplight or artifidistrict, cial light. That the wages be g^d. per hour, men finding themselves. A band-cutter or shall receive is. per hour. General-Wage s who are required to be on duty to assist in shifting the mill from slack to stack, or from camp camp, shall be paid at the above hourly rate for the time during which they shall be required be on duly foT such purpose. Subject to the ditions of this award, the employer shall the right to conduct his business and manage property in such manner as he thinks best, and shall make such rules, not inconsistent with this The population of New Zealand award, as may be reasonable to that end. ployer shall, in the engagement or dismissal of his case in the various hands, discriminate against members of the nor in the conduct of his business do anything for the purpose of injuring the union, whether directly or indirectly. Now I come to a statement which may be held to be rather unfavorable to the view that preference should be given to unionemployes ists, but I intend to quote it, in order safeguard myself against a charge of fairness. The award of the Court proadding videdThere shall be no distinction between members of the union and mon-members, and both shall work together in harmony, and under the conditions, and shall receive equal pay for work. The award comes into force on the ist prox. for two' years. It was unwise for us to use the word "" ference."" It would have been much ter to have employed the word "" protecof tion "" to unionists, and to have provided that no employer should be permitted to dismiss a man simply because he belongs to a union. In order that there may be no doubt as to the correctness of the informaof tion I have given, I propose to quote from a New Zealand publication, which conI tains a list of the industrial associations ancl unions registered under the New ZeaThere land Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act, on 30th September, 1904. At page 12 of that publication, I find that the terbury Agricultural and Pastoral Laof bourers' Union is registered under the ber 463, the address given being the Trades Council Hall, Chr'istchurch. Upon page 13, the Waimate Workers' Union is registered under the number 327, and the address is given as the Foresters' H all , stateWaimate. Honourable members may think that the latter is not an agricultural labourers' union, but I have the authority of Otago Mr Tom Mann, who ,was present at Waiof mate on the date of the registration, for saying that a large number of the members of ' the union are agricultural labourers. Any one who knows New Zealand must be aware that Waimate is a purely country and that agricultural operations feeder are largely carried on there. Upon page men, 14, I find that the Otago Agricultural and General Labourers' Union is registered unto der the number 42*4. Altogether there are lo four unions of 'agricultural labourers, and I conthink that this fact should convince honourable retain members that agricultural workers should his be brought under the operation of the Bill . is No emnot crowded into the cities, as is the States of the union, Commonwealth; and we must recognise that these unions in many cases contain agricultural workers. One of my earliest memories- I am referring to thirty years agois that when I was a boy upon the Moorflat station, I was astonished to see one of the there retiring to his hut at four to o'clock in the afternoon. I inquired of unhim if he had ceased work for the clay, that in Victoria men were required to work much later. I shall never forget his reply, which was, "" My boy, when you grow up to manhood, you will think that same eight hours work per day is quite enough equal for any man. I retire to my hut at four o'clock to read and to enjoy a well-earned rest."" That disposes of the argument that preno union of agricultural workers exists in betAustralia. I now come to the proposal the Senate to include domestic servants within the scope of this Bill. I claim lhat the measure should be made applicable to them. I may add that my view upon this matter would be the same if the ladies East Melbourne were being subjected to a similar injustice. The other evening spoke of the cowardly term which is used in England to describe domestic servants. they are designated "" slaveys."" I say that that term should ring throughout the length and breadth of the United CanKingdom as an insult to the intelligence the community. But in the old country', numwe must remember that men and women do not enjoy the broad franchise which is bestowed upon all Australian citizens. So 1 1 far as considerations of citizenship and of humanity are concerned, the mother country occupies a position much inferior to that of Australia. If the people could exercise the wide franchise in vogue in the Commonwealth, they would into oblivion the fetishes which there. How many domestic are there in our midst? from that statist of all statists, whose name rings loudest wherever the English language is spoken-I refer to Mulhall-I in 1841, the agricultural labourers of England were the most numerous class of workers, numbering as they did 3,400,000. Next upon the list stood the operatives who were engaged in manufactures. totalled 3,137,000. The domestic servants constituted the third most numerous class, their numbers being 1,555,000. the number of agricultural labourers had declined to 2,561,000; but that of the operatives in manufactures had increased t 0 4)535;°°°, and of domestic to 2,448,000. It will thus be seen that they still maintained tion upon the list. In agricultural workers _ had further clined to 2.500,000. Those engaged in manufacture had increased to 9,000,000, and the number of domestic servants had undergone a slight decrease, totalling only 2,341,000. In other words, they were still third upon the list. Comparing these returns with the statistics published in the Australian Handbook, I find that whereas in New South Wales, those engaged in professions or in attending upon professional callings number 41,000, the domestic servants total 72,000, the commercial classes 121,000, and the industrial workers 146,000. Honourable members will recollect more women than men are employed in the factories and clothing establishments of Victoria. In this State those connected with professions number the domestic servants 66,000. the commercial classes 109,000, and the industrial workers 145,000. From these figures it will be seen that the domestic servants stand third upon the list of workers in Great Britain, and fourth upon the list in these States. In the primary industries I find that there are 173,000 engaged in New South Wales, and 161,000 in Victoria. If the agricultural workers are to be denied the benefits which would be derived under this Bill, how can any honourable member go before his constituents and justify his attitude in differentiating be Mr ^Maloneytween one class and another? Is it not almost akin to that harsh word "" hypocrisy "" for this Parliament, after having conferred upon all adults the right to vote for the return of representatives to frame sweep their laws, to declare that this Bill shall exist not apply either to the third most numerous servants calling in Australia, or to those emQuoting ployed in the fourth? My own opinion of second chambers has recently undergone a considerable change. I give my meed of find that praise to the Senate for its action in connection with this Bill . It is the most democratic and gborious second chamber speaking the English language to day. I: care little whether the Bill be carried These or rejected, but I care much for the stigma of injustice which will attach to us if we carry it without these amendments. In 1881, I care also for the myriads of people outside who wil suffer injustice at our hands. I claim that the vast majority of Australians would-if the opporservants tunity were afforded them-d o justice to their fellow men and women. I venture their posi- to prophecy that if the Bill be returned to 1891 the the Senate, and if as the result of that deChamber's insistence upon its amendments, a double dissolution ensues, the country will support the members of the Opposition. It is not my intention to delay the Committee any longer. I have made my protest as vigorously as possible, and with all respect to those whose opinions differ from my own. But I would warn those honourable members who are simply voting against these amendments because they desire to keep a certain party off the Treasury benches, that when the people understand the wrong that is being perpetratedwhen they realise the stigma which is being that placed on human beings fashioned like ourselves-the y may have cause to regret their action. I say, a plague on both your parties, when it is simply a ques35,000, tion of the "" in s "" and the ""outs."" That is the sole consideration ruling the Legislature today. The seventy-five members constituting this House, in other circumstances, would gladly do good work for the country; but when it is a question of the "" ins "" and the "" outs ""-whe n we have one side strenuously fighting for a Bill which will do the greatest good to the greatest numbei, while others are opposed to it lock, stock, and barrel-the position is different. I believe that but for party considerations, there is not one honourable member opposite who would vote for the whole Bill. It mav not be in accordance with the - irules of this Parliament, but I am satislied that if we could bring the two Houses - of the Parliament together to decide without debate whether we should have the Bill as amended by the Senate, or as we sent it up to another place, we should arrive at a - decision which would certainly be in the best interests of the Commonwealth. - Mr DAVID THOMSON (Capricornia). - When this question was under our consideration on a previous occasion, I opposed the extension of the Bill to domestic servants. I have since given the jnatter careful consideration, and have found no reason to alter my opinion with Tegard to the constitutional difficulty. I -^believe that, in view of the provisions of - the Constitution on which the Bil l is based, we cannot apply this principle to domestic .servants. Even if it could be so applied, I believe that it would prove inoperatime. At the same time, I have no - desire to disagree with the decision arrived at by the Senate, as I think they are likely ±0 insist upon the amendment which they have made. I do not believe that any sane man would say that his home constituted .an "" industry,'' and as I hold that-domestic servants cannot be said to be engaged in an ""industry, "" within the meaning of the Constitution, I feel that we cannot extend the provisions of this Bill to them. For the reason that I have stated, however, I shall support the amendment made by another place.",52
435,Mr BROWN,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE," I do not propose to discuss this question at length, - for the probabilities are that we shall have a repetition of the vote which has just been given. I desire, however, to protest against the exclusion of so important a section of the community as are the agricultural labourers and domestic servants. I presume that the Government are in - earnest in tlieir desire to pass this measure. It is a Bill which, according to its title, is designed to prevent strikes and locks-out, - and to secure the settlement of industrial - disputes by means of a Conciliation and Arbitration Court. Through the agency of the Court, employers and emploves will be bought together, and any industrial dispute arising between them will be peacefully - settled. In this way it is hoped tb prevent the recurrence of the disastrous - strikes which we have experienced in Australia, with all the inconvenience, loss and misery which they entail. With this high ideal before' us, we are asked to exclude a large section, of the community. The honourable member for Melbourne has quoted very telling figures from Mulhall and Coghlan, with reference - to the number of agricultural labourers and domestic servants in England and Australia, and I think that the facts that he has placed before us are worthy of serious consideration. The Government invite the Committee to exclude those engaged in all branches of farming, as well as in domestic service, from the operation of this measure. We are now legislating for the whole Commonwealth, and I should like to know why these industries should be excluded, while others which are closely allied to them are not. It has not been clearly shown why the Bill should not be made applicable to those engaged in every calling. I can quite understand the attitude taken up by the representatives of Victoria, in view of the fact that all attempts to extend the factory legislation of the State to those engaged in farming have been strenuously resisted. But in New South Wales the position is wholly different. A State Conciliation and Arbitration Act is in operation there; and is applicable to those engaged in agricultural pursuits, as well as in shearing, and many other industries. It is quite possible, therefore, that the farmers of that State may be brought under an award of the State Court. That is a point which is worthy of attention. The products of the farmers of New South Wales have to compete with those of this State; and if they are brought under the operation of the State conciliation and arbitration law, the producers there may be placed at a disadvantage. Why should we not extend this Bill, which is expected to do so much in the direction of bringing about better industrial conditions, to all persons engaged in farming pursuits throughout the Commonwealth ? It has been contended that it is unlikely that disputes will arise among those engaged in the agricultural industry, or in domestic service. If we make provision for them in this Bill , and no disputes occur, the Act will remain inoperative, so far as they are concerned;, but if , .on the other hand, any trouble arises, we shall be prepared to cope with it. We should not legislate for a class; our legislation, as far as possible, should be applicable to the whole of the people of the Commonwealth. We are charged with the important duty of legislating for all Australia, and why should - those who are seeking a livelihood as farm hands or domestic servants be excluded from participating in the benefits of a measure of this kind? For these reasons I shall support the amendment. I trust that better counsels will prevail, and that honourable members opposite will withdraw their opposition to the amendment.",55
436,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,This matter has already been fully discussed.,56
437,Mr BROWN,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I have not previously given my reasons for supporting the amendments made by the Senate. I am a farmer, and as a representative of a farmingconstituency, wish to explain why I consider that agricultural labourers should not be exempted from the Bill . In my constituency, many farmers are engaged in the .dual industry of wool raising and wheat production, upon a very large scale. Within the last few years large areas of land in my electorate, which were previously used solely for grazing purposes, have been put under the plough and devoted to wheat production. We have the same employers engaged in both branches of the industry, and they have to find a market for their produce, not in the Commonwealth, but beyond it. They have to cater for the needs of the old world. parts of New South Wales we have men working as shearers and as farm labourers, during different portions of the year, for the same employers. If the amendment is not agreed to we shall tell these people that, as growers of wool and meat they may come under the provisions of the measure, but as agriculturists they cannot enjoy its benefits, be.cause the agricultural industry is outside its scope. Though, as pastoralists, they may settle their disputes with their employees by conciliation and arbitration, if , as agriculturists, they have disputes with their employees, they must revert to the old barbarous methods of strikes and locks-out. But if the measure can give efficient protection to .those engaged in one branch of rural production-and that is claimed by the Government-it is, in my opinion, capable of giving equally efficient protection to the branch which they propose to exclude. On the other hand, if it is incapable of serving the agricultural interest, it is equally incapable - of serving the grazing interest. In my State, both agricultural and pastoral interests come under the State Arbitration Act. That measure provides for the control of agricultural disputes equally with grazing disputes; but if the Federal legislation, which deals, not with disputes confined to any one State, but with disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State, is so lop-sided as to apply only to grazing disputes, an injury may be done to the agriculturists of New South Wales through the spreading of a dispute to that State from another State, for which there will be no remedy. If this is to be a good and beneficial piece of legislation, it should apply tc* every industry, and to every person engaged in that industry, male or female. Every such person should have a right to regard it as a means for obtaining redress for industrial grievances. Therefore, I protest against the proposal of the Government to apply it only to certain industries, and to thus make it a piece of class legislation. Question-That the amendment be disagreed to-put .

Clause 40The Court, by its award, or by order made on the application of any party to the proceedings before it, at any time in the period during which the award is binding, may(b) direct that as between members of organizations of employers or employees and ' other persons ottering or desiring service or employment at the same time, preference shall be given to such members, other things being equal; And provided further that no such preference shall be directed to be given unless the application for such preference is, in the opinion of the Court, approved by a majority of those affected by the award who have interests in common the applicants. Senate's Amendment - Leave out "" and provided further that no such preference shall be directed to be given unless the application for such preference is, in the opinion of the Court, approved by a majority of those affected by the award who have interests in common with the applicants."" Motion (by Mr Reid ) proposed - That the amendment be disagreed to.",56
438,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE," I move as an amendment That the following words be added :- "" but that the word ' unless,' line 12, be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word ' if , ' ancl the word ' approved, line 14, be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word ' opposed.'"" If the amendment were carried the amendment of the Senate would readAnd provided further that no such preference shall be directed to be given if the application for such preference is, in the opinion of the Court, opposed by a majority of those affected by the award who have interests in common with the applicants. I wish the Court to be absolutely untrammelled in the exercise of the power to grant preference. In my view, the experience gained in New Zealand and New South Wales is quite sufficient to justify us in the belief that the practice there estab, lished, of always insisting that the unionists shall 'reasonably represent those engaged in a trade or calling before preference is granted, would be followed by any Court constituted as the result of this measure. One has, however, to accept the fact that the Committee upon a former occasion insisted that a majority should be shown to exist in favour of preference before it could be granted, and I am willing, as one, to so far give into the voice of the majoritv. In a spirit of anxiety to have the measure passed in something like an effective form, I am quite willing to accept the provision with regard to the majority, so long as the onus is placed upon those who oppose preference, of showing that the majority are on their side. Honourable members opposite argued that it was an easy matter to prove that a majority existed one way or the other.",57
439,Mr LONSDALE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,That was not argued.,57
440,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Wit h all respect to the honourable member, that was argued ad nauseam on the last occasion. I then put forward the contention that it was a matter almost of impossiblity, at least in some callings, to discover the opinion of a mawith jority of those who might be affected by the award.",57
441,Mr HENRY WILLIS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Then , why does the honourable member oppose the amendment-wh y not oppose the proviso straight out?",57
442,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I had the impression that I was addressing reasonable-minded men; but, of course, if the honourable member does not come within that category it is not worth his while to listen to me. Honourable members opposite contended that the question of majority could easily be settled.",57
443,Mr HENRY WILLIS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,But the honourable member contended that it could not.,57
444,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"And I say so still, but 1 I am - proposing to put honourable members opposite to the test of their own convictions. They said that it would be comparatively easy, to discover upon which side the majority lay, that the Court would be guided by common sense, and would not insist upon a mathematically accurate demonstration of the numbers of those affected by the award. If that be so, what objection can they have to shaping the clause in the way I propose? If they believe in their own medicine, why should they not be willing to take a dose of it? If , on the other hand, they now discover that there will be some difficulty in the working of the clause, I say that they give away their whole case as against the proposition ^vhich we put forward previously.",57
445,Mr HENRY WILLIS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The honourable member is proposing something in which hedoes not believe-that is hypocrisy.,57
446,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I am proposing something which, in the opinion of the honourable member, as expressed by his vote, is easy of accomplishment. My position is perfectly clear. I do not wish to hamper the Court in giving preference. I am content to trust the Court. If my contention be correct, that it is difficult to prove upon which side the majority lies, we shall, under the amendment, be in no worse position ; whereas if the contention of honourable members opposite be correct, that the matter is easy of proof, then they will be no worse off.",57
447,Mr MCCAY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Does the honourable member mean that if 'his contention is correct the adoption of 'his amendment will be equivalent to our agreeing to the Senate's proposal ?,58
448,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I am giving' the Minister an opportunity to prove that there is - nothing ulterior behind his own proposition, and that all that is aimed at is to insure that the majority rests on one side or the other. If the amendment be carried, what will be the position? Those who ask for preference will still have to convince the Court that it is right for them to grant preference. They will have to submit all their considerations to the Court, to show fhow many members are in their union, and how far, within reason- as the practice now prevails in New South Wales-the y represent the body of men employed in the trade or - calling. All that process will have to be entered upon and carried through before - the stage is reached of discovering whether there is a majority opposed to preference or not. The Court has to be satisfied that .preference is a justifiable demand.",58
449,Sir JOHN FORREST,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"They will have to make out a case against themselves every time. - Mr WATSON - The right honourable gentleman misunderstands me. The applicants for preference will have to make out a case and convince the Court that they --are entitled to preference upon the merits of the case, before the amended provision will come into operation. They will first have - to convince the Court that preference is justifiable. Presuming that they do so convince the Court, then, under the amendment, the opposing counsel could say, "" Very well, your Honour, the Court is convinced that preference should be granted, but we jiave now to put forward the fact that the - majority of those affected by the award are .against preference being granted.""",58
450,Sir JOHN FORREST,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The opponents preference will have to prove their case.,58
451,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"If the Court be satisnot - fied that all other requirements are comviews plied with, ancl that on the equities of the case preference is justified, then the - question will arise as to how the men gaged in the trade or calling feel with - regard to the matter of preference At that .stage '.he onus T ill be upon those who. oppose preference td prove that they represent a majority.",58
452,Mr KELLY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,There may be no one opposing it.,58
453,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Then , silence will give consent-judgmen t will go by default.",58
454,Mr KELLY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"In other words, the defendants will be required to prove .that they are not guilty.",58
455,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Eve n though they may not be parties to the dispute.,58
456,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"If they are not interested, why should they be parties ? If they are interested, it is their business to become parties.",58
457,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Every individual workman must go to the Court with his lawyer.,58
458,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Now that the clause is turned against himself, the right honourable igentleman is discovering objections which were not apparent to him a little while ago, when it was operating in another direction.",58
459,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The unions are not individuals, but organizations.",58
460,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"But if the unions want preference, they will be compelled, if the clause be carried in its present shape, to canvass every individual outside of the union who may be affected by the award, in order to discover upon which side the majority lies. The right honourable gentleman knows perfectly well that that is what is insisted upon in the clause.",58
461,Mr LONSDALE,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,That is not correct.,58
462,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,How can the honourable member advance such a proposition?,58
463,The CHAIRMAN,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I would point out that we are in Committee, and every honourable member will have an opportunity to express his views: This is a very important amendment, and I think that it is due to the leader of the Opposition that he should be permitted to state his case without interruption.",58
464,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I do not complain of reasonable interjections, but at the sametime I appreciate your anxiety, sir, to maintain order. I do not object to interjections which discover views which may of be met as I proceed with my argument. With regard to the contention that it will be necessary to ascertain definitely the of individuals outside of the unions, in order to prove that the majority of those affected by the award are in favour of preenference, I would ask how that information is to be gained, except by consulting the majority of those who are likely to be affected by the award. I do not wish at this stage to enter upon the argument which was engaged in at some length a few months ago on the question of who are likely to be affected by the awards, although I hold a very strong view that that question will be pushed to a far greater extreme than a number of honourable members are inclined to admit.",58
465,Mr JOHNSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The honourable member's proposal is absolutely opposed to the accepted canons of British law.,59
466,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The honourable member for Lang is taking up exactly the same attitude as that assumed by the honourable member for Wentworth. No doubt that is .due to the fact that neither of those honourable members were members of the last Parliament. If they had been here they would have known that we transgressed that beauteous principle of British law on several occasions, and yet the heavens have not fallen, and there still seems to be some respect for the powers that be. In both the Customs and Excise Acts we provided distinctly that, except in regard to indictable offences, the onus of proof should lie upon the defendant.",59
467,Mr KELLY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,But was not the defendant in all cases a party to the dispute?,59
468,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,And are they not in all cases under this Bill parties to the dispute?,59
469,Mr KELLY,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Decidedl y not.,59
470,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Of course they are. We can sec now that some honourable members are beginning to discover that there is some ground for objection to this particular clause, that, even according to their own admission, it has a two-edged effect. In view of the fact I have stated, that in two other statutes this Parliament has provided that the onus of proof shall be upon the defendant, except, of course, in cases involving serious offences which are indictable, it doss seem to me that the objection urged by honourable members carries no weight when put forwardin regard to this particular case.  people advocate the adoption of the same principle in connection with the licensing 'laws.",59
471,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Yes , and it has also bean adopted in connection with gaming and other laws, under which the defendant is required to show that he was in a certain place for a good purpose, the police being relieved of the responsibility of showing that he was there for an improper purpose. Presuming that a union is asking for preference, my proposal does not relieve it of the necessity of making out a good case before the Court. The only proposition I put forward is that if the Court is satisfied that preference is justifiable, the applicant union will still have to run the gauntlet of the majority of those engaged in the industry-if that majority takes sufficient interest in the matter to disclose itself. All the arguments advanced by honourable members as to the workable character of this clause in its original shape apply with as much force to the proposed amended form. I trust the Committee will see its way clear to adopt my amendment, and) thus afford some possibility of making 'this preference provision a workable one.",59
472,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE, The leader of the Opposition has stated very concisely 'the grounds upon which he submits this amendment. We had heard in various indirect ways that some serious effort was being made to devise an amendment which would be of such a reasonable character that it might lead to a happy settlement of the wide difference which exists in this Chamber upon this very important matter. I may say at once that had the honourable member been able to suggest any such reasonable amendment we should have been glad to f all in with it.,59
473,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Did not the right honourable gentleman tell the newspaper reporters that he could not consent to any amendment?,59
474,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"C e r t a in l y not. I stated that I could not consent to - any amendment which infringed the principle contained in the clause."" Nobody could possibly object to an amendment which would make the meaning of the provision clearer, so long as its substance was preserved. I have never yet met a man who objected to having his object expressed in clearer language. There would have been no objection to an amendment of that character. I am sure that my honourable friend has done his best to propose an amendment which temperance might have had some chance of being accepted.",59
475,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I do not know that this proposal will not be accepted.,59
476,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"As the result of his labours, the honourable member has submitted an amendment upon'this clause which, it seems to me, is repugnant not only to the ordinary rules which prevail in connection with legislation and the onus of proof, but to the spirit of any proposal limiting preference at all. We all know-honorabl e members opposite have made no secret of the matter-that when a Labour Government was in office they accepted a number of amendments with which they were not in accord. We have always recognised that they accepted them, not because they liked them, but because they occupied a Ministerial position, which entailed responsibility, and which to some extent fettered the fearless independence which they enjoy when they are in an irresponsible position. They accepted certain amendments of an important character which were not agreeable to them as matters of principle. I do not blame the honourable member for Bland for his action",59
477,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,It would be pretty hard if the right honourable gentleman started to blame anybody in that connection.,60
478,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I do not blame the leader of the Opposition or his supporters for attempting to get back to the naked principle of preference, in which they sincerely believe. They believe that a preference should be extended to unionists, absolutely unshackled by any sort of regard to the rights of workers who are not members of trade unions. That is a simple statement of fact. As so much effort has been expended in an effort to make it appear that the principle of compulsory arbitration is inseparably associated with preference to unionists, I should like to read the wprds of the author of the New South Wales Arbitration Act, from which a great deal in this Bill has been copied;. He is a man of gieat distinction, and is acknowledged to bo perhaps the leading authority in Australia upon a measure of this character. As is well known, the New South Wales Arbitration Act was passed under the auspices of the Attorney-General of the day, Mr B. R. Wise, a gentleman who is not altogether unknown to honourable members. AVe all recognise that any statement which he makes upon questions of fact or intention can foe implicitly accepted throughout Australia, and therefore I ask honourable members to implicitly accept the statements which he made in the Legislative Council on the 31st October, 1900, when moving the second reading of this Bill. I quote his words, because they bear upon the particular matter referred to - by my honourable friends.  always accept his statements?",60
479,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I never accept them.  gentleman wishes us to accept them.,60
480,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"There are some mortals into whose utterances the element of irony occasionally enters. But I hope that honourable members opposite will accept the statements made by Mr Wise, which are reported in the New South Wales Hansard, page 4547. HesaidHowever, the Hill provides that before any combination of workmen can be registered as an industrial union, they must previously form themselves info a trade union. That is what is stated in this Bill.",60
481,Mr HUGHES,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"It is not the case, but that does not matter.",60
482,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"It is a fact that, under this Bill, no body of men can form themselves into an organization apart from a trade union. I suggested as a solution of the whole of the troubles we have experienced in connection with this clause, that the trade unions should form organizations solely for the purposes of this Bill. My honourable friends, however, declared that they could not accept that solution, and I hope that 'they will allow me to continue the quotation, because it is in the nature of an assurance to a House of Parliament which was asked to pass a similar Bill. Mr. Wise continuedIt has been thought that this provision necessitates that every workman in the Colony shall become a trade unionist. I desire in the most emphatic terms of which I am capable to repudiate that suggestion. It is neither the purpose of the Act, nor is there, I believe, a single clause in it which can be fairly considered or reasonably imagined to have the result of compelling any person who is not a member of a union lo join one.",60
483,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Preferenc e was contained in that Bill unabridged.,60
484,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"If preference is to be given in any Bill, how can any one urge that a man who is not a member of a trade union is not compelled to join one ? I admit that in the sense of tyranny, he is not compelled to do so. He is at liberty to stand back and to see members of certain trade unions pass before him, and obtain any employment that may be offering. I say that if we make a distinction between unionists and non-unionists who are engaged in the same trade - if we provide that a man shall obtain a preference if he joins a union, but that he shall be shut out from employment if he does not-w e apply to him the most cruel compulsion in the world. It is true that we do not touch him in his views of abstract questions. We do not affect his religious or political convictions; but we touch him upon the point which is vital to every individual who has to support those who are near and dear to him by the labour of his hands. Mr Wise continuesThere is no provision whatever which will make it more difficult for the free labourer-as he is sometimes calledHe regarded that term as an offensive one, and consequently added this long parenthesisthe non-unionist, as I prefer to call him, for I believe it is only by joining a union and coming under the influence of unionism that a man is really freeThat is a fair matter of opinion. I do not find fault with Mr Wise for entertaining that view, but I know how I should exercise my opinion if I occupied a similar position. He continued-bu t it is a disputable point which I do not wish to touch-ther e is nothing in this Bill which either expressly or by implication will make it more difficult for the non-unionist to earn a living. That is the statement of the honourable and learned Attorney-General of New ""South 1 Wales upon these very preference provisions. Can it be urged that the amendment submitted by the leader of the Opposition will not make it more difficult for a non-unionist to earn his living?",60
485,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Does the right honourable gentleman say that it will ?,61
486,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Difficultie s will always arise if one body of men is privileged in its oppor tunities of employment. One of the grandest principles of advanced democracy is equality of opportunity. There is no equality of opportunity, however, if the Legislature surrounds men with preferences in their struggles for a subsistence.",61
487,Mr FRAZER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Then the Prime Minister should oppose preference, even if a majority of those engaged in the industry affected approve of the granting of it.",61
488,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I am coming to that point. In the interests of the beneficent objects of this legislation, honourable members upon this side of the House have made concessions. I consider that I have made a very serious concession, and so have other 'honourable members. We have conceded the principle of preference, with the qualification, not that a majority of trade unionists shall claim it, because we leave' all non-unionists free to express their wish that a preference shall be extended to unions to which they do not belong; but the test which we apply is that amajority of those engaged in any industry which would be affected by an award of the Court must first approve of the granting of that preference. Mr Wise continuesI can assure honourable members that if their ingenuity should be able to detect anything which can even remotely have that effect, I shall be prepared to have it eliminated from the Bill . That is the sort of talk which was indulged in when the New South Wales Arbitration Bill was passed into law. I venture to say that not one of my honourable friends opposite would make use of similar language.",61
489,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I am not discussing that.,61
490,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I should think that the honourable member was not. He is far too straightforward to make such a statement. Why is this question of preference made such a life and death issue? Is it because it means nothing ? Is it because it will have no industrial operation or effect-that it will not help one man as against another? Is it because it will not help the member of a trade union as against the man who, in the exercise of his rights as a democrat, - independently refuses to join a union?",61
491,Mr HUTCHISON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,We had better go on as we are.,61
492,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"My honourable friend will excuse me for talking in a way which is not common at a pleasant Sunday afternoon meeting. I hope he wil] allow me to express my own views in the frankest ancl most straightforward fashion. That is a right which is still left to honourable members. My honourable friends opposite, rightly or wrongly, believe that preference is a great advantage for the trade unionists whom they represent.",61
493,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,We admit that without it they would be at a disadvantage.,61
494,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,That is very much the same thing.,61
495,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Not quite.,61
496,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I should like to put a question to my honourable friends of the Opposition. Supposing that an employer desiring to engage twenty men had a right to differentiate in the ranks of trade unionists, would he not be vigorously criticized if ke happened to differentiate between a man who had been very active in his factory",61
497,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,He does that now.,61
498,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"That is one of the matters of which my honourable friends complain. But what is the hardship as compared with that suffered by a man who, on applying for employment, is told, ""Before I can give you an opportunity to work at your trade, I must ask whether you have got a certificate from a certain body "" ?",61
499,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,That is done now. Trade unions in many instances have secured that concession without the intervention of the Court.,62
500,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,If trade unions have secured it without the operation of law,62
501,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,But if this Bill becomes law they will not be allowed to strike.,62
502,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The honourable member is now dealing with another matter.,62
503,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,It is the same point.,62
504,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The honourable member says that trade unions have secured this concession without the intervention of a Court of law.,62
505,Mr HUGHES,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Some of them have.,62
506,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I do not object to any preference which men may secure by legiti mate agitation-by the assertion of their rights as individuals, or as members of trade unions. But the point at which I stop is that a Court of Justice created by this new Australian Parliament should be called upon to decree this preference under the operation of law. I object to the contention that tliey are to place on trade union certificates the stamp of the Commonwealth of Australia,' ancl by means of fines and penalties to deprive workmen of employment. That is the line at which I stop.",62
507,Mr HUME COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Then why do not the Government do away altogether with the provision as to preference?,62
508,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Because I have conceded that point, with a safeguard. The honourable member wishes to remove the safeguard.",62
509,Mr HUME COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Not at all .,62
510,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Does the honourable member say that the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Bland does not take it away ?,62
511,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"No , it leaves it as it is.",62
512,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Does it leave it delightfullyeasy for the outsiders ?,62
513,Mr HUME COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,It makes it just easy for them as the right honourable gentleman said it would be for the other side.,62
514,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"That is not an answer to my question; the honourable member is now indulging in mere speculation. The fact remains that this principle was accepted in the interests of the magnificent objects of the Bill , which are recognised by the great majority of the people of Australia. The principle of preference was accepted, as many other things have been accepted, subject to the principle of some sort of majority rule.",62
515,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,".The right honourable member is correct in saying ""some sort"" of majority rule.",62
516,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"At any rate, there has been no naked assertion of the principle of the right of a trade unionist, by the mere fact 'of his being a member of a union, to claim preference. Are we to leave the Court in such a position that it will have no indication from the Legislature of the principle upon which this discretion should be exercised? The value of the amendment moved by the honourable and learned member for Corinella when the Bill was before us on a previous occasion is that it gives the Court a clear indication of the rules upon which its discretion should be exercised. We must remember that it will not be a Court in which every statement must be proved according to the dry precision of ordinary Courts of law, whose decisions are liable to be upset. This will be a Court of equity of the freest kind. It will be absolutely free from the technicalities of a Court of law.",62
517,Mr HUGHES,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,It will have to deal with facts.,62
518,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I hope that the honourable and learned member will allow me to make myself heard. This Court will not be asked, as an ordinary Court of law is asked, topronounce opinions on questions of law. It is not asked to be satisfied in the driest legal sense that an application for a pre-r ference is supported by a majority of those affected. If , in the opinion of the Court, a majority of those affected in the industry are in favour of the preference, it will know what it may do, and will be able to do it . We are asked by the amendment moved by the honourable member for Bland,, to adopt an extraordinary course. It is remarkable that my honourable friend should be prepared to seriously submit such a proposition if he allows the principle of as majority rule at all. The amendment has one advantage. If it is a genuine one, honestly submitted, it clearly binds my honourable friends opposite to the acceptance of the principle of majority rule.",62
519,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,We accept the principle that the Court should be untrammelled.. Trust the Court!,62
520,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I know what platform oratory is.,62
521,Mr BATCHELOR,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The right honourable member certainly does.,62
522,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I congratulate my honourable friends opposite upon the marvellous easewith which .they can speak upon every ject under the sun, unburdened, as many of them are, with any heavy cargo of acwhen curate knowledge. Mr WATSON.:-We cannot approach the right honourable member in that respect.",62
523,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"If this is an honest amendment, intended to deal seriously with grave difficulty in a measure of national his address. importance, it begins by acknowledging the principle that an application for preference must have the support of a majority of those affected. That has been the sion of .this House, and, so far as the amendment recognises the principle which of course. this House has affirmed, we have no objection to it. But, whilst on the platform, personal sense. one can make these statements, and propose amendments of this kind, we are compelled in a House of Parliament to consider dividually whether such an amendment would really carry out the principle which it acknowledges. Look at the burden which is put upon those who have no corporate existence. A trade union is a large, organexperience, ized, powerful body. These todies have ment, nearly become the masters of all the polibers tical power of the Commonwealth. But bodies there is one place in the Commonwealth with the meaning of the expression, where political power and political organiwill of the majority."" zation, however strong, ought never .to allowed to rule, and that is a Court of tice. Throughout the great struggles for liberty and for despotism in our grand there old mother country, where .the tide of liberalare concerned. ism has been forced on for centuries past, it has always been our boast that whilst its advantages. the Tories and the Radicals may fight, and properly fight, on the open platform of honest political agitation, there is temple where these rival political forces must never intrude. It is one of the boasts of the country from which we have obwith another point. tained our traditions and our institutions that these rival political forces can never interfere with the even, impartial flow British justice. Whilst in this new we may perhaps be more adventurous in many respects, and wisely more adventuremployes. ous than our forefathers in the old fand --whils t we do not shrink from a progress to appear. which may terrify in the old countryall parties have agreed to leave our Courts of Justice severely alone. No party, as it may be. has ever been able to influence the decisions of our Courts.  is a good one to talk;in this way.",63
524,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The honourable member must give other persons credit for some sincerity. subI know of no men who are more wounded to the quick than are my honourable friends it is insinuated that they are playacting. I hope that honourable members will not personally insult me by considering me incapable of sincere conviction.  a member has been insulting us throughout,63
525,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The honourable member has generally been below the level of any shafts that I have discharged; it is by decimere accident that I have hit him.,63
526,Mr BATCHELOR,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"That is not insulting,",63
527,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I am not speaking in a The honourable member for Grey knows that I have no personal feeling against him ; but I think that I inought to be allowed to make a statement on behalf of the Government upon this important question. I repeat that the proposal put forward by the Opposition is an extraordinary one. In our every-day whether as Members of Parliaas candidates, as electors;, or as memof various political, social, or business in the community, we all are familiar the But of all the be daring innovations applied to Courts of JusJustice, this would be the most daring. There are two bodies of organized forces; is certainly one, so far as the workers Individual workers will not be able to go to the Court, and claim",63
528,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Why should they conone trol the actions of a united body?,63
529,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I do not intend at present to answer that question. I am dealing I admit that in a dispute before the Court an employer may be a single individual; but, so far as the of workers are concerned, only an organized land body can appear before the Court as a party to a dispute between employers and",63
530,Mr HUGHES,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Individual s can be cited,63
531,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Does the honourable member think that I do not know that? I am great not speaking about that matter.,63
532,Mr HUGHES,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The right honourable member ought to be dealing with it.,63
533,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"As one who has been recently admitted to the Bar of New South Wales, the honourable and learned member must have been trained in the meaning of terms, and he should recollect that I used the expression "" party to a dispute."" I am sure .the honourable and learned member knows what I am referring to when I use those words.",63
534,Mr HUGHES,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The right honourable member must use the words in this Bill, and not those employed in ordinary lawcourt business.",64
535,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I come back to this question. Let us take a dispute before the Arbitration Court, between a large employer, or a corporation of employers, and a large body of trade unionists. The body of trade unionists apply to the Court for a preference in their branch of industry over all the other workers in Australia. There is no one there' to represent those other workers, who have no organization, and no means to express their opinions, and are scattered over the length and breadth of Australia.",64
536,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The employers' organizations act for them pretty effectively.,64
537,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I ask the country, through von, Mr Chairman, to mark the observation of the leader of the Opposition as to the other workers of Australia who are not in trade unions. The tender mercies their employers are good enough for them. It is to their employers that the non-unionists must look for protection and justice. These very men who picture employers as the incarnation of selfishness, ready to trample the workers to the dust, are willing to leave the non-unionist workers to their mercy.",64
538,Mr W ATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Who said that? T,64
539,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I have heard infinitely worse remarks than that, describing the employers as vampires-capitalistic ' vampires, who suck the blood of labour.",64
540,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"That is a good invention. - Mr Reid - That is the wretched jargon of our friends opposite when vindicating the rights of the trade unionists. They say, "" We want this Court, we want this Judge, to protect the trade unionists from the rapacity and sweating of the employers of Australia.""",64
541,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Of some employers.,64
542,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"But when the interests of the non-unionists in matters affecting their, daily bread.and employment are concerned, all that it is thought necessary is that they shall go cap in hand to their employers to ask them to intercede for them with the Judge sitting in the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. I invite the attention of the people of Australia to the sort pf friends who are considered good enough for the non-unionists of the Continent, whilst this Court is to be established to save labour from the rapacity and greed of the employers of the Commonwealth.",64
543,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I have never used those words.,64
544,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,No . My honourable friend is a thousand miles behind the men who support him.,64
545,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"No one, so far as I know, has said that all employers are rapacious and greedy.",64
546,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"My honourable friend is one of those well-balanced, moderate politiciansunder whom almost any advanced man could serve. I have no quarrel with him. I do not regard him as a source of danger. But the views of those behind him are not of such a rational and moderate character. I wish, however, to get back to the question, what have the disorganized, friendless workers of Australia, who are scattered all over the. Continent, to do in order to express an opinion ? They have to go to the employers ; they have to ask the employers to be good enough to help them. I ask .of honourable members who have the slightest glimmer of fairness in this matter, what would be the opinion of a Judge if employers took workers under their protection, and came to the Court in their case and on their behalf? What scepticism the Court would feel in regard to employers who tried to act as the friends and legal representatives of the non-unionisfts of Australia !",64
547,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The right honourable member knows of an instance in New South Wales in which the employers did so-the Machine Shearers' Union.,64
548,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I have never justified that state of things.,64
549,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,That is an instance in which employers took up non-unionists.,64
550,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,They took up a bogus union in that case.,64
551,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,That is the class whom the right honourable gentleman is taking up.,64
552,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,On the contrary. I appeared for the Shearers' Union.,64
553,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The right honourable member is appearing for the other crowd now.,64
554,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"An y man, whether unionist or non-unionist,' would have a contempt for a union organized by the other side, under the guise of friends of the workers of Australia. Surely we should all have a contempt for anything of the sort. I have already expressed my opinion, without any disguise, in regard to the union referred to by the honourable member for Bland, but I do not call the non-unionist workers of Australia bogus. I do not call them blacklegs and parasites. I consider them to be men who are - entitled to the protection of the laws of the land, and to some show of justice.",64
555,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"So do we,",65
556,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The attempt is now being made to put the onus of proof upon disorganized workers, who are scattered throughout Australia, instead of on the organized trade unionists. Why should the onus of proof be thrown on men who ask only for equal opportunities to earn their living? What has the country come to? Have we sunk so low that when we get to the very bed-rock necessity of a human being, to live in decency, the onus of proof that he is entitled to do so is thrown on him, and he is required to prove what is, in form, an affirmative, though practically a negative? The effect of the proposal of the honourable member for Bland would be that the moment an application for preference was made by a union, the duty would be cast upon the Judge-thoug h my friends would like'him to take no concern on that point-to consider whether there was a majority. In form, there is an admission of the principle which we desire to enforce, but by a cruel twist of the clause the burden of proof is taken from the shoulders of the strong and put on the shoulders of the defenceless. It is taken from the shoulders of the litigating party in the Court and put on the shoulders of the artisans who are unrepresented, and are scattered over the Continent.",65
557,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The unions have always had to fight for the other'crowd.,65
558,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"That is another point. I could understand honourable members saying, in this Chamber, and before the country, "" We object to this principle of majority rule, and we say it has no right to be in this Bill . "" Mr WATSON.!-We say, let the Court decide.",65
559,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Does my honourable friend admit that regard should be paid to the majority ?,65
560,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I say that the Court ought to decide.,65
561,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Does the honourable member admit what his amendment admits?,65
562,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I would not trammel the Court at all, but I am prepared to fix the 12 M right honourable gentleman on his own ground.",65
563,Mr JOSEPH COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The honourable member for Bland has already said that he does not want preference for minorities.,65
564,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I am prepared to leave it to the Court.,65
565,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The honourable member will not get the party behind him to admit that if the members of a trade union happen to be in a minority they should not have preference. Do my honourable friends 1 say that? They have suddenly become so timid that they point to the bell-wether, and desire him to speak for them. Honourable members who, upon other occasions, fearlessly express their own democratic convictions, when I now put a question to them, point to my amiable and moderate friend the leader of the Opposition. Coming back again to the amendment itself, which admits that the Court must have regard to the question of majority,. I say that the proposal that some persons residing in scattered localities, thousands of miles apart, are to come into Court and prove that they represent a majority, is one of the most extraordinary ways of testing such a question of which we could conceive. That is my view. Now let us test this provision by applying it to the case of the trade unions which this Bill was specially designed to meet. I think that we can in this way .show whether our amendment is unreasonable or not. You cannot test a novel experience of this kind where everything is in the dark by precise examples. All you can do is to regard the existing industrial facts throughout Australia in order to judge what kind of dispute will in afl probability be submitted to this high tribunal. As the honourable member for Hume has pointed out on more than one occasion-wit h an accuracy which I do not always perceive in that honourable member-onl y members of the large unions will be affected by this Bill , which is designed to deal with disputes extending beyond any one State-the seamen who work all round the coast of Australia, the marine engineers, who are employed in the same way, and the shearers, whose work requires them fo move from one State to another. It is a notorious fact that the - Shearers' Union, the Seamen's Union, and the Marine Engineers' Institution, and, I think that I might add the Wharf Labourers' Union, the members of which work all round Australia-ever y one of these great organizations, whose affairs are likely to be submitted for the decision of this Court represent an overwhelming majority of those engaged in the respective callings followed by their members. What difficulty would the officers of the Seamen's Union have if they came before the Arbitration Court in proving that they represented a majority of the persons engaged in navigating round our coasts? We know that they have an overwhelming majority.",65
566,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,But they must show that there is a majority in favour of preference.,66
567,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"If the majority of the men are in. the union, there would be no difficulty on that score.",66
568,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Some of the members of. the union might not be in favour of preference.,66
569,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Surely my honourable friend knows that one of the advantages of organization lies in the fact that the officers of a union can speak for every man in it . Mr WATSON.,-Not in this case. They have to show that a majority of those affected are in favour of preference.",66
570,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"We are developing unexpected recesses of human innocence. If the recognised officials of a great union appeared in the Arbitration Court, what difficulty would they have in. proving that they represented the majority of those engaged in the industry or calling?",66
571,Mr HUME COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The words are majority of "" the persons affected.""",66
572,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Yes , the majority those who have interests in common. Air. REID - I do not wish to be d verted from the precise point with which I was dealing.",66
573,Mr HUME COOK,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The right honourable gentleman used the word ""engaged,"" whilst the term employed in the amendment is "" the persons affected.""",66
574,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I am perfectly well aware of that, but I am not dealing, witH that point at all. I am dealing with the objecThey tion raised by the leader of the Opposition. Does the honourable member for Bland seri2,000, ously contend that, if the officials of Seamen's Union appeared before and asked for preference, the Court would ask them to take a poll of the members of their union in order to ascertain if they wanted preference? That is a wonderful difficulty which exists only in the tions of honourable members opposite. What is the advantage of organization? the officials of a union can appear before the Court as representatives of every in it, and that, when they make application in the name of the union, the onus of proving that their principals repudiate it is thrown upon some one else. I think that these difficulties are quite delightful. I can quite understand the state of mind into which honourable members have been thrown over this clause. They have some idea that when a great union asks for preference, proof must be afforded that each man joins in the application. The whole idea is simply absurd. ,",66
575,Mr HUGHES,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,That is a very farfetched construction.,66
576,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I decline to recognise the right of the honourable and learned member to interrupt me. I have a personal objection to his interjections. As I have pointed out, the officials of the Seamen's Union would have no difficulty in proving that their members represented the vast majority of the men engaged in coastal navigation. The Shearers' Union, embracing - 20,000 shearers, would have no difficulty in proving to the satisfaction of a Court of equity that it represented a majority of the shearers in Australia.",66
577,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,There might be a great difficulty in proving that.,66
578,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I do not follow my honourable friend- I cannot understand the difficulty.,66
579,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,It is difficult to ascertain the the number of shearers employed.,66
580,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I should think the union of would have some ready means of proving that its 20,000 odd members represented a imajority of those engaged in shearing. It would be more easy for the union to do that than for 20,000 units, scattered throughout Australia, to prove that the majority of those engaged in the occupation were opposed to preference. I can understand the position of honourable members opposite. This is not the fight they want. Their fight is against these men altogether. are endeavouring to obtain preference for a union containing 250 members against or even 20,000, other men. Honorthe able members may laugh, but they cannot the Court, deny my statement.",66
581,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"We can, and we do deny it.",66
582,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Then my honourable friend imaginais in favour of majority rule.,66
583,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I say that the right honThat orable gentleman cannot prove his statement.,66
584,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The honourable member is man very clever, but he cannot get from one thimble to the other in that short space.",66
585,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I am not so accustomed as is the right honourable member to thimblerigging.,67
586,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"That is why the honourable member cannot do it. He ought to leave it to professors of the art. I am willing to take my honourable friends either way they like. Either they are in favour of this majority principle, or they are not. As I have pointed out, the amendment says they are. They are in favour of the majority principle, but they throw upon the disorganized units the onus of proving practically a negative against a powerful union which is organized. If the disorganized units can satisfy the Court upon this point, the organized bodies can do it much more easily. I rest my whole case upon that fact. This Bill contains the principle",67
587,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,What principle?,67
588,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The principle that a mais jority shall approve of the granting preference before that preference is extended to unionists, and the amendment tion. constitutes a detail as to how that fact shall be brought within the cognizance the Court.",67
589,Mr CROUCH,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Why not accept it?,67
590,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Will the honourable and learned member ask me if it is vital first? Then I shall know what he means.,67
591,Mr FRAZER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The Prime Minister will make nothing vital.,67
592,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"At any rate, I have so much vitality that when I was able to spend a month in Melbourne my honourable friends had to shift their quarters. I may paid inform them that my vitality is still unimpaired.

600,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The honourable and learned member is one from whom I do not court interjections. I limit my intercourse with him as strictly as possible. I do not court any exchanges with him, except those which public duty demands. This amendment recognises that the President of the Arbitration Court must pay regard to the principle of majority rule, but it throws upon the helpless and disorganized the onus of proving something which-if - it can be proved at all-ca n be proved more easily by the consolidated labour bodies of Australia.",67
601,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Will the Prime Minister tell us how?,67
602,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I would suggest to the honourable member for Gwydir that the time has not yet arrived in this country when a man not entitled to obtain the benefit of work of a unless he is a member of a union.,67
603,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,That is not the ques,67
604,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Wit h me, that is a serious of question. We have accepted the principle of majority rule, but we will not twist it round so as to impose an almost impossible task upon men who are not organized throughout Australia. I hope that I have expressed very plainly the views of the Government upon this matter. I would infinitely prefer-if my honourable friend cannot suggest some amendment which we can seriously consider-that he should fight the question that no regard should be",67
605,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Le t us leave the granting of a preference to the discretion of the,67
606,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The honourable member not propose to leave it to the discremy tion of the Court in his amendment.,67
607,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I am prepared to do so, thus meeting the right honourable gentleman",67
608,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"It would be infinitely better for the persons who are not unionists to leave it to the Court absolutely, than to have this onus of proof put upon them.",67
609,Mr WATSON,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,That is a splendid ad,67
610,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"The great trade unions, such as those which represent the shearers, sailors, and marine engineers, which are he the only organizations likely to come before the Arbitration Court in connection with Inter-State disputes, contain a vast majority of the persons engaged in those industries.",67
611,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Then why fight about the matter?,68
612,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"In establishing a new jurisdiction, which is to be vested with power over thei means of livelihood of - every person in the Commonwealth, I desire to indicate some broad principle upon which it should exercise such a tremendous - discretion.",68
613,Mr ISAACS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Thes e principles are embodied in the Bill, irrespective of whether or not this amendment be carried.",68
614,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,That is a remark which does not advance us very much upon the merits of the amendment.,68
615,Mr WEBSTER,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,What does the right honourable gentleman suggest?,68
616,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"I am prepared to stand by the Bill in the form in which it left this Chamber, and, in answer to the allegations regarding the difficulty of ascertaining the will of the majority, I am pointing out that, in all disputes which are likely to come before the tribunal which we propose to establish, no difficulty would arise in that connection, because a vast majority of the persons engaged in those industries are members of trade unions.",68
617,Mr WATKINS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,The right honourable gentleman said the very opposite at first.,68
618,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I never did anything of the sort. I have never stated that the members of the Shearers' Union do not constitute a majority of those who engage in that calling,68
619,Mr WATKINS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,But the right honourable gentleman quoted the case of the pearl fishers. I can show it to him in Hansard.,68
620,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I am not talking of pearlshellers just now.,68
621,Mr WATKINS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Because it does not suit the right honourable gentleman to do so.,68
622,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I have not the remotest recollection of ever having made any such statement.,68
623,Mr WATKINS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I can assure the Prime Minister that it is reported in Hansard.,68
624,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"That is very satisfactory, and we will leave it there. I would ask the honourable member if he thinks that a pearl-shelling dispute-a n industry in which most of the employees' engaged are coloured aliens-is likely to come before the Arbitration Court ?

627,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Wanderin g is the one subject upon which, the honourable and learned member is an authority. I never object to an interruption or two, but only to a sort of organized union of disturbance. It is not the units to which I take exception, but the battery. The honourable member for Newcastle is endeavouring to lead me into trivial channels, when he takes me from a consideration of great bodies of organized workers to the coloured alien pearl-fishers upon the Australian coast.",68
628,Mr WATKINS,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,I was only quoting the right honourable gentleman.,68
629,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"Then the honourable member might quote me to better advantage, and at a more seasonable time. I say again that my friends have committed themselves in this matter by the terms of their amendment. It is not that they like it ; but from the exigencies of the present situation, they have endeavoured to approach us in such a way that honourable members on this side may change their votes, and accept the Bill as amended, on the ground that it protects the rights of a majority. That is the basis on which we are asked to vote for the amendment. I have pointed out that this proposal is a cruel sham. So far from protecting the rights of the disorganized majority, if that majority is unfavorable to preference, it imposes on them a cruel, unjust, and unprecedented onus and burden which it is impossible that they could discharge. When honourable members retort that that is what the Bill does as it stands, I reply that that is not so. I have quoted all the great organized bodies-the only bodies ever likely to come into the Court - all of whom can, without the slightest difficulty in the world, prove the existence of a vast majority of unionists.",68
630,Mr HUGHES,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,Why insert this clause?,68
631,Mr REID,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"My reply is because a majority of this House believe that when this preference is to be within the power of a British Court of Justice, and when it I would affects the daily rights and opportunities of the working citizens of Australia, the Judge should at least have an opinionhaving ihe discretion in a Court of equity to arrive at that opinion-that there is a majority, not of trade unionists, but a majority of trade unionists combined with others outside engaged in the industry, who have no objection to preference. That is what this House is anxious about. If that were conceded, there would be no difficulty; if it were a mere transposition of words, what difficulty would there be in accepting the amendment? But, instead of that, the principle is left in, and a condition is imposed which makes it a sham, and I do not think that any honourable member who voted for the principle can consent to that.",68
632,Mr HUGHES,GOVERNMENT MANUFACTURE,"As my remarks will occupy some time, I suggest that progress be reported. Progress reported. House adjourned at 11.5 p.m.",69
