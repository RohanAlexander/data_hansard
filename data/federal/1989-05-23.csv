NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional Motion (by Mr Beazley) proposed: That so much of standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the honourable member for Wills from moving the following motion: That this House censures the Leader of the Opposition for demeaning his office and the Parliament in that he has(1) failed to observe proper standards of integrity by misleading the Australian people about his knowledge of and involvement in events leading to his election as Leader of the Opposition; and (2) failed to establish and maintain appropriate standards of behaviour for his Shadow Cabinet, in particular his failure to act against the members for Ryan and O'Connor for admitted acts of deception and dishonesty.",10

5,Mr HAWKE ,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,"Wills-Prime Minister) (2.03)-I move: That this House censures the Leader· of the Opposition for demeaning his office and the Parliament in that he has(I) failed to observe proper standards of integrity by misleading the Australian people about his knowledge of and involvement in events leading to his election as Leader of the Opposition; and (2) failed to establish and maintain appropriate standards of behaviour for his Shadow Cabinet, in particular his failure to act against the members for Ryan and O'Connor for admitted acts of deception and dishonesty. At the outset, let me emphasise that this motion makes·no comment whatsoever upon the endless divisions, the interminable civil war which rages in the Liberal Party of Australia. Basically, this endless struggle is the Liberal Party's own affair. This motion is about standards; it is about truthfulness; it is about trustworthiness; it ,is about the quality of Australian public life; it is about fitness for office; and it is about leadership. These matters are decidedly the people's affair, the people's concern, the people's business and, therefore, very properly the business of this Orders Parliament. I ask the House to consider the litany of allegations, assertions and admissions. I ask the House to consider by whom they have been made and about whom they have been made, not lightly, not in the heat of the moment, but repeated day in and day out. Mr Acting Speaker, listen to the litany of quotations: 'a display of squalid political conduct'; 'admitted dishonesty'; 'a deliberate pattern of deception'; 'telling lies'; 'men who have failed the basic test of honour'; 'sheer amorality'; 'unethical conduct'; 'dishonest and deceitful'; 'betrayal of confidence and trust'; 'trust reciprocated with treacherous responses'; 'lying and scheming'; 'behaviour unworthy of respect'; and .-dishonourable conduct with enormous implications for Australia'. Mr Acting Speaker, if any of us on this side of the House were to use that kind of language, you would deem it unparliamentary. But these statements have not been made by us, although we cannot but agree with them. These charges are made by Liberals against Liberals; leaders against leaders; former Ministers against former Ministers; conspirators against conspirators. It is true that we are not in a kindergarten, although one could hardly wonder at times, with the behaviour on the other side; but we are all in a position of service, responsibility and duty to the nation where there is a fundamental requirement for integrity, probity, the ordinary decenc-es of pu!>lic life, an? honourable conduct. It IS a special responSl'(I bility of the leadership on both sides to protect those values by, setting standards and by enforcing them. Yet already in two short weeks this new leadership, this recycled leadership, has failed the test; it has failed to set the standards and it has failed to impose them. This is already a tawdry, tarnished and, indeed, temporary leadership. Let me make this preliminary comment: I am not a stranger to leadership challenge. I know that tough and hurtful things are. involved in such challenge, and I certainly know that challenges come as no surprise to the challenger. Let me go at once to the heart of this matter. The core of it is not the machinations before 9 May.' Its core is what has happened since 9 May and the response of the Leader of the Opposition, the honourEmptyHere those events. The honourable member for Bennelong ( Mr Howard) has put the matter from his own perspective. On 17 May he said: I.want to make one thing clear made a decision to replace me. O.K. But since then two events have happened. One of them was that I was J:Ilade an insulting offer for the front bench and, worse of all, people have admitted dishonesty and treachery, and I think that raises enormous implications for the public's perception of the Liberal On the same day, 17 May; the honourable member for Bennelong said: I, happen to believe that when people of enormous power in the party publicly boast about how successful they have been in telling lies that those who care about the party have a right to talk about it publicly, to express the concern, indeed the outrage, of many ordinary members of the party about it. I mean the fact is that people boasted about how clever they had been in telling some lies. Now that's a pretty serious thing. That is from the narrow, if natural, perspective of the honourable member for Bennelong. He is certainly correct as far as he goes. But it is not just a question' of the boasting admission of the dishonesty of the honourable member for O'Connor ( Mr Tuckey); it goes well beyond that, to the 'very serious question of the honesty of the Leader of the Opposition, and that is very heavily in question, not least to prominent members of his own Party. This is the heart of the matter, and it is the subject of the first part of today's motion. At his press conference to announce the success of his coup, the Leader of the Opposition said: was elected... beholden to none and obligated to no one. Later an exchange took place. He was asked: How long have you been considering a challenge? His answer was: Well, it was in essence a draft. People came' to see me thrqugh last week. At first I gave little attention to it, but by the end of the week the numbers were so substantial that I felt compelled to talk with Senator Chaney on the weekend. Again he had to say: It was a virtual draft and it happened in the last week before the leadership changed. On the same program, justifying his blanket denials of any leadership challenge at the National Press Club on 20 April, the Leader of the Opposition said: On that occasion, I had no delegations coming to me wanting a change in leadership. Had I, I would have indicated it. Now what transpired in the week before the change was, increasing numbers of people coming up and virtually drafting one into the leadership. . The Party This repeated assertion had a clear intent: to de,ceive the Australian media and the Australian people into a belief that there was no leadership challenge until a few days before 9 May, that he was blissfully unaware of any Party. challenge, that he was totally uninvolved in any challenge, that he discouraged any challenge, and that he merely answered the call spontaneously made in those fateful seven days of May. No-one in politics, including the honourable member for Bennelong of course,and me, would take issue with the right of anyone to aspire to the leadership. Rather, the core of the matter is the denial by the honourable member' for Kooyong, after the event, of any foreknowledge of, or involvement in, what we now know to have been months of the most detailed scheming. The Leader of the Opposition's colleagues can make their own assessment of his veracity; indeed, several of them have already done this publicly. For exampJe, on 17 May Mike Carlton asked:, Do you accept Andrew Peacock's denials; his claim that he knew nothing about this until the weekend; that he was simply drafted? The honourable member for Bennelong answered: I can't believe that in. the face of what transpired on Monday night and what I know . . . I cannot believe in all my heart that he was not privy to the detail of that. Mike Carlton asked him: 'So you believe he has lied?' The honourable member replied: Well, somebody is not telling the truth . . . You can't have gone into that kind of detail and then expect people to believe that suddenly people came along and tapped you on the shoulder and said, 'Hey chum, we'd Hke you to be leader'. Or again, Mr Acting Speaker, hear the words of Senator Michael Baume, who said this: There is a simple question. One has to decide who is lying-John Moore and Wilson Tuckey or Andrew Peacock. But the plain fact is that there is a much simpler test of the veracity of the Leader of the Opposition, based on something that was in the public domain long before 9 May. I know, because I put it in the public domain myself. Every member of this House and every member of the Press Gallery knows that from early April on numerous occasions, including here in this chamber, I forecast an imminent challenge. I challenged the honourable member for Kooyong with it directly. I was even able to signify and specify the target of support that he had set for himself and his managerS.",10
6,Mr TUCKEY ,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,Do you want another debate?,12
7,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,Order! . Mr TUCKEY - What about another TV debate?,12
8,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,Order! I warn the honourable member for O'Connor.,12
9,Mr HAWKE,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,"He was demanding, as I pointed out in this chamber, a minimum level of 41 votes. That was the target that the honourable member for O'Connor and the honourable member for Ryan had· set to achieve from the beginning of this year. It was not some sort of spontaneous draft that occurred suddenly a few days before 9 May, as the Leader of the Opposition wished to be believed. I was able to say that in this place because I knew, and I know, about this because we have our Deep Throat. The question for the Leader of the Opposition to ariswer is exactly the question which Richard Milhous Nixon had to answer over Watergate: 'What did you know and when did you know it?'. The answer to that question is, 'Everything, from the beginning'. His hired guns have become his smoking guns. Of course, in these circumstances the ignorance of the honourable member for Bennelong may seem to be all the more extraordinary. He has given his explanation, and the explanation of the honourable member for Bennelong is in itself a quite remarkable comment on Liberal standards. Speaking with Andrew Olle of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on the morning of 15 May, the honourable member for Bennelong said, People have said to me, 'Why - idn't you know. Well, one of the reasons I didn't know is that the people immediately around me failed that basic test of honour which is required of people in that position. Then, after the infamous Four Corners ego trip, the honourable member for Bennelong said on 2GB on 17 May: 'Those who boasted about their proficiency in telling lies, in practising treachery, have done the Liberal Party an enormous disservice, an enormous diSservice. There is a place for some honour in a political party . . . If those people who shared my political confidences felt I· was unfit, they should, in honour, have resigned from the Shadow Ministry and, from outside the Shadow Ministry, worked to bring about a change of leadership. . That would have been an honourable thing to do, but they choose not to do that. They chose to enjoy and abuse my political confidences and having done that they then demonstrated their sheer amorality in a political sense, by publicly boasting about it'. The honourable member for Bennelong did not limit his condemnatipn and his charges of deceit and dishonour to the honourable member for O'Connor and the honourable member for Ryan. Of Senator Chaney he said, 'an enormous disappointment'. Of the honourable member for Mackellar (1Mi' Carlton) he said, 'He was a friend'. Of Senator Austin Lewis he said, 'In this situation you don't know what to believe'. Most touchingly, of the honourable member for Tangney ( Mr Shack)-he 9f the fluttering eyes and uttering lies-the honourable member for Bennelong tells this story: . Peter Shack, for example, made a fetish during the weeks that led up to it of actually coming to me and saying 'John, you know I've always been a supporter of Andrew's, but that is now a thing of the past. We're all getting behind youhow true-with the knivesand we all want you to understand that there is going to be no chillienge'. Mike Carlton, said to him: So, you were lied to? John Howard replied: Yes. Oh, yes. The question was, 'Were you lied to?'. The answer' 'froll1 John Howard was: YI1-' Oh- yes. There was a deliberate pattern of deception. There was a deliberate plan to encourage me to think there was going to be no challenge. What did the honourable member for Bennelong have to say about that other great figure in this plot, the President of the Liberal Party, John Elliott, the real power behind the throne, the agenda-setter, the Liberal leader fixer, the man who gave the nod? The honourable member for Bennelong said of him: Any Party President who fails to tell the Leader of an attempt to replace him is, in my view, being unethical. .1 Let it not be thought for a moment that this is just the attitude-the emotion-of a leader betrayed. The honourable member for Mitchell ( Mr Cadman) said this of his colleagues: . . . their disloyalty and . . . their dishonourable actions . . . ' ' Senator Tony Messner said, ' ... gross disloyalty, admitted dishonesty'. Senator Brian Archer, in a letter to the Burnie Advocate on 17 May, said: We have from within our midst those who gloat over their decept,ion, disloyalty and scheming over three and a half years' to bring down the Leader . . . their leering, gloating and bragging about their conniving . . . But; in all justice, I should give the honourable member for Bennelong the last word because he said this on 17 May: I am responding to a public display of squalid political conduct . . . there are' thousands of ordinary hard working members of the Liberal Party who do not believe that the people who hold power'in the party should conduct things in such a dishonest, deceitful fashion and then boast about it, to betray confidences and trust, to reciprocate faith and trust sponses. "" But it is not the conduct of the Liberal Party before 9 May that is the issue here, although it will certainly be a matter for the judgment of the Australian people. The issue here is the response and the attitudes of the Leader of the Opposition-his standards, his values and his fitness. What has been his reaction? That ,reaction has been a revelation in itself-far more significant and damaging than the so-called revelations on the Four Corners program. The Leader of the Oppqsition dismisses it as 'tasteless and stupid'. Could anything be more revealing of the standards of the Leader of the Opposition than when he describes as 'tasteless' conduct which colleague after colleague has deplored in the strongest terms. On his own admission the Leader of the Opposition is aware of the damage. On 16 May this acknowledgment was finally wrung out of him: I think what they have done a,fter the event has been entirely unhelpful to the Liberal Party and I don't know that it's altogether helpful to the nation either. That is an admission that the conduct, since 9 May, of his senior frontbenchers and principal henchmen has harmed the nation. Yet he says that something that is harmful to the nation is not a sackable offence. One might well ask: if such conduct which is harmful to the nation is not a sackable offence, what is a sackable offence in this Liberal Party? What is a sackable offence in this Opposition, in this front bench, in this would be government, under this would be Leader? That is why this House must also censure the Leader of the Opposition on the second ground in the motion before it. If the state into which the Liberal Party has fallen-the Party branded by its own supporters as the Party of dishonour and deceit-was the only thing at issue, it would perhaps not be a matter of great national concern. But much more is at stake. One of the greatest of Australia's, resources is the strength and the stability of its political system; our great parliamentary democracy. Anything that detracts from that strength and stability damages Australia. One of the vital elements in that strength and stability is the standards, the integrity, the stability and the quality of leadership set by the Opre- position. Yet today this nation, this Parliament and this people have been saddled with an opposition and with a leadership which by the admissions and confessions of its own members is based, as they put it, on dishonour, deceit and division. The Leader of the Opposition, by his f-ilurC{ to set and to impose standards, by his own acknowledged lack of standards, has demonstrated that he is not fit to lead and he is supported and controlled by people not fit to govern. EmptyHere Opposition) (2.23)-Two things about this Government stand out al'ld they come through today: cynicism and shameless hypocrisy. My mind was stirred by - the recounting of events postured by the Prime, Minister ( Mr Hawke), and I will get to that in a few minutes, about his own role, his own Partythis shameless hypocrite who stood at the dispatch box today. He obviously did this with a determination to reduce the standards of this Parliament to those of an Australian Labor Party national conference - Some honourable members opposite are not going to be here long and some have not been here long. This happens, to be my twenty·fourth year in this House. I have heard it all before from governments and from oppositions,and this is the grubbiest, shallowest exercise in nearly a quarter of a century. This even had to be written in advance because they could not have the Prime Minister uttering the words that might have come out and dobbed him in. Honourable members know the background of this man and I will detail it. May I say that I probably know it as well as many of them. The old Australian L!iborParty respect for this Parliament allegedly competed unsuccessfully today with the phoney political exercise engaged in by this man. We should make no mistake about it. This exercise is absolutely poll driven as this Government faces defeat as more and 'more Australians turn away from it. Furthermore, in terms of any grubby political exercise the Prime Minister comes well qualified. He does not come to this dispatch box with clean hands at all. I say bluntly to the Prime Minister right at the start: I have nothing to answer for at all, nothing to explain away and nothing for which I have to apologise. I - was glad that the Prime Minister reminded people. of the words that I used that day because the comparison can be made with hi-. I cOPle to the leadership of this Party, unlike the Prime Minister, beholden to none; unlike the Prime Minister, responsible to all; and unlike the Prime Minister, obligated to no-one. ' Put iri context, this censure motion is moved by a Government out of favour, with an economy out of control, and with living standards for Australians' absolutely depressed. We come back here today after an extraordinary last week in which the Government was advised by its own Governor of the Reserve Bank that it had made the most alarming mistakes, that the economy was ul'ldoubtedly out of control and that its economic policy was wrong. What do we do? We see the Prime Minister come in here today with this motion - and he does not explain to the Australian people the future direction of this country. I put it to the Prime Minister bluntly that there is only one political party sitting in this House that has consistently and deliberately lied to' the Australian people, and that is the Australian Labor Party. There is only one party leader in this House who has consistently and shamelessly refused to be honest with the Australian people. He sits there seeming to make himself out to be smug and complacent, but he is heading a government that has no honour, no respect, no shred of decency and certainly no compassion. Let us test this man for his memory. After all-MONICA",12
10,Mr BEAZLEY ,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,"He is reading his speech notes. EmptyHere have a few notes too, but I do not stand here and readtQem word for word, like the poor little creature did before. Let us test him on some of th-se quotes that I have here. He is even known to have said things about the Leader of the House ,before he ingratiated himself into his company. Ol1e thing we can say' about this Prime Minister is that he does not let facts stand in the way of his own modest ego. Unlike some of the Labor members in this House, I remember the day' he had Hayden there with knives in his back. I remember Bob Hawke that night unquestionably losing his cool and savaging Richard Carleton, or seeking to, on Nationwide. So many of us today; thinking back on it, can remember him modestly saying what he expected of the Australian people. He said-and this should be borne in mind when one thinks about the statements made about no capital gains tax, abolishing child poverty, and having no child living in poverty, et cetera-'I can expect them to believe that when I say something I tell the truth'. In the same breath, he said that he had not been involved in any counting. He said he had brought no pressure to bear on the embattled Bill Hayden. He said that he had no idea that morning that Hayden was about to stand down. But every journalist and every politician in the country knew the truth. They knew that Hawke had single-mindedly pursued the end of Hayden as leader. There is no-one in this place who does not know that. No-one has more ruthlessly chased the political power in this nation than the current Prime Minister. Even before he entered the Parliament he was scheming and dealing to get the Labor leadership., One remembers what might be euphemistically called his tried and emotional outburst at Labor's 1979 national conference. Mr Burr-Did he cry that time? EmptyHere sight-and that was in pre.crying days. He was ip his cups, but I put it - ifferently. Hayden, he said, 'was a temporary leader'. Hayden, he said, 'had a limited future'. Hawke even, it says on the record, accused Hayden of lying. What about the Washington trip in 1979, or one element of it, which I remember as Foreign Minister, where this man who came to the dispatch box today paraded himself before so-called business heavies and journalists openly proclaiming himself as the next Labor leader and promising to cut down Hayden-again before he was even elected as member for Wills. When 'the stories of that trip were relayed back he denied the entire incident. He denied it all and sent John Edwards around to Steketee and Toohey begging them to abandon their ethics ahd to print retractions. The truth was no bar to this man and it was no bar to his seeking to deny and to rewrite history. From the moment he took his seat in this Parliament he was sharpening his knife for the kill-and I know it. He used his cronies at the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) to set up Hayden in terms of the wages pause, et ,cetera. All the while the honourable member for Wills and his backers were chipping away and chipping away. I heard him recite the questions put to Richard Milhous Nixon. What about Hawke that night on Nationwide, when he sought to qeny any involvement whatsoever? Well could we use those questions: what did he know then and what did he know about it? Did he forget to say that he had worked on it for four years? Did he forget to add that John Button had told him the previous day that Hayden had had enough? Did he forget, or did he simply decide not to tell the truth? For elec-ion after election I could go through promise after promise, on the capital gains tax or about an economic nirvana where seeds had been sown for lower interest rates and we were about to reap the crop, to the .last election when we had the most degraded effort of all, where the Prime Minister used the children of this nation, and said that 'by 1990 no Australian child would be living in poverty'. When people found that hard to swallow, he went on the offensive and said, 'There will be· no watering down of the pledge that was made'. The minute the election was over, it was a short farewell to that promise; It then became the parents' fault; he was merely to create the 'environment' in which no child 'need be' in poverty. Bluntly put, this man has the cred. ibility of an ant. Those around him are of about the same stature. Have a look-one in here and one in the other chamber. Throughout his Government, the Prime Minister has been supported by two of the most tainted, bare-faced brawlers of the New South Wales Labor Party, the old institution which former New South Wales Minister George Paciullo said, as I recall, was run by a right wing mafia. One of the kings of that mafia, a former State President of the ALP, is at the table now; I refer to the Treasurer. The other is the former State Secretary, Graham Richardson. Together, they established the practice and the pattern of this· Government, which is modelled on the old, factional thuggery of New South WaleS. Someone in this Parliament can attest to that I see that more· than one person can do so, actually, now I face in the direction of the Acting Speaker.",14
11,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,"The Leader of the Opposition had better be fairly carefu1. EmptyHere direction and look for one Peter Baldwin. Honourable members might ask Peter Baldwin about the New South Wales Labor Party; they might just ask him about Ritcho's good mate Tom Domican; and they might ask him about the right wing. mafia in action. What about Ritcho's role to Hayden, 'We're beTreasurer, hihd you all tht:way', and the like? Frankly, I cannot wait to see what will happen when another election is called. The next will be the fourth in six years, if it is called at the time that appears likely. It would great to be a fly on the wall and to see expression on the Governor General's face when the Prime Minister seeks an early eleccareer tion. It w0ll:ld probably make the Australia Day fireworks look pale by comparison. I could say a lot about the man at the table, the Treasurer ( Mr Keating), but Prime Minister moved this resolution, not the Treasurer, so I will get back to him. This man came before the dispatch box, a nervous little creature, with everything written in vance so that he could get his words right. Even then, he fumbled the pronunciation. The charges fell to the ground because could not substantiate them. He is the apothknow eosis of hypocrisy in the Parliament when moves a motion like that. This is the .man whose smug deceit overrides any other arcannot gument that he sought to project today. could go through Minister after Minister but by his behaviour today the Prime Minister torpedoed his own argument. When talking about standards in the Parfailure. liament, I invite honourable members to think motion. of the way the Prime Minister treats his Ministers. We could go through the Ministers who have sat in the Parliament and survived misleading the Parliament,abusing travel allowances and So forth. Much more could be said. They showed no remorse and received no reprimand; there was no sign any regret from the prince of hypocrisyopa, posite, so he should not come in here .and seek to lecture thiS side of the .House' honesty. How will it sit with the fellow who will follow me in the debate and is evidently to second the motion? He will come to the debate allegedly with clean hands and argue about a clean record in government. I will abstain from the personal stuff that could have been used in a wide-ranging, debate such as this, but he knows what I mean. We do not have to traverse that; it is ingrained in the minds of all Australians. They reject the honour'able member for Blaxland not only as a Treasurer, but also for the way in which he has conducted his Treasury. If the as did the person who spoke before me, starts preaching about honesty, I will tell him-right now that he does not even election know the me.aning of the word. The Prime Minister's record is one of knifbe ing and chipping away at Hayden for the the leadership, even as he' denied it time and again on television and elsewhere. That man's has been built on deceit; that man's career has been built on deception; and that man's government has lied in words and it is a government that has lied in actions. I know the no sin worse than an elected government deliberately misleading the Australian people. The harsh reality. in electoral terms is that the Prime Minister's Government is a sham; adthis motion is a sham; it does no honour to this Parliament, and we of course reject it. The fact' that it will pass on' the numbers he does not worry us one whit,. because we what is the motivation behind this. We he know that the Prime Minister is trying to avoid the issues of the day and we know he substantiate his case. There is nothing I to be answered; there is everything to be offered in opposition, and the reality is that the Prime Minister has fallen flat on his face. As a Prime Minister he is seen now as a So is his Government and so is this",15
12,Mr KEATING ,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,"Blaxland-Treasurer) (2.36)-The contributjon of the Leader 0'£ EmptyHere both style and substance . In the past we have heard contributions with style but without substance, but the Leader's contribution toof day was without both style and substancepaltry, puny reply to a motion censuring him in the Parliament. The motion moved on by the Government does not dispute the right of the Liberal Party to change its leadership. Of course, that would be absurd. The essence of the proposition is the failure of the Leader of the Opposition to observe proper standards of integrity and his misleading of the Australian people. The seriousness and gravity of the charge come from the fact that the Leader of the Opposition walked into a public news conference after his Party had elected him leader, knowing that his utterances and answers to questions by journalists would matter in terms of the public's reception of the change of leadership of his Party and its attitude towards him. In essence, he said that he was drafted to the leadership of the Liberal Party; that people had come to him as late as the previous week and had urged and begged him to stand and that he had submitted his nomination, whereupon he was popularly elected. That is the impression he sought to put across-dishonestly, we now understand: it was a fabrication of facts-to a news conference. In other words, we require that the Leader of the Opposition observe the same standards that are required of Ministers in the Parliament; that is, in reply to questions on an issue the correct answers must be given. What we had here was an attempt to deceive the Australian public, to mislead the people in the most disingenuous way. The most disingenuous remarks were made about the Leader having been drafted, whereas in fact he was involved in a long running set of arrangements to procure the leadership of the Liberal Party, with people acting on his behalf-knowingly acting. on his behalf-to destroy the honourable member for Bennelong ( Mr Howard) as Leader of the Liberal Party. That would have put a different - onstruction on his leadership. It was not as if he was not entitled to put that construction if he saw fit, but he believed that he could manipulate a better reception to his leadership if he misconstrued events. It was only from the television documentary, when the honourable member for Ryan '( Mr Moore) and the' honourable member for O'Connor ( Mr Tuckey) made clear that the conditions were other than as the Leader of the Opposition related, that we were aware that there was a long running set of arrangements. The Leader of the Opposition was asked: Were you aware that this was quite a meticulous plan being put into effect? At the Sydney press conference on 16 May he said: No. He was also asked: Saturday was the first day that document? The reply was: That is correct. _That is correct, yes. That, we now know, was untrue. The honourable member for Ryan made clear that that was untrue in his performance on the Four Corners program. In addition, when he was asked to apologise, the honourable member for Ryan put out a statement saying: . I regret that my account and the presentation of those events by 4 Corners has caused this level of concern. He did not say that they were wrong; he stood by everything he said. He just regretted that people did not like what he had to say. He has not backed away from anything. He made it quite clear that he had documentation which he showed the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of' the Opposition sent him away to continue to drum up support and to report to him occasionally about the account. This was also made clear by the honourable memberJor O'Connor in his contribution on that television program. Yet on the first· day of his new leadership of the Liberal Party we had this deceitful attempt by the Leader of the Oppositionthe man' who is seeking prime ministership of this country-to disingenuously mislead the Australian public. That is the c-arge against the Leader of the Opposition. That is the charge about integrity. It reflects very poorly on the Leader of the Opposition to be up here making innuendos and trying to deal with the past in records in relation to the Prime Minister. It is clear that the Leader of the Opposition misled the Australian public knowingly and deceitfully. That is the issue. He also misled the media of this country in responses to the questions that were put to him, only to be exposed - y his colleagues, his fellow conspirators. As well as that, in the motion we talk about the lack of integrity on the part of the other participants, the honourable member for O'Connor, the' honourable member for Ryan, the honourable member for Tangney ( Mr Shack) and others. In the days after the change of leadership the honourable member for Bennelong, Mr Howard, did say this: . Those people cho-e to enjoy and abuse my political you saw any sort of confidence. He was dead right about that. We often see these supposedly big, hairy-chested strong men like the honourable member for O'Connor throw a few defamatory remarks around the House of. Representatives under privilege. They think they are tough guys. But what the honourable member for O'Connor was not prepared to do was to say to the former Leader of the Opposition, 'Look, I don't think you can win an election, I don't have confidence in your ability to put a policy across and I don't think you ought to be leader. But in believing that, I do not think that I should serve on your front bench, and I won't. I won't serve under you and enjoy your confidence. I will oppose you and try to replace you'. No, there was no such display of integrity. He wandered along, happy to enjoy the office that the former Leader of the Opposition had bestowed on him, while he cowardly went around knifing him in secret cabals in the Liberal Party in the weeks leading up to the challenge. He showed no integrity, no decency. That is the same sort of thing that he used to do in his hotel-lull people into a false sense of security; get them drunk; then beat them; That was what he did to the former Leader of the Opposition. He lulled him into a false sense of security; he did not disagree with him but then in the dead of'night he knifed him. This is the kind of integrity he has. Then he went on television and admitted that he was a self-confessed liar. In other words, a person who wants ministerial office in this country is a self-confessed liar who says that this is the way he will deal with his leader. Then let us take the honourable m-mber for Ryan. The. former Leader of the Opposition said he did everything to encourage his trust, but never did the honourable member for Ryan say that he was rejecting that trust, that he did not want his front bench position because he did not believe in his leader. He did not say that. He did the lousy thing: he stayed-living off the body of the former - eader of the Opposition; living off his politIcal power and his confidence in him. It was the same with. the honourable member for Tangney, who comes here with his unctuous performances, asking questions anq so on. The honourable member for Bennelong said, 'Several times over the past few months Peter Shack came to me and said, ""Look, forget about challenges. That is all in the past; let's concentrate on winning elections. Do not worry about looking over your shoulder"". What sort of person behaves like that? Opposition members 'interjectingMONICA",16
13,Mr KEATING,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,"No, I would never behave like that. What sort of person behaves like that? The honourable member for Tangney just sat there, quite happy to live off the former Leader of the Opposition's political confidence and political strength and enjoy his front bench position. He lived off the political body of the former Leader of the Opposition but was never prepared to teU him. Do those opposite know what people who live off the bodies of other people are caUed? They are called lice. The lice of Australian politics are sitting there, dragging down the former Leader of the Opposition. They did not have the decency to go and teU him that they had no confidence in him. They ran around having late night meetings in a cabal to knock him off. Then there is that little goody-goody in the Senate, Senator Chaney, the plain man's goody-goody. What did Senator Chaney do? He did not say, 'lam associated with Mr Howard as Leader of the Government in the Senate. It is clear that I am his confidante and friend'. He said to him, 'You lead on. If there is a problem, I will teU you'. He told him, all right, when they aU walked into tell him that they did not want him any more. That was the position in which Senator Chaney left the honourable member for Bennelong. The honourable .member for Bennelong said that Senator Chaney had failed the basic test of honour. He was dead right. It would be one thing if Senator Chaney had said to him, 'They have come to me-I am bound to teU you that they have come to me-and I think they are correct. I am convinced that you cannot win and I must say that I cannot support you any more'. But not to tell him, and then to walk through. the door with the other monkeys and say 'We are all joined together to be rid of you', when he was a friend, shows just what a. lightweight Senator Chaney is. If Senator Chaney happens to win a seat in the House of Representatives he will get ripped to shreds over here. As we have seen, once a weakie, always a weakie. Then we had the honourable member for Goldstein ( Mr Macphee) telling us about how he will carry the city of Melbourne for the Liberal Party. The arrogance of it all at the Press Club! 'If the Liberal Party keeps me, I will carry the city of Melbourne'. He could not even carry the people on his own local preselection panel. The Deakinite Liberal-forgetting that 'liberal' is a misnomer in the Liberal Party. The Liberal Party is a conservative party; it is not a liberal party. The nearest thing to a Deakinite liberal party today would be the Australian Democrats. That is probably where the honourable member for Goldstein belongs in terms of his views. As· the honourable member for MCPherson ( Mr White) has said, the honourable member for Goldstein is disloyal to Liberal Party objectives. The honourable member' for MCPherson is right. But the honourable member for Goldstein is back here with the Leader of the Opposition. What we are going to get from all these people is the same sort of stuff. The Leader of the Opposition is supposedly puttinglhe coalition together. The honourable member for Goldstein is supposed to be the thinking man's Liberal, standing as some rallying point for principle. Imagine it-the honourable member for Goldstein a rallying point for principle. The other, Liberal members simply saw an opportunity for ministerial office and clubbed down the former Leader of the Opposition. This is the great Opposition front bench of integrity. The person who leads them was prepared to stand up to the Australian media, to the Canberra Press 'Gallery, to the public, and say, 'I was virtually drafted for this job', when he knew full well that he had schemed and plotted to destroy his opponent. He had sat as his deputy and had, never had the decency to tell him or to resign from his position as Deputy Leader of the Opposition, to stand aside and say, 'I do not support you any more, 1 intend to oppose you and I intend to beat you'. They all did the indecent thing. They all' stuck. In the end, it all came to a head over the Goldstein' preselection. The' honourable' member for Goldstein, having lost the confidence of his local electorate, said 'This is the Liberal Party knifing me' and attacked Mr Howard for not supporting him. That was the rallying point for the others to say, 'This is it. Let's go for it'. There they all are, rewarded on the front bench. If that is political principle, if that is the thing that lead-· ership is made of, if that is the stuff of quality, God help Australia if the Opposition were ,ever to win a national election. God help the country. Absurdly, the Leader of the Opposition said that the position of shadow Treasurer was the most important position he had held in 23 years. What an extraordinary statement from someone who has held senior economic portfolios-industry and commerce, industrial relations and five years as foreign affairs Minister. His period as shadow Treasurer amounted to nothing. Every person in the Australian media understands what a failure he was in that position. This is the person who is afraid of power, the person who, ,when he lost the leadership, and when EmptyHere you always wanted to be Prime Minister, didn't you?' said, 'I don't, know that I ever did'. Do honourable members remember his tell-tale remark, 'I don't know that I ever did', as relief overtook him? He is having a run for' power \Vith the plott,ers, the schemers, the people of no principle, for a run to the wire:",18

Having listened to what the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) said here, I would like to ask him: Will his oampaign director speak in this debate? When his campaign director went to see the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke), did the Treasurer resign? So he should not come inhere ladling out this hypocrisy, because, most people thought that he was on the nose when he arrived in this place. But let me tell the Treasurer that he was on the nose before h- got here. As most other people have been reading at length in this debate, I would like to take a few moments to read. at length from a report by Mr Tom Burns. Does the Treasurer remember Mr Burns?",19

21,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,Order! Honourable members on my left and on my right will come to order.,20
22,Mr BLUNT,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,"Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. I am pleased that you have c9me to my protection, because I think it is important that everybody in this chamber and in the gallery hears what I am about to read. I have a report by Mr Tom Burns into the administration of the New South Wales branch of the Australian Labor Party. Reference has been made to the right wing mafia of the New South Wales organisation before. But let us see what was said about the Treasurer's pre-selection, his endorsement, when he first came into this place. I will not read at length from this document; I will just read some salient points from it. It states: The action of the· New South Wales Executive secured the result by allowing supporters who had joined the Party outside of the expressed Party rules to participate. 27 supporters of Mr Keating who are allowed a vote were admitted into Central Bankstown Branch, yet they not only lived in the Condell Park area but in joining Central Bankstown Branch were outside their State Electorate and their Federal Electorate subdivision. Mr Burns goes Oll-MONICA",20
23,Mr KEATING ,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,This is unbelievable.,20
24,Mr BLUNT,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,The Treasurer knows what this document says. I will. read it to him. Government' members interjectingMONICA,20
25,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,Order! Honourable members on my right will cease interjecting. The Treasurer will cease interjecting.,20
26,Mr BLUNT,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,"Let me remind honourable members opposite of what Mr Burns went on to say. He said: I believe the decisions made by the Executive were slanted to support Mr Keating, and were inconsistent with decisions made in respect of the Chifley preselection contained in the Credentials Committee's report . . . The document goes on like that. Those are the standards of this Treasurer. He stands condemned. As the Leader of the Opposition EmptyHere motion of censure is. a political stunt. It is also true that some Ministers, who are no longer in the chamber, advised agaiI;1st this tactic. l'\'! wonder they are not in the place; they have had enough of it. Members on the back benches of the Government look a bit glum, because the reality is that this motion will expose the Labor Party . . Honourable members opposite have talked about standards. Let us have a look at their standards in Liverpool. What happened there? The ballot boxes were put in the boot of a car and were chased around the suburbs of Sydney. Mr Acting Speaker, have you ever heard anything more amazing? We then had a court challenge. Of course, the same thing happened with Banks, and we are talking about a challenge to Kingsford-Smith. What is happening with Prospect? It goes on and on. In case someone in the Labor party has not read this report, I seek leave to table it. Leave granted.",20
27,Mr BLUNT,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,"I thank the House. The truth of the· matter is that this motion is before the House today because the Government and the Treasurer will do anything possible to avoid debating the real issues. Even people such as Max Walsh have said that this Government's death sentence has been signed. They quote the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia and point out that the Treasurer was not even aware of what the Governor was saying at the weekend. The reality is that the Treasurer has lost control of his portfolio. His performance in here today indicates that he has really lost his grip on parliamentary proceedings. We should be debating the economy in this place today. That is what the Australian people expect us to talk about. They want us to talk about things that concern them, not some figment of the Government'simagination or something that is grossly irrelevant. An article in the Australian Financial Review, Australia's primary economic journal, talks about the economic realities of this country today. It is headed ',A bleak winter forecast for the economy'. It states: First, the annual inHation rate is likely to worsen the June quarter from the 6.9 per cent recorded' in the first quarter . . . What was the Treasurer's forecast? Was it 4.5 per cent? What happened there? Did he lose his grip again? The article continues: Second, the $ i.2 billion April current account deficit is far from the end of Australia's billion plus monthly external shortfalls . . . Third, interest rates are likely to stay high until inflation and the balance of payments begin to improve . . . But the article says that is not likely. It states that business confidence will commence to deteriorate as interest rates' continue to rise and that the impact of the tightening of monetary policy will begin to bite noticeably into economic activity. It talks about' the likely continued instability in the· exchange rate and the impact of the falling Australian dollar on the total aggregate of our foreign debt. So why are we debating this motion? Before Question Time, before there is a chance to put a question to the Treasurer, members of the Government come in here with this sanctimonious, hypocritical motion that is totally irrelevant to the problems that confront the Australian people today, and the Prime Minister wanders around this place pretending to be without sin. Richard Carleton was absolutely right. Many people have forgotten that our Prime Minister had two bites at Mr Hayden. The first time he got 37 votes. Did he ,resign? Not on your nellie. He just went back and started scheming and undermining again. The people in the Australian Labor Party understand exactly the morality of the Prime Minister. They have read the autobiography: they have read his famous quote, 'I have never told a lie to anybody except women about other women '.What a quote! Of course, that in itself is a lie because the length of broken promises from this Prime Minister is legend. Does the Prime Minister consider that a broken promise is a lie? If it is not a lie, is it a betrayal of confidence? Are we going to define exactly what a lie is? The Prime Minister keeps his head buried in his papers. It is all right for the campaign director, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training ( Mr Dawkins), to sit there next to the failed candidate and stroke his beard. What was his position when he went to see the Prime Minister? Will he be .in participating in this debate? Will he put his standards on the line? His standards will be found wanting too, as will his candidate's standards. We have seen the standards he applied when he sought to get into this place and they still apply today. Nothing has improved; in fact, it has got a lot worse. The Prime Minister has a history of broken promises. Let me remind the Prime Minister of the celebrated television interview by EmptyHere out of the Prime Minister's broken promises. It was 20 metres long-22 yards, the length of a cricket pitch. The list was longer than one's arm. Those promises included such classic statements as, 'There will be no new capital gains tax'. This is a most appropriate quote: 'The Government remains committed to'the retention of a 13.5 per cent ceiling on housing intere-t rates'. The Prime Minister should ask'the Treasurer, sitting next to him, what the ceiling is today and what it is likely to be next week. Will it be 16 per cent, or 16.5 per cent? Another broken promise was, 'Labor has pledged not to impose a sales tax or an excise tax on wine'. What happened there? What happened with the wholesale tax system? What happened with lump sum superannuation? Mr Hawke stated, 'Labor will reduce the price of petrol'. What happened to the price of petrol? He stated, 'We pledge to bring home ownership once again within the reach of ordinary Australians'. My goodness! What standards does this Prime Minister have? He is prepared to walk around this country saying anything that is convenient or appropriate at the time, that meets his political priorities at the time, and he does not worry about the consequences. He wanders around knowing that people believe him, that if he makes, a stateme,nt people will have confidence in him, and that most of the statements and promises that he makes will never be kept. If that is not a betrayal of trust and confidence, 1 do not know what is. That pattern existed long before the Prime Minister got into Parliament, it has persisted during the entire term of his Government and it will persist until the people of Aus-. tralia throw him out at the next election. Even the members of the Australian Labor Party know exactly what he is like. Paul Kelly, a noted political commentator around this place, has written at length about what the Labor Party thinks of its Prime Minister of today. Members on the Government benches should listen to this-it is Bill Hayden speaking: Mr Hawke is not always terribly helpful to the Labor Government with some of his impulsive, intemperate comments . . . The Prime Minister said-and I remind the House that we are talking about loyalty and commitment; loyalty and commitment from our current Prime Minister-'As far as I'm concerned, Hayden is dead'. The Prime Minister .claims that he was not involved at all in gathering the numbers for his first or second challenges. Let me tell the House that he was; he knew exactly what was going on, because the Treasurer ( Mr Keating), who knows all about numbers, said this: (Hawke is) a mug. Our candidate (Hawke) is proving to be a clown. He can't count and I don't believe he can win with just New South Wales and Victorian Centre Unity support. This is what the Treasurer said""'about him and obviously his opinion has not changed very much. That is why the Treasurer and the campaign director ran a campaign as late as last year to convince the Prime Minister that it was time to go. That is what it was all about. The Labor Party's opinion of our current Prime Minister is as low as ever. Its members see him as an expedient person to have at the head of the Government, but they treat him with disdain and as a joke. The reality is that the whole Labor Party understands exactly the morality that is exposed by the two people who have spoken in this debate so far. This is what the honourable member for Reid ( Mr Uren) said in 1982: The situation is that Mr Keating has decided to publicly tear down the Labor Leader and is trying to blame other people for his actions. What sort of morality is that? How dare the Prime Minister stand up in this House when his own colleagues are prepared to make statements of that sort about him? This tactic today was a bad one. The Prime Minister should not have embarked upon it and he knows that he should not. It is exposing the inadequacies of his own Government. Let me give one more quotation from a letter to Bill Hayden from the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button). He said: I must say that even some of Bob's closest supporters have doubts about his capacities to lead the party successfully, in that they do not share his own estimate of his ability. What we should be speaking about in this chamber today are matters of economic concern to this country. There should have been a Question Time.",20
28,Mr HAWKE ,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,There will be.,22
29,Mr BLUNT,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,"Go.od. Then let us have a Question .Time where the Prime Minister does not filibuster. Let us have .relevant answers to .the questions. Let us not have a guillotine for the proceedings for the rest of the week because the Prime Minister has used two hours of Parliament's time to debate this superficial motion. Then later today, or perhaps tomorrow or at some other time, he will impose the guillotine on the business of the Parliament. This is being done so that he can indulge himself in a classic political stunt for which there is no support at all throughout his Government. Max Walsh summed up the position very well. Having watched the Treasurer on the Sunday program, he was horrified. I felt quite sorry for the Treasurer because obviously he had lost his grip. I think most people who watched the program were aware that the Treasurer was not quite sure. what to do or to say. That is apparent from the total confusion and conflict that exists in his statements on the economy at the present time. As I said, Max Walsh summed up the position very well. If the Prime Minister has not read it, he should, because it is what this debate is all about today. Writing in the Sydney Morning Herald yesterday, Max Walsh commented on the Treasurer's dilemma and on what the Governor of· the Reserve Bank had said. He said that the Governor had signed the Government's political death sentence and he concluded his remarks with a telling paragraph, namely, that the Government: is on death row, looking out through the bars and enjoying the. Liberals having a public mestic argument. Reality will soon arrive. The Government may be getting some comment, fort from the events of the past week, but I Opposition. say to the Prime Minister: Reality will soon arrive. The Australian people will judge on his performance of the last six years and, when they judge him, the proceedings in House today will be seen as a stunt, as irrelevant. They will vote on his performout. ance, not this debate. . Mr BEAZLEY (Swan-Minister for Deftrump ence and Leader of the House) (3.05)- time Mauled by a dead sheep, the National Party of Australia has struggled manfully-because it has no women members-to produce this problems with that. contribution from the new Leader of the National Party, the honourable member Richmond ( Mr Blunt), the would be Deputy Prime Minister, the replacer of Ian Sinclair as a performer in this Parliament and in country. His contribution, in this context political debate in this' country, has to said to be one of the most trivial performpathetic ances put up by a senior front bencher in censure debate in this place, certainly in the period I' have been here. What an embarpress rassment to his Party. It is an indication a majority in his Party now wish to merge into the Liberal Party, where they can be decently lost, in the hope that somebody will emerge from the Liberal P!I,rty to take stand in the bush. That was pathetic. The Opposition quite reasonably says that· this Parliament is obliged to debate and cuss economic matters and a whole raft of other things. Of course it is. Of course it important to discuss those matters in this place: we do so frequently at Question Time, in reply to matters of public importance raised by the Opposition, and' in numerous debates on legislation that comes before Parliament. Those are not the only matters adjudicated on by this Parliament. This liament also discusses the question of politiTuckey), cal standards in this country and the question of the political capacities of both sides of House to govern this country. There is a of things that are properly before this champresenting ber. The standards by which the Opposition would seek to lead this country festly, front and centre, the responsibility of this Parliament and should be considered exactly this sort of motion. It is nonsense to dosay that this is a political stunt, which has no place in the normal life of this Parliabut that is what one expects from the The Opposition came prepared. That him speech by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Peacock) was obviously an Opposition effort this at a censure motion. He had his notes in front of him; they were detailed and printed Obviously, the Government trumped the Opposition. That is fine. We are happy to the Leader of the Opposition the first up; we will be trumping him in the next 12 months every time he comes to debate a political matter in this place. We have no However, that was a performance using a for written speech. What on earth was the Leader of the Opposition going to say? Given that he read it, what possible motion was he this going to argue with that inctedible mishof mash that he presented in this place? It was, be like the speech that followed it, a totally effort. In fact, every statement made any by the Leader of the Opposition, who has very sensibly retreated from this place, in his conference was confected. There were that many issues contained in that Press conference that have not yet been aired or discussed in this debate. He had to be coached for two days to utter some fairly simple lines, a everyone of which was nonsense, particularly those concerning 'beholden to none' and 'obligated to no one'. This is the biggest disOpposition front bench in history and he says he is not beholden. What an incredible is statement. The Leader of the Opposition has reinvented parliamentary private secretaries to get all the team on board; we will have more to say about that later. He says he is not beholden, yet he has a couple of charthis acters on his front bench, the honourable member for Moore ( Mr Ryan) and the Parhonourable member for O'Connor ( Mr who have yet to display any talent in terms of anything significant in this placethe the policy making elements; not beholden, raft when he cannot fire them for effectively to this House, the media and the public the evidence that their Leader is a are maniliar and somewhat of a twerp. The Leader of the Opposition, as he boasts, in has been in Parliament for 24 years, yet he has to be coached by a couple of media experts in how to conduct himself for 10· minutes at a press conference. What a humiliation. Humiliation was visited upon the Leader of the Opposition by the honourable member for O'Connor and the honourable member for Ryan as they boasted one after the other. They did not just challenge the veracity of his remarks when they said that six weeks ago they took to him a written document. It is not just that humiliation. That is the focus, the centraJ nub, of the deceit of the Leader of the Opposition. That is the core element of the argument. I am not going to dismiss that. That is not all that they did. They took him apart piece by piece as they boasted of their capacity to manipulate the processes. The Leader of the Opposition is obliged and beholden to 'those two shadow. Ministers, who ought to have been dismissed from this place, to hold him here. The Leader of the National Party of Australia, the honourable member for Richmond; ( Mr Blunt), who previously spoke, said that, somehow or other these events to which we· have referred are figments of the imagination. I know that the Opposition has been in a bad dream for the last week, but let me tell those opposite that what they think are figments of imagination I am afraid are all there in black and white in the transcripts around this country. They are no figment. Those words, in politics, are knives and those knives have been dancing across the airwaves for the la-t week. The enormity and frequency of those knives ,that have been dancing across the airwaves sometimes confuse us as to their true significance; there have been so many of them. One of the quotes that the Prime Minister meptioned in his speech would have been enough to have a. discussion in this pJace. But we have had so many. We have had one after another; a total litany of charges. These were not from some bunc,h of nincompoops in Liberal Party branches who slave year after year to put these misl-aders and deceivers into Parliament-not from one of those clods who manage to maintain their membership of the Liberal Party when they are so shabbily treated by the people who lead them. These charges are from people who have served and who, wish to serve on the Liberal Party front bench. Senator Michael Baume has described them as deceivers. Senator Michael Baume was the Parliamentary Secretary during the course of the last Fraser Government. Senator Tony Messner is also running down the lies and deceit accusation track. He was a Minister in the previous Fraser Government and a front bencher for most of the time of the Opposition. The honourable member for Bennelpng ( Mr Howard), of course, in the statements he made out of his agony and hurt also referred to the charges. He had a long and distinguished career in this place. We are not talking here about parliamentary or party pipsqueaks. We are talking about the people who would seek to lead this country and who have on occasions led this country. They have passed judgment on the clutch of clowns who sit now comparing notes on the front bench and who are weeping over the speeches that. W04ld have been made if we had only given them the chance in this place. One of the puzzles in politics in the last couple of weeks is the question of why the Leader of the Opposition has not put the honourable member for Bennelong on the front bench. Why has he not done this? Nobody can actualiy see a sensible reason for this. One can see that the best explanation for the Leader of the Opposition is that it is a pure act of malice. In a sense it would be reasonable, mainly-1 guess-instinct with a pure element of malice in it. He has decided, 'I hate that little fellow and I'm going to leave him out forever'. But that in fact is not why the Leader of the Opposition did that. He is not possessed of that level of malice. The reason the Leader of the Opposition would not appoint John Howard to a position which was easy for him to appoint him to is his weakness. The problem for this country is the weakness of the Leader of the Opposition. He cannot afford to have on the front bench three people who collectively are likely to start to give shape and direction, whether it is a direction he likeS Or not, to the development of Liberal Party policy. He can afford the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) and Senator Stonej, he cannot afford the honourable member for Bennelong. The honourable member for Wentworth, from the performances he has put up here, is obviously politioally naive .. Whatever may be his technical competence, he is not going to make a substantial impact on the politics of this country. He may be an adviser but he is not going to be a tor-, pedo. John Stone is an eccentric. He has become essentially eccentric since he lefCthe DepartParty. ment of the Treasury. He has involved himfifty-first self in some oUhe weirdest areas of politics. But collectively they do have some economic knowledge. If one were. to put the honourbers able member for Bennelong in the middle, out. who has a proven capacity to develop icy-whether one likes those policies or not; we 'do not-one would have a combination which the Leader of the Opposition could not handle. That is one of the points that have been persistently missed in the political commentaries that have come forward. the end he will put Howard on the front bench, because' in the end the Opposition will not be able to overcome that appalling weakness, as an explanation is sought for electorate as to what exactly the Liberal Party stands for and where exactly it is going. In the final analysis members opposite are right about one thing: in two or three months from now the events of the past week or two will be pretty irrelevant. The public will want to know what the Opposition thinks about the economy. The public has not been able to find out from the shadow Treasury spokesman-now the Leader of the Opposihonourable tion-for the past two years. Many people have forgotten the last press conference given by the present Leader of the Opposition when he was shadow Treasurer. Why has that been forgotten? It is because, although it went for two hours down there at the National Press Club, not a memorable thing was said. After two years in tlte job the former shadow Treasurer had not one policy. The Leader of the Opposition, except for purposes of a 10-minute press conference, ineducable. Except for the purposes of coming out and making a statement such as 'I am beholden to no-one', or whatever, the Leader of the Opposition is, in fact, ineduchim able. That will be a problem, as time goes by--:-and it has been evident with the events of the past couple of weeks. It is almost impossible to count the numsays: ber of people to whom the Leader of the I trust Opposition is beholden in the Liberal Party. political In all, there are 40 of them. I know of other instances like this. I worked on a newspaper in India at a time when it was necessary to make everyone a Minister in order to sustain a majority in parliament. In this case it relates to a majority of people in the Liberal· In India, the last position held by the member of a parliament of 100 was Deputy Minister for Silk Worm Production. I have taken a look down the list of memon the Opposition front bench to find where the equivalent is: I guess it is the polParliamentary Private Secretary to Mr Peacopk, one James Porter. In case no-one has noticed, he is under threat. What did Andrew have to say about the honourable EmptyHere members the comments that the honourable In member for Bennelong ( Mr Howard) made about the honourable member for Goldstein ( Mr Macphee), and one can remember the comments made about that preselection a the couple of days ago by the Leader of the Opposition. My advice to the honourable member for Barker is that he should duck: he is in diabolical ,trouble. The leader whom he assisted into office will not help him. As far as the honourable member for Barker is concerned, he is drifting quietly out to sea. Maybe it will not be so quietly. Everyone else has had a bit of a sing-song over the last . couple of weeks and so perhaps when the member for Barker is finally rolled we will hear something from him. Time is running out and so we cannot get around to the honourable member for Ryan or the honourable member for O'Connor in any great detail. They are now, in fact, pathetic figures. The honourable member for O'Connor has become something of the Clint Eastwood of this House. When he stands up in this place now he is no longer serious; he the no longer makes the day-he guys himself. is From now on, every 'film performance' of , thehonouiable member fOr O'Connor will be farce. He has rendered himself a farcical figure. No longer is it necessary to describe as 'Iron Bar Tuckey'. From this point on it should be 'Wilson pales-into-insignificance Tuckey'. This wonderful little letter from 'Wilson pales-into-significance Tuckey' I can recover your confidence as this error of judgment pales into insignificance against the Government's inept conduct of our national economy. He is running behind an issue of the day to defend his silliness. In the end, that is simply all it was: a pathetic silliness on the part of the honourable member. Mr Tuckey...:...c. You· aren't worried about the economy, then?",22
30,Mr BEAZLEY,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,"Since the honourable member for O'Connor tells me that I am not worried about the economy, I can say that I am absolutely certain of one thing: I will get no solutions in relation to it from him. One of the things for which he has been notable in this place, along with the honourable member for Ryan, is a total incapacity in the policy area. As far as ,the former Leader of the Opposition was concerned, in' the end he had to go under to the honourable member for O'Connor. There was no way in conscience that he could give him a decent position. There was no way in conscience that he could appoint him to a serious place-and so in the end he was always going to be an .unhappy man. The honourable member for O'Connor is going'to make his Party unhappy. He has ceased tb be a problem for the Party on this side of the House. He has become' a problem for his own Party. The honourable member is a problem now for his leader. The last act that he could perform in this place, out of decency for his leader, before the National Party takes his seat, would be to' resign and allow the Leader of the Oppositibn to put the honourable member for Bennelong on the front bench. The performance of the honourable member for O'Connor hasbeerl contemptible, and it follows a contemptible week. For that contemptible performan.ce and contemptible week the honourable member is going to be censured.",26
31,Mr FIFE ,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,"Hume-Manager of Opposition' Business) (3.20)-The Leader of the House, the honourable member for Swan ( Mr Beazley), just referred to a particular performance as a contemptible performance. I say to him that this is a contemptible move on the part of the Government to censure the EmptyHere is a waste of time, it is a political ploy and it has fallen flat. The Leader of the House, above everyone else in this chamber on both sides, ought to know something about standards. Throughout his contribution he talked about standards, as indeed did the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer ( Mr Keating). But during the past six years the standards of the Parliament have slowly but surely fallen to a state that has never before existed in Australia. Standards have fallen because the Government does not pay due regard to what should occur in the most important Pl\rliament in Australia. Today, at least two hours of debating time is being absorbed by what can be described only as a political ploy. It has turned out to be a damp squib. During the course of today five Bills will. be. introduced. I am told that a further eight Bills will be introduced later in the week. Thirty-two Bills are to be guillotined for passage in the three sitting days of this week. That is disgraceful. It is made even more so by virtue of the fact that the Government is using time in this way to try to gain some political advantage. It will fail to do so because the Australian people, will judge the Government to be hypocritical. While on the subject of the lowering of standards in the Parliament, I remind people listening and those who will read the debate that during the period 1975-1979, no less than 5,555 questions were asked over 359 sitting days; from 1983 to 1987, under the. present Government, only 3,766 questions were. asked over 320 sitting days. In 1980 the daily average of questions asked was 16, but last year the daily average had fallen to 1l.5. That is an. indication of the cavalier way in which the Government ,treats the Parliament. Let us look at what is proper in terms' of the use of the forms of' the' House. The' motion now' before the House shOuld. not have been moved. A Leader of the Opposition, while responsible to his Party and the community, in technical terms is not responsible to the House' for his actions and the actions of his Party members. The Leader of the House knows that; if he does not, he ought to. The exercise is one in which the numbers must prevail, placing the Opposi-· tion from the start in a no-win situation. It can bring only discredit on this institution. I invite the Leader of the House and other· honourable members to turn to page 424 of House of Representatives Practice, where 'it is stated: A motion in the form of a censure of a Member, such as the Leader of the Opposition, not being a member of the Executive Governinent, is not consistent with the parliamentary convention that the purpose of a vote of censure is to question or bring to account a Minister's responsibility to the House. So even· that text on parliamentary practice makes it patently clear to the Government' that what it is doing here today is nothing. more than a political ploy. It is taking the time of the House, time that should devoted to some of the things that really concern people outside. Members lic are sick to death of their Parliament engaging in this kind of frui,tless activity debate. I pose the question today to the with Leader of the House: What about devoting two hours of debating time today to exarilining the .economy? The Treasurer is in the Minister said: House and is available; I understand that he is going overseas or will be away from the again House next week. Today is the day on which lies .. we should be addressing some of those probIf lems. If we must examine standards in terms telling the truth, let us consider some of things that have been said hy' the Prime Minister in recent times. I noted, when the Prime Minister was speaking, that he used the phrase, 'Someone is not telling the truth'. During his six years as Prime Minister he has repeatedly broken promises and underafter takings that he gave solemnly to the AustraMinister, lian people-not just to his own political Party, but to the Australian people. Let consider what he said about interest rates because, if anything is biting the average Australian family, it is home loan interest rates. Let us examine what he said in regard. On 6 July 1987-not too far baclcbut. he said: Interest rates as you know are falling and will continue to fall and mortgage interest rates are . . . expected to fall before the end of 1987. If honourable members cannot remember what occurred, they should go out and ask Mr and Mrs Average Australian. On 26 January this year, Australia Day, 1989-and cite this in case any honourable member thinks that 6 July 1987 is going back too far-in regard to home loan interest rates truth. the Prime Minister said: They'll go down this year. On 26 January the Prime Minister said that home loan interest rates would go down this year, but we know that the rate is now' 16 per cent and there' is a suggestion that it will soon be 16.5 per cent-a record high for Australia. These are the important questions, not this motion that members opposite have tn-mped up from the gutter somewhere to absorb time and try to gain political points, which they will not do. On 27 January, the up day after Australia Day, the Prime Minister be was asked whether there was' a chance that rates might rise before they fell; he said: . of the pubNo, I don't belieye so. and Let us consider another area that is linked interest rates, . that is,' the home ownership question. In the Australian Labor Party policy speech of 13 November. 1984 the Prime We pledge ourselves to bring hollie ownership once within the reach of ordinary Australian famiwe want to test that comment in terms of integrity and of misleading the Australian of public-and the debate today is about misthe leading; members opposite have talked about standards and integrity-we conclude that this Government has no integrity as far as the economy is concerned and certainly as far as economic matters that affect Australian families are concerned. Just four years that 1984 policy speech by the Prime high interest rate policies have priced young Australians out of their own 'us home. The percentage of people living in their own home is declining, whereas under Liberal governments the percentage always increased. In March 1983 the average that monthly loan repayment w-s about $350, by September last year the average monthly loan repayment had risen to $778 and it is still increasing. In my own G.onstituency people have come to my office as'a last resort to tell me that they are being forced to sell the family home. . Let us consider the question of child p-v­ erty, a quotation about which the Prime I Minister should have in, mind when he accuses the Leader of the Opposition and other members of the Opposition of not telling the",26
32,Mr NA BROWN ,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,What did he say?,27
33,Mr FIFE,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,"I will remind the honourable member and the House what he said. In 1987 the Prime Minister made the following solemn promise, and I quote him verbatim: By \990that is next yearno Australian child will be living in poverty. He said that at the Australian Labor Party election campaign policy launch. No wonder the Tasmanians do not like him. The facts on child poverty make a mockery of the Hawke Government's promise. In December 1987 an estimated 440,000 Australian children remained in poverty. According to the report of the National Inquiry into Homeless Children, at least 20,000 to 25,000 children and young people are still homeless. Mr Acting Speaker, I am sure that you are interested in this. Five per cent of all Australian children,or about 200,000not a small figure-are in families where the chief wage earner is unemployed. That is disgusting. It is disgraceful. Yet the Government has the hide to come into this place and talk about standards and integrity so far as the Opposition is concerned. It is a government without heart and without standards so far as running this institution is concerned. It is certainly without standards in relation to the advice it gives the people. It says what it believes will be suitable for the time, regardless of whether it is able to deliver or whether it believes i.t is right or not. Let us look at the balance of payments. We should be debating that today rather than the internal politics of the Liberal Party-or, indeed, the internal politics of the Labor Party. The people are not concerned about that. They want the national Parliament to address the issues of the day. It is time we addressed those issues. Let us look at what has occurred under the Labor Government in relation to foreign debt. Foreign debt· has more than trebled in six years, climbing from just under $24 billion in 1982 to more than $121 billion today. It continues to rise at the rate of about $1 billion every month. What is the Government doing about that? What advice has it got for the Australian people? What advice has it got for this Parliament about its plans to overcome that serious deficiency? The Government has no advice to offer. It is not even prepared to make the time available to give us an opportunity to question Government members in detail about these matters. The overseas debt has now reached the alarming figure of $7,400 for every man, woman and child in Australia. Mr Acting Speaker, you and every one of us on average owe someone overseas $7,400, and that figure is increasing. Servicing our foreign debt now requires 63c in every dollar of export income. Every time we send our wool or our wheat overseas, for every dollar we earn 63c is required to service the foreign debt, compared with only 26c in every dollar when the Fraser Government left office in March of 1983. These are the matters that ought to be addressed by the national Parliament, not the internal arrangements within a political party. The Prime Minister, the Leader of the House, the Ministers on the front bench and even the younger Ministers on the back bench know that since 1901, when this Parliament first sat, there have been arrangements and campaigning to get one or another person in as the leader of a political party. That has always happened. The Government has engaged today in a lot of hypocrisy at the expense of the real issues that ought to be discussed. Let us go back to one of the many quotes from the Prime Minister's speech that we will all underline and use from time to time between now and the election and during the election campaign. The Prime Minister wanted to know from the Leader of the Opposition what constituted a sackable offence. I want to know from the Prime Minister what he regards as a sackable offence in relation to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs ( Mr Hand). On more than one occasion the Minister for Aborigirial Affairs has misled this Parliament. The Prime Minister has failed time and time again to accept the responsibility of removing that person from office. The Government has engaged in a load of garbage today. It is hypocritical-MONICA",28
34,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,Order! the honourable member's time has expired.,28
35,Mr DAWKINS ,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,"Fremantle-Minister for Employment, Education and Training) (3.35)-If nothing else has become clear in this debate, it is obvious that through the grievous decision that the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia made last week, the Opposition has now lost any firepower its front bench ever had in terms of debate in this place. That is only one of the things they will have the time to contemplate and regret as the weeks and months pass by. This is titled a censure debate. It is a debate which is about the standards of conduct in public office of people opposite, but it might well be called a requiem for the Liberal Party. The leadership problem arises because the Liberal Party has no guts to be interested in anything else; it has no thoughts about anything else. All it has to be concerned about is a cOllstant preoccupation with leadership. Every time it gets interested in leadership its standards of political decency decline and decline and decline. The big question we have to ask ourselves is: what has happened to the Liberal Party? The Liberal Party once at least used to pretend to be interested in public and political decency. Now it is not. There is a very good reason for that. Every now and again Opposition parties find themselves blitzed by governments. It has happened in Britain with the British Labour Party; it has happened in Australia with the Liberal Party. What has happened with this Government is that we have so bedazzled the Opposition with the pace of reform-the greatest transformation in the Australian economy that has ever occurred-that they have not got an answer. In this debate the Opposition talks about the need for its participation in political debates in this House. We have been beseeching'the Opposition to participate in the debates which are going on in the country about our direction and about restructuring, but we do not get anything from those opposite because they have got no ideas. When opposition parties are blitzed, as they have been blitzed on this occasion, the normal thing is to retreat and engage in a period of introspection to try to come up with a few ideas, to get in touch and reach out to the imagination of the Australian people. That is what a decent Opposition. would be doing. What does this Opposition do? It just looks back into the mists of time and calls that the future. Then it occupies us with a few leadership sideshows. This leadership sideshow is not something which is about a new direction for the Liberal Party. It is not that at alL It is about another chapter in the sordid personal jealousy which has existed between the honourable member for Bennelong ( Mr Howard) and the honourable member for Kooyong EmptyHere since .Fraser departed from this Parliament those two men in the Liberal Party have never been able to get on-and never will get on. Neither of them could ever accept the idea that the other would be leader instead of himself. What we are seeing played out here again is just another chapter of envy-the envy of these two creatures. Neither of them is capable or worthy of being Prime Minister but neither of them will allow the other to have a clear run at the objective of being Prime Minister. That issue remains unsettled because, as the former Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong, said on 60 Minutes, he is not giving up; he is just waiting for his next tilt; he is going t9 play out another chapter in the saga of jealousy and envy which has belittled the Liberal Party of Australia and those two politicians for the nearly seven years they have been in Opposition. . This leadership contest has all been an alibi for doing something about policy. The Liberal Party cannot lay a glove on us in, relation to policy. It has no answer to us, so, apart from the leadership exercise, it has looked back to a time when there was a certain security in the. way in which the Liberal Party did things. If we look back to that age, the 1950s and the 1960s, during the Liberal hegemony what do we find? We find that that was the age when internationally Australia was going through an age of lickspittle to the Amel'icans and the Europeans. We had no idea of where our place in the world was, where our place in the region was. Domestically it was an era of lethargy and indolence. The government of the time was content to ride on the luck which came to this country every now and again because of the prosperity of our mining and agricultural industries. Those were times when the Labor Party decided to fashion policies for a contemporary Australia. That is why now, for the first time, in. our history, this Government has been able to give Australia an economy which is equal to our time and circumstance. and an international presence which is second to none in terms of countries of our size and many even larger. That is why the Liberal Party has descended into this squalid and recurring leadership battle: it has no answer to this Government, it has no message for Australian people and it has no vision for Australia and how it might be. The leadership .battle is a camouflage for the fact that the Liberal Party has no ideas, no policies and no hope for Australia. It has been so bitter that it has allowed the normal standards of decency to which it would adhere to decline into the gutter. It is a pity that the Opposition, when looking back to Menzies in a futile search for something to fill up the empty pages its manifesto, did not look to the kind of decency for which he tried to stand in terms of political conduct within this country, kind of decency which many people in the Liberal Party once used to think was imporit. tant to the way people in public life behave. This leadership battle has been so bitter terms of personal rivalry, and so necessa'ry as a camouflage for an absence of policy, and absence of idea, that any conduct' will do so long as it achieves the purpose of one of these two vain men who seek to lead Liberal Party and, God help us, this country. Let us consider the person the Liberal Party has now put up. It has put him up once before. He was elected in lQ83, because the honourable member for Bennelong, the former Treasurer, had been Jailing. But least he had been stoutly trying to defend his policies and those of his Prime Minister. This man, the honourable member for would Kooyong, rode in on the back of the former Treasurer's loyalty to Fraser during the months leading up to the 1983 election. got the easy ride to office on the back of former Treasurer's unpopularity. When the honourable member for Bennelong got his chance in September 1985, they never let up, tive. they never let him have a go, as he tried vainly and hopelessly to resurrect some stance in Liberal policies. They never let They never let go of the idea that Howard had to be cut down and Peacock had to be put there. The honourable member for Kooyong is not so much a leader as a scout.. He goes out in front a few steps to see what is happening but then scurries back to the pack to find out what his instructions are and what he should do next' in terms of where the party should be led. Is it not amazing that in the case of someone who has been here, on his own say-so today, for 23 or 24 years, who has been it Minister for nine years, who has been Leader of the Opposition for something like 2t years, we still do not know what he stands for? Can anyone tell us of a Peacock idea? Can anyone point to a Peacock monument? There is no Peacock monument, despite his having been a Minister for nine . years and despite his having been here for nearly a quarter of a century. The Peacock achievements are nothing but a blank page. of His career has been erected on columns of clay-not that clay which is fired to flinty hardness but rather a clay which remains the damp and pliable and which will inevitably crumble whenever any pressure is applied to Perhaps the most important epitaph for in the honourable member for Kooyong was written by one of his conspirators, the honourable member for Ryan ( Mr Moore). On television on Sunday, when asked, 'What are some of Andrew's failings?' he said, 'I the think it is probably sometimes a lack of attention to detail'. We know all about that. We have had nearly a quarter of a century of a lack of attention to detail and now the Liberal Party is trying to give us a bit more. Interestingly, the honourable member for at Kooyoqg did not mind about the details of others .. He did not mind a few conspirators .putting together a few details about how he cut down his Leader while he was still his deputy. He did not mind about details then, regardless of the dishonour, the disloyHe alty and the deceit that might have been the involved in putting together that detail. So great was his jealously, any conduct would do.if it would achieve his particular objecI suppose that the one for whom we should subspare a particular thought is the poor old up. honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Spender). There he was, away in Panama, trying to observe the cheating and lying of Noriega. He could have observed the same thing here in the Liberal Party. He did not have to go to Panama to witness cheating and lying. He could have found the Noriega of Australian politics, the honourable member for O'Connor ( Mr Tuckey), orchestrating it right here in his backyard. The extraordinary thing as far as the Leader of the Opposition is concerned is why he clings to this Noriega of Australian politics, this self-confessed liar, as the Treasurer so aptly described him. This person who is beholden to no one seems strangely to find the honourable member for O'Connor indispensable. The person who is beholden to no one certainly cannot get by without the honourable member for O'Connor. Yet in doing so, he clings to a man whose credibility is obviously in tatters, someone who has confessed to being a liar, someone who in public office is confessing to be a liar, someone who seeks to be a Minister confessing to be a liar. When we look behind the disgusting bravado and insensitivity of the honourable member for O'Connor we find someone whose long public life-almost as long as that of the Leader of the Opposition-has been punctuated by a scant regard for proper standards. This recent, easy admission about telling downright lies causes us to look back to his earlier conduct. Perhaps this latest admission reveals him as an incorrigible recidivist, that is, someone who has failed to be able td tell the difference between the truth and a lie. Let us go back over his long history. I am not interested in his personal misdemeanours. I am interested only in his conduct in public office, of which there has been a lot. For instance, was it honest for him to falsify his nomination when he contested public office 25 years ago? Was it· honest for him to participate in the restructuring of electricity tariffs in a way which derived a personal benefit for him? Was it honest of him to spend public funds in an unauthorised way? Was it honest of him to use his public office to interfere with a son who was to be a relevant, serious witness in an important trial? Was it honest for him to claim in his Liberal Party nomination for the seat of O'Connor that he had the support of Sir Charles Court when clearly he did not? I am quite sure that the honourable member for O'Connor will say 'That was all honest conduct'. But why should we believe him now? Why should we believe anything he says about the past?",28

44,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,"Order! The Minister's time has expired. MrN. A. BROWN (Menzies) (3.50)-1I have been sitting in this chamber for the last two hours. As the debate has progressed my mind has been turning to see whether 1 can find one word to describe this debate which the Government has dragged us into. The only word that I can think of at the moment, is 'absurd'. It is completely absurd for government, charged with the responsibility the country. of administering this country and its affairs, to take time off from the weighty matters facing this country and descend into the litical gutter to try to score a few points. Despite the, fact that the Government has deliberately embarked upon the course of dragging the Parliament into the political gutter, the, Minister for Employment, Edufind cation and Training ( Mr Dawkins), whom by we have just heard from, surely reached solute rock bottom. I will not reply by difrom recting towards him the personal abuse that I could draw upon. I do not want to contribthat ute towards lowering the standards of this Parliament any more. Let me say this to ment him: He is a Minister sworn to administer department. He is responsible for public matters and public affairs, yet he demeans his office by coming in here, taking his ary, and taking up the time of this Parliahave ment by dragging this debate to those dismal depths to which he just dragged it. I will saying a few other things about this matter but I wanted to make that point at the outset. The Government has dragged this Parliament into a completely absurd situasking ation. The Government has abandoned comment pletely, for two hours, all of the important matters facing this country. It has sought scurry off with some base political issue, the same way as the Minister is now scurryture ing off scared of what he might hear in the remainder of this debate. I will come to those other economic matters in a moment but let me make this point at the outset: for a government to to censure an opposition is absurd in every sense of the word. If honourable members opposite do not already know, I will ,tell purely them that they will win the vote which will be put on this motion and the censure motion tion will be carried. I suppose that that them some sort of satisfaction. They will and that will be a great victory. In the course of doing so, they will have, demeaned the Government, the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) will have demeaned his office, those on the Government side who took part in the debate will have demeaned their office. Looking at this Government's performance over the last five years or so that is probably a fair summary of it. It is a governa ment which continues to demean itself and Let me make an additional point to reinforce that, if it needs an'y reinforcement. The po. honourable member for Hume ( Mr Fife) has already referred to this point. Today, on the blue business sheet, we have the program that awaits us in the Parliament. What do we find as we go down the program? We that another motion will be moved later the Leader of the' House, the Minister for abDefence ( Mr Beazley), the former journalist the newspaper in India, where he learnt his craft. He will move a motion to the effect the House should declare that 32 Bills are urgent Bills, and he will move an allotof time for the Bills. So in half an hour a he will stand up here-Billy, Bunter personified----,get that sanctimonious tone into his voice and say, 'The Parliament is running salout of time. We have 32 urgent Bills that to' be passed. There has to be, a gag and a guillotine. We do not have time to be waste debating these Bills'. But the question that the Australian people will be askingand heaven help the Government, this must be the question people in the gallery are now-is: 'How is it that the Parliadoes not have time to, debate 32 important Bills when it does have time. to go to into the gutter and take two hours debating in something of a base, synthetic, political nafrom its beginning to its end?' When , they ask that question they will realise that the answer is that this Government must have something to hide. It mu-t want to divert attention from something if this is the be trying way it conducts its business. Frankly, in my view, what I have said really disposes of this whole motion. It is political; it has no substance; it is time wasting; and it is an attempt to divert attenfrom far more important things. Let me gives say in addition, 'by way of reply to the win speeches that we have heard from the Gov' ernment today, that we have heard a lot about standards from that great paragon of standards himself-the Prime Minister. We and know a lot about his standards over the years. We have heard a lot about fitness for office, and we know a lot about his fitness for office. We have heard of these lofty high principles that have to be followed. We have heard a lot about who is fit to hold office and who is not, and it has been illustrated.' If the Minister for Defence pays attention for a moment he will hear me give him credit by saying, 'You have picked up this one and that one very cleverly. You have thrown a bit of dirt and a bit of muck'. I suppose that the Minister learnt that also on the newspaper in India. He has. had the satisfaction of throwing a bit of muck. This is something that he should have learnt when, he was with his friends on the newspaper in India. Some of the people who worked at the same time as the Minister for the moral rearmament cause learnt something about. morality that the Minister missed out. Apparently he was out at tea when it was being taught. We can do that too; it is very easy. It is very easy to point the finger at the Minister and at one or two others on the front bench. But that is not the substantive point that we make in this debate. If we are looking at fitness for office,' let us look at some of the geniuses Who line the front bench at the moment. We have to sit here day after day listening to the Minister for Administrative Services ( Mr West). He comes up to the dispatch box like some zombie, unable to articulate what is in his mind. Armed with his script he religiously turns over each page and is completely lost as to what is going on in his Department. He is unable to tell us what is happening about the buying and selling of Government property. He is completely lost without his little script. If is anyone unfit for ministerial office it must surely be him. We have had to sit here for two years listening to the honourable memEmptyHere ister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support. We have had two years of fumbling, red-faced incompetence, twisting, armwringing and not knowing one end of an airport from another. Is that the sort of standard this Government maintains is appropriate? He was an absolutely incompetent person to be in charge of a ministry; someone who, should have been sacked the first time he answered a question in this House. Of course, he was not sacked. He was allowed to go on and we had two more years of red-faced fumbling, bumbling and mumbling until even honourable members on this side cried out to the Prime Minister, 'Give us some relief. Get rid of this moron'. At last he went. Was he fit for ministerial office? Of course he was not. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs ( Mr Himd) is another sanctimonious specimen if ever there was one. His Department is completely out of control. His public servants are resigning. People on independent bodies, for which he is responsible, are unable tb bear the corruption over which he presides any longer. Yet he is still a Minister. He is absolutely incompetent. It is doubly bad in his case because, while he continues with this absolute incompetence, the Aboriginal people for whom he is supposed to be responsible sink further and further into misery, poverty and illness: That is what he presides over. Is he fit for office? Opposition members-No!",31
45,Mr NA BROWN,LEADER OF THE OPPOSITION,"Of course he is not. We have a whole succession of others. But the point I want to make to the Leader of the House is this: It is very easy to make these points. I used to get paid money for doing this in the courts. It is not very clever. I can tell the Minister that there is a lot of raw material to use. If I wanted,to, I could go on through the Prime Minister and the Treasurer ( Mr I<.eating)-the artful dodgers that we heard from before. Frankly it is just too easy. In the last few minutes that I,have I want to tell honourable members opposite about there the things that this Parliament should be talking about instead of the rubbish that we have had over the last two hours. I want to tell them about young people who cannot afford to buy a house; young people who will see over a quarter of their income ripped off them by the interest rates for which this Government is responsible. How about spending two hours debating that matter tomorrow? What is the answer to that? Will the Government spend two hours tomorrow debating interest rates-yes or no? There is no answer. What about inflation? As people's' savings decay in the banks, will we debate the effect of inflation on savings? Will the Government spend two hours tomorrow debating that matter-yes or no? The Leader of the House should wake up. Is the answer yes or no? Apparently the answer is no. What about our debt? When we look at our overseas debt we see that we are becoming like some backwater Central American republic-we are going into bankruptcy. Will the Government spend two hours tomorrow debating that matter-yes or no? Apparently not. Australia will continue to sink further and further into debt. For heaven's sake, the Australian people must wonder why the Parliament cannot find two hours to debate the fact that the country is going bankrupt. The Government should be condemned for its attitude on that matter. What sort of exchange rate are we going to end up with? I think it was the Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Kooyong ( Mr Peacock), who said that our currency did not stand up very well against the Matabele gumble bead. We are getting even worse than that. Will we spend two hours tomorrow debating our exchange rate fall and the effect that that will have on interest rates? Will we have a debate for two hours tomorrow on how our industries are shrivelling and how we cannot afford to trade profitably? Will we have a debate for two hours tomorrow about trade and why we make a loss of $1 billion and more every month? Will we debate that tomorrow for two hours, or perhaps just two hours a month might be enough? But no, we will not. The Government has to seize on the problems which we freely admit we have had in the Liberal Party. But I can tell the Government that those problems will not last. By the next election, the Government will find that the Opposition has policies which will be articulated by the Leader of the Opposition, his colleagues and my colleagues. They are policies which will provide answers to the sorts of problems that are giving great concern to the Australian people. The Government will find that the people will endorse those policies and th-t they will endorse us. We are not afraid of poJitical troubles. Every political party gets into. trouble from time to time. Let me remind the House that the previous speaker, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, this great paragon of principle about how a political party should behave, ran off to the Prime Minister and said, 'Bob, time to go, time to retire; off to the farm'. As if that were not enough of a humiliation, he then had to run off and leak it to the press. These are the great principles and standards that are being held up by the Government. What a lot of balderdash, hypocrisy and absolute rubbish from beginning to end. The Government should be ashamed of itself. I will end on this note: when that day comes and when the Government is defeated I wonder how much satisfaction it will get from looking back to the day when we had this debate. I will tell honourable members the date so that it is ingrained in their memories. They should look back to 23 May 1989 and, from the position of Opposition .that they will then have assumed, say to themselves, 'What a pity we wasted two hours of muckraking, political rubbish and garbage on that date'. I hope that it gives the Government some satisfaction because it will not get anything out of this debate except that satisfaction. Motion (by Mr Beazley) put: That the question be now put.

47,Mr HAWKE ,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Wills-Prime Minister)-I wish to inform honourable members that His Excellency the Governor General yesterday appointed the Hon. Clyde Holding as Minister for the Arts, Tourism' and Territories. Mr Holding has been given responsibility for tourism matters within the portfolio of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories following the reduction in his workload that accompanied the achievement of self-government by the Australian Capital Territory. He has a continuing responsibility for all Australian Territories except the Antarctic Territories. As a matter of courtesy, I inform the House that the Minister for Social Security, Mr Howe, is on sick leave for the remainder of this week. Questions which would normally be addressed to Mr Howe should be directed to the Minister for Community Services and Health, Dr Blewett. ' NA NA EmptyHere Prime Minister. I refer him to his statement on 27 January, just before the Western Australian elections, that home loan interest rates will not rise any further this year. In the light of the rise in mortgage interest rates, does the Prime Minister still stand by his statement: 'I can expect the Australian people to believe that when I say something I tell the truth'?",36
48,Mr HAWKE,HOME LOAN INTEREST RATES,Yes. NA,36
49,Mr MILDREN,NASHI FRUIT,"I direct my question to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. I draw his attention to a recent serious breach of Australia's quarantine regulations that occurred when a shipment of 240, boxes of nashi fruit was imported illegally from New Zealand to Australia. Is the Minister aware of the anxiety such actions cause,not only to growers of disease-free nashi fruit but also, to other primary producers, such as potato 'growers, who have been assured of the security of our quarantine procedures? Will the, Minister undertake to have a thorough investigation of the circumstances and ensure that appropriate action is taken so that a serious threat to the safety of our primary industries will not be repeated?",36
50,Mr KERIN,NASHI FRUIT,"I' thank the honourable member for Ballarat for his question. I will set out the background to this. A consignment of 248 boxes of nashi fruit was imported from New Zealand and presented to Plant Quarantine for inspection on Sunday, 14 May \989. A phyto-sanitary certificate issued by the New Zealand authorities was presented. The importer claimed he had applied for a permit and that one had been granted. The importer quoted the permit application number to the inspector, who' erroneously took the number to be the permit number. The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service has initiated an urgent recall . to retrieve the fruit which has not been sold. Of the 248 boxes imported, 57t boxes have been retrieved and 52t destroyed. The remainiQg 109t boxes have been distributed beyond recall. The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service is still investigating the circumstances under which this import was permitted and will be taking any necessary action. New Zealand authorities have advised that the exporter has been made aware of the seriousness of the matter, and measures are being taken to prevent its recurrence. NA NA",36
51,Mr BLUNT,AUTHORITIES,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. In the light of the Treasurer's statement that cuts imposed on the borrowings of Commonwealth authorities would 'severely curtail the capital programs of many Commonwealth authorities and. . lead to the abandonment of some intrinsically good projects', will the Government privatise these Commonwealth authorities to allow them to achieve an adequate capital base ,and thereby operate competitively in the market-place?",36
52,Mr KEATING,AUTHORITIES,That is apathetic inference to draw from that statement. MrBlunt-Why?,36
53,Mr KEATING,AUTHORITIES,"I will tell the honourable member the answer. It is that policy is directed towards pulling the whole investment phase back, both public and private. The essence of the operation of monetary policy is to withdraw demand and, with it, in part, investment. We could not very well say to the private sector, 'You should diminish your investment plans or decisions' and say to the public sector, 'Go for your life'. We are being consistent in saying to the publio sector, 'You have got to come back too'. It has got nothing to do with who owns what, the market or anything. I would have thought that would have jumped between the lobes, but obviously, it takes a while to get across. NA",36
54,Mr BRUMBY,FUNDING FOR AGED CARE,"I refer the Minister for Housing and Aged Care to an advertisement in today'sMelbourne Age, authorised by the Hospital Employees Federation of Australia, Victoria No. I Branch, which claims, amongst other things, that the Federal Government has cut funding for aged care services, and that at least 83 nursing homes' in Victoria will be forced to close. I ask the Minister: Are these claims accurate? Will any nursing homes be forced to close as' a result of Government reforms to aged care? Further, what is the position of small nursing homes attached to bush nursing hospitals?",37
55,Mr STAPLES,FUNDING FOR AGED CARE,"The quick answer to this question is that we do not close them down; we build them and we rebuild them. I find it difficult to understand the reason for this union's action on this occasion. We wrote to the Australian Council of Trade Unions about this in February and in its response to us on this issue it suggested that there should be a floor of 336 hours. The' Government has certainly produced that floor of 336 hours, and has actually gone above it by adding an extra therapy hour per bed per week. The honourable member for Bendigo has asked me to answer the claim that the Government has cut funding. That' claim is patently untrue. From 1983 to 1988 there has been an increase in' real terms in every area of Government funding of aged care. For hostels, recurrent funding, which this union is particularly concerned. about, has gone up by 88 per cent in real terms. In nursing homes it has gone up by 20 per cent in real terms. This Government now' spends three times what was spent on the home and community care program, or its equivalents, when the Opposition left office. As far as building new nursing homes and putting more money into aged care is concerned, as members of this House will find out in a very short period of time, there will be a lot more nursing homes and hostels in this country, which will benefit their electorates. In addition, over· the next three years this Government has committed an extra $130m for restructuring. More importantly, it is not a direct comparison between the amount of dollars which is important, but how those dollars are now being spent. This Government has instituted a process of aged care reform which will mean that our dollars will be spent far better, far more wisely and far more efficiently than was done by the previous Governm-nt. The advertisement adopted an Opposition tactic, which ,I find quite strange. It adopted one of the old Opposition scare tactics which we see from honourable members opposite regarding aged care policy. The advertisement states: 'Would you put your old dad out in the street?'. I am getting' tired of people who make these sorts of statements and then will not back them up. They will not back them up, and they cannot back them up ,because, under all the reforms which this Government has undertaken concerning aged care, not one person has been thrown out on the street-despite the obscene displays and processions of old people that have been used by members of the Opposition to make their political points. The simple fact of the matter is that no nursing homes will close and no nursing homes have closed. . There are honourable members' in this House who seem to get polit-cal delight out of waging this campaign. The campaign is 'not restricted to the Hospital Employees Federation on this occasion. Thete are a number of honourable members, particularly some 'from northern Victoria-the honourable member for Mallee is one-who go around frying to scare people aoout this issue. 'I will make an offer to those members of t,he Liberal Party and the Nation-l Party in Victoria that, if they cannot read what has been sent to them, they should cofue and talk to me. I will give them a full rundown this week of what. is happening in their area. If they want that information,' they Should come and see me, not go around scaring old people in country areas. ' ,. Let me inform honourable members of some of the facts. There are 82 small nursing homes in Victoria, and about 165 in Australia. These include small nursing homes in bush nursing hospitals. The claim which is being made that all of these will have to close is absolute rubbish. Fifty-eight of those small homes are in Melbourne. Many of them were old homes purchased in the 1960s and 1970s when nursing homes were all the go for making a quick buck. That is not the case any more. Nursing homes, under this Government, provide adequate and proper aged care facilities. Forty of those homes are already being developed or are likely to be approved for redevelopment. That is coming about because this Government is committing about $8m over the next couple of years to assist both private for profit and voluntary care organisations to do so. Twenty-four homes are in rural Victoria. Of these, 14 have been approved or are likely to be approved for expansion. A further four are located with a large hospital or other facility. So we are talking about only a couple that could in any way be portrayed as being at risk. But they will not be at risk under our proposal. If any honourable member has a concern about a small home in his or her electorate, he or she can come and talk to me and be reassured. Any facility which chooses to expand or amalgamate will be assisted by the Government. Any facility, particularly in a country area, which puts forward a proposal which is in the best interests of that community will be assisted to do so. Meanwhile, that floor will persist. That means that 40 per cent of small homes will have far greater resources than they have ever had before. Mr Downer-TQis is a statement now.",37
56,Mr STAPLES,FUNDING FOR AGED CARE,"---'If it is a statement, it is one that is well worthwhile. Mr Tim Fischer-I raise a point of order, Mr Acting Speaker. The Minister has now clearly indicated that he is, in fact, making a statement. You should, therefore, direct that he should do it after Question Time.",38
57,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,FUNDING FOR AGED CARE,The Minister has done nothing of the kind. The honourable member for Farrer will resume his seat.,38
58,Mr STAPLES,FUNDING FOR AGED CARE,"If this is a statement, let me say this: the Government is committed to the care of the aged in this country. If members of the Opposition want tq indulge in scaring old people, if people in this Parliament and in some unions-for their own advantage, with others behind them-want to persist in that, they have got to deal with this Government and the reality of this Government's aged care program. NA",38
59,Mr HAWKE ,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"Wills-Prime Minister)-I have just spoken to the Leader of the OpEmptyHere his indulgence. The Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business, Mr Barry Jones, has to leave for Melbourne without delay. In his absence the Minister for Trade Negotiations, Mr Duffy, will take any questions which would normally be addressed to Mr Barry Jones. NA NA Mrs.SULLIVAN-My question, which is directed to the Prime Minister, relates to the fact that the Government has declared this year the Year of Citizenship. My reason for directing my question to the Prime Minister and not to the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs is that it follows on a question he took from his own side on the same subject a few weeks ago. It relates to a request by pensioner groups that the $35 per head fee to apply for Australian citizenship be waived. Is the Prime Minister aware that certain Government members are making public announ.cements that this fee is to be waived for age pensioners? If so, why is the tvtinister saying that this is not Government policy?",38
60,Mr HAWKE,YEAR OF CITIZENSHIP,The answer to the question is that I am simply not aware that honourable members are making that statement. I therefore have nothing to add to it. I am not aware of their making a statement. There has been no decision taken to that effect. It may well be that the Minister is still looking at this. There has been no decision at this stage. I repeat: I am not aware of honourable members making a statement that a decision has been taken. But in the light of the question from the honourable member for Moncrieff I will have discussions with the Minister to see whether the matter has been advanced any further. . AUSTRALIA POST: CHRISTMAS NA,38
61,Mr WRIGHT,CARDS,I direct my question to the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support. I refer to concerns being expressed by manufacturers of Christmas cards regarding claims that Australia Post is pressing to have the concessional postal rates for· Christmas cards abolished and to place date restrictions on any concessions that are given for the sending of Christmas cards. Is the Minister aware of these concerns? Are there moves to remove these concessions? What is the Government's policy on this issue?,39
62,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,CARDS,The Minister can answer the factual matters but not announce· what Government policy is.,39
63,Mrs KELLY,CARDS,I am aware that there have been some concerns on this issue. I asked Australia Post whether it had any plans to alter the postage on Christmas cards. The information I received is that it had no intention of doing so. I can assure honourable members as the Minister responsible for Australia Post that I would not endorse any such move. NA,39
64,Mr COWAN,FOREIGN INVESTMENT,"I address my question to the Prime Minister. I refer to a reported statement in the media recently from the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy concerning foreign investment within Australia. I ask the Prime Minister whether he intends to take any action to control foreign investment in Australia and, in the particular, with respect to the beef and pastoral industries.",39
65,Mr HAWKE,FOREIGN INVESTMENT,"The position of the Government has been quite clear on this issue. We have the Foreign Investment Review Board as part of our approach on this question. Essentially the position of the Government is that we welcome foreign investment in this country. We regard it as an important part of the economic development of Australia. But we do not have open slather. Therefore we have the Foreign Investment Review Board which is there to enable us to have a body which takes into account national interest considerations. We believe that that is an appropriate way to go. The position of the Government is quite clear in regard to foreign investment generally, May I say to the honourable gentleman, who I know has a sincere interest in these matters, that, as far as his reference to the beef industry is. concerned, there have been some expressions of concern about the degree of investment and about the possibility of vertical integration which could act to the detriment of Australia. Those concerns have been expressed particularly in regard to Japanese investment. I make it quite clear to the honourable gentleman, to this House and to the nation in general that, as far as this Government is concerned, whatever is done about foreign investment in this countrywe do things through the Foreign Investment Review Board-this Government will not be party to discrimination on a national or racial basis against inveStment in this country. We will not be distinguishing and discriminating against any particular country. Mr laD CamerOD--'-You have already done it on real estate.",39
66,Mr HAWKE,FOREIGN INVESTMENT,We have not done it once at all. Mr laD CamerOD-You have. You have done it with the Japanese.,39
67,Mr HAWKE,FOREIGN INVESTMENT,"The lack of intelligence and perspicacity of those opposite on all issues never ceases to amaze me. It is, of course, the case that there have been decisions against Japanese investment. It was not because it was Japanese. The decision that was made by the Treasurer in regard to a proposed hotel development in Sydney was not made against the Japanese; it was against the proposal. If that simple distinction is incapable of being understood by the honourable member for Maranoa on that side of the House, there is very little hope for him. I hope that, under the leadership of the new Leader of the Opposition, obviously while we will not agree on all details of these matter, I can count on his support for a proposition that whatever we do in regard to foreign investment in this. country there will be no discrimination against any particular nation and that the only consideration that can properly be taken into account is the AustraliaQ national interest. We are quite clear on this: Our concepts, our principles, are clear, as is our procedure, which is more than ,can be said for the Opposition. In what was labelled as the bible of the Liberal Party-we are not quite sure what t,he status of the good book is now; the honourable member for Bennelong said it was the bible of the Liberal Party' but there have been soineharsh words said about it-EmptyHere",39
68,Mr HAWKE,FOREIGN INVESTMENT,"The Leader of the Opposition has said that it is still the bible and I am glad to hear that.. In - he bible it says that the Opposition will get rid of the. Foreign Investment Review Board. I say to the honourable member from the National Party who asked the question that if he .has any real concern about. the question of foreign investment, in this country in general or in the beef industry in particular, his concern ought to. be addressed to his coalition partners. As far as the Government .is concerned we will keep the Foreign Investment Review Board because we think it is appropriate that there should be a body with the capacity to look at the national interest. According to the bible of his coalition partners, it says that it will get rid of the Foreign Investment Review Board and that there will be open slather. NA NA",40
69,Mr LA VARCH,INFORMATION PROGRAM,"Is the Minister for Primary Industries. and Energy aware of the problems faced by millions of Australians who live outside the majqr metropolitan areas in gaining infoqnation about Federal, Government services? What is the Government doing to overcome these problems and, in particular, what is the current status of the countrylink community, i,nformation program?",40
70,Mr KERIN,INFORMATION PROGRAM,"Some time ago the Government decided to set up a branch within my Department to look at rural provincial affairs, that is, to look ,at some of the questions that bother the fiv- million people who live in non-metropolitan Australia. This is quite apart from industry policy. Part of that scrutiny was very much thi-. whole question of access to services and information .. That is the reason why we set up the countrylink program. I thank the honoura,ble member for the inter-st he has shown in it by encouragIng the use of this program in his. own electorate. We set the program up in July 1988. It has proved to' be very successful. The program consists, of an 008' telephone service which provides information for the cost of a local call, shopfront displays, travelling to country shows and field days, information stands which are distributed to community groups and the Rural Book, which is now in its second or third printing. It has certainly been very well received in rural Australia. Country Australians have made more than 7,000 calls now to the 008 answer line. Calls are still running at about 80 a day. The answer line operators provide information on services ranging from education entitlements, primary producer assistance, small business programs-the full gamut of Australian Government programs. More than half. a million households in isolated areas have received information' about the answer line. A letterbox drop campaign for a further 500,000 households began last month. The countrylink community information stands have proved particularly popular. Forty-eight stands have now been installed. There are countrylink stands in places as diverse .as Coober Pedy, Khancoban and Katherine. Additionally the Rural Book has been distributed to service qrganisations, country libraries, police stations, schools and individuals throughout Australia. Again it will be reprintedjri order to meet the demand for it. I simply conclude by thanking the honourable gentleman for his question. This whole program is in line with the Government's access and equity objectives. Countrylink continues to provide that very valuable information service to all rural Australians. NA",40
71,Dr HEWSON,INFLATION RATE,What is the Treasurer's estimate of the impact on the rate of inflation of the fall so far this year in the Australian dollar against both the U1).ited States dollar and the trade weighted index?,40
72,Mr KEATING,INFLATION RATE,"These things, of course, are entirely uncertain. When the Australian dollar appreciated, what would otherwise have been a mechanical flow through into lower prices did not materialise. It invariably does not, which means that margins are generally improved, or fattened. Conversely, when the dollar goes the other way some of those margins will mean that,. in order to maintain market share, companies will not pass on higher prices but absorb them against the margins which they have accrued in the past. It is very hard to be wise about inflationary effects of the exchange rate. The United States position is a classic example. The United States had a very large competitive depreciation against the rest of the world but a very muted inflationary effect-which I thought the honourable gentleman might have noticed. . NA NA",40
73,Mr JOHN SCOTT,GRANT,"Is the Minister for Industrial Relations aware of a Worksafe Australia research grant aimed at a study into the effects of radiation exposure on uranium mine workers? Can the Minister advise the House of the aptount of this grant and when we might see the results of the study? Further, can the Minister advise whether this study into radiation exposure will be investigating the lung cancer deaths of the Radium Hill uranium mine workers? EmptyHere honourable member for his question. It is 'one of great importance. The honourable member for Hindmarsh has had a considerable' role to play in caring for the people who have been affected by this issue over the years, and I know of his deep personal commitment in relation to this matter. I aware of the Worksafe Australia research grant, which is funding a study into the effects of radiation exposure on uranium mine workers. The research involves an epidemiolthe ogical study of 2,574 workers who were ployed at the South Australian Radium Hill mine between 1952 and 1961. Worksafe Ausmember tralia is providing some $93,540 over two years to continue research which was cbmI menced in the 1970s by the South Australian Department of Mines and Energy. The study has two major aims. The first is to determine whether uranium mine workbeen ers employed at the mine from 1952 to 1961 are experiencing an increased inCidence of lung cancer as a result of radiation exposure at the mine. The second aim is to determine the nature of any relationship between eXposure to radiation at Radium Hill and the incidence of lung cancer. The principal purpose of this phase of the study is to contact as many workers from the mine as po'!;sible, or their relatives if the workers have died, and to record the data on their smoking and occupational histories together with data on their exposure to radiation, using information collected at the time on the radon levels at the mine. The' study .is particularly significant because it is the only one that has been undertaken on Australian uranium mine workers. Its results can be considered in conjunction with similar studies undertaken overseas. Such studies provide invaluable information to authorities responsible for establishing internationaJ standards for radiation protection. Following· the collection of the information, interpretation of the emerging mortality and morbidity patterns of the miners will be undertaken. A report will be provided by the end of this year. This research is an example of the relevant and practical research into worker occupational health and safety being undertaken under the auspices of Worksafe Australia. NA",41

75,Deus ex machina,CHINA,Government members interjectingMONICA,41
76,Mr SPENDER,CHINA,Let me tell honourable members that it is always nice to be back here and to see these friendly smiling faces. am 'I ask the Prime Minister whether his Governinent will advise the Chinese Government of the wholehearted support of the Australian Government and of this Parliament for aspirations for democratic rule which are emnow so widely expressed in China.,41
77,Mr HAWKE,CHINA,"I thank the honourable for North Sydney for his question. . Let me say that we in the Government-and have rio doubt those in the' Opposition, iricluding the honourable member for North Sydney-are following with very keen inter. est the developments in China. We have receiving regular' reports' on the situation from our Embassy in Beijing, and we will continue to monitor events very closely indeed. I must say that the situation there is confused and the outcome at this stage is unclear. What is certainly clear-and this is in line with the question which has been asked by the honourable member for North Sydney-is that we are witnessing an unprecedented surge of self-expression amongst the Chinese. This pertains not just to students. Clearly this has gone beyond the students who were the initiating factor in this expression of self-interest. As I say, this is unprecedented in its extent now. I hope that the honourable member for North Sydney would agree with me and with the Government that to this point the Chinese Government has acted with restraint. It has not exercised violence and, essentially, there has been an acceptance of the right of the students and others to express their points of view. This has been reflected in the way in which they have been able to stay there, and although from the students' point of view the dialogue has not been entirely satisfactory, nevertheless, the fact is that dialogue rather than violence has characterised' what has happened. It is certainly the Government's very strong hopeand I am sure this hope would be shared by all members of the Opposition, as I do not think there are bipartisan views on thisthat the current crisis can continue to be handled, and finally resolved, without violence and with a respect for fundamental human rights. We have noted with pleasure the assurances that have been' issued by the Chinese authorities when announcing the decision to mobilise troops that punitive action would not be taken against the students and that dialogue would continue .. In this country, and I think with the support of the Opposition, we have consistently supported efforts by the leaders of China in recent years to open and to expand the Chinese economy in order to bring increasing prosperity to the people of China and a more promising future to all the people of that country. On behalf of the Government-and from the indications from the Opposition I think I can say that this is on behalf of the Parliament-we express the hope that the drama now unfolding in Beijing and in other parts of China will continue to be handled by the Chinese authorities without violence and with a continuing respect for fundamental human rights and that their actions will in no way hinder the continuation of China's reform process and the opening of China to the outside world. Mr Downer-Y0';1 are having five bob each way.",41
78,Mr HAWKE,CHINA,"There is no question of having five bob each way, and this miserable fellow opposite should not demean an important question which I think was asked seriously by the honoQrable member for North Sydney. The Chin-e authorities are aware of this position of the Australian Government, and we will continue to make clear the position that I have just put.",42
79,Mr SPENDER ,CHINA,"Do we support democracy? Mr HAWKEThe honourable member talks about democracy. I do not believe that anyone in this c()untry is seriously suggesting that we can tell the Government of China 'introduce democracy'. I do not believe that the Leader of the Opposition, who knows a bit more about foreign affairs than the honourable member ever will, would say to me, 'Send a message to Premier Li Peng and Secretary-General Zhao, ""Introduce democracy"".' At least the Leader of the Opposition knows a bit more about· foreign affairs and the relations between countries than to be so damned stupid as to say that. We will talk here seriously about this matter. The fact is that we support the expressions that are being given in China of the desire of people there, the students and others, to have a greater say in their affairs. I believe that in those expressions they have the support not only of this Government and this Parliament in Australia, but also of men and women of goodwill around the world. We will not tell the Chinese Government how to conduct its affairs, other than to make it clear that we support the moves towards free expression of views by the people of China and that we want it to handle this matter without violence and with a respect for fundamental human rights. This Government will not tell the Government of China, outside those obvious indications of what we believe ought to happen, how otherwise it should 'conduct its affairs or what particular system of government will operate in China. Obviously, in both China and the Soviet Union we are witnessing a breakdown of the centralised economic, political command-type society, which has hitherto characterised those two countries. To the extent that that is happening, it should be a matter of pleasure and satisfaction for all men and women of goodwill around the world. We will not do any good for the people of China or of the Soviet Union if we, or any of the other great democracies of· the world, start to tell them, 'This is how you are going to conduct your affairs'. We· should make it quite clear, as we have done, that we have a commitment to the respect of fundamental human rights. We will continue to make that commitment on our part consistently clear. SPECIAL BR04DCA-TING SERVICE",42
80,Mr ONEIL,CHINA,The Minister for Transport and Communications will be aware that some 65 different nationalities living in the. Spennot cer Gulf region of my electorate of Grey are ·unable to enjoy the services of Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) television. Can the Minister inform .the House when SBS television will be made available to my electorate?,43
81,Mr WILLIS,CHINA,"It is a fact that the Government is giving some consideration to the extension of SBS which, as members of the House are aware, is primarily concentrated in the capital cities and a few regional centres. Many people in Australia, particularly those in areas which have a substantial ethnic concentration, do not have access to SBS television. at present. Obviously, it is desirable to redress that situation. However, resources are involved in doing so. The Government is giving consideration to that and I am very much aware of the fact that the honourable member for Grey is very concerned that his electorate should be one of the first areas to receive any extended SBS service. We will certainly take that representation into account in our considerations. ROYAL AUSTRALIAN NAVY: FLEET NA",43
82,Mr TAYLOR,SUPPORT NEEDS,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Defence. In a recent Four Corners interview, the Minister defended the use of aircraft of the Royal New Zealand Air Force at the Naval Air Station, Nowra, to meet the weekly fleet support needs of the Royal Australian Navy. Will the Minister explain to the House the rationale behind this decision, in particular, whether the Royal Australian Air Force can meet the. commitment? Can the Minister also explain whether special security arrangements for Royal New Zealand Air Force personnel are needed in the light of Prime Minister Lange's recent public statements on the ANZUS alliance?",43
83,Mr BEAZLEY,SUPPORT NEEDS,"The honourable member's question allows me to clear up one or two matters which I had not bothered with in this place. On the second question, I point out that the New Zealanders are allies of Australia. They are allies with us in the ANZUS arrangements and they are allies with us as a result of agreements arrived at in 1944 and by all practical measures of cooperation between our two countries which have been in place since World War I. I do thiQk, therefore, that anything other than the normal types of security arrangements that exist between us when we undertake joint activities will be necessary. should this particular agreement come to fruition. Details of the agreement are yet to be finalised. The point about utilising the New Zealand aircraft, if it comes to that, is that it would be a more efficient use of· resources than were we to fly the FA18s for additional hours, beyond the hours that they need to fly. The fact is that the fleet support role is amply done by FAl8 aircraft, as one would expect given the fact that they are fundamentally naval aircraft and one of the multiplicity of roles for which they have been acquired is maritime strike. Therefore, they do fly and will continue to fly in the fleet support role. However, they are very expensive to operate. Once we have moved beyond the point of time where training is essential for the Air· Force personnel engaged, we move into an area where· it is obviously useful to acquire other forms of assistance. We have utilised Macchi aircraft to do that, and we are looking at utilising civil contractors. The Royal New Zealand Air Force wishes its Sky hawks to perform a number of roles. Were its Skyhawks to come here, they would not be exclusively. engaged in fleet support activities. They would be engaged in a multiplicity of activities with which the New Zealanders task their Skyhawk aircraft. There is at least the potential for substantial savings. I think the operating costs per hour for an FA 18 aircraft would be in the realm of $9,000 to $10,000; for a Skyhawk they are probably nearer $2,000 to $3,000. Clearly a very substantial saving is to be made. Mr Connolly-Why did you sell them?",43
84,Mr BEAZLEY,SUPPORT NEEDS,"The argument is sometimes made that we should have kept them ourselves. Had we done so, we would have had to fly them for those additional roles apart from the fleet support one. It would have been a gigantic waste of money to keep in service an aircraft that we did not need. If we were going to keep those aircraft in service, we would have needed to upgrade them, as the New Zealanders have done. There was a suggestion on a program recently that we had been played for mugs selling those 10 aircraft for $28m to the Royal New Zealand Air Force. I gave an answer to the people who provided that question which the program helpfully then did not provide itself. That $28m was paid for 10 aircraft back in 1984-85. We are now trying to get rid of 40-odd Mirages-an aircraft which is, in many ways, more capable-for about $50m. At this stage, we have been unable to find a buyer. That would seem to cast doubt somewhat on the assumption that $28m for 10 aircraft was a bad deal at the time, in then dollar terms. If it proceeded to completion, the arrangement for utilising New Zealand aircraft will be a useful point of contact between ourselves and the New Zealanders. The New Zealanders will gain useful experience in operating the fleet support role. They will also have opportunities for additional and different flying experiences than those they get in New Zealand as they perform their other functions. Because we have a close and ongoing relationship with New Zealand, it will be yet another useful symbol of the fact that that relationship continues. NA",44
85,Mr GRACE,SRI LANKA,"My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade. In view of the Australian Government's stated support for an end to the violence in Sri Lanka, can the Minister say how the Government views the talks which are reportedly taking place now between the Tamil militants and the Sri Lankan Government?",44
86,Mr DUFFY,SRI LANKA,"The honourable member for Fowler has maintained an interest in this area for a long period. The Australian Government has been concerned about the continuing' violence in Sri Lanka, not only because of the conflict between the Indian peacekeeping force and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in the north and the east of the country, but also because of the campaign of terror and intimidation being waged by the extremist People's Liberation Front in an attempt to overthro,w the Sri Lankan Government. As a government, we welcome the recent commencement of talks between the Liberation Tigers and the Sri Lankan Government. These talks are an internal Sri Lankan matter, although the Government of India and other friends of Sri Lanka are taking a close interest in their outcome. For its part, this Government hopes that the talks will result in genuine negotiations which will lead to a lasting and equitable solution and a return of peace to Sri Lanka. Such an outcome would have the support of all countries with Sri Lanka's interests at heart. In the context of the talks, it is worth noting that the often criticised and at times controversial presence of the Indian peacekeeping force appears to have been instrumental in producing a situation where the Liberation Tigers have decided to turn to negotiation rather than violence. The restoration of peace will also depend very much upon the cessation of violence by the People's Liberation Front, and the Australian Government calls on all parties involved in the violence in Sri Lanka to continue to pursue serious negotiations for an end to the bloodshed in the interests of all Sri Lankans. NA",44
87,Mr BURR,URANIUM MINING,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. In the light of Australia's severe balance of payments problems, will the Government change its uranium mining policy, which allows only three mines to operate in Australia, and allow all economic deposits to be utilised, thereby earning wealth for all Australian citizens?",44
88,Mr HAWKE,URANIUM MINING,"The question from the honourable member for Lyons portrays a significant lack of knowledge of the present market for uranium. The fact is-and he ought to be aware of this-that the existing producers are having considerable difficulty disposing of present production., The assumption underlying the honourable gentleman's question is that there is a great market out there waiting to be filled and, that if we could only dig up more uranium we would be able to sell it all at, an economic price. I repeat: the honourable member should go and talk to the existing producers; he would understand from them the difficulties they are haying in disposing of present production. The question is based upon a lack of knowledge or, to put it more directly, on ignorance. Once the honourable member starts to understand the ppsition he might be able to ask a sensible question. NA",44
89,Mr GORMAN,HMAS NIRIMBA,"My question is directed to the Minister for Defence. Will the building program now being undertaken at HMAS Cerberus have any bearing on the retention of HMAS Nirimba within my electorate of Greenway? Can the Minister assure the personnel, staff and members of the local community that HMAS Nirimba will remain in its present location?",45
90,Mr BEAZLEY,HMAS NIRIMBA,"To the best of my recollection, the building program that is under way at HMAS Cerberus is unrelated to any action regarding the future of HMAS Nirimba. An extensive building program ,is under way, but its purpose is to enhance the capabilities that already exist rather than to institute work to take over activities being carried out elsewhere. The situation of the apprenticeship training school in the honourable member's electorate has been under review. At this stage there are no plans to do anything other than to leave it there. NA",45

If this fruit is contaminated with fire blight disease, what effect will this disease have on our great Australian fruit industry?",45
92,Mr KERIN,NASHI FRUIT,"An official let through this fruit as a result of a mistake and we are trying to track down the fruit. I wish to add an additional point: fire blight is a serious threat to apple and pear trees, but there is no scientific evidence of transmission of the disease on fruit.

Are you aware that in fact, on a trial basis or otherwise, some grabs have already been used by several networks, especially during the past fortnight?",45
100,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,VIDEO GRABS,"My advice is that the Broadcasting of Parliamentary ProceedingsCommittee, prior to making a report to the House, circulated the parties in the House for their opinions. The parties are considering their opinions. When they have replied to the Broadcasting Committee, the Committee will report to the House. At present it is not permissible to use voice and television grabs from the television feed. Voice excerpts may be used but video excerpts may not be used. The use of video excerpts would require a resolution of the House. I expect that after the Broadcasting Committee reports, the House will make a decision on that matter. NA",46

103,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN FLAG,The Minister will be aware that I called the honourable member for Mallee. I am well aware of these two questions to me and I intend to answer them.,46
104,Mr COBB,AUSTRALIAN FLAG,"Subsequent to that question and Madam Speaker's reply to me of 27 September 1988, two flags have been displayed in the chamber in their present temporary position until the architects can determine a permanent position for them. As eight months has now passed since that original decision, I ask you, Mr Acting Speaker, to report on what progress has been made on determining an appropriate permanent position for our national flag. Further, I ask you to use the good offices of your position as Acting Speaker to ensure that the flags are flown in their permanent position by the time Parliament resumes for the Budget sittings. In doing so, will you also give consideration to having two flags erected at the rear of the chamber so that an Australian flag can fly proudly from each of the four corners of the chamber?",46
105,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN FLAG,"The stands for the flags have been aequired, but consideration is still being given to the type of material from which the flags should be made.

107,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,LIVING STANDARDS,"Mr Ronald Edwards)- Mr Acting Speaker has received a letter from the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The adverse impact on living standards of high inflation and high interest rates under the Hawke Government. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their placesMONICA",47
108,Dr HEWSON ,LIVING STANDARDS,"Wentworth) (5.1O)-For the second time in six years the economic mismanagement of the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) has precipitated a major economic crisis in this country. The first crisis occurred in 1985-86 and the second is happening now. We are in the midst of an economic crisis, but one would not know it from the attitude of the Treasurer, his statements, his actions, or his lack of presence in this debate. The House will recall that in 1985-86 the economic crisis took a particular form. Activity collapsed, inflation accelerated, the Australian dollar collapsed, and debt exploded. Everyone of us in the entire Australian community had to pick up the tab for that economic mismanagement in terms of dramatically higher interest rates and a significant cut in our living standards. I put it to honourable members that this Report scenario is presently repeating itself. Yet the Treasurer continu.es to act as if he is totally oblivious of this fact. Today at Question Time I asked him a fundamentally important question, a simple question about the impact on inflation of the devaluation of our currency since the early part of this year. He brushed it off as if it does not matter. That particular issue is fundamentally important to the Treasurer's wage-tax deal with the union movement. How long are the workers of the country going to go on and accept the sort of deal they have got when substantial devaluation-induced price increases flow into the system? Honourable members will recall that back at the time of the Budget the Treasurer identified the balance of payments as our number one economic problem and inflation as our number one economic disease. Honourable members will also know that at the present time both of those economic parameters are wildly off track relative to their Budget time forecasts. The current account deficit looks like coming in somewhere around $17 billion at best, against a Budget time forecast of $9.5 billion. Indeed, - that $9.5 billion is an exaggeration. A number of circumstances have changed that should suggest that' the Treasurer is actually aiming for a lower figure. The terms of trade improved when he did not expect that to be the casethat is one reason why he is technically arguing for a lower figure-and some of the aircraft that were foreshadowed to be imported in the course of this financial year will not be coming. 'So the magnititude of the overrun is much greater than simply the difference between $17 billion and $9.5 billion. Si):nilarly, on the inflation front, the Treasurer predicted that in,flation would fall to 4t per cent by the middle of this year. We know that it is currently running, on his best fudge number,' at' about 7 per cent, having 'adjusted for the treatment of housing costs in the consumer'price index (CPI). More realistically, it is probably running at 8 per cent. There is a major 'economic crisis before this country at this time and the Treasurer shows absolutely no interest in it and no concern about it. He has got the unbelievable arrogance to wander around the world lectUring other co-ntries in the Organisation for, Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and elsewhere about what is wrong with their economic management even though his economic management at home is in a complete mess. Next week he is off on another one of these trips, the second in about a month-he would not be ducking questions or debate-where he is going to visit the OECD. I gather he is going on to Russia. I would not be surprised if again he does not stand up and lecture the major countrieS of the OECD about what is wrong with their economic performance even though by OECD standards we have presently the worse inflation and wage situation and one of the worse debt and balance of payment problems in the OECD. But that will not stop this arrogant, insensitive Treasurer .. One can bet that he will get over there and lecture them. When he goes onto the Soviet Union-I imagine to study the' processes of peres"" troika-I imagine he will also give its people an instruction or two as to how they should \ go about restructuring. That is something he has not undertaken seriously in this country. It is interesting that he brought down a major ,economic statement, the April statement, a few weeks ago, and despite the fact that those, forecasts are so wildly off track and the fact, that there is, a lot mo-e in the pipeline in terms of bad news for the average Australian, ,he gave the economic scenario about one page out of' 18 in that document. The two key problems-the balance of payments, the number one economic problem, and inflation, the number one economic disease-got a line each."" On the balance of payments he said: . With so much of the new equipment needed by . ' business having to be imported, the balance of payments deficit has not narrowed as we expected. Has not narrowed as expected? It is running at nearly 100 per cent above forecast. On inflation, he said: And with demand running too strongly inflation has not fallen as we had hoped. Inflation is ruqning at nearly twice the Budget time forecast. The Treasurer is the master of understatement. He shows no awareness of the magnitude of our current economic circumstances. He also shows no understanding of the nature of these probleIps and how to deal with them. In the limited time. I have tpday, I shall pick up just a couple of statements the Treasurer made in his most recent public performanceQn the Sund,ay program on the National Nine network last weekend. He commented on the essence of his economic strategy. I quote directly from the transcript of that interview when he said: Let me remind you of the national accounts at the end of last year. We had ONE demand running at about 8%, but product growth about 4. So we got 4% coming as imports, we can knock demand 'back a long way before we start affecting the Australian economy. There is the essence of his strategy. Demand has outstripped supply: there has been 8 per cent growth in demand, 4 per cent in supply, the'refore a 2.1 per cent I growth in imports over calendar year 1988. What is his solution to that problem? His solution is to rely solely on monetary policy-to put up interest rates and to keep putting them up until there is some evidence that the Australian economy has turned down. We are being warned constantly by people like the Governor of the R-erve Bank of Australia and others that there is no evidence yet· that the economy has peaked. Looking at the trend of some of the key indicators like employment, imports and a number of others, domestic activity still seems very strong. But the Treasurer is locked into high interest rates. How are these high interest rates going to work? His solution is that they will work because they will bear down on demand and will reduce consumption and investment spending in the private sector. That is the essence of his strategy. He argues that the 8 per cent will gradually come back in line with the 4 per cent, and, as he says, 'We can knock demand back a long way before we start affecting the Australian economy'. .What the Treasurer does not say-and what he does not realise or understand-is that those high interest rates will also affect the supply side of the economy. They are also going to cut back the productive capacity of the economy. It is going to be very interesting to see at what level' demand comes back' and at what rate of growth terms demand comes back more in line with supply. It will not be at the Treasurer's 4 per cent because his high interest rates will in time pull back demand, but they will ultimately also pull back supply. Those two could well come together, as they did in 1985, towards zero growth rather than anywhere near 4 per cent growth. The basic problem in the strategy is that there is a major hole in it. It does not add up. ' We have learned that the· Treasurer has no capacity with arithmetic. Last year he did the inane thing of challenging for the leadership of the Australian Labor Party when he apparently had something like. four votes up his sleeve. His arithmetic on that occasion was about as good as it has been on these economic forecasts. His policy here has got a major hole in it. By relying on interest rates he will pull back both demand and supply. As I said at the start, we are at risk of a repeat of the 1985-86 situation where we have a recession iii the latter part of this year or the early part of next year. While we have had Reaganomics in the United States of America and Rogernomics in New Zealand, we have Belafonte economics in Australia. There is a hole in the Treasurer's economic bucket-'With what shall we fix it, dear Paul,· dear Paul, with what shall we fix it?'. One of the main reasons interest rates are as high as they are is that he is using monetary policy .as the sole instrument to try to control the economy, That strategy is destined to failure because of its inherent weakness in that it pulls back both supply - nd demand. It also has another problem. The high interest rates oyer the course of 1988 pulled up our currency as well. Our currency appreciated throughout 1988. That had the disadvantage of working against both those objectives. It works directly against the inflation objective as housing cost increases are sucked into the CPI, pushing the CPI away from where it otherwise would be. In. time it will work against the balance of payments as well . What is the Treasurer's, solution to the so called nexus between interest rates and the exchange rate? His solution is to talk down the currency. We saw that a couple of months ago. He wanted to break that nexus. His only solution w- to get out there and make statements about how the currency would fall, how he was pleased with the reaction of the financial market, and other things. He has now set the Australian dollar on a very dangerous course. Foreigners are taking him at his word. They have seen the currency fall .. They have taken the opportunity to re-assess their view of the Australian economy and they have been selling our currency down in recent days as a direct reflection of the Treasurer's lack of economic management. I would like to raise another interesting point in relation to the Treasurer's interview. The other main reason why interest rates are so high is the level of our international debt. Under his policy we have to have interest rates near their current level simply to get foreigners to continue to lend about $120 billion or $130 billion a year to this country. The bottom line is that the Treasurer has sent this country broke. In order to get foreigners to sustain that investment in this country he has increased interest rates to these sorts of levels. With a weak currency the probability is that he will raise interest rates a lot higher, even though the currency is falling. The fact is that he will have to put interest rates right up to stop the currency falling. That is related to debt. He has conceded that with debt there is a very significant domestic problem-a deficiency of savings. If we had more savings we could get by with less debt. Yet he consistently rules out any measures to stimulate private sector saving and in the prospective Budget he has consistently reduced public sector savings. He has reduced his prospective Budget surplus by about 50 per cent. In a Channel 9 interview the Treasurer made the following statement: If you reduce those public savings with a tax deduction, you run down savings which you definitely got in your hand, for savings you might get, that is, additional savings one might get. That explains why he had the Prime Minister running around the country, straight after the April statement, trying to get everybody to save rather than spend their tax cuts. According to his own logic, he should not be giving the tax cuts. He put the explicit argument in the Channel Nine interview that the tax cuts will compound his problem. He is reducing· savings in an environment where the current account deficit is getting bigger and where the debt problems are worsening. Again, he is working directly against his principal objective. The bottom line from the point of view of the average Australian is inflation and higher interest rates. We have seen the very cynical exercise of the Government offering tax cuts and wage increases in the second half of this year as an early election strategy. The fact is that even if they give some temporary benefit, a feeling of relief if you like, to the average Australian around 1 July, they will soon be clawed back by higher inflation and higher interest rates. I have been trying to argue today that the Treasurer has not got the economic strategy to deal with our rising debt and our balance of payments and inflation problems. There are a couple of fundamental inconsistencies in his strategy which mean that, having locked himself into higher interest rates, he probably has a long way to go. He will probably have to put interest rates up quite 'a lot and live with more difficult external circumstances than otherwise would have been the case. The average Australian understands this and will not be conned by his bombastic rhetoric. Australians know that their living standards have fallen about $58 a week under this Government. They know that interest rates on home loans have gone up from 13.5 per cent to around 16.5 per cent and promise to go higher. They understand the bottom line of this Treasurer-a totally arrogant, insensitive Treasurer who is quite happy to blame and lecture everyone else but who is without any substantial response to the fundamental economic problems of this country.",47
109,Mr SAUNDERSON ,LIVING STANDARDS,Aston) (5.25)- Mr Deputy Speaker-Opposition members-Where is the Treasurer?,50
110,Mr SAUNDERSON,LIVING STANDARDS,"Having listened to the speech by the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), it is no wonder the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) has not bothered to come into the chamber. It is interesting to note that the honourable member for Wentworth, an avid supporter of the previous Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong ( Mr Howard)-who was supposedly sharpening his knives for a go at the Treasurer-decided that he would dump his loyalty to his Leader on the promise of being shadow Treasurer rather than shadow spokesperson for finance. It is no wonder he is in here trying to make out that he has some ability in this area. This is supposed to be a matter of public importance about the adverse impact on family living standards of high inflation and high interest rates. The shadow Treasurer barely mentioned the word 'family'. More importantly, he never mentioned one thing the Opposition would do if it were in government that would be different from what we are doing in terms of economic management. There are some interesting comments in this week's edition of Australian Business. An article headed 'What the Liberals are planning for business' states:' In economic management, the differences will be more of style than substance. That says it all when talking about an Opposition led by the honourable member for EmptyHere Although Opposition spokesmen say they are happy about policy direction since the 1987 election, claiming that all that was lacking was ,someone to 'sell' those policies, there rem.ain some significant gaps. There is, for example, ,no taxation policy, nor overall economic policy. Both of these large burdens are to be dropped in the lap of new shadow Treasurer John Hewson '. . . The article goes on to say that in terms of reducing demand there are two options. It states: The coalition's solution is plain but unpalatable: a substantial escalation of deflationary measures. The prescription has been promoted by groups such as the Business Council of Australia (BCA), for months. It lacks only political practicality. In March 1988 the Economic Planning Advisory Council examined two possible strategies-effectively the current Government's and the BCA's. The Business Council of Australia's alternative would result in unemployment of almost 15 per cent at the end of this year, not the current 6 per cent. That is the solution being put forward by, the shadow Treasurer-an' economic policy which would dramatically escalate unemployment. One does not have' to be a Rhodes scholar to know what the impact on living standards would be of a dramatic rise in unemployment. We are really hearing the argument that we should go back to the policy of the previous conservative Fraser-Howard Government-a policy that, says that when times are tough, create unemployment; that is how to drop demand. Hundreds of thousands of people are made unemployed. Families and children are put into poverty. That is the Opposition's solution, the solution that is being put by the shadow Treasurer. As announced in April, the G()v-rnment has reached an accord with the trade union, movement regarding a wages-tax policy which will mean that this year the living standards of families will substantially increase. Obviously, some of that increase will offset in7 come forgone over previous years. What is the alternative solution put by the Opposition? The shadow Treasurer said in his speech that there should be no tax reduction, no wages accord. He has stood up today and attacked the Governmerit for the impact our current policies have had on living standards. But the very solution that he puts forward will reduce living standards to a greater degree and create unemployment. That is his solution, which is not a solution ora policy at all. Let me go back to the article in Australian Business which referred to exchange an, rates. The article stated, that a Peacock government would be unlikely to alter the way in which exchange rates, were being managed. It also stated that the Treasurer and the Reserve Bank of Australia-the official financial family-would be allowed to continue. It stated that the Opposition had no tax policy and wholesale tax reform would be unlikely in the first term of a Peacock government. We have already seen signs of that. Within days of the Opposition's new regime, the President of the Liberal Party of Australia was talking about another consumption tax. He said that, the only solution was a consumption tax. Of course, that was denied by the Opposition shadow spokesperson, who said, 'We will not have a consumption tax; not in our first term anyway'. People will be safe in the Li-erals' first term in office. What will we have? A Liberal government will have no tax cuts and no wage increases. It will create unemployment and, some time later, it will introduce a consumption' tax. We are now starting to see a measure of the sort of policy that might be introduced by the Opposition. Is it, any wonder that the public are bemused by the Opposition? Instead of, ,espousing constructive policies so that the community has a real alternative, the Opposition is indulging' in infighting, backstabbing, plotting and scheming. We do not see Opposition spokespersons on Four Corners ,talking about their policies, carving up our policies, putting forward alternatives and talking abput a better life for Australians. We see them talking about how they have lied, cheated' and deceived their own comrades to promote themselves to the front bench. That is all 'they are concerned about. They really do not care whether they stay in opposition, as long as they are on the Opposition front bench. In their minds, that is all that is important. ' The Opposition does not have, any industry development policy. It is no wonder that, the Treasurer does not bother to come in here to respond to Opposition matters of public importance because those matters of public importance are a nonsense. Until members of the Opposition get their act together and have a constructive policy there is no reason for us to respond to their comments in any meaningful way. Let me respond to some of the pointsand there were not too many-made by the on shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth. He talked about the selling down of the dollar as if there were a world reaction to mismanagement by Australia. knows the truth. The current devaluation the dollar is a result of an international to increase the value of the United States dollar. Exchange rates all over the world declining as a result of the appreciation the United States dollar. This Government has demonstrated that it has been able manage the economy while, at the same time, creating growth and, more importantly, ployment. If we· are to have increased living standards the only solution is to have employment. As a result of 30 years of mismanagement by the Opposition-for 30 years it rode the back of our resources and our sheepOpposition Australian industry is incapable of competsort of regime. ing on the world market. It is now going through a reform. That reform has been started by this Government-not by the Opposition, the supposed supporters of the vate sector. The Opposition did not anything to help industry restructure itself. It did not come forward with any developthe ment plans. It did not come forward any constructive ideas as to how Australia could face the turn of the century in a competitive and constructive way. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, basically saw the decline of what was left of manufacpreselections. turing industry. Unemployment reached figtively ures unheard of since the Great Depression of the 1930s. We have spent six years in bringing about industry reform. Even our current accord with the trade ment is based on further improvements in Australian industry-a restructuring of inbe dustryand the trades within industry itselfsuch to bring about competitiveness. That is the Mr Boyle said: only way we will guarantee long term emThey ployment in Australia and long term growth it. in the manufacturing industry. This Governvery ment has created 1.4 million jobs in six years. We have seen a decline in unemployment from in excess of 10 per cent to 6 per cent. At the same time we have seen an increase in the participation rate of the work force. Those are the management figures that must be looked at. The Treasurer commented on the impact our balance of trade figures as a result of importing new equipment and refurbishing our manufacturing industry. That is a factor we have had to face. Refurbishing was not He occurring and industry was operating with of antiquated equipment. It was being promove, tected by conservative governments and had no incentive to reform and modernise itself. are So when the crunch came it was· hard. of Hundreds of thousands of people were put out of work in the last couple of years of to the previous Fraser-Howard Government. Not only were hundreds of thousands of empeople doomed to years of unemployment but also their children's prospects of employfull ment were destroyed. We have managed to turn a lot of that around. But some of those people will never have a proper opportunity. That opportunity was taken away as a result on of the Opposition's mismanagement. The now proposes to return to that I wish to quote from an article in the Australian Financial Review of 9 May in priwhich the President of the Australian Small EmptyHere Boyle, took credit for the coup that dumped honourable member for Goldstein ( Mr with Macphee), the honourable member for Higgins ( Mr Shipton) and the honourable more member for Bruce ( Mr Aldred) from their preselection. He said that he would not rule we out standing himself at the next round of He said that he had been acinvolved in ensuring that these three candidates lost their seats. He said that he was extremely satisfied with the result. He said that the 'at risk' category of sitting union move- . Liberal MPs were: Those . . . who have been publicly seen to more interested in social issues than the areas as industrial relations and economics. are the ones who are going to have to watch Our view at the ASBA is that social justice is all well as long as you can afford it. The view .of some people in the conservative parties is that we can only afford a social conscience and policies which relate to social issues if we can pay for them. So those people are not concerned about unemploy-'. ment. If they have an economic mechanism they use it. They do not worry about the consequences; they do not worry about whether it will create unemployment; they do not worry about the impact on the children of those families; they just use that economic weapon because it is available to them. This Government has responsibly attempted to use the economic measures available to it. Some of them are unpalatable. Some things we would rather not do but, in the economic circumstances, we have chosen what we believe is the best course to achieve the overall purpose of altering growth and reducing demand so that our economy has a chance to recover. At the same time, we are prepared to enter into an accord to prevent a wages blow-out which will almost certainly occur without some' form of agreement on tax offsets. In doing so we are maintaining employment. All our policies are 'geared around those aims which will ensl.lre that we avoid a further bout of high unemployment and poverty-matters about which the Opposition has no concern.",50
111,Mr COBB ,LIVING STANDARDS,"Parkes) (S.40)-It is amazing when Australia is in a desperate situation economically that the Government calls on a major debate today, a mud-slinging debate, in order to score some cheap political points. When it comes to what should be the main debate, the matter of public importance put up by the Opposition, namely, the adverse impact on living standards of high inflation and high interest rates under the Hawke Government, the Government cannot be bothered even to have a Minister reply to the debate. We have just had the spectacle of the honourable member for Aston ( Mr Saunderson), a backbencher, leading the debate. The Treasurer ( Mr Keating) has again squibbed facing up to the Opposition shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), a man who has the highest credibility in this area in Australia today. It is no wonder that the Treasurer has squibbed it yet again, but the press is starting to pick up this sort of thing. I will admit that the Treasurer has been quite clever in recent years in giving the impression that he knows something of economics, but when he is put on the spot by someone who really does know something about economics he walks away from the debate. I noticed that he was in the chamber earlier today for the mudslinging censure motion. He used his usual low language and called members of the Opposition 'lice' and that type of thing. But when a serious matter comes up for debate, such as the state of the economy, for which he is directly responsible, where is he? He is not here, he has squibbed it again. I think it is an indictment of this Government that its Minister turn up for the mud-slinging debate but not for the substantive matter of public importance. I hope the Australian people will take note of that at the next election. The message is starting to get through to the Australian people that the Australian Labor Party (ALP) is no longer a party for the worker or the average man in the street, and it is certainly not a party for middle class Australia; it is virtually a party only for ALP cronies and big business. It, has attempted to change every traditional value this country has had since it first got the treasury bench some time back in the early 1970s and from 1983 onwards and has spent money as though it is going out of fashion. When we think about it, it has pushed taxes to levels that have never before been dreamed of. We have seen increases in sales taxes, increases in income taxes and increases in excise taxes by the order of 100 per cent in the five long years this Government has been in office. Mr Nehl-They're bleeding Australia dry.",53
112,Mr COBB,LIVING STANDARDS,"As the honourable member for Cowper says, they are bleeding Australia .' dry. As well, this Government has introduced new taxes. It has brought in a fringe benefits tax, a superannuation tax, a capital gains tax-the' list goes on and on. This Government taxes just about everything that moves and everything that does not move. In fact, the present Government makes Gough Whitlam and Jim Cairns look like a responsible duo by comparison. The Government's policy seems to be one of high spending and high taxing on non-productive things. In the period it has been in office this has led, not surprisingly, to the unholy economic mess that we are experiencing and for which we are suffering in Australia today. We have a massive foreign debt, high inflation, high interest rates, high taxes, staggeringly high youth unemployment and low productivity which are leading to depressed living standards. Mr Braithwaite-And a lousy trade balance.",53
113,Mr COBB,LIVING STANDARDS,"And a lousy trade balance, as the honourable member for Dawson says. The rest of the trading world is passing Australia by. Many of the economic indicators show that small countries such as Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and even Malaysia are catching up and passing Australia. It makes one wonder where we will be if this Government is returned for another term. Let us look at some of those factors in a little detail. Our overseas debt is nothing more than a time bomb ticking away. When the present Treasurer took over, the overseas debt in gross figures was of the order of $25 billion to $30 billion, which is not a figure to be proud of. Today it is in excess of $120 billion and, if we take into account the falling dollar of the last few days it is probably over $130 billion. Net overseas debt has more than quadrupled to in excess of $95 billion and will soon break the four-minute mile and go over $100 billion. The current account deficit is adding $1.5 billion to our overseas debt every month. It makes one wonder how much longer we Cl,),,!l go on in this state. Dr Harry Edwards-It is $50m a day.",54
114,Mr COBB,LIVING STANDARDS,"As the honourable member for Berowra says, $50m a day. When the figures are brought down every month the Treasurer tries to look disinterested. He says, 'It is nothing to worry about, troops. It is on track; it is on target'. For heaven's sake, if it is on target it makes one wonder what the Treasurer is aiming at. The country is in a disgraceful state. It is interesting to note that the Treasurer's predictions have been reduced to a laughable state. In fact; he will not even make a prediction now. Since saying that the current account deficit for the 12 months would be $9.5 billion, only 10 months has passed and it is well over $14 billion now. According to the experts, the figure will be worse next year. We are sending more out of Australia in interest payments than we are spending individually on health, education or defence, yet the Government is putting in place no incentive whatsoever to save. When that sort of policy was put to the Treasurer he dismissed it out of hand in his usual arrogant fashion. I say to the Treasurer and to the Government that the position we - re in economically is tota:tly unsustainable. Many of our major economic indicators show that we are now in the same' league as Mexico, Brazil and Argentina. Some very interesting consequences flow from this. One was mentioned in debate earlier today, namely, foreign in-' vestment. The last figures I have for the year 1987-88 show that we had $17 billion to $18 billion net in foreign investment flowing into this country. There is nothing wrong with foreign investment coming into the country; in fact, we welcome it. But the point is that it is coming in in such magnitude because of the state of the economy. This Government, this Treasurer, have set up conditions by which overseas countries can come in and invest at an advantage over Australian citizens. I think that that is a sorry state indeed. On top of that, in recent days the Australian dollar has been in free fall. Not long ago it was 88c against the United States dollar and it has dropped to 73c or 74c. The experts are predicting that it will fall further yet. It makes one wonder where it will end up. Australia's inflation, relative to that of our trading partners, is running at the worse it has been for many a long year. In fact, in the five years of this Government, on average, compared with our trading partners, it has been the worse ever in the history of this country. At the moment it is stuck at 7 per cent; despite the Treasurer's prediction that it would be 4+ per cent. If he had not fiddled with the consumer price index, it would be about double his prediction. As I said earlier about his current account deficit prediction, he is too terrified to make any more predictions because they will be laughed at and treated with mirth and derision. It seems that the Government is incapable of doing anything wi-h the economy. Interest rates, which are crippling Australians today, particularly aspiring home owners, are running at record levels of 16 per cent to 16+ per cent. Young people have no hope whatsoever of buying a home in a capital city. In fact, even if they· inherit money from their parents or some relative who dies, both still have to go out· to work to sustain the interest payments that are due. It is a tragic and narrow government policy to use the sole instrument of forcing interest rates higher and higher instead of making the hard decisions of cutting Federal Government expenditure. This Treasurer is the highest taxing Treasurer in Australia's history. Of the tax cuts that he will be offering from 1 July, 40 per cent will be clawed back by July next year. Australia is in a dreadful state. We need a Treasurer and a government with a stomach to make the hard decisions now that will stop the downward spiral in the standard ofliving in this country and restore Australia's economy to the buoyant dynamo it was before the present mob of socialists got access to the treasury",54
115,Mrs HARVEY ,LIVING STANDARDS,"Hawker) (5.50)-1t ill becomes the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), the honourable member for Parkes ( Mr Cobb) or any other member of the Opposition to come in here today and criticise this Government's Treasurer ( Mr Keating) on its economic policies, parti9ularly on the matters of inflation, interest rates and living standards. We are now two years into this parliamentary term, with probably less than a year to go to the next election, and we have not yet seen from this Opposition any tax policy, social security policy, retirement incomes policy or family assistance policy. For how mJ,lch longer can this go op? I understand that one has to be, to a certain extent, charitable towards oppositions; one cannot expect them from the beginning to come up with viable alternative policies. But we have been waiting for two years. Mr Connolly-On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: The honourable member said that the Opposition had not put out a retirement incomes policy. I shall be only too happy - o provide her with a copy. It was released late last year.",55
116,Mrs HARVEY,LIVING STANDARDS,"I understand that the Opposition has put out a kind of preliminary retirement incomes policy-Mr Connolly-As the Government has not got one, I can assure you we are well ahead.",55
117,Mrs HARVEY,LIVING STANDARDS,"But that policy does not deal with important things such as tax rates; for example-the nuts and bolts, the figures that count when it comes to a retirement incomes policy. As I said, for how much longer can this go .on? It particularly ill becomes the Opposition, after the events of the last two weeks, to criticise the Government, for in that time members of the Opposition have exercised and displayed a particularly vulgar and tacky kind of political assassination and public vindictiveness. Today they have raised this re-re-recycled matter of public importance, which has come up on a number of occasions in this or some other form. Members of the Opposition ask why the Treasurer is not here to answer on this matter. The answer is that he has better things to do than come in here and respond to the debate on this matter of public imbench. portance, which has come up on many occasions in this House. As I said, the Opposition has no policies. All it has is a booklet-a '.bible' as Opposition members call it-its Future Directions document. It consists of a series of platitudes and cliches, nostalgia and sentimentality about Australian families and the Australian way of life. It includes absolutely no concrete policies, no facts and figures. We are the party that is doing that. We are in government and we are delivering. The Opposition can provide no alternative policies to those they are criticising in this debate. Occasionally we get some inkling from a statement that the Opposition issues of what its policies might be. The honourable member for Parkes was in here a moment ago talking about taxes and how this Government is supposed to have the highest taxing policy of any government of this country. I have here a press release dated 16 May from the Treasurer which says that the shadow finance Minister at the time, the honourable member for Wentworth, made it clear that he opposed the 1 July tax cuts. How can members of the Opposition complain about high taxes and at the same time oppose tax cuts? The shadow finance Minister made it clear that he believed that, rather than implementing the 1 July tax cuts, the Government should have kept the money and added it to the Budget surplus. The honourable member for Wentworth does not think there should be tax cuts on 1 July. I hope the people out there are listening. The shadow Treasurer does not want tax cuts. At the same time we have the honourable member for Parkes and other honourable members getting up and saying that this is a high taxing government. Next I shall refer to living standards. I wish to refer to an article in the Australian Financial Review of 26 April. It was written by Michael Stutchbury and was headed 'Stop Whingeing. Australia's living standards may never be higher'. He said, among other things, that there are claims that Australian's material living standards have fallen over the 1980s. He said there are enough people, ranging from the socilil welfare lobby to the old left of the Federal Opposition· and to the New Right, who have a vested interest in promoting this line to make it the new conventional wisdom. In fact, he went on to say, the economy has produced 20 per cent more output per head of population in the past decade and per capita household disposable income-that is, after tax-has increased by about 11 per cent in real terms over the same period, on his figuring. He suggested that working middle class families have not suffered from lower living standards, as the Opposition claims. Certainly those standards have not been lowered and at worse, he said, they have probably risen a little. He said that, while wage restraint means that single income families have struggled, it has also pulled probably hundreds of thousands of Australians out of the true po'verty of unemployment and provided many more families with more than one breadwinner. He went on to. talk about the symbols of affluence, which have continued to proliferate. For example, nearly 50 per cent of Australian households own or rent video cassette recorders; in 1982 only 13 per cent of households had those appliances. According to another survey, the number of Australians owning a personal computer rose by nearly 90 per cent in the three years to 1988. Ac-' cording to other market research the proportion of Australian households with microwave ovens has risen from 5 per cent in 1982 to over 43 per cent in 1988 and the penetration of clothes driers into households has also risen, as has the number of households with dishwashers and other expensive appliances. Stutchbury went on to talk about the' number of cars, and so on. This would not indicate that Australians living standards have fallen across the board in the last six years. We acknowledge that there are particular groups in our community that have been passed by by the increase in family income. These are, in particular, one income families and families on some sort of pension or benefit. The April economic statement gave real increases-wage and tax cut increasesto low income families, gave an advance on the pension indexation rise to pensioners and increased the amount of income a pensioner can earn before he or she starts to pay tax. It gave real benefit/> in dollars and cents, not just words, to low income families, including pensioner groups. To get back to the wording of the matter of public importance, maybe I could look at a few statistics. The Opposition's statement mentions inflation. When the honourable member for Wentworth, who opened the debate, was senior adviser to the honourable member for Bennelong ( Mr Howard), as Treasurer, the rate of inflation. was 11 per cent; it is now 7 per cent. When the honourable member for Wentworth was senior adviser to the then Treasurer, as far as interest rates were concerned five-year government bonds peaked at 16.4 per cent; they are now at 14.25 per cent. If one could get a home loan then, one may have got it at 13.5 per cent as the official rate on the main loan but one would have had to combine that with much more expensive personal loans in some kind of cocktail loan arrangement. And as far as living standards are concerned, the most important thing that we on this side of the House have to boast about is that since we have come to power we have created 1.4 million jobs in this country, compared with a comparatively minuscule number of jobs:I think it was a one per cent rise in the number of jobs-during the years when the' present Opposition was in government. What more can a government do for a family than provide a real full time income for that family that it did not have before? . As I said at the beginning, the raising of this matter of public importance is simply an empty exercise. While the Opposition seeks to criticise the Government, after two years in opposition it has yet to come up with any serious alternative economic policy.",55

Secondly, we anticipate entertaining the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea at lunch tomorrow. That will require a bit of fast footwork between ourselves and the Opposition to make sure that we are not hauled in here for votes during the course of that discussion, but that should be possible. In anticipation of those developments I move this motion and thank the Opposition for facilitating it.",57
122,Mr FIFE ,HOUR OF MEETING AND QUESTION,"Hume-Manager of Opposition Business) (6.01) ---.:.The Opposition will not oppose the motion before the House. There are special circumstances tomorrow. The Government has an enormous amount of business to be transacted. I made some comments earlier in another debate that a lot of time was wasted today-some two hourson a motion that was brought forward by the Government for purely political purposes. It fell flat. Notwithstanding that, we on this side' of the House want to demonstrate our willingness to facilitate the business of Parliament and deal with those things that are important to the Australian public, so we will not oppose this motion. However, I point out that something will occur tomorrow during the luncheon period, if this motion is carried-and of course it will be because it will be supported by both sides of the House-that has not occurred before that I can recall. The Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea will be in this building, a luncheon will be tendered to him and while he is here Parliament will be sitting. It is, to say the very least, unfortunate that the Government could not have arranged its business better. The interests of Australia and Australia's relationship with Papua New Orders Guinea would have been better. served if we did not have to sit at lunchtime. tomorrow, and the two hours that were wasted on the censure motion to delve into the domestic affairs of the Liberal Party had been put aside. But, as I have indicated, we will facilitate this motion. We will not vote against it. However, again I appeal to the Leader of the House ( Mr Beazley) to take some action to lift the standard of this Parliament. Month after month, and certainly during the last two to 2t years, the Government has disregarded the importance of the Parliament. Legislation has been rammed through Parliament-I will have more to say about that on 'the next motion-in a disgraceful way, and members. are not given the opportunity to. fully examine and debate the issues before the House. Because of the special circumstances of tomorrow we will not oppose this motion, but I indicate to the Leader of the House that I hope the Government will cooperate with the Opposition in ensuring that where divisions are required procedural motions could be moved to allow those divisions to be held at a later hour rather than during the luncheon break. On behalf of the Opposition I give an unqualified assurance that there will be no quorums called in that period. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA .

Mr LIONEL BOWIj:N (Kingsford Smith-Attorney-General) (6.08)--,--I move: That the amendments be agreed to. Following the introduction of the Australian Securities Commission Bill in the Senate on 14 October the Government agreed to a motion of the Parliament on 17 October referring the Bills to a joint select committee of the Parliament for consideration. The Government supported that motion to enable further public consultation and detailed parliamentary review. The Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation reported to Parliament on 13 April. In its response, which the Government tabled in Parliament on 5 May, the Government indicated its acceptance of the majority of the recommendations and appreciation of the importance of that of the Committee as a forum in the business of the professional community and the investing public. The Bills were debated by the Senate on 9, 10 and 11 May. In the course of that debate the, Senate adopted most of the Committee's recommendations as amendments to the Bill. The Bill has now been returned to this House with the amendits ments made by the Senate. The Government accepts all the amendments made by the Senate and I will give a brief outline of them. . I note that the Close Corporations Bill was not amended in the Senate and the Opposition did not oppose it in the Senate. Virtually all the Senate amendments to the Australian Securities Commission Bill result from the Government's acceptance recommendations made by the Joint Select Committee. Amendments such as the amendment providing for the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) chairperson to be an· ex officio member of the advisory committee qualify amendments proposed by the Joint Select Committee. One of the most significant group of amendments, namely, amendments (2), (4) to (8) and (39), will establish a Parliamendeal tary Joint Select Committee on Corporations and Securities to examine the activities the ASC and related bodies on the of companies and securities laws. The Parliamentary Committee will have a wide-ranging power to review the operation of the legisabout lation . and to oversight the working of ASC, the Corporations and Securities Panel and the Companies Auditors and Liquidators Disciplinary Board. Amendment (1) clarifies the functions of the advisory committee enable it to provide advice to the Minister about matters relating to corporations as well as to securities and futures markets. Amendments (9) aQd (10) give the ASC power to advise the Minister on any matter relating to national scheme laws and on ters connected with companies, close corporations and the securities and futures industries. However, the ASC has. not been given the function so to advise to ensure that it will not be obliged to divert resources from more essential investigations, administrative and enforcement tasks. This reflects the portance which the Government attaches the role of the statutory advisory committee in this area. By virtue of amendments (23) to (27) the ASC chairperson will also be ex-officio member of the advisory committee. Amendment (3) will ensure that the ASC, in performing its functions and in exercising powers, is to strive to maintain, facilitate and improve the performance of companies as well as the performance of the securities and futures markets in the interest of commercial certainty, reducing business costs and the efficiency and development of the economy. Amendments (18) to (21) give effect to a recommendation of the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation concerning the desirability of the ASC operating as a collegiate body rather than as a body of the dominated by its chairperson. Amendments (28) to (35) will ensure that the Corporations and Securities Panel will have a minimum membership ot five composed of both part-time and full time members. The Government accepts that the president of the Panel should be appointed full time to facilitate the swift determination of declarations of unacceptable conduct .during a takeover. Amend-ents (36) to (38) .with Panel hearings. Th-. Panel will have a discretion to hold a publh;: or private of hearing where a national scheme law reoperation quires it to hold a hearing. Amendment (12) requires the ASC to. provide the Minister with interim reports serious contraventions. Amendment the (13) empowers the ASC to give a copy of interim and final reports of investigations to . relevant law enforcement agencies. Amendment (14) empowers the ASC to commence to a representative action in the name of a' company without the consent of the company's directors. By virtue of amendments (15) to (17) information obtained as a direct or indirect consequence of the production of books to the ASC will be admissible in matevidence against a person in criminal proceedings. There are two miscellaneous ameridments which I will mention. Amendment (11) re. quires ministerial directions to the ASC to be tabled in Parliament within 15 sitting days of their publication in the Commonwealth of imAustralia Gazette. Amendment (22) sets out to the criteria which the ASC will need to follow when preparing its annual report.",57
123,Mr MOORE ,AUSTRALIAN SECURITIES,"Ryan) (6. 15)-Amendan ments moved by the Government in the Senate as they relate to these amendments add to the sorry saga of the companies law in Australia. Another 57 amendments have come into the House as a consequence of the Edwards Committee. Mr Deputy Chairman, you were Chairman of the Committee and there were two members of the Liberal Party of Australia on it. I think the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation did a very good job. It showed that at least it was an independent group that went out and had a look around Australia. It was not run by the Attorney-General's Department or the 36 faceless men, one of whom ratted on the Committee in the end. At last count we came up with 280 amendments. We now have a further 57 amendments. As a consequence of this, it is nd wonder that those in the legal community-the Attorney General ( Mr Lionel Bowen) being one of them-are saying, 'Look, what's going on with company law; we don't know; we can't get a copy of the proposals because' you wouldn't print them. We had to send someone down to pencil in the new amendments'. The Government saved $40,000 but it did not worry about the $40m that it spent on the referendum.",62
124,Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,AUSTRALIAN SECURITIES,"We didn't spend $40m, did we?",63
125,Mr MOORE,AUSTRALIAN SECURITIES,That is what the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith said. That is what the papers said. They said that the Government spent $40m on the' referendum.,63
126,Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,AUSTRALIAN SECURITIES,It was anextravagance.,63
127,Mr MOORE,AUSTRALIAN SECURITIES,It was an extravagance and a great failure too in the situation.,63
128,Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,AUSTRALIAN SECURITIES,Only because of Mr Howard.,63
129,Mr MOORE,AUSTRALIAN SECURITIES,The Government bombed it out. The Government did not know what was going on. Mr Kerin-The Nationals opposed the referendum-MONICA,63
130,Mr MOORE,AUSTRALIAN SECURITIES,"Well, that is all right. The Government put up constitutional referendums to get them knocked over. The Government does not know what it is doing. That is its trouble. The trouble was that the Government spent $40m on a referendum but would not spend $40,000 on reprinting the law. All the Attorney-General's col-, leagues are a bit upset about it. They want to know what is going on. It had only a very limited appeal. The Committee members had a couple of days here and there and they came up with a number of amendments, some of which the Government accepted and some which it did not. We should address two amendments which I think are important. The first is the tracing of beneficial ownership. The Committee came up with a recommendation. The Government turned it around. It had to turn it around. In the end, after much brow-beating, late at night the, Government caved in. But in the process I received from Lloyds Corporate Advisory Services a letter which says: As the Edwards Committee appears to have accepted, the enforcement of these provisions in private hands is a most significant protection against the warehousing of large and small shareholdings. The proposed Govern-ent position: reverses the unanimous view of the Edwards Committee; One wonders what is going on. The letter goes on: does not address the practical issues involved; means that 'warehousing' of shares will become effectively undetectable; and constitutes adangerous emasculation of the important protections conferred by the substantial shareholding provisions of the Companies Code and the Takeover Code. . I quote from these gentlemen in this particular company because they are very prominent in this area. The Government has repressed that and dillydallied. Eventually, as with the other 280 amendments, the Government accepted them in the middle of the night. It is about time the Government caught up with us. The second point which we pressed in the Senate was the declarations of unacceptable conduct. Part of the deal by the old Australian Labor Party dealers was with the Business Council of Australia, the 36 faceless men. The Government promised it the Corporations and Securities Panel because it wanted to get in on the act.'",63
131,Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,AUSTRALIAN SECURITIES,"What's wrong with them? They're businessmen, aren't they?",63
132,Mr MOORE,AUSTRALIAN SECURITIES,There is a nice conflict of interest in it.,63
133,Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,AUSTRALIAN SECURITIES,"Have you seen the interests of the NCSC members? But you would disclose it, wouldn't you?",64
134,Mr MOORE,AUSTRALIAN SECURITIES,"That would not be hard because of the rate of pay here. I would think, Lionel, if one were going to disclose the interests of some of the proposed mem-, bers of the Panel one would need a bigger book than a dictionary in relatio,n to it. MrLionel Bowen-Would you nominate some of the Panel?",64
135,Mr MOORE,AUSTRALIAN SECURITIES,I would nominate some of the Panel. As a consequence of this situation the recommendation' of the Committee was to stay with the NCSC.,64
136,Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,AUSTRALIAN SECURITIES,It was a very unusual recommendation.,64
137,Mr MOORE,AUSTRALIAN SECURITIES,It was a quite simple one which said to stay with the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC). It was as simple as that.,64
138,Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,AUSTRALIAN SECURITIES,There is a minority report.,64
139,Mr MOORE,AUSTRALIAN SECURITIES,"Of course there is a minority report but the majority agreed. There is a democracy even within the Australian Labor Party. The majority said that it ought to stay with the NCSC. That was heavily pushed by those honourable members. But two days later they rang oq the telephone and said, 'We want to see you, Lionel. We've missed out. We haven't got our hands in the cookie jar. We haven't paid the bill. We. did the work for you, now we want our hands in the cookie jar'. So Uncle Lionel says, 'That's. okay we'll reinstate it for you. We'll put you on the list. You can be on the Panel. There is no trouble at all'. So the boys got on their bikes and pedalled home to. the Business Council of Australia, the deed' done, with bills paid and jobs assured. But neither of those things has occurred. It is really a hamfisted old show. It was just a straight out grab for power in Canberra. The major constitutional questions were never addressed. Where were the opinions that this is based on besides that opinion of Byers?",64
140,Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,AUSTRALIAN SECURITIES,What about the report?,64
141,Mr MOORE,AUSTRALIAN SECURITIES,"Byers's opinion is pretty good. We should look at his opinion on the referendum. It was a ripper, was it not? As a consequence of those situations the Attorney-General is now going into a power grab on a very questionable legal base which will necessitate a large number of High Court of Australia challenges in relation to it. Even the Attorney-General's Department said over two years ago that the Commonwealth did not have the power. It recommended that the powers be split because of the grave constitutional doubts. Then along came the Byers opinion on which everything has been hung. Every conceivable head of power in the Constitution has been wrapped into the Bill. Telecommunications have been wrapped into it. The' Government has grabbed everything it 'can possibly find in the hope that it will still finish up with something. One should look at who has given opinions in favour of it. Byers is for it. Beyond that, where are the other opinions? The Government does not have one other opinion. It has only the opinion of Byers, and he has been shown to be fairly imiccurate. As to the next round, against that there is the opinion of the Law Council of Australia, the Law Institute of Victoria and many well-known legal firms. I hesitate to name them specifically, but I have the details here. The unanimous decision of the Attorneys-General and the Solicitors-General of all the States indicates that there will be big constitutional problems. Inevitably, many companies will remain outside the ambit of the Commonwealth power. A whole range of companies, including recreational, educational, scientific and health companies, will not be caught by the Commonwealth power. These include charities, holding companies, unincorporated associations, building societies and friendly societies. The cons-­ quences could be quite damaging for the business community. Why is the Government risking the future of our business reputation just to get this legislation through?",64
142,Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,AUSTRALIAN SECURITIES,Because the Senate recommended it.,64
143,Mr MOORE,AUSTRALIAN SECURITIES,"The Senate never recommended this. It recommended that the responsibility for law changes be addressed. It did not recommend taking over responsibility in relation to this. The only body to recommend this was the Australian Labor Partyand this relates to the old dogma, the allpower-for-Canberra game. As a consequence of that we now have these Bills with these amendments. I ask the Attorney-General: What arrangements will he make in relation to transition? I have not seen that· matter addressed anywhere.",64
144,Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,AUSTRALIAN SECURITIES,It's in the Bills.',65
145,Mr MOORE,AUSTRALIAN SECURITIES,"There might be some provisions in Bills in relation to what is proposed, but I am asking the Attorney-General to come forward and identify how he proposes to establish the company law, when he knows that the States are going to oppose it. He has had statements from State Attorneys General quite clearly setting out the fact that they will not cooperate. This will m.ean a large range of duplicated services-not' to mention costs. The cost of that will be horrendous. However, I suppose the Attorney General is not going to worry about that with retirement around the corner. Lionei will have his monument up on the hill, and subsequently someone else can fix this matter. While the Attorney-General is not worrying about the matter and someone else is fixing it, ordinary companies are concerned. In the meantime, referring to a hoary chestnut, what will happen to some of the legal cases that are currently involved when the transition takes place? Will they be taken over. by the Attorney;General's' Department or will they be dropped? The National Companies and Securities Commission will not have the power or the position to go through. with them. Come to think of it, what hap- . pened to the Attorney-General's special power under section 291 in regard to Roth- . wells, in retrospect. Rothwells proved to be one of the greatest financial frauds of all time and yet the Attorney-General sat there and did nothing. We invited him day after day to do something under section 291 of the Companies Code, but he would not do a thing, and that was because his mates were in it. There was a State election around the corner in Western Australia, and so the Attor':ley and his colleagues all stood back, saymg that they knew nothing about it.",65
146,Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,AUSTRALIAN SECURITIES,What about the NCSC?,65

149,Mr MOORE,AUSTRALIAN SECURITIES,"I was addressing the question of the Attorney's handling of the Rothwells saga, in relation to which matter I asked a number of questions here in the House. I asked why the Attorney did not use section 291 to launch an inquiry and investigation. He said that the Government did not have the power.",65
150,Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,AUSTRALIAN SECURITIES,I didn't say that.,65
151,Mr MOORE,AUSTRALIAN SECURITIES,"The Attorney-General did say that. He certainly did not take any action. Most assuredly, he could have launched those investigations, but he chose not to. He walked right away from the matter. While the Attorney was fiddling around in that area and not doing anything at all, in Sydney we had the Spedley business going on. So far as I can see, from reading the newspaper reports to date, that has the potential for even greater damage and greater irregularities in company law than the Rothwells matter-and that is saying something.' What is the Attorney doing about that, or has he given up the ghost on those sorts of situations? Why did the Attor- ' ney-General not exercise his power under the existing section 291 of the Companies Code to investigate the position of Rothwells and the more recent developments with the Yuill group of companies. This was an extraordinary position, because one of the great flow-ons of this Commonwealth takeover is' that all the power now centralises in the Attorney-General's Department and the Attorney-General. Its the real 'one telephone call fix job' which will happen in this situation. That is the whole basis of the Business Council of Australia's approach. Every time it gets on its bike to come to Canberra it is after the one telephone call fix situation. The Attorney knows that that is the whole basis of the call.",65

155,Mr MOORE,AUSTRALIAN SECURITIES,"- amvery touched by the retirement offer. I am just wondering what job the Attorney has got for himself. However, I suggest that the transitional arrangements must be addressed. This· relates not only to the inconvenience which has been caused to business. I raise the question of what will happen in relation to ongoing investigations and prosecutions. Will they be continued in the Attorney-General's name? Will he take 'over the cases?",66
156,Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,AUSTRALIAN SECURITIES,They will be under State law.,66
157,Mr MOORE,AUSTRALIAN SECURITIES,But that will be wiped out then.,66

165,Mr MOORE,AUSTRALIAN SECURITIES,"There are problems. The Attorney might not have a problem, because he is retiring.

This is fair dinkum; this relates to the market-place.",66
166,Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,AUSTRALIAN SECURITIES,The honourable member must get his law right. If it happens under State law it is dealt with under State law; if it happens in the future it will be under Federal law.,66

172,Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,AUSTRALIAN SECURITIES,"They can do it under the Corporate Affairs Commissions or they can vest it in the DPP, for which the Bill provides. Mr Smith-What if they don't provide the computer tapes, or the business names, or some such?",66

177,Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,AUSTRALIAN SECURITIES,You are talking about State infringements which you are now suggesting the States do not want to pursue.,66

213,Mr WEST ,MELBOURNE AIRPORT,"Cunningham-Minister for Administrative Services) (8.00)-I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Expansion of international terminal facilities, Melbourne Airport. My colleague the Minister for Telecommunications and Aviation Support ( Mrs Kelly) has endorsed a proposal by the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) for the expansion of the international terminal at Melbourne airport. Melbourne airport is now Australia's second busiest, and the existing international terminal, opened in 1970, was designed with an average passenger processing rate of about 500 persons per hour. Although the current demand on the building is regulated to some 800 passengers per hour as far as possible, monthly peak loads as high as 1,200 arriving passengers per hour are being recorded due to off-schedule arrivals. In addition to departing and transit passengers, peaks of this magnitude are causing serious deterioration in the level of service to the travelling public and inconvenience to airline operators and other terminal users. Accordingly, the FAC, in conjunction with its consultants, has developed a concept plan for the expansion of the international terminal complex at Melbourne airport to meet current and forecast growth demands for passenger facilities and aircraft parking requirements to beyond the year 2000, with the ability for further expansion if required. The proposal being referred to the Parliathe mentary Standing Committee on Public prices. Works will increase the capacity of the minal so that it can handle 1,800 arriving passengers per hour and 1,800 departing pas· sengers per hour and will be implemented phases over the next 61years for overall completion in 1995. The project will provide an additional six B747-400 aerobridge concirculation nected gates and a further two aircraft standtion off positions; it will involve new building construction of 28, 100m2, the complete refurbishment of 35, 100m2 of the existing building and work associated with the provision of additional building services. This major development will include: Terminal expansion The terminal proper will be increased in area by about 10,500m2 to 38,200m2 providing all F AC airline and government facilities required for the efficient processing of originating and terminating passengers and their baggage, together with associated revenue generating concessions and airline office/VIP lounge space. Concourse extension The area of the existing two-level concourse will be increased by about 2,600m2 to some 10,000m2 and will connect the terminal to a new satellite. Refurbished lounges and· amenities will be provided for departing and arriving passengers using two existing aerobridges. Outwards and inwards immigration and primary customs control will also be located within the concourse. Satellite A new two-level satelIite of nearly 15,000 m2 will be constructed. It will provide facilities for departing, arriving and transitting passengers using aircraft at 10 gate positiohs. Areas wiIlbe provided for retail, food and beverage concessions and VIP lounge - pace within the satellite. Pavements and services New apron pavement for the efficient manoeuvring and parking of aircraft up to B747-400 size will be required. The provision of new and/or upgraded trunk services-that is, water, power, sewer, drainage, et cetera-will also be necessary. The Corporation's preliminary estimate for development is $170m, at December 1988 As I stated earlier, the project will be terimplemented in phases. The Corporation is developing a program that will match the provision of facilities with demand whilst in generating funds to assist the financing of further development. Phase 1, involving the expenditure of $8.9m, will improve passenger space and the outwards immigraarea, and provide expanded concessions. Completion is planned by the end of 1990. Further phases will progressively achieve completion of all the stated improvements by 1995. The proposed works are in keeping with the conceptual proposals for longer term expansion of both domestic and international terminal facilities at Melbourne airport, developed by the Corporation in consultation with the State Government. The proposal is being referred to the Committee at the conceptual design stage as part of the FAC's fast-track implementation strategy, which seeks to ensure the progressive commissioning of expanded facilities. to meet the growing demand. I table the drawings of this very important proposal and commend the motion to the House.",68
214,Mr JULL ,MELBOURNE AIRPORT,"Fadden) (8.07)-The Opposition welcomes this reference to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, and r am delighted to see that at last something is being done about the existing situation at Melbourne airport terminal. One of the things that concern me is that, like so many of the other airport infrastructure arrangements in Australia, this move is coming somewhat too late. While there has been a tremendous growth in air traffic throughout Australia and, indeed, in Melbourne, future projections of the growth of international airline traffic to Australia have indicated by the year 2000 triple the number of international visitors will be arriving on our shores. I was interested to h-ar the Minister's statement tonight, because he talked about· this facility being finished in 1995. In fact, this facility that has been alluded to has the capacity to handle the expected numbers but it will have the capacity for only five years; after those five years it will be in trouble again. It is rather typical of the attitude that been taken by this Government during its period in office that it really has not addressed the whole area of the infrastructure that is required for the growth of international aviation and indeed the growth of tourism into Australia. No-one would deny that Australia is still flavour of the month; no-one would deny that Australia has a tremendous potential in terms of the growth of international tourism; and I think very few people would deny that one of the real difficulties we face in this country is the prospect of not having the correct infrastructure to handle the traffic. Of course, it is not only Melbourne airport that faces problems; we all know what a disaster the Sydney terminal is, and, while an expansion of facilities at the Sydney terminal is being undertaken at present, we wonder whether or not those facilities will be able to handle the growth that is expected by the year 2000 and beyond. There is a disastrous situation in Brisbane, and that is of particular concern to me because, on the projections, by the year 2000 Brisbane airport will be the second largest international airport in Australia. While in principle the Federal Airports Corporation has given the go-ahead for a new terminal in Brisbane, I understand that in that case too it will be 1995 before we see any action. Extensions are going ahead at Cairns airport, a locally controlled airport. We know of the problem that exists in Darwin, and all of a sudden Adelaide airport is very much on the agenda because a number of international airlines-MONICA",69
215,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,MELBOURNE AIRPORT,"Order! I remind the honourable member for Fadden that this motion is about a referral of work at Melbourne airport, not work at other airports around Australia. While the honourthat able member may be able to illu.strate the situation at other airports as part of his argument, the substance of his remarks should refer to Melbourne airport.",69
216,Mr JULL,MELBOURNE AIRPORT,"I defer to your wisdom, Mr Acting Speaker. I think it is part of the difficulty that we face. If we are going to look at the situation at Melbourne, I am sorry not to see in this reference regarding· Melbourne terminal any indication of exactly what the Government intends to do in terms has of the deregulation of the domestic airlines system from 1 November '1990.",69
217,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,MELBOURNE AIRPORT,If the honour-. able member .is going to talk about deregulation we are really getting a long way away from a referral of work at Melbourne.,69
218,Mr JULL,MELBOURNE AIRPORT,"May I just complete that, because one of the problems that we have is that if the Government goes ahead with deregulation from 1 November next year, there will be no terminal space. One of the things that have been put forward to the Government for its consideration is the incorporation of a joint user terminal within the new international facility. In that respect I would hope that the Public Works Committee will examine that particular prospect. If we are going to go down that road of deregulation there are two airports that stand out that have a deficiency in terms of terminal availability. One is Melbourne and one .is Sydney. There is a very real prospect of being able to incorporate a joint user facility within the new terminal complex in Melbourne. We must do that if we are going to make sure that the Government's plan for deregulation, with all the benefits that can bring into the domestic aviation industry, goes ahead. The Opposition supports this motion and we trust the matter will have a speedy passage through the Committee. We need to have this sort of decision from the Government in a hurry if we are going to meet the requirements and the demands of the international aviation industry not only in the next five years but for 2000 and beyond.

"". Mr LIONEL ,BOWEN (Kingsford Smith-Attorney-General) (8.12)-I move: That the amendments be agreed to. I turn to the Senate, amendments affecting the Corporations Bill. The first one concerns company formation and administration. In response' to concerns of the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation about the requirement of corporations under clause 158 to wind up when they cease trading activities, the Senate has amended the test, by amendments (15) and (16), so that a company is not required to be wound up unless it has ceased to be a trading corporation or, in the case of a company that has ceased to be a banking corporation, the company is not a trading corporation. This resolves the underlying problem raised by the Committee. The amendments recognise that a company will not cease to be a trading corporation under the constitution simply because it may cease trading activities. The failure of companies to trade for a significant period of time will be picked up when those companies fail to comply with the requirement to provide an annual return or an annual activity statement. Failure to provide such a return will give the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) grounds to have the company wound up. In regard to fundraising by public companies, the amendments made in the Senate to the prospectus provisions of the Corporations Bill generally follow the recommendations of the Joint Select Committee. The amendments retain the basic structure of tQe Bill but modify its operation in the followidg areas. The first is that the width of thO exemptions in clause 66 from the require-i ment to lodge a prospectus has been reduced in particular cases by amendments (3) to ( 14), such as removing the professional investor exemption, reducing the limit on the number of offerees from 25 to 20 and excluding prescribed interest from the limited offerees exceptions. A number-of additional classes of prospectuses will require registration and pre-vetting by the Commission under clause 1017A as amended by amendments (46) to (48); namely, prospectuses for the issue of units under a listed unit trust, and the issue of a prospectus to existing holders of prescribed interests under prospectuses of companies applying for listing. Secondly, to improve the efficiency of the vetting process the ASC will be required by amendment (51) to make a decision on whether to register a prospectus as soon as possibl- and no later than the prescribed time. Amendments (44) and (49) clarify that secondary trading on the stock exchange and all securities currently quoted on the stock exchange are exempt from the prospectus requirements. The power of the ASC to issue a stop order in respect of defective prospectuses has been modified by amendment (53). The effect of this amendment is to remove from clause 1033 the merit review criteria from which the ASC can issue a stop order. The remaining criteria, namely clauses 1033 (2) (a), (b) and (c), will allow the ASC to issue stop orders where a prospectus is substantially misleading ,or does not comply with the corporations legislation. This amendment gives effect to the recommendations of the Joint Select Committee, which was concerned that judgments about the merits of an investment should be made by the market and should not be displaced by the judgment of a regulatory agency. The right of a client of an unlicensed dealer or investment adviser to rescind agreements made with the unlicensed person is dealt with by amendments (40) and (41). The amendments made in the Senate preserve the general right to recision but remove that right and the right to recover the commission in cases where the dealer or adviser has declared to the client before the relevant agreement was entered into that he or she is unlicensed. The amendments respond to the concern of the Joint Select Committee that the clients of unlicensed dealers or advisers should not have an easy way out of purchases of securities that prove disappointing, while at the same time they retain an effective deterrent to unlicensed dealing, an important investor protection measure. These amendments also implement the Joint Select Committee's recommendations that the ASC be empowered to take action on behalf of a client to recover commission paid to an unlicensed dealer or adviser. Amendments (56) and (57) make corresponding amendments to the futures industry provisions in relation to rescinding agreements made with unlicensed persons as are being made to the securities chapter. The limitations period for actions under clause 1005 (2) has been extended from three years to six years by amendment (42). Amendment (43) gives effect to the Joint Select Committee's recommendation in relation to the liability for insider trading. The amendment empowers the ASC to take action to recover as a civil penalty the profits made as a result of insider trading and a corporation's security.This measure will ensure that even if the corporation is unwilling to take action against insider trading in its shares, the ASC can recover the profits of such trading on the corporation's behalf. The Senate has amended the definition of associated in clause 11 of the Corporations Bill to remove the extension of that definition to include executive officers. Amendments (1) and (2) were recommended by the Joint Select Committee on the ground that the extension of the definition would have resulted in significant extra administrative costs for companies in ascertaining the shareholdings of its management staff and publicising such information where the substantial shareholding provisions apply: For these reasons the Government has accepted the concern of the Committee and supports the amendments which give effect to that recommendation. The pre--etting of part A statements, which was removed in the original Bill, has been retained by the Senate. Clause 644 of the. Bill has been amended by amendment (17) so that the ASC is required to refuse to register a part A statement if it believes the statement does not comply with the Corporations Act or contains any matter that is false or misleading. The Government .acknowledges the concern of the Joint Select Committee that in some cases the abolition of the pre-vetting of part A statements may reduce investor protection. However, the Government remains of the view that prevetting does not necessarily achieve the purposes which the Committee seeks. Although the Government has accepted the amendment, the question of pre-vetting of part A statements as well as prospectuses will be monitored to determine its usefulness as an investor protection measure and the extent to which it acts as a burden on market efficiency. An amendment made in the Senate also tightens the, requirements relating to the compulsory acquisition of. shares by an offeror who achieves a 90 per cent shareholding in a company. The test in clause 701 as amended by amendment (18) substitutes the existing test under section 45 of the current Companies (Acquisition of Shares) Act, where the shares may not be compulsorily acquired unless in addition 75 per cent of the target shareholders accept the offer. The previous alternate requirement in clause 701, that the compulsory acquisition may also proceed where 75 per cent of target shareholders have left the register, has also been retained. The Senate has adopted the thrust of the Joint Select Committee's recommendation for amendments of the Bill to provide greater capacity for companies and shareholders to obtain information as to the beneficial ownership of shares in the company. Amendments (19) to (35) restore the power conferred by section 261 of the present Companies Act to enable companies themselves to send notices tracing the beneficial ownership of their shares. The significant change made by the Senate to the Committee's proposal was to require a prescribed fee to be paid by the company sending the notice to the person receiving the notice. This will compensate the person receiving the notice for the costs of supplying the information. The amendments also adopt that part of the Committee's recommendation requiring the ASC, at the request of a company or shareholder, to request information as to the beneficial ownership of shares provided a prescribed fee is paid and the ASC does not consider the request to be unreasonable. The Government considers that this approach will meet the legitimate concerns of companies to be properly informed about persons taking an interest in the company, while providing safeguards to reduce the current abuses and costly burdens imposed on those receiving tracing notices. The Senate has rejected the recommendation by the majority of the Joint Select Committee and the views of the Opposition that the power to make declarations of unacceptable conduct should be vested in the ASC, rather than in the Panel. The Government has considered the matter and the views of the majority of the Committee. However, it accepts the views of the five minority members of the Committee on the importance of separating the functions of investigation and adjudication. The ability of the ASC to threaten to take a matter to the Panel, and to publish, and to publish that fact, will be just as effective an enforcement weapon as the power to issue a declaration, which of itself has no consequences unless the Panel makes the appropriate orders. For this reason the Government supports amendment (39) made in the Senate which enables the ASC to publish an application by it to the Panel for a declaration of unacceptable conduct. The effectiveness of the Panel's capacity to deal with unacceptable conduct is enhanced by the associated amendments to the ASC Bill for a full time president of the Panel and by amendments (36) to (38) which amend clause. 735 of the Corporations Bill to enable the president to make interlocutory orders.",69
219,Mr MOORE ,MELBOURNE AIRPORT,"Ryan) (8.23)-The amendments put forward by the Attorney-General ( Mr Lionel Bowen) in relation to the Corporations Bill are a result of the work of the Edwards Committee. At least the members of that Committee went around Australia and took some views from the corporate sector in the short time they were given. They came up with some recommendations. As I said before the suspension of the sitting for dinner, the recommendations that came forward from that Committee were a darned sight more market-effective and realistic than those put forward by the 36 faceless men. The amendments put forward here relate to precise areas within the takeover code and as()ciated areas. The Opposition takes the view that the prevetting of prospectuses ought to be retained. We do so because after what the stock market has just been through a large number of prospectuses have been issued by various corporations which clearly have been light on information and misleading in presentation. The 36 faceless men do not want to retain the prevetting of prospectuses because they are the ones responsible for putting up the prospectuses. It is all very well to say 'Take an !l.ction. Defend yourselves against this situation'. Can you imagine, Mr Deputy Speaker, the ordinary investors of Australia, with $1,000 here or $5,000 there, taking a legal action against a major corporation which has launched a prospectus? The reality is that they will not. The 36 faceless men have said that it is okay; it is all part of the one telephone call fix syndrome. The Attorney is very big on that. The boys get on the phone. They get on their bikes and pedal up here. They say 'It is part of the deal. The Business Council of Australia (BCA) is going to support this but you are letting us down'. The Committee said that this would have to go. What happened? The Attorney turned it around and fixed it up. The second area, part A statements, has the same sort of smell about it. In this area the Government went along with the Committee's recommendation, but very reluctantly. The Attorney has just said that the Government will look at the matter, that it will keep a close eye on things because it may 'inhibit the workings of the market', to use the Attorney's words. That is quaint. Part A statements can be fairly technical. These days, when a lot of takeovers are taking· place, if corporations do not have their part A statements right, in my view they are well advised, in their own interests, to have them run through the regulatory authority, in this case the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC) Or the new body. The difference between the prospectus and the part A statement is striking. It is stunningly different. We accept one but not the other. Someone's tail was squeezed, so the Government retained that provision. The best one was the tracer provisions. The Edwards Committee said that we ought to allow them. The Government said no. Discussions went on all night. There was the famous letter from Lloyds which I mentioned before and which clearly set out the impact of not allowing a proper tracer provision. The principal reason for a tracer provision is that, if one does not have some way of approaching the share register of certain companies, one will undoubtedly have warehousing. A large number of smaller merchant bank-type operations practise warehousing, under all sorts of names. The companies are entitled to that. The Opposition put forward the proposition and in the dark of night the Government eventually accepted it. . I now turn to one of the real pearlers, one of the really good efforts of the Attorney General-the Panel versus the NCSC as to where the declaration should be. They beat their breasts, talked about how the body cannot be judge and jury and all the rest. The Chairman of the NCSC, Mr Bosch, made a very good case to the Edwards Committee on this matter-a sizeable and winning argument. He made the very valid point that if one wants to' declare an a""tion out, the essence is to act. That was the basis of his argument. He argued that therefore companies ought to have the power to do it, and not only that, but also that it was part of the overall administration of company law. I have always been impressed by the need for certainty and action in the share market. The idea that one can defer a decision gets one into all sorts of odd games. I point the finger at a major company which has pressed its luck, in my view, with proprietary companies and the placement of other company shares. If the Securities Commission is not able to act promptly but has to refer the matter to a panel which has to gather in some way-----:maybe physically or by telephone-information to make a judgment. on the matter, one is deferring it, one is deferring the timetable, it is further down the track. That might not be being a judge and jury in legal terms, but to me, one of the hallmarks of Mr Bosch's chairmanship has been his success in getting negotiated settlements. That is a very valid way to go about things, rather than deferring matters which can result in legal complications. I urge the Government to think about this matter. In terms of its practical application I think it is one of the areas the Government has missed. The reason for that is that the boys from the BCA have been on the telephone again. The boys have been up here saying ' Mr Attorney-General, the deal was this. We will support your package. No-one else in Australia will.' Not one body around Australia is supporting this action in this corporate Bill, except the BCA. One or two of them started out supporting it.",78
220,Mr LIONEL BOWEN ,MELBOURNE AIRPORT,Small business.,79
221,Mr MOORE,MELBOURNE AIRPORT,"No, only one part of small business, not the real small business. A few bodies started out supporting it, but when they woke up to it and saw what was in it they all gave it the thumbs down. So the Government is reliant on its boys at the BCA. They could not get up here quickly enough. Suddenly their perk had gone. They all want to be on the Panel because that is the essence of the one telephone call fix syndrome that is ,so important to the centralisation of company law. So the Government caved in, and we are. to go down the path of re-establishing the Panel with a full time chairman, a full-time secretariat no doubt, at more cost, ignoring the practicalities of the Bosch administration of cOmpany law which has been very successful in relation to negotiations and which has brought about a large number of settlements. I regard this as being one of the hallmarks of his chairmanship. The Attorney-General has to admit that the Government has rushed this Bill through the Parliament. It has not consulted people. It has gone around Australia claiming a great victory in centralising this operation. .No transitional arrangements are in place and its constitutionality is very much in question. All we have is the Byers opinion. The Byers opinion was very strong at the referendum; it went down. there. Yet the Government is proposing again to hang it on this legislation. Despite the fact that the Government negotiated with the Australian Democrats to get this legislation through the Senate it brought the legislation back here where it has the numbers, and it will then rush it over to Government House; no transitional arrangements are in place and there is no constitutional certainty. The Government still has a long way to go before Australia is in the can in regard to Federal company takeover law. On the other hand, the Opposition has consistently pressed for enhancement of the cooperative scheme. The cooperative scheme has served Australia very well over the last 10 years. Sure, we have had one or two administrative problems, but for people to put out the linethis has been done by some people involved in this matter-that we do not have a unified company law is rubbish and incorrect. That has been peddled around by certain legally trained members of the Attorney-General's advisory group. On top of that, another group was going around Australia peddling the quick fix approach. There is no need to hurry with company law. Consultation and certainty within the law are most important commercial practice. Instead of that, we have had a complete rush and minimal consultation.",79
222,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN ,MELBOURNE AIRPORT,"Mr Rocher)-Order! The' honourable .member's time has expired. Mr LIONEL. BOWEN . (Kingsford Smith-Attorney-General) (8.33)-I wish to reply quickly to' the points raised' as I' did not have time to reply earlier. I appreciate what the honourable. member for 'Ryan ( Mr Moore) is saying, btlt· he has said it all before. I db nbt want to delay the Committee, but 'let me' make dear' that the issue of whether the Panel should have an ability to make a declaration of unacceptable conduct was an attempt at streamlining. If it were left to the Australian Securities Commission there would· be a judicial review on the merits; If we then got a panel to operate independently, 'apart from being the judge and the jury, there would be an independent assessment by the business' community. I do not know why the honourable member denigrates so mjmy members of the business community. As to these 36 so-c--led faceless men, as far llS I am concerned there are about 24. They are not faceless; they are well known all over Australia. '. ' Mr Moore-In the end, none of them was consulted either.",80
223,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,MELBOURNE AIRPORT,"The honourable member should not get pff the point. The fact is that they are well known in' the business c-mmunity: It has been suggested that we should try to get the market to be answerable for itself. Of course,' if there is to be a review on the merits of the law, that will take place. The honourable gentleman had another go about the Rothwells Ltd caSe. Let; u- face it, Rothwells was incorporated in Queenslanda State the honourable member knows a fair bit about. The Corporate Affairs Commission could have taken action. In 1987 the National Companies and Securities Commission (NCSC) started to investigate Rothwells. We have seen problems in other areas where the Commission came to an arrangement thaI if a company handed in its: financial trading licence, it would not investigate anything before a certain date. Can honourable members imagine what has happened there? Quite properly, the honourable member has been worried about small investors who have done their money. Does the honourable member think that the CAC is able to take any action on their behalf? No. It never has and it never will. . Mr Moore-Queensland has no trade practices Act.",80
224,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,MELBOURNE AIRPORT,"Yes,' Queensland has .defective laws. The whple purpose of this legislation is to give this Parliament some power. If members of ,parliament ca,n discuss' mat-ers, as the honourable ge-tleman and I aiediscussing them across the table-admittedly in a fashion where we are not likely to come to some agreement-at least someb09Y would. be accountable for these matters.' Mr Moore-Yes, but-MONICA",80
225,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,MELBOURNE AIRPORT,Order! The honourable member for Ryan may speak again. He should not interject. .,80
226,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,MELBOURNE AIRPORT,"Ida not want to encourage the honourable member. I have listened to him, quite fairly in his in-erests for about 25 minutes. I know I cannot convince him on these issues, but I do not want it to be. sai9 in the marketplace that Hiis is a takeover by the Attorney-General's Department. It is not. It IS good law. For the first time this law 'will be able to be altered in a parliament and we will not have a mad scheme where Ministers can decide something on the recommendation of somebody else not in the Parliament and where, when the 'legislation comes into the Parliament, it cannot be altered. That is the very. reason why the Senate objected; that is the very reason why the Senate established a committee; ilnd that is the very reason why, in 1987, a Senate committee recommended that there be some Commonwealth law to deal with accountability and responsibility. That is all this legislation does. The idea of establishing a proper legal framework is welcomed., Of course, the ques-, tion of its administration will depend, on the people who administer it. Probably many of the' complaints the honoutable gentleman makes' are due to the fact that the NCSC does not have sufficient resources, even though there are 1,500 employees in the States and the States are making a clear ptofit of $80m. The honourable membe,r should not tell me that the business community is not making a contribution. The question is whether it is getting a service.' There is no compatibility in the computer facilities. Plenty of things can be improved here. All we want to do is give the business community good law. This legislation is a very worthwhile proposition. Admittedly, it will be challenged. Perhaps the Constitution has defects in it. It has many defects, but we cannot solve them by referendum, particularly when the Opposition tens everybody that it favours certain proposals until such time as they are put in a referendum, when the Opposition opposes them. One of the extraordinary features of this chamber is that we can have an sorts of difficulties because we cannot agree on what would be beneficial. In this case business people in the marketplace quite properly are saying to investors, 'Invest in the share ket. It is a good proposition. If there are cheats and shonks we wiIIdeal with them'. Then we will not h-ve the problem we have now of not knowing what is likely to happen. Of course, only 9 per cent of Australians are presently investing in the share market. The honourable member thinks that the present scheme is crash hot. I am not criticising people who have been handling this scheme; it is most difficult for them. But I can assure the Committee that plenty of investors have abandoned the market because they are not too sure what will happen to their shares or anything else. ' There will always be the risk of the marketplace. From a free enterprise point of view, the honourable gentleman knows that people take a risk in the marketplace. Encumbered with all the so-caned protective devices, we are saying that companies must always be able to account to others as to who are their shareholders. That provision is stiII there. They should not have separate requests to try to find out who their shareholders are from day to day. That was one of the tricks that were employed. An we are saying is that they will now pay the costs. All these points could be answered, but I suggest to the honourable gentleman that we should see how this thing works. I know we will have plenty of. troubles but I think it will work. The business community has a genuine interest in making it work. I think that is clear enough. A committee of this Parliament will be set up and anybody can take complaints to it. I do not deny that that will be a good thing, but this Parliament should not become a mere cipher for some arrangement made outside where nobody can move an amendment or oppose legislation and, if they do, it would go back to the State because we are dealing with State laws. 'The honourable gentleman was worried about what happens with investigations already under way. Obviously, they are under way because of State infringements. So those matters would be dealt with under State law. That can happen. Just because somebody was knocked down last week and the laws are changed next week does not mean that that matter cannot be dealt with under the State law if it is a Federal law that has mar- changed. That is the first weakness in the honourable member's argument; the States can do this themselves. Secondly, the States can hand such matters over to the Director of Public Prosecutions if they want to. That is provided for in the legislation. Why in the name of fortune is the honourable member those now suggesting, when we have not even passed this legislation, that we have to think about those State offences if the States will not cooperate? Quite frankly, if the States want to let crooks get away because they do not want to give us the evidence, that would make it hard. But the offence was committed under State law, not under this law, add that is what the honourable gentleman should understand. I welcome his constructive comments. I think we have an opportunity to say to this Parliament: under the Constitution we have a responsibility for trading corporations and foreign corporations. Clearly, those responsibilities are in the Constitution. They were not put in by our forefathers in 1900 on the basis that we would need to look at them. The issue is that we have one market in Australia and it is important to make it a strong market. The way to make it a strong market is to have integrity in it, parliamentary scrutiny of it, and parliamentary accountability for it. Question resolved in the affirmative.

228,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN ,MELBOURNE AIRPORT,"Mr Rocher)-Is that the wish of the Committee? There being no objection, the Committee will allow that course to be followed.",82
229,Mr KERIN,MELBOURNE AIRPORT,"I move: That Senate amendments Nos I and 21 be disagreed to, but that in place thereof, respectively, amendments Nos, I and 5 be made: (1) Clause 5, page 4, lines 14 and IS, omit words after ""Australia"", insert ""grain growers, especially wheat growers, with a choice of market options"", (5) Clause (4), page 49, add at the end clause the following sUbclause: ""(2) Regulations prescribing a State or tory enactment for the purposes of section 7 sectism 88 shall not be made unless the Minister notified the Minister of the State or Territory responsible for the administration of the enactment the subject-matter of the regulations, "", I think that it may suit my colleague oppoa site, the honourable member for Murray ( Mr Lloyd), that we make only one speech on of these matters, because we do not want to can. have a re-run of them clause by clause 'as we had in the third reading here and as the same issues have been dealt with in, great detail in the Senate, I believe that the ernment has shown great flexibility in the '15 months since the Industries Assistance Comsible mission report on wheat marketing was, ceived. We have agreed that the Australian Wheat Board's export monopoly should congrower, tinue and that there be no sunset clause on the Board's marketing role. We eventually accepted the feed wheat monopoly-not that we thought there was ever any risk of Board losing control of that market; but was prepared to move once it thought that there may be a""slight premium in the feed a referendum. wheat market, and therefore the boards and the growers should get it. ,We also accep-ed the suggestion of the Grains Council of Ausavailable tralia' for a fund to provide a capitafor the Board and the industry. When Bill was 'last in the House most of the. amendments were suggested by the Austrabe lian Wheat Board and the Grains Council. We accepted six Opposition amendments on the floor of the House, and we now have accepted a further four amendments. These amendments again seek to accommodate as far as possible remaining industry concerns. The fitst of these amendments provides that the Wheat Board's commercial activities should be directed to providing 'grain growin ers, and especially wheat growers', with choice of marketing options. This will, actee. commodate industry's desire to give the Board a broad power to trade in grains other than wheat, while at the same tirpe preserving the the integrity of the legislation. Another will give the Board greater salary flexibility by providall ing that staff may be appointed on terms and and conditions more favourable than those of the managing director, subject to myap' , proval. This will enable special cases to be of the accommodated without putting at risk the broader principle that,commensurate with Terrihis status, the chief executive officer should or be the most highly paid officer. We have also has specified further the requirements for conof sultation with the Grains Council on the operation of the wheat industry fund and agreed to an amendment requiring me to tell State when overriding State transport regulation!! apply, as if I would have, not done all so in any case. We have gone as far as we The Opposition wants the Board to ignore the Australian Constitution and trade intrasGovtate in the absence of complementary State legislation. This puts the Board in an impossituation. It would also put the Board reat risk because of the ,potential it would create for a competitor, or even a rebel to challenge the constitutional validity of the Act, thus putting the whole legislation, including the export monopoly, in jeopardy. It is a point to observe that the the Opposition was opposed to the GovernI mentIs referendum' proposals and, now it wants to ignore the Constitution without even ' ' , The Opposition would also risk having people on the Board who are not the best in the misguided belief that indusbase try ought to be able to, have one of its - he members as chairman' and a majority of 28 grower members. I believe that that would unnecessarily restrictive and could be deleterious to the Board's success in a deregulated environment. The key to the Board's successi.n operating 'in a deregulated environment will be the quality qf the Board and its staff. But this is really a straw mim. ,I have confidence in the Grains Council of Austtalia. What the Opposition still does not seem to understand is that I am putting more the box seat than ever before. The Grains a Council is effectively the selection commitIf it does not ,tru,st itself to pick the very best board and has to have, it set out in legislation, I think that is a very sad reflection by the Opposition on the Grains Council. I also trust the Grains Council because I believe that among 46,000 wheat growers it will find the requisite people as well as other people it may think are appropriate. The Opposition is also willing to have the Board abuse its market power through specifically exempting its pooling activities from the Trade Practices Act. While the Bill provides clear authority for the Australian Wheat Board to operate pools-and such operations are, therefore, exempted from trade practices provisions-the Opposition would extend this exemption to marketing activities also. This would give the Board a golden opportunity to abuse its market power without fear of sanction. Finally, the Opposition wants to. expose the taxpayer to the risk of a 95 per cent underwriting approach, which is beyond the status quo, when it knows that under the new arrangements the 90 per cent will pay more on the new formula than the. 95 per cent on the old formula. Perhaps it is not focusing so much on the Government's 90 per cent and its 95 per cent as the reduction down to 80 per cent over five years, consistent with the general policy by the Government on underwriting. The policy is to phase down underwriting, and that is consistent with the Government's broader policy of reducing Government involvement in statutory marketing, industry taking greater responsibility for its own risk - anagement-as occurs in the wool industry and many cooperative arrangements all round the country where growers look after themselves-and greater commercialisation of the Board. The Government is providing substantial assistance to the Australian Wheat Board and the wheat industry through its two borrowing guarantees, the provision of national interest cover for credit sales, and the maintenance of the export monopoly, et cetera. Against that background, the Government is not prepared to assist the wheat industry any further by maintaining an indefensibly high level of underwriting; given, as I said in my contribution in the third reading debate on this matter, the way the world wheat markets have changed and are changing. It is the world that has changed and we need to accommodate the world. If the Senate fails to ,pass this Bill, it will trigger the sunset clause. This means that there would be no underwriting of the 1989 crop and the Board would suffer a severe crisis of confidence as its very existence after 1991 would be at risk. The previous coalition leaders said that they would aCt responsibly on this matter. It is up to the new leaders to stick to this position and save the wheat industry from being sabotaged by the troglodyte elements in the National Party of Australia. Both the former leaders, the honourable member for Bennelong ( Mr Howard) and the right honourable member fqr New England ( Mr Sinclair), gave that undertaking. On the day of the coup the new leaders, the honourable member for Kooyong ( Mr Peacock) and the honourable member for Richmond ( Mr Blunt), reaffirmed that the understanding would hold. In an interview published in Queensla""d Country Life on 18 May, the honourable member for Richmond, now the Leader of the National Party, clearly stated: Andrew and I have agreed that all agreements and arrangements between the Liberals and the NP should stand and that includes a lot of agreements beyond wheat. It is quite clear that the leaders are saying what they mean. As this matter goes to the Senate we will see whether they will back down and weasel out of their agreement. If they do, it will make a complete mockery of the Opposition's stand on deregulation in general.",83
230,Mr LLOYD ,MELBOURNE AIRPORT,"Murray) (8.50)-1 support the way these amendments have been grouped together. I think it is sensible because it clearly defines the two amendments that the Government is now prepared to accept-or accept with slight re-wording, and that is acknowledged, as the Government has accepted some of the 41 amendments that the Opposition originally presented in this House. Therefore, the coalition parties will agree to those two amendments. However, the second group of amendments-(2) to (20)-are the major amendments that the coalition parties, together with the Australian Democrats, had inserted in the legislation in the Senate. These amendments can be grouped into certain categories according to their implications for the legislation. None of them is an unreasonable amendment. Mr Kerin-They are unconstitutional.",84
231,Mr LLOYD,MELBOURNE AIRPORT,"If the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy wishes to speak about the amendqtents being constitutional or unconstitutional, he is the one that is preventing the Australian Wheat Board from trading after 1 July, in complete contradiction to his second reading speech and his repeated claims over the last 12 months that he was going to make the Board a strong domestic trader. In practice, what he is doing is making it impossible for the Board to trade intrastate. Let us stick to the real position. If the Minister wants to get into a' debate on who is weakening the Australian Wheat Board and putting it into this impossible position after 1 July, we will have the debate and the responsibility will be shown to be completely on the head of the Government. As I said, none of these amendments is unreasonable. Some of them, obviously, are more important than others, and the most important of them is underwriting.. The amended legislation, from the Senate is for underwriting of 95 per cent, and on the basis of the legislation the calculation is now on the current year rather than the three-year provision of the older legislation. The Opposition has demons,trated, both in this chamber and, in the Senate, by providing figures, that 95 per cent i- a completely safe amendment. }?rom the point of view of the Government, it would never trigger any government payment. If one goes back over the figures, there would have been only one year-in the early 1980s-when payment would have been triggered. Since then the Wheat Board has had the ability to deal in futures; and the' problem would not occur again. The current legislation, with 95 per cent and the three-year· averaging, was triggered once, in 1986, at a cost of $ 140m. Let us put that into perspective with what the governments of the other major wheat trading countries, or groups of countries, paid out in the same period, and are still paying out in the case of the United States of America and the European Economic Community. They have paid out billions and billions of dollars. Even Canada, which is the closest nation to us in comparative terms, paid out $3 billion at the time of our one expenditure of $140m. The point we make is that with the proposed new underwriting arrangement there will be no call whatsoever on the Government, so it is a way to assist the industry at no expense to the Government. The Government's proposal of 90 per cent do,,:,n to 80 per cent is mean and punitive. The industry can borrow better, at no cost to Government, at 90 per cent or 95 per cent. At 80 per cent the arrangement is virtually useles's. The Government is forcing the industry to use growers' levy money to assist when it gets down to 80 per cent and cites the wool industry as another industry doing this. There is no comparison between the wool industry and the wheat industry. Wool is Australia's one world dominant industry and it, to a' large extent, sets the price for the rest of the world. The Australian wheat industry is not a significant industry in world terms. It is certainly significant in export terms, but the Australian industry does not set the price. The Treasury of the United States of America sets the price. Therefore, the rest of the world quails, even if the Vice President of the United States does not quail or quiver, when the US goes into its export subsidy program. Apart from the underwriting, there are proviSions to allow the Board to be a strong domestic trader, and I take the point from the Minister in relation to the difficulties that this legislation has for intrastate trading. Who put the Board in that position? Anybody who has put the Board in that position should not be critical of anybody else who is trying to' improve the impossible position of the Board. When it comes to interstate trading, the point' the Minister made is that the Government will let the Board buy into the pool for interstate traqing but it will not protect the Board when it wants to sell out of the pool domestically. What is the use of having an arrangement that permits the Board to buy into the pool but .not to sell out of the pool in safety in interstate trading. Next I come to the membership of the Board. The Minister indicated in his second reading speech that the chairman will. be a wheat grower. If that is the case, what is there to stop the Minister from putting it into the legislation? That arrangement for the Wheat Board has been good for the wheat industry and for Australia. When it comes to membership of the Wheat Board the Opposition is not insisting on .State membership. I agree with the Minister that that should not be a requirement for a Federal authority. But I believe that from the 46,000 wheat growers, as the Minister suggested, it is obviously possible to obtain five superior people out of the eight put together by the selection committee who are wheat growers. I see nothing unreasonable about that. The Grains Council of Australia, as the representative of the wheat industry, has the right to accountability, because the Minister in his own requirements for statutory authorities requires that. I acknowledge that the Minister in clauses 82 and 83 accepts consultation, if not agreement. We believe that as this levy is growers' money, for accountability arrangements that should persist. When it comes to flexibility and commercialisation, which the Minister is very fond of quoting to the Board, .the Board should be able to employ its senior staff free from the restrictions of the Remuneration Tribunal and the Public Service, because the Board has to act and compete in a most competitive world market. I acknowledge that the Government is providing wha.-, we call the Dairy Board proposal to provide some relief, but I see no reason why the Board should not be completely exempted in order to be allowed to put into effect the Minister's own statement that he is making the Board more commercial. That extends to the act of grace for the Board and also to unnecessary ministerial limitations with regard to the Board's ability to act in a commercial manner. The Opposition parties will be persisting with these amendments in the Senate. The Government has to understand that there is no change to the policy of the coalition parties. We have stated that these amendments are reasonable. Mr Deputy Chairman, it is very difficult for me when the Minister is wandering around trying to find a telephone while I am trying to deliver a message which I think I can deliver better straight across the table than by telephone.",85
232,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN ,MELBOURNE AIRPORT,Mr Rocher)-The honourable member would deliver it better if he spoke through the Chair. The honourable member may proceed.,86
233,Mr LLOYD,MELBOURNE AIRPORT,"The absence of Government members from the chan.tber indicates their complete lack of concern for this great industry in Australia and the hypocrisy they show to the industry and the country. I repeat that the Opposition parties will be persisting with these amendments in the Senate, and the final passage of the legislation is not on the head of the Opposition. We are ready, willing and able in the Senate to pass the - mended legislation so that there will be legislation in place from 1 July to enable the wheat industry of Australia to have the benefits of it. As far as the Opposition is concerned it is up to the Government to view, with greater reason than it has so far, these amendments that we will be persisting with in the Senate. To indicate our persistence with the amendments the Opposition will be requiring a division on amendments (2) to (20).",86
234,Mr HAWKER ,MELBOURNE AIRPORT,"Wannon) (8.59)..,-1 support the views of the Opposition but first I wish to draw attention to the fact that while the honourable member for Murray ( Mr Lloyd) was speaking there was not one member of the Government in the chamber. Mrs Darling-Yes, there was. I was here.",86
235,Mr HAWKER,MELBOURNE AIRPORT,"I am sorry, there was one. Now there are only three. That is an appalling indictment of the amount of interest that Government members are taking in this important Wheat Marketing Bill. I also take exception to the comments made by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy ( Mr Kerin) when he introduced the Government's amendments. He said that if the Senate failed to pass this legislation it would trigger . sunset clauses· on· underwriting. He completely overlooked the simple fact that if the Government were reasonable, and prepared to look sensibly at some of the amendments that have been put up by the Opposition, there would not be a problem, To blame the Senate is a very one-sided argument which completely overlooks the fact that the Government has, within its own powers, the opportunity to make sure that this Bill does pass. The Minister went to great lengths to say that when there was a change in the leadership of the Opposition the new leaders of both the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia had agreed that past arrangements would continue. I remind the Minister that those past arrangements included a very clear undertaking about our views on underwriting. For the Minister to claim that a change of leadership-even if it means maintaining our same policy-somehow excuses the change in his views on underwriting, shows that he is sadly mistaken about these matters. It has been clearly set out in the Opposition's policy agreement, and clearly stated on a number of occasions by the honourable member for Murray, that we believe very strongly in this question of underwriting. The Minister should take that on board .and not try to mislead the Parliament with his statements. I would like to reiterate this point on clause 78. We believe that the question of underwriting is very important. For the Minister to try to sweep it under the carpet as though it really is not significant completely overlooks the needs of the industry, and the needs of the Australian Wheat Board as it moves to a different marketing set-up on the domestic market. It would well behove the Minister to take note that the Opposition is being entirely consistent on this matter. For him to accuse the Senate of delaying is a very one-sided argument. I support the amendments moved by the honourable member for Murray and emphasise to the Minister that underwritirig is a very important part of those amendments. EmptyHere The rules of the chamber do not allow me to move the amendments that I moved when the Wheat Marketing Bill came before the chamber in the previous sittings of Parliament. The amendments I moved then were aimed at restoring the Australian Wheat Board's monopoly power on the domestic market. I did it then because I believed in those amendments for two reasons. First of all, I believed I was supporting the views of the Australian wheat industry, in particular, the views of my electorate of Mallee, which is a very large grain growing area in Australia. Secondly---.:and probably this is the more important reason-I moved those amendments because I believed it was in the best interests of the Australian wheat industry for the Board to retain those powers. Mr Kerin-Is everyone in cockies' corner going to speak? EmptyHere in this Parliament for as long as we wish. We will not be blackmailed in Parliament, even though the Minister for Primary Industries and. Energy ( Mr Kerin) has blackmailed the Australian wheat growers. It is a paradox to me that the Wheat Board is seen by the Government as being essential to maintain export powers, but not to maintain domestic powers. I want to make it clear that my views in relation to this issue have not changed. In fact, over the past week or two I have been out in the constituencies discussing wheat and my views have firmed up. It is a disaster that the Australian wheat grower will lose this vital marketing arm which has proved so successful over the years; it has provided equity and stability to the Australian wheat industry, and at the same time' has provided growers with market signals that have enabled the Australian wheat and grain industries to adapt and change at a very significant pace in relation to world trading situations. It is a shame that the manufacturing and secondary industries in this country have not been able to adapt and this Bill change to the same degree. Mr Kerin-If they were allowed to set the price on the domestic market it would be all right. EmptyHere the Australian work force sets the price on the domestic market very adequately. There is no intention by the Government to acknowledge the amendments of the Opposition in this Bill or to make other changes to our industrial system that will bring some sort of deregulation to the Australian work force, which is so essential if this country is to survive. The Government has shown, by the way that the Minister has spoken tonight in relation to the action of the Senate, and through his reaction to the amendments moved by the shadow Minister for primary industry, that it has a very clear agenda in the primary industry area. I believe that this agenda will be shown just as clearly in future primary industry legislation that comes before the House. The first part of that agenda is this: we now see a direction by the Treasurer that no assistance will be granted to any of ,\ustralia's primary industries, and that no assistance will be granted that will - na-le - f-mi!y farmer in this country to malOtalO hiS viabIlity or stay on the land. Yet every other group in this community-even down to some of the very deviant groups in this community-is continually milking the A!lstralian taxpayer for assistance. The second part of the Government's agenda is its intention, with this legislation, to break down growers' influence and control over their own industry. It is obvious that the Government is not prepared to accept Opposition amendments that have been moved by my colleague. These amendments are quite justifiable. Basically, they seek to remove restrictions relating. to the employment of people by the AustralIan Wheat Board; they seek to maintain grower control; and they seek to maintain adequate underwriting principles. It concerns me that just today in this House we heard comments from the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) about the uranium industry. Exactly the opposite conditions and guidelines apply to that industry in the deregulation debate to those that apply to the wheat industry,.,ln a similar vein, as I have already mentioned, exactly the opposite conditions apply to the labour market and restrictive work practices that exist in this country as apply to the wheat industry. I refer to the comments made by my colleague the honourable member for Wannon ( Mr ·Hawker). I respect the. me-b-r for Wannon for his stance concernlOg thiS IOdustry. He has not deviated fro-?is. view - nd I respect him for that. But It IS IOterestlOg that he is now critical of the Government's action in not accepting some of the. very genuine and necessary amendments that have been moved by the Opposition,· particularly relating to underwriting. In my view, that will leave the Australian Wheat B.oard not on a level playing field with other marketers on the domestic market, but will place it in a very disadvantageous position. I conclude by saying that I regard it .as very significant that the Hawke Government has taken the sort of stance and produced the sort of legislation that it has in regard to some of our great Australian primary industries which, at this time, comprise the only significant economic f-r-e in this co.u':1-ry and which are maintalOlOg, our credibilIty economically and our viability domestically. I reject totally the sort of blackmail that has been shown by the Minister. We knew for months and months about the constitutional issues that now exist, but the Minister has done nothing to alleviate the. situation in regard to these constituti-nal issu-s. Also; - e has done nothing to assist the IOd-stry 10 trying to overcome some o- the - Isadvan­ tages it will how face! particularly on. the domestic market. 1 belIeve that these disadvantages will flow significa!ltly. into the - x­ port market, particularly 10 years of ?Igh domestic production and low export pnces. This Parliament should suppor- the amendments that have been moved by my colleague. I am very concern-d abou- the trend this Government shows 10 relation to the support of Australia's primary industry.",86
236,Mr IAN CAMERON ,MELBOURNE AIRPORT,"Maranoa) (9.10)I wish to speak in favour of these amendinents and, of course, continue to oppose the raft of Bills which the Australian Labor Party has put forward in this House which affect every wheat grower across this nation. The Opposition has put forward many amendments which the Government refuses to accept. We believe that .the amendments that we put up relate to things which the industry has come to us about and supports. They include particularly the underwriting arrangements. As a wheat grower, I do not support the total deregulation of the domestic human consumption market. It just staggers me to think that the Government can do away with and totally deregulate this particular market and have it thrown to the wolves of the world subsidised market. We know that while the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy ( Mr Kerin) was actually speaking on this legislation the Vice-President of the United States, Dan Quayle, was here telling us that it w.-s not affecting our markets. The Government, the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke), and the Minister met with Dan Quayle. He gave all sorts of unnecessary and unbelievable explanations as to how the Americans were not affecting our market world-wide; but they are. While the Minister was putting this legislation through we heard the announcement of a further sale of subsidised wheat to Russia and so it continues. Once the Wheat Marketing Bill becomes law, whenever' that is-of course, at the present rate we are not too sure, it might be three years down the track and the Australian Labor Party will not even be in government-we will have the opportunity to put up our own legislation. We will keep sending this stuff back to the Senate as long as we sit here, until the Minister is prepared to make some changes that the industry wants. Of course the Minister has set it up. Two years ago we opposed the changes that he suggested where each State had its own grower representative. We h;lVe now a total regulation on the composition of the Australian Wheat Board. The Labor people come in here all flushed about deregulation for growers. But when it comes to setting up the Board itself, we see total regulation on the composition of it. The Minister has absolute say on the people who will comprise that Board. The only grower representative in law in the Bill will be the chairman. Anybody else on the Board need not be a grower. I know one can argue that the Grains Council of Australia Is appointed to set up the selection committee, but the facts are that in law it need not appoint any growers. Any member who is put forward by the Grains Council can be rejected by the Minister if he does not like the colour of the tie the person. is wearing or the colour of his politics. The Minister can say, 'No, we don't want ,him, thanks very much' and he is not accepted. .These are the sorts of things to which we continlie to object. The underwriting, of course, is something that we feel will not cost the Government anything. It does not cost the Government anything to give a guarantee. Although, as I have said in this House before, it is not that the guarantees are worth much. We see that the dollar has dropped about 4c in the last 24 hours. That is how much confidence the world has in this present Labor Government's regime. Mr Wright-What a ridiculous statement. No wonder they are after your seat.",88
237,Mr IAN CAMERON,MELBOURNE AIRPORT,"The honourable member for Capricornia interjects but that is what has happened. I ask the honourable member for Capricornia to understand that in Cairns the other day in an interview the Minister mentioned coal freight rates. This Bill has been moved from wheat to cover all grains. All of the amendments he has accepted do not just deal with wheat; they cover all grains. The Minister also mentioned up in Queensland that. the Government, will deregulate the coal freight rates. The Queensland Government and the people. of Queensland have spent about $50m electrifying the ra-l line which carts all the coal down through my electorate, through the electorate of the honourable member for Capricornia, to the coast, on to the ships and around the world. This Government is about deregulating coal freight rates now. I wonder how we can the continue in business and continue earning the sort of export income that is needed because this month we will see a $2 billion imbalance in our trade figures. The wheat industry is one of the few industries in this country that actually earn vast amounts of money in exports. It earns $2 billion to $3 billion a year in export income. Yet we have the Labor Party Minister in the Hou-e screwing it down and making it harder for us as wheat growers from Maranoa to earn a living. I put it to the Minister that the support price of wheat has put a floor in the grain price in this country. Once it is removed there will be no floor. It is all right now while the price is on the up. The price is on the up world wide because there has been a substantial drought in America. Of cO\.--se while people continue to breed and the world's population continues to grow, they need more food. So the price of wheat is on the way up. But we should wait until the price of wheat starts to comes down again. It is very difficult for us to adjust our production rapidly. We cannot do it. Supply often overruns demand. Of course the price adjusts itself downwards rapidly. We have spent 30 years setting up a situation whereby we have some cushioning of that downward arrangement that helps us to stay in business as farmers. That is what the marketing schemes are designed to do. They are not designed to support people in the good times. They are designed to support people in the bad times. Where will this finish? The Minister is finished with the grains industry. He is obviously sticking his spurs into the sugar industry. It is totally deregulated. The Government has lifted every form of support that that industry had to keep it in business. What will the Government do? Will it move to ,the wool industry next? Will it abolish the floor price scheme that has been established and that the growers tllemselves have contributed to over a period of years? It was set up to cushion the effects of the' fall in wool prices. What has happened with the wool market? It is a good example. It is the same as the grain market. We' have seen a rapid increase in the price of wool in the last 18 months. But what has happened in the last three months? It has plummeted downwards again. It is actually below the floor price established four months ago. The average price of wool has fallen below the floor price. The same thing will happen to grain. Yet we have a system in place on which farmers over all this time have worked. They have worked towards putting a system in place where they have some sort of support under their grain market. It does not apply to a lot of wheat. It is only one million tonnes out of the 18 to 20 million tonnes we produce. We are totally dependent upon 'exports. We have few people in this nation. Our farmers out on the Darling Downs, on the western downs, in the Central Highlands and in the areas that I represent in Queensland are very efficient. All of those farmers will benefit from deregulation. 1 do not deny that. Obviously the big farmer who produces the good quality grain will be able to sell to the flour miller when it suits him. When it suits the flour miller to buy he will give him a reasonable price. But overall the average farmer will not benefit. The average farmer will suffer severely. That is what we are on about on our side of politics. We believe that the existing arrangements that have been put in place over many years ought to remain. I would even go so far as to say that if the Government is not prepared to support the sorts of floor price arrangements we have, we ought to be prepared to levy ourselves more and put in our own floor price arrangements. We still need legislation to allow the Wheat Board to remain the sole trader on the domestic market for quality wheat for human consumption. I believe we can put a floor price into that market provided the Government allows the Wheat Board to remain the sole seller .. We ought to be prepared to finance our own floor price scheme. But the Minister does not seem interested in that sort of arrangement. He is going to throw us to the dogs. He is going to deregulate totally our part of the. market overnight. He will put us at the' mercy, of the flour millers across this nation. . We know that the latest tactics are to give consumers the cheaper price for bread. At least that is the supposed position. But that will not happen because the middlemari takes all the profits. I guarantee here tonight that the price of bread will not fall. But the price of the quality wheat that is produced by farmers in my electorate will come down well below the prices that we are used to getting. It is amazing how the Government continues to support Broken Hill Proprietary Co: Ltd and the banks by a $200m subsidy, yet when it comes to the grain industry and primary industry in this country it is not prepared to give them some form of support that the old legislation was giving. I have much pleasure in supporting these amendments. Along with the honourable member EmptyHere honourable member 'for Wannon ( Mr Hawker)-although he is a bit on the other side-we will continue to oppose this legislation. Question resolved in the affirmative.",89
238,Mr KERIN ,MELBOURNE AIRPORT,"Werriwa-Minister for Primary Industries and Energy) (9.20)-I move: That Senate amendments Nos 2 to 20 be disagreed to, but that' in place of Senate amendments Nos 5, 9, 10, and 19, respectively, the amendments Nos 2, 3 and 4 be made: (2) Clause 7, page 6, omit subclause (4). (3 Clause 44, page 21, omit subclause (3), insert the following subclauses: ""(3) When the Chairperson is holding office in an executive capacity, a person shall not be employed by the Board on terms and cohditions more favourable than those applying to the Chairperson. ""(3A) When the Chairperson is not holding office in an executive capacity, a person shall not be employed by the Board on terms and conditions more favourable than those for the time being determined under subsection 45 (2) except with the approval of the Minister."". (4) Clause 82, page 40, after subclause (2) insert the following subclause: ""(3) Regulations that would affect the operation of subsection (I) shall not be made except after consideratiori by the Minister of a report the Grains Council made after consultation with the Board."". At this stage I want to say only a few words. I have broadly covered the amendments I have just moved in my initial contribution to this small debate tonight. My comments basically apply to the remarks made by some of the honourable members opposite who want to re-invigorate the whole debate. The subject under discilssion relates to about 15 per cent of the total crop. That is what this measure is' all about. It has very little to do with what members opposite are waxing eloquently about to the people they think they are representing. , The. honourable m-mber for Mallee. ( Mr Peter Fisher) said that the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) does not want to provide any assistance and that the Government wants to wipe out family farms-all that sort of homespun nonsense. Since I have been Minister, in response to every reform I have proposed there has been a cacophony that I am out to wreck the family farm, that the Government is out to withdraw assistanc-, and all the· rest of it. The. Government is trying to provide appropriate forms of assistance. There is this usual National Patty of Australia hyprocrisy: cut government spending everywhere but do not cut government spending on us. National Party members want US to cut government spending but not on the roads, research, and so on. The same thing applies with the exchange rate, which matter the honourable member for Maranoa ( Mr Ian Cameron) has just raised. When the dollar is high, the National Party of course says that it is too high, and when the dollar is down the Liberal Party says that it is too low. Whi'chev-r way one goes one cannot win. They just do not understand that the dollar is floating. They do not understand that one of the main factors affecting the Australian dollar is the United States dollar. As to all this home spun stuff, subsidies killed the north coast dairy industry. The National Party kept the subsidies on; it kept those people in poverty and told them how good it was for them. Honourable members opposite are saying that the Government wants deny industry control of its own forby tunes. The Government is prepared to give industry total control, as occurs in other cropping industries, but the reason for the Government's backing of the wheat industry is that it is the backbone of the cropping industry. During the debate previously I gave the reasons why the Government backs the wheat industry. We now hear this nonsense about blackmail and all the rest of it because of the Senate. As far as r am concerned, the Senate has equal rights with this House; it also has equal responsibility. It knows what it is doing. Tl1ere was a bit of nonsense about Vice-President. Quayle, which I will not go into. Mr Ian Cameron-,-Why not? . Mr KERIN-Well, for a start, the honourable member said that I met him, but I did not. I am not going to get into all that rubbish. However, the honourable member for Maranoa said that I have absolute say on the Board. I do not. I do not think I have knocked back anyone put up by a selection committee. All I am saying is what sort of skills should be there, and the selection committee picks the people. As to the underwriting aspect, it is not just that somehow we are going to reduce cruelly the figure from 90 per cent to 80 per cent, with a subsequent effect on the wheat industry. An 80 per cent underwritten guarantee is not bad, in life; that is very bankable, when one considers what the other cropping industries have. As well as that, on the domestic market it is this mechanism which will make the Board' aggressive. It is this mechanism that will make sure that it becomes a true marketer, not just a trader, and'that we will not miss the opportunities we have been missing on the export market. The honourable member for Maranoa said that the guarantees are not worth much. As a matter of fact, on $2 billion to $3 billion worth of borrowings the guarantees are probably worth at least $40m to $60m. The $800m is national interest cover. It is real money; it is a real contingent liability. The honourable member for Maranoa is quite wrong in saying that the Government guarantees are not worth much. I am told that somehow I have to do something about coal freights. Well, unfortunately, I cannot do anything about coal freights in Queensland. The Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) made an offer to Premier Ahern and Premier Greiner. In Queensland the mines that were established many years ago have a very cheap freight rate in present terms, but anyone who wants to open a mine is now effectively stopped from doing so because of the crazy system that the Queensland National Party applies-the corrupt non-democratic National Party Government in Queensland. The debate can be widened to inciude sugar and wool. The crazy National Party regulations in Queensland are preventing sugar industry from reaching its full potengone tial. Between the two governments, we spend $461m. The Burdekin Valley is probably best place in the world to grow sugar. Most of the sugar industry in Queensland is now landlocked-but apparently sugar cannot be grown there because a judge has not said that that can be done yet. This is a so-called free enterprise government in Queensland. is absolute nonsense. In relation to wool, am supposed to be attacking the wool indusVice-President try next. Many of the reforms that the Government is putting into place are occurring as a result of reforms that occurred in the wool industry in the early 1970s-under the government the day, which was not a Labor government, but they were put in place by Ken Wriedt in 1974. Of course, as to the - way people the industries act, Vines and Gunn had to be booed and jeered and jostled and have flour bombs thrown at them, because the sort of popular nonsense that honourable members opposite raise put them into that situation. It took that to get reform for the wool industry. The honourable member for Maranoa said that he would like to set floor price for the grains industry. He can have a go, but I thought he would have the amendments. noticed that in this legislation the Government is trying to give the Grains Council Australia and the industry a chance to some additional funding measures into place. However, anyone would have a hard job to his comments. setting a floor price, unless one wanted to get into stockholding in a very big way.",90
239,Mr LLOYD ,MELBOURNE AIRPORT,"Murray) (9.26)-There is nothing to reply to. If 'cacophony' is the in word, I can simply say that we have just heard the same tired old cacophony. There is no point in replying to that. EmptyHere want to make one point. We are not out there trying to preserve family farmers irrespective of viability or stability or their financial position. I point out to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy that family farming is a very major part of the Australian wheat industry. Since he has been Minister and since the Labor Party has been in government the number of wheat farmers in this country has dropped from 47,000 to the 37,000. Some 10,000 wheat growers have under since this Government has been in office. We believe that this situation should the not continue. It is as simple as that.",92
240,Mr IAN CAMERON ,MELBOURNE AIRPORT,"Maranoa) (9.27)I want to draw the following point to the attention of the Minister: As to Vice-President Quayle's visit to Australia, the Minister tells me that he does not have the standing It in the Labor Party Ministry even to meet I with him. For three parts of the time that Quayle was here all he wanted to do was talk about wheat trade. But the Vice-President of the United States of America left this country arguing the question of wheat trade, and we are still arguing the of matter of wheat subsidy since he has been home again. Yet we have the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy here trying to in tell me that he did not meet with him. I think that is a disgrace on the part of the Government. It is a disgrace that our Primary Industries Minister does not have the standing in Cabinet to meet with the Vice President of the United States of America to discuss trade matters.",92

243,Mr KERIN ,PAIRS,"Werriwa-Minister for Primary Industries and Energy) (9.38)-On behalf of the committee appointed to draw up reasons for the House disagreeing to amendments Nos 2 to 4, 6 to 8, 11 to 18 and 20 of the Senate, I report. such reasons, 'which are being circulated to honourable, members. The reasons read as followsRe-sons of the House of. Representatives for disagreeing to the amendments of the Senate. Senate amendment No. 2 is not acceptable because: The amendment is an attempt to. provide the A WB with powers to trade intrastate in the absence of complementary State legislation. However, the amendment goes beyond the CQmmonwealth Government's Constitutional power and simply cannot be accepted. The only way this issue can be solved is for State Governments to pass the necessary complementary legislation. ' Creating a clouded legal situation is not the answer since it puts the A WB in an impo-sible position. It would also put the Board at risk because of the potential it would create for a competitor to challenge the Constitutional validity of the Act, thus putting the whole legislation including the export monopoly, in jeopardy. Senate Amendment No.3 is not acceptable,because: The amendment seeks to remove a standard provision which simply says that the Wheat Board may not exceed its Constitutional powers. Its exclusion would do nothing to change the Board's legal position and could put the whole Act in question. Senate Amendment No. 4 is not acceptable because: This amendment is consequential on Senate Amendment No. 3 Senate Amendment No. 6 is not acceptable because: The provision for the Minister to issue directions is a reserve power to allow for exceptional Circumstances. It is not a power which is' used lightly and it is not normal practice to include a provision regarding compensation. The question of compensation would normally be taken into account in issuin.g any direction. Senate Amendment No. 7 is not acceptable because: The amendment places an unnecessarily restrictive; condition on the appointment of Chairman of the Board which could be deleterious to the Board's success in a deregulated environment. The Government has already indicated that initially the Chairman will be a grower, although it regards this as a transitional arrangement. In the longer term the Chairman should be a person who has skills appropriate to the broader commercial charter of the Board. It is therefore not appropriate for it to be specified in legislation that the Chairman should be a grower. Senate amendment No.8 is ·not acceptable because: As with Senate amendment No.7, it is not appropriate that the Board composition be so narrowly prescribed in legislation. The key to the Wheat Board's success in. operating in the new deregulated environment will be the quality of the Board and its staff. The Board therefore needs the best people available with a balance of production, marketing and finance skills. Senate amendment No. II is not acceptable because: In the first instance, such an amendment is unnecessary. The Bill provides clear authority for the A WB to operate pools. Such. operations are therefore authorised under Section 5.1 of the Trade Practices Act, which provides for spec'ific exemptions for the activities of statutory marketing authorities. Secondly, such a specific exemption in respect of the pools marketing activities is unwarranted. As indicated in the Second Reading' Speech the A WB should not operate in such a way as to abuse its market power. Senate amendment No. 12' is not acceptable because: The amendment removes the requirement that, subject to certain circumstances, where a grower seeks a cash-out payment from the pool, the Board shall provide that option. Given that most of the wheat crop is exported and that the Board's export monopoly is. being retained, some growers will have no alternative but to deliver to the Board. The Government believes the offer of a cash-out from the pool should remain mandatory. Senate amendment No. 13 is not' acceptable because: The amendment is consequential on Senate amendment No. 12. Senate amendment No. 14 is not acceptable because: The amendment is consequential on Senate amendment No. 12. Senate amendment No. 15 is not acceptable because: The amendment is unnecessary because act of grace payments are a matter for the Board's commercial judgment and there is thus no need .to make specific provision for them in the legislation. Senate amendment No. 16 is not acceptable because: The requirement that statutory authorities obtain Government approval of their borrowings is Government policy. It recognises, even in the absenceof a formal guarantee, the potential liability of Governments if statutory authorities are unable to meet their borrowing liabilities and, is not unreasonably restrictive. Senate amendment No. 17 is not acceptable because: The amendment is contrary to the Government's policy to phase down underwriting, consistent with its broader policy of reducing Government involvement in statutory marketing, industry taking greater responsibility for its own risk management, and greater commercialisation of the Board.' Senate amendment No. 18 is not acceptable because: The Government is already providing substantial assistance to the Wheat Board through its two borrowing guarantees, the provision of $800 million of National Interest Cover for credit sales; and the maintenance of the export monopoly. In addition it has broken new ground through provisions in the Bill to exempt the Board from restrictive State regulation of transport, handling and storage. Against that background, the Government is not prepared to commit itself to guarantee Board borrowings beyond 5 year-. Senate amendment No. 20 is not acceptable because: The amendment places the Grains Council above the Government in terms of the requirement that Grains Council agreement is necessary before the making of regulations regarding the Fund. Motion (by Mr Kerin) agreed to:, That the committee's reasons be adopted. NA LA WS AMENDMENT BILL 1989 Bill presented by Mr Kerin, and read a first time. Second Reading",93
244,Mr KERIN ,INCOME EQUALIZATION DEPOSITS,"Werriwa-Minister for Primary Industries and Energy) (9.39)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to major changes to the operation of the income equalisation deposits (lED) scheme. The lED scheme provides a mechanism whereby farmers can reduce fluctuations in their· income by putting money aside in good years for the bad years that are likely to follow. The scheme has operated, in various forms, since 1976. In the May 1988 economic statement the Government announced that it would introduce a tax-linked lED scheme for primary producers from 1 July 1989. The new scheme, it was announced, \yould be designed to overcome the drawbacks associated with the tax-linked scheme which operated until 1983. Income stability has long been a major issue confronting the rural sector. Unstable incomes in the rural sector are due to cyclical movements in the prices of commodities and the variations in weather, which can be experienced in their most extreme form in floods or droughts and fires. The timing and magnitude of variations in prices and the weather are impossible to predict. As 11 result the incomes of farmers will be highly variable and suhject to sharp and sometimes prolonged upturns and downturns. For example, the wool industry is presently enjoying relatively high prices while the wheat industry is only now showing signs of emerging from a significant downturn. There are a number of adverse implications of rural income instability, particularly for farm production, investment and farm welfare. On the production side, resources are often misdirected as a result of price and production instability. After the event, it is often clear that farwers have overproduced or und-rproduced; resources have been employed producing the wrong things in the wrong places in the wrong quantities. Large swings in the level of activity in farming industries result in large swings in demand for associated services, such as wheat storage and transport facilities, abattoirs and factories and businesses providing farm inputs and services. This results in considerable inefficienCies for all concerned and the costs are borne directly or partly by the primary industries. Farmers, of course, seek to protect themselves from instability and its consequences. Common farm responses are maintaining higher liquidity than otherwise, following more flexible operating patterns and diversifying production into a range of products. However, all these strategies result in some profitable .on-farm investments not being made and can increase the asset base necessary for farming. Similarly, risk and uncertainty tends to result in farmers being willing to borrow less and lenders being willing to lend less than would have been the case with stability. However, the service sector now provides facilities to farmers which act to reduce the risk associated with production and borrowing. Finance is now rationed according to price rather than quantity. Loans are increasingly being structured to reflect the characteristics and requirements of individual producers. Greater stability in farm incomes, .however, is likely to result in more farm confidence and borrowing power and, as a consequence, encourage farmers to adopt more efficient production methods over the long run. There are considerable 'welfare' costs associated with instability. Widelyfluctuating incomes have to be reconciled with regular debt repayment obligations and the rational planning of family living expenses, including health and education. This is particularly serious for lower income farmers, who. face the prospect of not only painful disruption to their family life but also the possible loss of the farm. The problem also extends to many non-farm rural families whose welfare depends on the prosperity of surrounding farmers. While these welfare costs are difficult to determine, they could be very large. The implications of unstable rural incomes clearly are not restricted to the agricultural sector but flow throughout our economy, influencing the level and nature of economic activity. Honourable members will recall the depressing effect upon the economy of the dtought of 1982-83, when the net value of rural production fell by 80 per cent. Conversely, strong prices for a number of commodities increased the net value of rural production by 68 per cent in 1987-88 making a significant contribution to exports and national income. Because of the diversity of commodities produced and the wide range of climatic conditions in Australia, the variability of incomes for individual farmers is likely to be proportionately much g-eater than the variability in the net value of rural production. In view of the significance of farm income fluctuations and their wider implications the Government accepts that some incentive' is justified to encourage farmers to provide for them. This view was supported by the 1974 Green Paper, Rural Policy in Australia; the Industries Assistance Commission in its 1975 report Rural Income Fluctuations-Certain Taxation Measures as well as its 1978 report Rural Income Fluctuations; and Professor Lloyd in his Victorian rural economics study of 1986. A device which operates directly on income to allow farmers to take action to reduce income instability would reduce the pressure on government to support a variety of alternative stabilisation measures. Many alternative measures act directly on prices or the quantity of production, with adverse implications for generally efficient industry operations. As well, we would wish to avoid measures which conflict with our general goal of an open international trading environment. For example, primary industries frequently seek to take common action through arrangements such as commodity price stabilisation schemes, although these rely on government backing. to operate effectively. The Government is supporting a number of price underwriting schemes but as a general policy believes that they should deal only with extraordinary downwards price movements and that industry should assume increasing responsibility for meeting their costs. That is, the Government, while acting to alleviate the pressures created through fluctuating incomes, believes that the price mechanism, which is transparent and rapidly transmits prevailing conditions, forms the most important base for decision making by producers. The original lED scheme, established in 1976, was tax linked, providing tax deductability on deposit and tax liability on withdrawal and a non-commercial interest rate on the full deposit. However, the operation of both IEDs and. tax averaging was distorted by the operation of 'in-out' averaging, introduced in 1977, whereby primary producers were taxed at the lower of the average and standard rates. The lED scheme was revised in 1983, replacing' the tax deductability incentive with an interest subsidy so that the interest earned on deposits was two percentage points above the short term Government bond rate. At the same time 'in-out' averaging was abolished. However, deposits have fallen away rapidly since the introduction of the new scheme. To some extent this would reflect the greater range of financial in&truments available following the deregulation of financial markets in 1984. It - ay also reflect the significant downturns in the sector, for example the 1982-83 drought and severe downturns in industries such as wheat, sugar and rice. The Government has therefore decided to introduce a tax-linked lED scheme which overcomes the drawbacks associated with the tax-linked scheme which operated until 1983. Because this new scheme is tax-linked amendments are needed to two Acts-the Loan. (Income Equalisation Deposits) Act 1976 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. The amendments to the Loan (Income Equalisation Deposits) Act 1976 are necessary to establish how deposits can be made, the determination of interest on deposits, the withdrawal. of deposits and the application of a withholding, tax to withdrawals. The amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act· 1936 a,re necessary to provide deductability of eligible deposits and for the taxation of deposits - hen withdrawn. In the new scheme deposits will be tax deductable in the year of deposit and assessable for income tax purposes in the year of withdrawal. However, a number of changes will be introduced to ensure that unwarranted benefits are not available. Interest will be paid not on the whole deposit but only on the investment corriponent. The investment component reflects the value of the deposit when reduced by the notional tax that would have applied in the year in which it was deposited. This will ensure that interest is not paid on that part of the deposit which would otherwise have been paid in tax. As it is not possible to calculate the investment component for each .deposit according to the depositor's individual marginal tax rate in the year of deposit, as the marginal tax' rate will not be known then, a standard adjustment will be made to all deposits to determine the investment component. The adjustment rate will reflect the typical marginal tax rate of depositors. The rate will be set initially at 39 per cent, to apply from 1 July 1989- Consequently, the value of deposits will be reduced by 39 per cent to determine the investment component which will earn interest. Interest will be at the short term Commonwealth bond rate. A minimum deposit term' of one year will apply to deposits. Further, a withholding tax' will apply to withdrawals to ensure that there is no undue deferral of tax in the year of withdrawal and that withdrawals are not manipulated to gain tax advantages. As the taxpayer's marginal tax rate for the year of withdrawal will not be known when a withdrawal is made, the rate of tax to be deducted will be set at it standard rate to apply to all withdrawals. This rate will represent the typical marginal tax rate of withdrawees in that year. For 1989-90 the rate will be 29 per cent. The withholding tax will have provisions allowing withdrawees to have the rate of withholding tax reduced if they expect their marginal tax, based on their total taxable income, to be significantly lower that year. This will ensure that the withholding tax is not harsh in its treatment of farmers who seek to withdrawlEDs in years of poor income. Variations may' be obtained through an application to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy when making a withdrawal. As the purpose of IEDs is to encourage farmers to provide for income fluctuations the tax deduction will be available only to primary producers. Consistent with this, deposits in any year will be limited to net taxable income from primary production in that year. An upper limit of $250,000 will apply to the amount of tax deduct able deposits that can be accumulated. This represents a generous provision to maintain against income instability. For example, $250,000 is equivalent to total farm costs for three years for an average farm. Deposits will be deemed to be withdrawn when a taxpayer ceases to be a primary producer. The scheme will be administered by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. Deposits must be made by 30 June of the financial year. A minimum sum of $5,000 will apply to deposits and withdrawals. Deposits must be accompanied by a fee of $20 which will cover administrative costs. In the light of the introduction of the new lED scheme, the Government has developed arrangements to phase out both the present scheme as well, as the remaining deposits in the pre- 1983 tax-linked scheme. Deposits will paid not be accepted in the current lED scheme after 30 June 1989 and deposits in the scheme will be deemed to mature on 30 June 1992, when they will be repaid. This is consistent with the nature of the scheme, under which deposits are essentially financial instruments of the nature of bonds. A sum of deposits remains in the pre-1983 tax-linked scheme, notwithstanding that interest on these deposits has been phased to zero. These deposits will be automatically transferred to the new scheme and will attract interest and be subject to the conditions on withdrawal which will apply to the new scheme. They will als9 form patt of the $250,000 limit on the total amount of tax deductable deposits which may be held. Such deposits would not, of course, attract a further tax deduction when transferred. The Government is confident that the new lED scheme will make a significant contribution towards assisting farmers stabilise their incomes. I commend the Bill to honourable members and I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Lloyd) adjourned. NA (ELECTRICITY) BILL 1989 EmptyHere Morris, and read a first time. Second Reading ; EmptyHere ister for Industrial Relations and Minister Assisting the Treasurer) (9.52)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the Northern Territory Grant (Electricity) Bill 1989 is to provide for - he continuation of a grant to the Northern Territory to subsidise its electricity operations in 1989-90. The Commonwealth Government has subsidised the Territory's electricity operations since self-government. The arrange.ments that commenced in 1985-86 provided for an annual indexed payment of $40m until 1988-89. This amount has applied with the exception of 1986-87 when a lower amount was paid because of reduced oil prices and .budgetary considerations. The amount that was provided for 1988-89 was $50.9m. It was envisaged when the arrangements were put in place in 1985-86 that electricity assistance to the Northern Territory would terminate after this financial year. Accordingly, there was no provision made for such assistance in the forward estimates. However, it is now evident that the.-om­ plete cessation of electricity assistance in 1989-90 would place an unreasonable strain on the finances of the Northern Territory and its Power and Water Authority. The effects of this on the day-today finances of Territory households through significant rises in the cost of electricity would also be unreasonable. This point was raised with my colleague the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) by the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Snowdon) and Senator Collins. The Treasurer agreed that Territorians should be shielded from massive electricity price rises. His response to this issue is an excellent example of how vigorous representations by our Government colleagues from the Northern Territory have won for the people of the Northern Territory protection from what would otherwise have, been a J;l1ajor attack on their standard of living. The Government therefore has decided to continue assistance for electricity generation and distribution beyond 1988-89. In respect of 1989-90, a grant of $40m is to be provided. This Bill provides appropriation for that amount. In order to help the Territory adjust to the lower level of assistance, it is also intended that the $40m grant for 198990 be paid before the end of 1988-89. The Commonwealth has agreed with the Territory that in the years following 1989-90 the level of assistance will be fully phased out. .It is inte-ded that the grant will be reduced to $30m for 1990-91, to $20m in 1991-92, and $lOm in 1992-93. The grant will be discontinued in 1993-94. The Government's offer of assistance to the Notthern Territory provides for the amount of grants for 1990-91 to 1992-93 to be reviewed in the event that more favourable circumstances arise. Grants for those years will be provided for under the normal appropriaticm Bills in the relevant years. In addition to these payments, the Government has decided to waive, from 1 July 1989, the Northern Territory's electricity debt to the Commonwealth with a net present value of $31.9m. This will relieve the Territory of scheduled repayments of principal and payments of interest to a cash value of $6.4m for each of the next nine. ye!l.rs. The Northern Territory will also be able to continue to submit requests to the Treasurer for special additions to its global borrowing limits to fund the remaining electricity operating def"" icits of the Power and Water Authority. The assistance which has been agreed with the Northern Territory for its electricity operations is an important part of the Commonwealth's financial assistance to the Territory. The arrangements have been designed to ensure that the adjustments to the Territory's finances will not be unmanageable in anyone year. Without the proposed assistance, the burden of restraint which the Northern Territory would be expected to bear would be far greater than that of the States. Nevertheless, the Commonwealth is clearly indicating that assistance in respect of the Territory's electricity operations cannot continue indefinitely. For that reason the Commonwealth has insisted in its negotiations with the Northern Territory that the assistance be phased out. I commend this Bill to the House and present the associated explanatory memorandum. Debate (on' motion by Mr Beale) adjourned. LOCAL GOVERNMENT (FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE) AMENDMENT BILL 1989 Bill-by leave-presented by Mr Holding, and read a first time. Second Reading",95
245,Mr HOLDING ,NORTHERN TERRITORY GRANT,"Melbourne Ports-Min­ ister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories and Minister Assisting the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs) (9.56)-I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Local Government (Financial Assistance) Amendment Bill 1989 provides for an increase in the level of general purpose financial assistance being provided for local government in 1989-90. The 1989-90 level of assistance is to be $671m. This compares with last year's assistance of $652.5m, an increase of $18.5m. It is necessary to amend the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1986 because of changes regarding general purpose payments to the States which were agreed at the recent Premiers Conference. Under that Act, general purpose financial assistance for local government for 1989-90 and subsequent years was to be determined by changing the amount with respect to the previous year by the percentage change to Commonwealth general purpose payments to the States. For this purpose, general purpose payments to the States are defined by the Act, under section 6 (5) (A), to include financial assistance grants, identified health grants and general purpose capital assistance payments. Part of the capital assistance to the States and the Northern Territory is now to be transferred to the Commonwealth-State housing agreement. So that local government is not unintentionally disadvantaged by this change, the Government has decided to include in the Act an amount in lieu of the existing formula. The amount of $671m: presents a 2.8 per cent increase over local government's entitlement in 1989-90 of $652m. It is a greater increase than would have occurred had the present formula not been amended. Had this not occurred payments to local government would have been $18.8m less than the proposed payment. The payment will also be some $5m more than if local government funding had been aligned to the increase which the States are to receive. As a result, the increase in payments is 2.8 per cent which is more than the increase in comparable payments to the States and the Northern Territory. Consistent with the treatment of the States, the b!lse amount of funds for local government will also be adjusted for any differences between the current forecast of the consumer price index and the actual inflation rate. The changes to the Act are consistent with an earlier undertaking of the Government to treat local government no less favourably than the States in respect of general purpose financial assistance. Given the Government's continuing need to restrain its own expenditure, this Bill provides a good outcome for local government. When taken with the Government's decision in April to permit local govern-ent to levy rates and charges on Telecom Australia and Australia Post properties, it means. that in 1989-90 local government is estimated to be some $47m better off. I commend the Bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Beale) adjourned.

246,Mr BARRY JONES ,CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT,"Lalor-Minister for Science, Customs and Small Business) (10.00)-I move: That the BiJJ be now read a second time. The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1989, which is now. before the House, contains amendments to implement new tariff measures for the sugar industry and comes into operation from 1 July 1989. These changes follow a report by the Senate Standing Committee on Industry,' Science and Technology and form part of an assistance pa.ckage which also includes: the termination of the sugar agreement Act 1985; the lifting of the sugar import embargo; and the referral of assistance' arrangements for the industry to the Industries Assistance Commission for inquiry and report in 1991. For most sugar products, the Bill proposes a specific general tariff rate of 11.5c per kilogram phasing to 7c per kilogram by 1 July 1992. Special rates per Papua New Guinea, Forum island countries and developing countries have been set at five percentage points below the general tariff rate. Tariffs. on the remaining products, for example, cane molasses other than treacle, will remain at their current levels. All sugar products of New Zealand origin will remain free of customs duty. Duty rates proposed to operate from 1 July 1992 will, of course, be subject to the outcome of the 1991 industry review. Financial Impact Statement It is difficult to assess what volume and value of sugar imports can be expected following the removal of the embargo. However, they are expected to be low and their financial impact minimal. Details of the amendments contained in this Bill have been included in an explanatory memorandum which has been circulated for the information of honourable members. I commend the Bill to the House.

247,Mr ROBERT BROWN ,MOTOR VEHICLE STANDARDS BILL,"Charlton-Minister for Land Transport and Shipping Support) (10.02)-I move: . That the Bill be now read a second time. Each year in Australia some 2,800 people are killed on our roads and 30,000 seriously injured. In addition to the trauma and suffering which results from these crashes, the aftermath of this carnage costs the Australian community some $5,700m annually. This is equivalent to approximately $350 per head of population. Fortunately, concerted road safety activities have been able to reduce the pointless waste. It can be shown, for example, that road fatalities are decreasing when compared with the number of vehicles on the road and the distances being travelled. A vital component of the Federal Government's road safety strategy is to make the motor vehicle as safe as possible. Our aim is - o prevent the crash in the. first place and, In the event that a crash occurs, to protect the occupants. To this end, over the past. 20 years, a certification system for motor vehicles has been developed between Federal and State governments and the vehicle industry. This is managed by the Federal Office of Road Safety, and the cornerstone is the Australian design rule system. Australian design rules were introduced in the early 1970s to provide minimum standards for motor vehicles and trailers. Each design rule sets down performance and design standards for particular features or characteristics. There is now a range of design rules. covering a wide variety of safety requirements .. These include seat belts, brakes, tyres and other features to improve occupant protection. There are requirements for areas such as lighting which are intended. to help prevent crashes. There are also standards for vehicle exhaust emission, noise and anti-theft requirements. This system has undergone a major review in recent years which has resulted in significant cost savings for the industry by way of reduced paper work and administrative work. load. The system today includes a comprehensive program of audit and surveil1989 lance of manufacturers' performance against the design rules. This helps ensure that production vehicles continue to meet the standards. There have been significant successes and progress since the introduction of the design rules in the early 1970s. There have also been some continuing problems. These have largely resulted from inconsistencies in the way the design rules have been implemented by individual States or Territories. The vehicle certification system has in the past rested largely on cooperation and consultation. The Commonwealth has traditionally prepared the standards, but has had no legal basis for enforcing them. The States and Territories have used their vehicle registration laws to call up the design rules. Despite considerable efforts to standardise the implementation of the rules, uniformity has proved an elusive goal. Local interests have unfortunately meant continuing instances where the design rules have not been implemented uniformly by the States and Territories. Vehicle manufacturers have, therefore, been faced with the need to negotiate with up to eight separate administrations in order to get clearance to market their vehicles across Australia. In some cases, it has meant that special model variants have had to be produced to satisfy registration requirements of one State or Territory. Needless t6 say, in a market the size of Australia's the costs involved in this approach can be significant and are invariably passed on to the consumer. Australian industry can no longer afford to carry unnecessary costs. We must ensure that we provide the right environment to develop an efficient and competitive vehicle industry. This Bill represents another step on that path. Now that' Australian vehicle manufacturers are looking to rationalise operations with their international parents and increasingly to export their vehicles, the question of international harmonisation also arises. The design rules have been drafted, for some time, on the basis of hilTmonising with international standards wherever possible. Over the past five years we have moved from a situation where about 30 per cent of Australian standards were harmonised to some 60 per cent harmonisation today. Obviously more can be done. Greater harmonisation means that' Australian vehicles can compete' more efficiently in the international market and Australia needs to develop more manufactured exports. Alignment with international standards also means that the Australian community gets the benefit of the latest international safety standards. In 1988 the Inter-State Commission prepared a major report into the need for harmonisation of road safety regulations in Australia. The first recommendation of the report was that a single set of Federal legislation be introduced to ensure uniform vehicle design and construction standards on a national basis. This Bill is intended to put that recommendation into effect. The principal objective of this Bill, then, is to enable the Federal Government to establish and apply nationally uniform standards for motor vehicle safety and environmental quality expected by the community. This legislation is consistent with the Government's microeconomic reforms, in that regulatory costs to industry are reduced. Eight sets of regulations will be replaced by one. Transport is a key issue in the Government's reform agenda. This legislation' will help motor vehicle industry efficiency with benefits for both domestic and international trade. The Bill will underpin national uniformity. It includes provisions aimed at avoiding additional local requirements, by applying the same standards to all vehicles at the time of their first sale in Australia, regardless of source. The Bill will ensure the maintenance of the levels of safety and environmental quality that the community rightfully expects. This represents a major improvement over the current situation, particularly concerning second-hand imported vehicles. As it happens, this is a timely Bill. Honourable members will be aware that there have been increased imports of substandard, second-hand motor vehicles. These do not have a number of major safety features and the fact that they are permitted registration in some States but not others is a vivid demonstration of the problems of non-uniformity. A truly national approach will avoid these situations. I am advised that some examples of the way in which these vehicles do not meet the design rules include a lack of protection against side impacts, inferior seat belts and lack of child restraint fittings. Other examples include inferior tyre and breaking standards. This is because they are built for low speed driving in densely populated cities, such as those in Japan, and Japanese cars just do not travel as far or as fast as cars used in Australia. These standards will be declared by ministerial order and I intend to call up the existing Australian design rules as soon as this legislation comes into effect. Honourable members will be interested to know that the Australian design rules have been developed as a result of an extensive process of consultation with State and Territory governments, industry, unions and users. The rules have been endorsed by Federal, State and Territory Ministers at the Australian Transport Advisory Council and the Australian Environment Council as appropriate. The design rules thus reflect the views of the Australian community regarding the level of safety and environmental quality it wants. At the time of declaration, the standards will automatically apply to all vehiclescoming onto the market in Australia for the first time. Advance notice has also been given to vehicle importers by my press statement earlier this week. They can now make the necessary arrangements to ensure that cars that they import comply with the design rules, or can be modified in order to comply. This Bill derives its power from the Constitution, section 51 (xx) in relation to corporations, and section 51 (1), the trade and commerce power, in relation to individuals and unincorporated bodies. The declared standards will apply to vehicles offered for sale in Australia prior to first registration. After first registration State or Territory laws will then apply. Recalls of defective vehicles will be handled under industry codes and the provisions of the Trade Practices Act, as they are today. Under the arrangements proposed in this Bill it is intended that States and Territories will retain their responsibility to register motor vehicles for use on Australian roads. In the same way, the States and Territories will retain responsibility for ensuring that vehicles remain road worthy throughout their useful life. However, it is intended that the Austrlaian design rules be the sole criteria for the supply of vehicles to the Australian market. The Bill contains appropriate provisions to achieve this. I believe that comprehensive consultation arrangements are essential to ensure that the best possible advice is received during the development of new or revised standards. This should include advice from all interested parties including State and Territory regulatory authorities, industry and road users. I propose to retain the existing advisory committee structure agreed to under the auspices of the Australian Transport Advisory Council and the Australian Environment .Council unless experience with the new arrangements shows that better alternatives can be found. The Bill provides power to declare national vehicle design and safety standards by ministerial order. Orders will be tabled in both Houses of the Parliament and will be subject to disallowance in the normal way. As I said earlier, it is my intention to call up the existing Australian design rules as the national standards. ,. The Bill also provides for identification of vehicles that comply with the design rules. It cov-rs monitoring the manufacturing .and testing processes of manufacturers to ensure that production vehicles continue to meet the standards. There· will be provision for the appointment of inspectors to carry out the aUditing and surveillance functions. These inspectors will comprise a central group of Commonwealth officers assisted where appropriate by State and Territory officers. Officials of other countries' regulatory authorities working under contract or other cooperative agreements will help to audit overseas manufacturers. There will also be provisions to allow the appointment of agents from the private sector. The Federal Government already provides the resources to operate the existing system. The Federal Office of Road Safety manages the development of standards and the certification procedures but until the present time has had no legislation to administer them. The new arrangements proposed in this Bill will be administered within the Department of Transport and Communications, with only a modest supplement to existing resources in the area. There should be savings available to the States as they will be able to redeploy scarce resources to other priority areas. Furthermore, it is important to note that the costs of the existing certification system are fully recove.red from the vehicle industry. The Bill provides for cost recovery under the new arrangements. It is unlikely that charges will need to be increased at the present time. The Bill provides for the appointment of an administrator who will be responsible for the day to day operation of the system. The administrator will not have the power to declare new standards or withdraw approvals but will have the delegated powers necessary for the efficient and effective operation of the new arrangements. There will be provision for the cancellation or suspension, under prescribed circumstances, of the approvals held by manufacturers or importers. The Bill provides for appropriate sanctions for prescribed offences such as falsely identifying a vehicle as complying with the standards or for supplying a vehicle which does not meet the national standards. While it will not be possible for other governments to impose unique local standards, there will be no restrictions on manufacturers offering additional features on their vehicles as part of their marketing strategy. The Bill provides control over the import of vehicles, both new and second-hand. There will be procedures to allow non-standard vehicles into Australia' provided that the Minister is satisfied that proper arrangements exist to modify the vehicles to ensure that they meet the standards. Provision will also be made in the regulations for the importation of vehicles which are bona fide personal possessions. This will apply to migrants or Australian citizens returning from long periods overseas. There will also be provision to allow for test or evaluation vehicles and for the exemption of certain classes of vehicles, such. as tractors and road-making machinery, from the requirements of the Act. Consistent with this Government's policies on open government, the Bill provides avenues for access to the normal administrative law arrangements. Anyone who is aggrieved by a decision made under the provision of the Bill will be able to seek redress in the normal way. In summary, this Bill will provide for the first time in Australia a single set of standards for the design and construction of motor vehicles and trailers. As a direct result of this national uniformity, every Australian will benefit. The vehicle industry will not be faced with additional costs which have to be passed on to the buyer. The safety and environmental standards which we have all come to expect will be enforced and those few unscrupulous operators who are looking to make a quick profit at the expense of our community safety will have to meet the same standards.

251,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"Mr Andrew)I understand that it is the wish of the House 'to debate the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3) 1989 with the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No.2) 1989 and the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill 1989. There being no objection, the Chair will allow that course to be followed.",106
252,Mr MCGAURAN ,EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"Gippsland) (10.29)It needs to be said at the outset that the Government has allowed a mere 40 minutes for this rather complex legislation-the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3), the Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No;;2) and th-. Excise Tariff Amendment Bill-to be d-bated . One Bill, an Bill, .inc<;>rporates a whole number of different - trands affecting excise rates. Only minutes is being allowed. What sort of ernment js it that has so twisted its operaduced tion.sthat 40 minut- is all it will allow Opposition in which to represent the legitipontificated mate interests of a great many groups? It an absolute disgrace that this Government is so unable to manage. the business of the House that the democratic process suffers a result. It is appropriate that at this hour this evening the galleries are unusually filled with representatives of local governsafety ment who can see how this Government standard ramrods legislation through the Parliament because of its ineptness and unwillingness allow free and open. debate. How can the Parliament properly scrutinmotor ise government legislation if so little time is allowed to debate complex pieces of legislais tion? It is the Executive gone mad. Any selfthe respecting backbencher on the Government side should be as outraged as members of the Opposition and should do something about it. It is an absolute disgrace. No-one on the Government side could possibly deAfter fend the guillotining of these three pieces legislation of which I, as shadow Minister, have charge for the Opposition. Nor could anyone defend the guillotining of 32 pieces of legislation that will be dealt with in same fash/onover the next few days. I will not dwell on the matter, for it speaks for itself. The Government is utterly incompeunderstand tent. It shows disdain for the legislative ess. The Parliament and the people we represent are the poorer for it. In a mere 40 minutes that must be shared among several speakers, how does one hope to cover the number of diff-rent elements contained these three pieces of legislation? Let me deal first with the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3). This deals in a number of different with the diesel fuel rebate scheme. It quite rightly corrects some anomalies that have lirisen, an<;i extends coverage in an expanded :way for the fishing, mining d!lstri- at the grand cost to government of $40mcollectively, being $Sm for the coverthe .age of a.dditional fishing operations, $3m additional forestry operations and $12m for omnibus additional mining operations. Just prior to the commencement of this 40 debate, the Minister for Land Transport and govShipping Support ( Mr Robert Brown) introlegislation dealing with standards of the safety for motor vehicles during. which he about the need to maintain safety is standards for vehicles so as to reduce the road toll. As he said this evening, some $S.7 billion is spent each year on road accident as victims. I just wish that .the pontificating late sanctimonious way in which the Minister sought to appease people's concern about the standards for vehicles extended to the of roads. If the Minister was truly honest he would admit that the standard of to roads has as much to do with the causes of road accidents as the safety standards for vehicles-if not a great deal more. Last week I had the great pleasure-there nO other way to put it-of debating with Minister before a biannual gathering of the Victorian Municipal Association. During that meeting the Minister was catcalled and booed by some of the SOO representatives of local government from throughout Victoria. being given Ii very polite reception at of the start, he was booed because of his arrogance, his disdain for his audience and his complete inability to give any sort of commitment to the formulation-let alone the the presentation-of a Government policy on road funding. He arrived late, left early and offended each and every person there, but I that that is his form. He did that procup at Coolangatta at a similar meeting only a couple of weeks ago. There is no doubt that this Minister is utterly out of touch with the requirements of local government. I feel sorry for him. It is pitiful that this Minister should think he can treat representatives of in local government as stupid fools. Mr Robert Brown-I raise a point of order. I think it is quite apparent that the honourable member's contribution bears no ways relevance to this legislation.",106
253,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"Mr Andrew)Order! The Minister does not have a valid and ,forestry inpoint of order.",107
254,Mr MCGAURAN,EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"We are dealing with diesel fuel rebate scheme, so it is approfor priate that we look at the level of excise. The one thing that the Minister sought to cling to before this very hostile audience was his much touted Australian Centennial Roads Development Act, but he did not tell the audience that the return to roads from the high excise of about 22c for every litre is only 4.95c. Only 4.95c of the excise on every litre of fuel is allocated by this Government to road funding. Before this much self-praised centennial roads program was introduced, that allocation was 5.23c per litre, so the Minister lowered the base; he cut the amount of funding for roads. The Opposition approaches the guillotining of this legislationthe cutting off of proper debate-with the same frustration as it approaches the Minister's publicity about his plans and proposals for roads in this country. Let me now look at the 'Excise Tariff Amendment Bill, another of the three Bills being dealt with in this cognate debate. This Bill has a number of functions, the first of which is to alter the excise duty on top crude oil. Top crude oil is used in the production process at refineries and therefore it attracts no excise. It is understood that some of that top crude oil was being used by one or two of the oil companies for fuel heaters in homes and thereby not attracting excise. Let us just' say that that loophole has been closed, so that any top crude oil not used in the production in refineries will now attract excise. Secondly, this legislation decreases the excise on liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), of which there is a six-monthly review. The Government has reduced the excise taking into account the lower export prices obtained for: LPG over the six months to September 1988. The Government takes into account the weighted average of the prices received from exports and local sales of LPG in the preceding six months period. Thirdly, this legislation reduces the excise on beer. This is to give effect to the Government's promise in the August' 1988 Budget. Believe it or not, that will cost the Government a massive $730m, but $330m will be immediately recouped because at 'the same time a sales tax has been imposed on beer to bring it into line with other alcohol products. Beer with an alcohol concentration of 1.15 and below will not attract excise; in other words, the position of the ultralight beers will remain the same-they will not attract excise-but beer with alcohol volumes above 1015 will attract excis- on a sliding scale, so the higher the volume of alcohol, the higher the excise. The end result is that the 'price of beer drops because the excise is .lowered, This is from a government that claims that there is no mdney for road funding, no money for the scientific community while the· scientific infrastructure in this country falls down around our ears and no funding for the defence personnel even though the Royal Australian Air Force is being decimated. In my electorate, at Sale, the. roulettes team has been more or less disbanded. It now has. only two pilots. What sort of Roulette team will be get with two pilots? The Government always hides behind. the fact that there is no money. It can find $730m to try to buy votes from the beer drinkers of this country, but it cannot find any money anywhere for roads, the defence forces, the scientific community or some of those infrastructure elements in our country that so desperately need assistance. The point to be made is that there is an element of worthiness about encouraging low alcohol beer. Of course, nobody would have any doubts about that at all, but people should not be fooled by this Government's supposed brave attempt at reduction in government expenditure. The truth is that this Government does not make the hard decisions about government expenditure. Reduc"" tions are never in the recurrent area, they are always· in capital funding, whether it be the selling off of the Tokyo Embas-y or shipbuilding yards. The fact is that this Government will not attack the hard areas. Ones which comes to mind are the wastage that occurs in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the fraud and duplicity that occur in some of the welfare areas. '. To allow other members of the Opposition to make a contribution to this cognate debate I will wind up my remarks. In summary, it is an ahsolute disgrace of the worse kind that the Government should so shorten debate on important pieces of legislation. I have had an opportunity to do no more than skim over the top of a number of different elements that need to be discussed' in this Parliament of the elected reptesentatives: of the people. How accountable is this Government for its legislation when it: allows no time to speak of for.. d.ebate. on such legislation? It reflects, at best, on the Government's legislative competence and, at worse, on its belief in the democratic operations of this' Parliament. \ .. ;. , ., "" . l\fr JlRUMBY (Bendigo) (10.42)-1 sup.POJt' t-e' Customs and ExCise' Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3), the Customs Tariff ,Am-ndm-l1t ,Bill .(-o. 2). and the Excise Tanff Amendmen,t Bin, which we are debating cognately: These Bills contain a number of omnibus amendments to Customs arid Excise legislation. I should make a brief comment in response to the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr MCGauran) in relation to the guillotine the Goverhment has imposed. The Government, has set .out in an orderly way the time available for debate on this issue and a number' of other pieces of legislation before the House. . , Mr .Beale-You could .have organised your time better, you. goqse.",107
255,Mr BRUMBY,EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"This Government gets on with the job. It is about making decisions for Australians. It is the height of hypocrisy for the honourable member for Gippsland to talk in this House about Government policymaking and getting on with the job. It is now May 1989 and we are still waiting for a much vaunted, much lauded policy which was supposed to be released by. the Opposition in August last year. It is May 1989. Where is the Opposition's tax policy? Where is its economic policy? The Opposition is a hopeless bunch. The Opposition is hopelessly divided over every issue that comes before this Parliament. It is hopelessly divided on economic policy and tax, and it cannot make decisions relating to wheat deregulation or immigration. The Opposition is hopelessly divided; it should not lecture us about not getting on with the job. This is an orderly way to. put legislation through the House, and that is precisely what this Government is doing-getting on with the job we started in 1983. The Excise Tariff Amendment Bill contains a basic amendment which provides for a lower rate of taxation on low alcohol beer. The honourable member for Gippsland noted .tP!lt there. area. n,umber of representatives pf,1oca,1 goyernment organisations in. . lery . tQnight. .I am particularly pleased to note that there are representatives from .the councils of Bendigo, Strathfieldsaye and Marong in my electorate of Bendigo. In relation to the points made by the honourable member for Gippsland, frankly, I found them , . rather insulting in relation to low alcohol beer. Almost without exception, every local government organisation in my electorate wrote to me in 1988 asking me to speak to the Treasurer ( Mr Keating) in support of a lower rate of taxation on low alcohol beer. I took those representations to Canberra. Many local government authorities throughout Australia also wrote to the Treasurer saying that they would favour the introduction of a lower taxation regime on low alcohol beer. That is precisely what we introduced in the August 1988 Budget. There was a $700m cost in loss of excise and a $300m gain in terms of the sales tax, so the net cost to the Commonwealth was $400m. The honourable member for Gippsland begrudgingly lauds part of that decision, and acknowledges that there was some worthiness in it. There is a lot of worthiness in that decision.' Since we reduced the prices for low alcohol beer, its consumption has risen considerably at the expense of high alcohol beer. One does not have to be an expert beer drinker to know-one can go to a hotel or a liquor outlet today and look at the sale of, say, Fosters Light compared with the sale of normal Fosters-that the marketing strategy for low alcohol beer has grown in strength in the marketplace. So our strategy has been successful in encouraging people to drink low alcohol beer instead of high alcohol beer. In turn; there are demonstrable health benefits to the Australian community. There are also road safety benefits. The honourable member for Gippsland mentioned motor vehicle accidents in Australia. The fact is that our rate of road accidents is still appallingly high. One of the contributing factors is still drunk driving. Low alcohol beers are making a contribution to keeping people below the vital .05 per cent level. So this measure is important from the road safety point of view. It has also produced benefits in. reducing the consumer price index, which was part of the Government's strategy. As I said, we received representations from local govern the' gal- ment. We took account of those representations . Mt MACKellar-Another fiddle.",109
256,Mr BRUMBY,EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"That comment is insulting to local government. We took account of those views and we reduced the rate of tax on low alcohol beer. If one shops around in the Bendigo area, for instance, one will find that one can buy two dozen cans of Fosters Light for as little as $16. This measure has resulted in an appreciable drop in, the, price of low alcohol beer. I certainly support the legislation which is before the House. The Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3) provides some further concessions in relation to the diesel fuel rebate for specified off-road users. Two years ago this Government took a decision to exempt primary producers from diesel fuel excise. That decision cost the Government many tens of millions of dollars a year in lost revenue. It is one which is heartily appreciated by primary producers. It saves them a great deal, havirig regard to the amount of diesel fuel they purchase. This legislation broadens the scope of those concessions to include certain forestry, fishing and mining operations. I support that aspect of the legislation. The real point I wanted to make in relation to fuel excise relates to that part of fuel excise which is contributed by State rail authorities. Something like $130m a year is contributed by State rail authorities through fuel excises. The fact is that rail authorities do not use roads, they use railway lines. I have always thought it doubtful logic that rail authorities be compelled to pay fuel excise. As I say, it is a significant amount. I think it is even more questionable why rail authorities should be paying the 5c levy which contributes""to the land transport trust fund. In fact, railway authorities contribute some $30m of the $1.2 billion that is raised from that trust fund. I simply want to express the view-Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER ( Mrs Dar':' Iing)---.:.Order!

This was inadvertently omitted from the draft of the Bill as introduced, though the explanatory memorandum which was, tabled with the Bill did envisage, on page 4, that the, penalty notice option proposed by this proposed new section would include repayment of the rebate wrongly paid, together with the penalty component.

258,Mr TUCKEY ,EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"O'Connor)' (10.53)--1.!rtle Bill is being taken as a whole, and lintend to make my comments accordinglY.'Iti all of this legislation, particularly that relating to the excise on alcohol, the point that has been forgotten is that the Government had a number of choices for the purpose of achieving its fiddle· of the consumer price index (CPI). The one that it practised most recently, in respect of housing, was just to keep going through various activities and various formulae until it found the lowest figure. We now have a situation in which pensioners are confronted, in shopping centres, with an increase of 1.6 per cent in inflation, whereas, of course, the Government figure will be only 1 per cent. In the case of low-alcohol beer, it is easy to take the $400m net off, but the Government could just as easily have taken it off fuel and, thereby, benefited more people. At the moment, to get some benefit under the CPI one has to be an alcoholic pensioner, and of course, most pensioners today cannot afford that. The reality is that it would have been much better had the Government chosen to work its CPI fiddle by taking an equivalent amount off something, like fuel, that everybody in the community uses or benefits from. My recollection is that some 15 per cent of Australia's gross domestic product--$l in $7-is consumed by freight. It was interesting to hear the Government's supporters speak in their normal self-cOngratulatory way. Today we have heard them even moralising. It was quite remarkable this morning to witness people moralising about standards and about how people behave. As has been said, in this place history cannot be rewritten. It is all on the record and these days the record includes television morgues-if one likes to call them that. I understand that the Prime Minister was reminded of some of his activities at the time of his coup, when he sank the knife well and truly into· the gentleman who now occupies the position of Governor General. The reality is that all these things come down to one point. There was nothing wrong with the Government's proposal---'MONICA",110

When we were debating it cognately earlier I made a point about the contribution of excise by State rail authorities. I simply said that, to my mind, there is a rationale for the Government at least to have a look at whether the State rail authorities ought to be making that contribution through fuel excise since the rail authorities themselves do not use the railway system.' The! excise levy in effect is essentially paid by the rliral and long haul rail systems-those that use diesel. Removal of the levy would obviously make rail more competitive and would thereby encourage rail use. It would do that by reducing freight costs. It would conceivably therefore increase rail use and, in that way, reduce the road repair bill and reduce the costs of polll,ltion in terms of exhaust emissions, noise, traffic congestion and so on. If a decision were taken to exempt State rail authorities from paying that excise on fuel, it would also of course assist those State rail authorities to compete in a deregulated environment. As we recently deregulated the environment in wheat marketing, transport, handling and storage, this is really a decision which ought to be considered by the Government. In summary, I am suggesting that, as we already have a series of exemptions from fuel excise fot such people as primary producers, miners, foresters, and so on, we should ,now look at examining whether that exemption ought to be extended to State rail authorities., They contribute about $130m' a year in fuel taxes. Use of the road system is not involved. In terms of the increased competition, which this Govermrient is introducing in a number of areas of the economy, particu"" larly in relation to wheat transport, I believe that there is a case for looking at exempting State rail authorities from that excise contribution. As I have said, if that were the case it would mean that State rail authorities would be in a position to use those savings to invest in the rail network, making it more efficient and thereby ensuring that lower freight costs could be offered, particularly to primary producers. In turn, that would increase efficiencies and allow us to expand export markets. I hope that the Government will have a look at this issue in the future. I know it is not a simple issue. It is a yery complex issue, and a number of arguments can be advanced either way. I certainly think that the Government should consider exempting the State rail authorities from the excise contribution. The rail authorities would then be able to make a bigger investment in tracks and 'infrastructure, and' thereby offer a more efficient and competitive service. In turn, this could; see mOre of our wheat,grains and other primary' products being hauled by rail, at a lower price assisting our primary producers and exporters and contributing to our balance of payments. I simply say that I hope the Government will have a ,lookal this matter and that we can provide at least some relief' to the State, rail authorities .to thus enable them to put further funds into the State rail systems, to invest in their systems in order to make them more efficient and more competitive.",111
261,Mr MCGAURAN ,EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT BILL,"Gippsland) (11.02)-1 want to make some comments in relation to the reduction of the excise duty for liquid petroleum gas (LPG), as contained in' the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill. The Opposition believes that a deregulated' market for LPG would see a greater industry incentive to increase availability of supply, to prolong the availability of the gas beyond the next decade and to ensure the efficient allocation of the resource across the market. Admittedly, although LPG supplies are not infinite, in the short to medium term LPG will enable us to meet a number of vital objectives in relation to' our broader energy requirements. If we could diversify our energy supply by encouraging wider use of LPG, in any of its applications, then, we would be going quite some way. towards enhancing our own energy security. At present, liquid petroleum gas has varied application. Some 41 per cent of LPG consumed in Australia is used as an energy source for residential, commercial and industrial consumption. Within this component"" residential use is growing, according to the forecasts, at a rate of some 6.4 per cent per year. Some 38 per cent of LPG supply is accounted for by lise as a feedstock in the petrochemical industry, whilst the remaining 20 per cent or so is utilised as an alternative to automotive gasoline. Automotive demand is expected to increase at a modest 3.5 per cent per annum. I do not contend that domestic, industrial and automotive demand be wholly converted to LPG use, but I do believe that LPG is an under-utilised resource. It' deserves , greateutilisation because it would allow us to diversify our energy sotirc- a,ndoffsethie enormous crude oil bill Which faces us in the next decade. Liquid petroleum gas can therefore extend the life of existing crude oil reserves and offset the huge import bills that we will face next decade as a result .of the Government's excise regime. LPG also provides a not insignificant export income for Australia. The 1.3 million tonnes of LPG which was exported in 1987-88 earned Australia some $240m. Under the current policy, these earnings will fall to around $60m annUlllly at the turn of the century. Moreover, liquid petroleum gas has other important advantages for Australians. LPG burns cleanly. It has no detrimental environmental effects whatever. The Government needs to realise that if it genuinely seeks to see this resource utilised effectively, it must comprehensively deregulate the pricing system it has built up around. the gas. To comprehensively deregulate the pricing system is to remove that pricing system completely. If the Government actually possesses an energy policy, with a clearly defined strategy-beyond just motherhood statements about Australia's energy needs into the future-then it must ensure that the pricing arrangements for LPG do not discourage its development as a fuel for use within Australia. The critical end of the LPG problem concerns the price setting of the wholesale price. The critical matter is the question of how the Government can create the appropriate relationship between producers and marketers of LPG. The key to that question, which has stood.in the way of the development of LPG as a fuel, is the Government's persistence in setting the wholesale price of LPG, The Government made a gesture for deregulation by lifting direct control of the wholesale price, yet it faltered. It transferred responsibility for the setting of the wholesale price of LPG to the Prices Surveillance Authority (PSA). While waving the banner of deregulation about its head, it continued with the regulatory policy through the PSA. The Minister for Resources, Senator Cook, likes to berate the Opposition for its deregulatory approach to LPG. He likes to create fears in the community of massive price rises in the retail price of LPG as a result of deregulation. But in doing. so he reveals his own . self-cdntradictory. and cowardly approach to policy foqnulation. Senator Cook acknowledges that the role of the PSA in setting the wholesale pric-. of LPG is unsatisfactory. In his own press statements he acknowledgeS that export controls will have to be reimposed if problems emerge in supplying domestic markets. I refer to the Minister's press release of 11 October last year. The Minister is intending to apply export controls-another regulatory device-in order to solve a supply problem in the industry. The greater this tendency, the further we get from the creation of a free market for LPG, which the Minister says is the Government's objective. In the press release of 11 October 1988 the following appears in relation to the announcement of the role of the PSA in setting the wholesale price of LPG: The Minister said the changes are an important move towards a free market in LPG-a further implementation of the Government's program of micro-economic reform. Not only has the PSA failed to solve the supply and marketing problems associated with LPG; it has moved still further from creating a free market by having recourse to export controls. The surprise in all this is that although the Minister would like to create a free market for LPG, as his press statement clearly states, he still has the temerity to castigate the Opposition for calling for deregulation in a proper way. The confusion in the Minister's response to the marketing of LPG is quite extraordinary. The coalition is prepared, unlike the Minister, to take the bit between the teeth when it comes to this policy. It is prepared, again unlike the Government, to promote a policy that it believes will secure Australia's energy supplies, despite the misinformation campaigns spread by the Government regarding the impact of deregulation on retail prices, As the Minister for Resources must know, problems of supply-such as those which have resulted in rationing in Victoria at peak periods which will run into the summer months of 1989-90-are essentially problems of pricing and industry incentive. As honourable senators will understand, the wholesale price of LPG is set by the PSA. The PSA wholesale price is geared to reflect import parity prices for LPG, a hypothetical proposition for Australia. In what little time remains in this debate, I do not have time to develop further the Opposition's deregulatory policy for LPG. I simply .wish to say that now is the opportunity for a sensible change in the Government's approach to the pricing of LPG. I realise that State regulations also apply to the acceptable mix of propane and. butane for use in various applications, especially in Victoria. This must be changed and can be changed. The PSA cap on the industry needs freeing; of that there is no question. Unless the Governme'1t acts on its supposed wish to deregulate the pricing and marketing of LPG, consumers will ultimately continue to pay a very heavy price now and into the future.",112

The States Grants (Schools Assistance) Amendment Bill ment: ' amends the 1988 principal Act to provide an additional $36.6m in appropriations for to substituting schools in 1989, including $21.7m for the clining Australian Capital Territory (ACT) in the second half of 1989. This increases the Commonwealth's schools funding in 1989 to an estimated total of $1,982.3m, consisting of separate amounts for both recurrent and capital grants and certain amounts for specificpurpose grants. In reality, the Bill makes adjustments and variations in the price Taylor). levels' of the financial schedules in the principal Act, as well as providing for grants ACT schools as a consequence of granting self-government to the Territory. The States Grants (Technical and Further Education Assistance) Amendment Bill 1989 in a like manner increases appropriations reflect cost movements in non-salary related items to December 1985 price levels and salary items to June 1989 price levels and will provide funding ,to the ACT from 1 July. Again, the Higher Education Funding Amendment. Bill ,1989 amends the 1988 Act. It is essentially a matter of supplementation funding which takes into account additional costs of increased salaries and other costs such as equipment and building costs. In line with Government policy,' it also phases out tion and T AFE. the subsidised overseas student program. The Bill reduces operating grants in 1990 and 1991 and these funds will be redirected to scholarships to enable overseas students obtain full fee places and therefore should not reduce the total level of funding availof able for institutions.

(am pleased to say thap have the support merely of the honourable member for Groom (MI' ' May I say, in talking generally about edto ucation, that this is my first opportunity to make some remarks on the portfolio since receiving the commission from the Leader of EmptyHere the education portfolio on behalf of the coto alition parties. I am very pleased to take over this portfolio. It is one of very great significance for the future of this country and it has been the' subject of much very close attention and analysis by the Opposition parties. I have the honourable member for Groom supporting me in this debate this evening. We have a very good committee chaired by Senator Baden Teague of South Australia and three very good policies in the three distinct areas of schools, higher educaIt is true to say that we are all conditioned to some extent by o,llr experience. As I come to this portfolio, like everybody, I have certo tain experiences which might be relevant to it. Firstly, I bring the experience of a parent·, four young sons, of a parent both within of the government system and within the nongovernment system. The second experience bring is perhaps a more novel one, and that is my involvement in the foundation of a school called Newhaven College in my elecdisadvantaged torate of Flinders. The school was opened 1980 under the Fraser Administration. Among the very long list of good things done by the Fraser' Government, I think that Govin ernment's support for choice in education was a very good policy that it adopted and implemented. Newhaven College was one those schools which benefited from that good policy. It was opened in 1980 by the honourable member for Hume ( Mr Fife), the Acting Deputy Leader of the Opposition. It is a secondary day school, co-educational, a Christian school and a parent-controlled school. There is always a lot of talk about government education, and non-government education institution detractors always like lio. to say that those institutions are elitist and are for only a very limited number of Ausnot tralians. This school shows the falsity of perceptions. It started with 53 students now has 345. Between 10 and 15 per cent its parent population are social security beguarantee neficiaries and in most of those cases parents would be single parents. The school's fees, because of very considerable Federal government subsidy, are able to be kept at level accessible to most Australians. The fees this year are in the vicinity of $1,100 annum. I think that is within the reach of most Australians. It is also a has been able to offer an extensive range of facilities and activities for its students and it I has had a particular interest in disadvantaged children. Another criti<;ism of the nongovernment sector is its lack of interest in children, but in this case it is in a criticism which is not well-founded. In addition to enthusiastically pursue the education policies that we have enunciated opposition, in the schools area one could not go past the concepts of choice and competition as being very important. But I also of want to place particular emphasis on the very importance of parental involvement in schools, both government and non-government, because it is my experience, I think shared by many, that if one has a system which encourages parents to have a real involvement in the education of their children, one will very greatly improve the outcomes of the educational process. That is something nonwhich I intend to give much attention to during the time in which I have this portfoIn respect of schools policy, whilst it is an a matter of money, money cannot be such put to one side when looking at the options and of government policy in that area. We have of a very clear commitment in our policy to funding levels. I think that is well the worth emphasising. After taking over the shadow portfolio I asked the Library to provide figures on Commonwealth Government a funding for schools in recent years, and I believe that the figures are very interesting. per I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a graph and a table of figures prepared by the school which Parliamentary Library.

264,Mr REITH,COMMONWEALTH,"The figures are very interesting. The 1983-84 figure in dollars per student for non-government schools in real terms-in other words, taking out inflationary effects-was $1,232.05, and the estimated figure for 1988-89 dr.opped to $1,140.50. In the government schools area, the figure for 1983-84 figure was $331.87, and that reduced to an estimated $341.52 for 1988-89. From the graph we see a constancy in funding for the States for government schools, and a levelling off, if not a slight decline, in respect of the non-government sector. I would be very interested to hear what the Minister has to say about those figures, because this Government is always quick to talk about its emphasis on schools policy and funding, but when we look at the figures we see that they tell a different story. Unfortunately, time tonight is limited by the guillotine. We spent two hours or more today on a point scoring exercise by this Government, and for those who are interested in issues of real substance to the people of Australia this has, meant that time for debate on important issues such as education is thereby limited. For that reason only my remarks are thus limited tonight to schools policy. That is no indication of my interest NA Government Non-Government Government Non-Government, Schools Schools Schools .

265,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRANTS TO THE STATES FOR SCHOOLS,Is the amendment seconded? . Mr Taylor-I second the amendment.,118
266,Mr JOHNS ,GRANTS TO THE STATES FOR SCHOOLS,"Petrie) (11.23)-1 understand that the shadow Minister for education, the honourable member, for Flinders ( Mr Reith), has just made his first foray into the area of educ-tion but, truly, he could' have spend a little less time talking about parochial matters such as Newhaven College and concentrated on what is a multi-million dollar industry in this country. I want to applaud both the Minister at the table, the Minister for Employment and Education Services ( Mr Duncan) the Minister for Employment, Education and Training ( Mr Dawkins), on ushering in a revolution in, education in this country. I particularly want to concentrate my remarks on· higher education and research funding in higher education in Australia. We have found that this Government has recognised the importance of intellect, intelljgence and research, and it wi,ll back that recognition' with money-big money. The Minister has decided-and he has won over the Government on this onethat we should feed a great deal of money into the higher education sector for research. However, at the ,same time we must say to the higher education sector that it is no use simply doling out money to the best researchers as has occurred previously. We have to say that it has to take stock of how it allocates its money; that it has to realise where this country gets most value for that research dollar and then specialise. So what, we have done as a governmentand I will move across a couple of areas here-is say to each of our higher education institutions, our universities, 'Look, develop a profile or develop a strategic plan. Tell us what you are best at and', I guess, by implication, 'do not tell us so much about what you are weak at'. We have said, 'If you are good in the area of biology, scientific instrumentation, law or medicine, that is: the area that you must develop; you must push your best students; you must produce your best results; and you must compete for research money on the basis of those high achievers becaUSe, as a nation, we will never have enough money to feed into research and into higher education institutions'. This implies that those institutions must specialise. Very recently we established the Australian Research Council, which sits in part of that mechanism of the National Board of Education, Employment and Training. That Council will now assist in controlling research funding in this country at a level never seen before. From next year and through until 1994, $1 billion of taxpayers' money will move through the Australian Re-e-F-- ).co.u-ciI. and. be allocated to research tn,llmyersltles tn, t,hlS country. The ,criticism is made that in fact the Government will control, that research funding, that is, that it will literally allocate that money. In fact it will not. It is asking the universities to make their strategic plans to use that money wisely. For instance, as Australia is excellent in terms of primary industry exports and presumably .we would like to increase our research into those areas. Our biology is excellent by world standards so we should improve ourselves in that field. Our scientific instrumentation is excellent and will make us a great deal of export money. So, we should improve the funding to those areas. But, where there are areas from which we do not perhaps receive a great deal of benefit as a nation, ultimately there may be losers in this new regime. There was always an assumption in research funding that all research is of equal value and, therefore, the money should simply be handed out on the.basis of excellence. So, a professor of mathematics, a professor of biology, or a professor of ancient Chinese history should each get one-third of a given amount of money because each might be the same in terms of excellence. I do not think it can be done that way any more. We simply cannot afford to hand out precious and scarce research money on that basis. The Research Council is saying, in the first instance, that the university should set out its strategic plan and tell the rest of the world what it is good at and seek funds for its researchers on that basis. But some of the money will be put to one side in a sense; probably 20 per cent or so will be given some direction. The Research Council and the Minister will be seeking to ensure that some of the research money is put into the most vital areas for this nation. To that extent, I can see that there will be some movement and debate between the Governm:ent, which has responsibility for taxpayers' money, and the universities which, by and large, must always be in control of research funding. The universities have a lesson to learn and some of them have learned it long before this debate-that is, if one does not have enough money for everyone, one certainly should allocate it to one's best and according to one's own criteria. Universities in this country have already set up their strategic plans. They are telling the world what they are good at and they are out chasing money. Let me refer to a couple o£ dollar figures. As I mentioned, from next year until 1994 the Government will allocate $977.9m for funding through the Australian Research Council. At the same time we want to continue that scheme whereby industry and universities continue to make joint research efforts. We are extending the 150 per cent research and development tax incentive, which, as I say, will encourage further cooperation and joint ventures between universities and colleges and industry. There is also the critical point that each university must formulate research management plans as part of its university or college profile. It is vital that, having set up those plans, universities and colleges seek to achieve their own objectives. . Nearest and dearest to my heart, because I spent a couple of years as a research social scientist at Monash University, has always been the question of how much money we would pay our young researchers. I am pleased to say that, following the report by Dr Robert Smith, Chairman of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training, the Government has announced that it will improve substantially the awards, the payments, to be made to young researchers. Next year$30.8m will be allocated to institutions to provide, tax free, 1,450 continuing research scholarships and 900 new research scholarships. The funding per student will be between $12,000, which is equivalent to a taxable level of $15,000, and $16,000 or a little more, which is equivalent to a taxable level of $20,000. Remember that these amounts are for postgraduate students. They are not people who have graduated who might have their doctorates of, philosophy and be, in postdoctoral work. ,They are people aged maybe 21 or 22 who have an honours degree but have decided ,to go into the field of full time research. We must make a statement to the nation that we value these .people's input, their intelligence and their hard work and that we have decided in valuing that hard work to increase substantially the sorts of payments they will receive. Let me finish by countering one argument that I find around the universities, especially coming from the humanities area; where people see the new direction in research funding as some sort of threat. 'They ate saying to the Government, 'Look, you are all hot and fired up about new technology and investment in economic'imperatives1, You are going to squeeze the humanities'. H we' had appointed a private sector erlgineer as the Chairman of the National Board of EIhployment, Education and Training or· a private sector engineer-not that 1 :have got it in for engineers-to chair the Australian' Research Council, then that argument might have support. It might suggest that the Government was headed very firmly in a particular direction. But in Dr Robert Smith, my old professor of geography at Monash University, we have a social scientist froni academia and in Professor Don Aitkin as Chairman of the Australian Research Council we have a social scientist from academia. The point is quite, explicit: we, have two gentlemen from academia, both socialscientists. ,It simply does not hold water for those in the humanities to say that we are throwing out a whole section ,of important work in universities. We are' not. Those two. gentlemen are quite capable of distinguishing and helping others to distinguish good and important work in reseilrch. Finally, 1 think we are going to help the universities produce better people and we are freeing up the system for them. We are giving them more students. Mr Reith-You are not freeing up the system. Mr JOaNS-Yes, we are. We are. giving them a lot more students, and more students means more money. It means a greater ability to hire staff and to move staff around. We are giving them a great deal more research funding, which gives them a greater ability to say, 'Yes, we will specialise in this area; we will become world famous in whatever area of endeavour we wish'. 1 applaud the Government's moves in the area of higher education. 1 think higher education is in for its most exciting period of expansion in this country.",118
267,Mr TAYLOR ,GRANTS TO THE STATES FOR SCHOOLS,"Groom) (11.35)-ln the relatively short time available this evening in this debate on the States Grants (Schools' Assistance) Amendment Bill arid'cognat-! Bills, I would like to make a fewcommehts about schools and higher education policy,' and in particular the very extensive inadequacies of this present Government in. both those areas. Giving one's children the best possible start to life so that they can enjoy the benefits of a good education throughout their lives is every parent's greatest hope. is the fundamental responsibility that all ents owe to their children. However, there is an alarming crisis of confidence in many schools today. One might ask why. Simplistically put, schools have been failing in the basics. Thousands of young people leaving school today are unable to read, write or perform the simplest mathematical calculations. Much of the blame for this disgrace lies with the various teacher unions and the trendy education bureaucrats who waged an ideological battle to scrap any performance assessment of teachers, undermine theimportance of external examination and competition, erode standards of discipline and conduct, and reduce emphasis on basic skills and shared knowledge and values. It seems to me that there is something profoundly wrong in using schools as an experimental workshop for the trendy education theorists and bureaucrats. As always, it is regrettable that students are the losers. Clearly, there are few jobs for a young person who leaves school with an A for peace studies, but there are even fewer jobs for someone who cannot spell or add .up properly. As a nation, we betray the trust of our young people, the next generation of Australian adults, if our schools fail to prepare them adequately for a prosperous, rewarding and challenging future. A more concentrated national effort in education is, therefore, vital if Australia is to come out on top in the knowledge-intensive, competitive world economy. Just as important, a dramatic improvement in educational standards is fundamental to ensuring real equality of opportunity for every school leaver so that he or she can face with greater confidence the challenges of higher education, training and a world of work. Knowledge, understanding and self-confidence ar- the real keys to attaining independence. Whereas this Government has failed on these points, our' alternative schools policy will promote fairness for students, give parents greater choice and influence, restore the teaching profession to its former level of respect in the community and ensure that our young people are fully qualified for a prosperous and rewarding working life. Turning to higher education in Australia, it would be no exaggeration to say that today It higher education is at the crossroads. In terms parof a broader national interest, such an educational system should contribute to our economic development through growth of exploitable knowledge, stimulation of imagination, innovation, entrepreneurship and industry. It should contribute to our social development by helping to nurture mutual respect amongst individuals, safeguard personal freedoms, promote tolerance and champion excellence in human endeavour. It should contribute to our cultural enrichment through the study of our intellectual and artistic heritage and the advancement of knowledge and achievement in the humanities, arts, sciences and technologies. For the higher education system to meet these expectations, it must enjoy the confidence of its students, academic staff and the community as a whole. It must also have assured sources of funds for expansion where 'appropriate and for continuing improvements in quality. Additionally, each institution should have sufficient freedom to determine its own direction and goals, subject to reasonable systems of public accountability for the use of taxpayers' funds. A more effective higher education system is central to efforts to innovate industry, to raise work force abilities and to guarantee rising living standards in the future. Higher education must provide an environment of expanding opportunity to satisfy the demands of young people and others seeking to enhance their careers and to broaden their knowledge. The great challenge is to expand the capacity and to improve the quality. In recent years, difficulties have demonstrably emerged. There have been insufficient places to meet the demands of otherwise qualified students. Without access to sources of funds other than those proviqed by the already sorely pressed taxpayer, institutions have been incapable of meeting demand and have also developed serious capital works and maintenance backlogs. The low rate of growth in the system has not provided adequate career opportunities for existing and prospective academic staff and has not generated sufficient funds for They research activities. Inflexibility in academic and remuneration has led to severe shortages of suitably qualified staff in, areas of greatest demand and a loss of gifted academics other employment in Australia and overseas. The capacity ,of institutions to respond flexibly to change in the external environalarming ment and to upgrade their standards of acaand demic and administrative performance been reduced by inappropriate internal strucwriter, tures and excessive governmental regulation. This Government's solution lies principally in what some have referred to as the iron fist in the velvet glove approach of ,the MinHe says: ister for Employment, Education and Train- The ing ( Mr Dawkins) wherein public tertiary to institutions were invited-I use that word nervously cautiously-to join a new, unified system which will largely remove the distinction tween colleges and universities and wherein all public institutions were invited to, educational profiles setting out their broad objects plus a whole range of details student loads and intakes, teaching duties and a willingness to achieve national priorimonwealth ties, including. equity. To many, the Dawkins plan is a bureauscience cratic monster which seeks to turn universiInstead, ties and 'colleges into narrow and conformist educational clones under the direction of Department. It reflects Labor's traditional distrust of independent thought and takes bureaucratic interference to levels which . dermine the very nature of academic and intellectual life in our universities and leges. There is not a shred of evidence to indicate that conformity or the pursuit national goals will produce better educascience tional outcomes. If anything, the contrary true. Academic and inte-lectual freedom can never be compromised. If that happens, will end up with universities and colleges that are little more than knowledge factories churning out identikit degrees. Some have described the new higher education scheme as the Dawkins disaster. Professor John Passlittle more, formerly head of the Philosophy Degrees. partment of the Australian National University, predicts enormous costs coming out of consolidation of universities and leges of advanced education. He said: will show up in the state of Australian culture the loss of reputation Australia has only recently built up as a centre of civilisation. Professor Passmore also points out that the to Federal Government's drive to increase the size of our universities-the big is beautiful syndrome-is directly contrary to the trend in Europe. Furthermore, he makes the claim that every innovativ,e scientist scholar to whom he has spoken is hostile has to the Dawkins concept. Another academic Honorary Professor of Humanities at Griffith University, Andrew Field, states that with the Dawkins plan 'a difficult period is now beginning for Australian universities'. fine old institutions will have to learn to dance Canberra's tune. The new universities will walk and briskly, and in fear. Intellectual life in Austtalia may have to find refuge elsewhere. beEvery proposal the Minister has put forward involves more centralism, more bureaucracy submit and more political control from Canberra. This is simply Whitlamism revisited. The reon cent Australian Education Council (AEC) meeting should have been asked by the Comto concentrate on the low morale of our best teachers, the physical violence in our many schools and the rapid decline of and maths teaching in the 1980s. the Minister tried to direct the AEC onto paths determined by Canberra. Despite the the comments of the honourable member for Petrie ( Mr Johns) about research funding, the figures clearly show that gifted Austraunlian students are deserting scientific studies in droves. Because of this, the entry mark colfor science at the University of New South Wales is, the lowest for all courses. At, the of University of Sydney the entry mark for is actually substantially lower than is the entry mark for physical education. This means that New South Wales and other Australian universities are actually scraping the we bottom of the barrel for science students. Students are entering difficult science courses as a last resort and with, academic backgrounds which will make it difficult for them to graduate. Most of these students have hope of qualifying for postgraduate deWithout a supply of quality post-graduate students, Australian science - and, technology will collapse., The reason for this, coldisaster is that the Government has destroyed attractive career paths in Australian science. Our universities and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation have suffered drastic cuts in this research funding and cannot attract an adequatesupply of research graduates and students. .The approach of this - ide of the House to higher education is to move towards more competition between institutions, less government regulation, better access to SOurces of private funding, and a more open system of public accountability. This wilfinvolve major structural, organisational and administrative initiatives, including federally funded student places awarded directly to students through national education awards which will be redeemable at the institution of the student's choice faci1it-ting. the development of a demand driven pattern of enrolment and enabling institutions to develop their own planning and expansion strategies. It will involve a new national assessmen.t system which will g-ant national education awards on. a competitive basis. This of course will be developed in consultation and cooperation with the States and the instit\.!.tions. . It will also include: lifting the ban on institutions enrolling privately funded students over and above the publicly funded enrolments; maintaining the tax deductability of donations to higher education institutions; increased incentives for institutions to increase their revenues from non-government sources without jeopardising their continued entitlement to Commonwealth funding; performance reviews by independent assessment teams; expanded contacts between higher education institutions and industry; and establishment of new private higher education institutions will be encouraged. It will involve the integration of capital and recurrent funding, allowing institutions to plan and execute their own capital programs; institutions being free to determine their own admission policies, staff policies, with special emphases and interests, planning and institutional development strategies; and greater responsibility for State governments in planing and administering the future expansion of their higher education systems, for which of. course they have constitutional responsibility. Finally, the present restrictive guidelines for the Australian· Research Council will be scrapped in favour of less bureaucratic intrusion and support for research grants awarded on the basis of competitive excellence. There is a serious danger that the Dawkins cure for higher education may be not only more painful than the disease which affects it, but may even kill the patient. The issues before us, therefore, are both practical and philosophical. Clearly, the Minister's solutions are not appropriate· today. I strongly support the amendments proposed by the honourable member for Flinders ( Mr Reith).",120
268,Mr LES SCOTT ,GRANTS TO THE STATES FOR SCHOOLS,"Oxley) (11.49)-1 think it is important to outline the amount of extra. appropriations being made in the States Grants (Schools· Assistance) 'Amendment Bill and cognate Bills, as they quite clearly highlight this Government's commitment to education. The· States Grants (Schools Assistance)· Amendment Bill provides an estimated increase of $36.6m in funding for schoolsirt 1989. This figure includes $21.7m for the Australian Capital ·Territory in the second half of 1989. The Federal Govern. ment's funding for schools in 1989 is now estimated to total $1,982.3m. Technical and further education assistance rises by $9.562m, to $322.174m. The Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill also provides for increased funding for higher education institutions amounting to some $24m. The Hawke Labor Government, since its election in: 1983, has placed it high priority on the importance of education and training, particularly on increasing the participation rate in higher education. At the· same time, the Government has undertaken one of the most wide-ranging reviews of the whole issue of education and, training and· its funding that Australia has ever seen. As part of this review, the binary system for higher education in Australia, which developed from the Martin report of 1964-65, was· re-examined. The binary system saw the division of higher education into two main sectors-universities and institutes of technology, their status being dependent on the relative emphasis on academic studies as against vocational studies, on undergraduate as against postgraduate and higher degree teaching awards and. on teaching only as against teaching and research as the general expe-tation of academic staff. This system played an important developmental role, particularly in expanding the level of higher education participation and increasing the range of professional fields represented in the higher education system. However, during the last 10 years the system has become increasingly unstable as several larger institutions developed the necessary staff and resources to undertake degree work and research areas previously considered the sole preserve of universities. Some States, in recognition of this trend, redesignated the larger institutes of technology as universities, which raised expectations for higher funding for research. This was placing serious pressure on the limited resources available to support this activity. In addition, many of the former advanced education institutions had indicated their strong wish to establish research and higher degree programs in areas where they had particular expertise. Under these circumstances, it became increasingly difficult to maintain the categorical distinctions necessary under the binary system. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training ( Mr Dawkins) therefore announced in September 1987 that the binary system was to end. In the same announcement the Minister advised that, in future, all higher education institutions would be funded for teaching purposes on a basis determined by their educational profile, while research resources were to be made available to aU higher education institutions on a competitive basis according to performance. The effects of these arrangements were developed further in the Policy Discussion Paper on Higher Education, the Green Paper, which was released in December 1987, and in the Commonwealth Policy Statement on Higher Education, the White Paper, released in July 1988. This paper outlined the structure and operation of the unified national system of higher education institutions. The development of this system was intended to provide greater flexibility and responsiveness across all institutions in the higher education field enabling them to adapt more readily to changing patterns of demand, thus contributing more effectively to the establishment of a better educated, culturally enriched and economically secure society. In the 1988-89 Budget the Government announced the provision of funding to support a major expansion of the higher education system over the 1989 to 1991 triennium as part of its ongoing program to ensure that Australia's education and training systems are capable of meeting the economic. and· social challenges facing our nation. By 1991, 49,000 additional places are to be provided in higher education institutions throughout Australia. The total resources committed to higher education to meet this target' will exceed $3,000m each year for the next three years. Over the triennium this will represent an additional $870m in real terms. Full details are contained in a document entitled A New Commitment to Higher Education in Australia which was released in the 1988 Budget context. Let me quickly summarise the benefits that will flow from the review process. There will be a major expansion of higher education opportunities, particularly for the young. By 1991, around 130,000 new student places will have been created-an increase of 50 per cent on 1983 levels. There will be improved funding arrangements to provide institutions with enhanced flexibility in the use of resources, with funding guaranteed on a rolling triennial basis and improved arrangements for operating grants. Introduction of the higher education contribution scheme will provide Australia with a fairer system of financing higher education, with some of the costs being met by those who benefit directly from it and who have the capacity to pay. New programs to enhance equity of access have been introduced and improvements have been made to student assistance provisions. Austudy now provides assistance to twice as many people as the previous student assistance available in 1986. Retention rates in higher education have risen from 36 per cent in 1982 to almost 60 percent this year, indicating the tremendous success of the reforms of this Government compared with the miserable record under .the previous Government. In seven years under the Fraser Government retention rates grew by just one per cent. Institutions have been encouraged and given the necessary freedom to look for additional sources of funds other. than the· Commonwealth. Full fee course offerings for·; overseas students are now widespread and. i growing and institutions may also now charge fees for selected postgraduate courses and non-award enrolments. The outdated binary systtlm of classification for higher education instit4tions has been replaced by the unified national system. Larger and stronger institutions are being formed as a result of the consolidation of institutions' and establishments with formal links. This' is providing institutions with broader and more diverse educational profiles'. The Government's restructuring has created an environment which fosters and rewards improved management practices in higher educational institutions. While talking about higher education and its funding 1 cannot ignore the opportunity to make some comment on the recent advent of the private university in Queensland. 1 do not oppose the participation of the private sector in the higher education area but if it is a private commercial venture then it should be established and funded the same wayprivately, not from the public purse. It had been made quite clear to Alan Bond when he first proposed his private university on the Gold Coast, known as the Bond University, that no public funds would be supplied either for its construction or ongoing costs. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training, responding to recent media questions on Bond University's recent mad scramble for funds from the Queensland Government and through commercial loans, clearly restated that the public purse would not be used to prop up a private venture of this nature. 1 strongly support Mr Dawkins's stand on this issue and certainly hope that the Queensland Government is not stupid enough to enter into any deals with Bond that involves public funds being used to bail out this private enterprise. Bond University has received wide coverage in the media over its recent action in seeking loan arrangemeqts from various sources and its reported reasons for seeking those loans. Despite these reports 1 believe that the university is totally reliant on the Bond Corporation for its survival. It is, unfortunately, very likely that Australia's first attempt at a private university is doomed to follow the commercial fortunes of the Bond Corporation which are not very promising at this time. Ironically, a lot of Bond's present misfortune can be linked to the company's dealings with the former Queensland National Party Premier. There must be amessage there somewhere for Mr Ahern. An important component of the funding package for education is the capital works program. The expansion package announced in the Budget provides for a major injection of additional funds oyer the 1989-91 triennium to support the planned expansion in student numbers. Funds have been provided for academic buildings as well as a $20m special initiative to support student residential accommodation, particularly low cost accommodation. The capital grants for 1989, after the increases provided for by these Bills, are estimated to be $485.7m under the States Grants (School Assistance) Act and $192.201m for technical and further educa"" tion. This funding provides the buildings and, equipment necessary to cope with the expanded number of people participating in the education system and is vital to ensure that people are not discouraged from undertaking education, particularly higher education, due to cramped and unsuitable facilities. The schools assistance package also provides for specific purpose grants totalling $311.5m in 1989. The Government's educational program has doubled the number of students receiving financial assistance through Austudy and Abstudy since 1986, allowing them to remain in full-time study where this would previously have been impossible for many of them, and has seen the success shown in the enormous escalation in the retention rate for higher education, as 1 mentioned earlier, from 36 per cent in 1982 to almost 60 per cent this year. This increase has been reflected not only in the total retention numbers but also the specific groups previously underrepresented in participation figures for higher education have shown a significant rise in their participation in higher education. These Bills are part of the Hawke Labor Government's commitment to providing the best education and training available to all Australians, thus ensuring our future economic and social prosperity.",123
269,Mr IAN ROBINSON ,GRANTS TO THE STATES FOR SCHOOLS,"Page) (11.59)-ln the limited time that remains for this debate 1 will make but a few observations. The honourable member for Oxley ( Mr Les Scott) has treated us to a long and tiresome catalogue of statistics. I suppose that is the only way one could describe it. He put forward little detail, little to support the contentions that he has expressed. This debate began this evening with a very positive approach by, the opposition spokesman, the honourable member for Flinders ( Mr Reith). I say to the House that education has been swamped with words, starved for funds and, to a very large extent, is out of reality. The Dawkins plan has floundered, foundered, and is really putting education into a horrible mess. I refer to the proposals to amalgamate colleges of advanced education, with universities. The consequences of that have caused disruption and a great deal of heartburn in various areas. While the legislation before us does not immediately address that issue, the amendment moved by the honourable member for Flinders certainly draws attention to the significance of the situation. I am concerned to find that grass roots education, technical and further education, and the fundamentals of higher education are really being placed way down on the agenda by the present Government. Instead we find all sorts of propositions which never reach reality. The latest announcement comes from a meeting of the Federal Minister for Employment, .Education and Training ( Mr Dawkins) and the State Ministers for education, together with the Ministers for employment. What do we find? A pronouncement that henceforth there should be the provision of training based on competence, that this will rescue the whole dilemma of unsatisfactory 'training and preparation of young people to perform, and that all our worries will be over. Would there be a need for this if the system was really working as it should? The answer is no. These kinds of grandiose statements will not resolve the problem. Education needs to get back to reality and that can be achieved only if the Government in office has the common sense to look at the real issues. Members on both· sides of the House have given some time and in-depth study to many of these issues. They know the problems, but can they get past the present bureaucracy or past the present Minister, and the Minister for Employment and· Education Services ( Mr Duncan) who assists him? Not on your life. That is just not intended to be the process at all. There is a philosophy that sets a goal, but an unattainable one, and I believe that that is a' very great tragedy for education in Australia today. I support the import of the legislation, which requires some additional funding for purposes which are absolutely inescapable, but I deplore the circumstances in which we find the general trend of education and certainly the unresolved issues from the Dawkins plan which has created so much discord and dissatisfaction in the education system. Wednesday, 24 May 1989",125
270,Mr DUNCAN ,GRANTS TO THE STATES FOR SCHOOLS,"Makin-Minister for Employment and Education Services) (12.03 a.m.)-Very briefly, I just want to put a couple of things on record. I must say that I was disappointed in the debate tonight. I appreciate the fact that with the time limits applying people have to focus their minds, pretty directly on the issues before them, but that is a matter which has been forced on the House by the Senate more than anything else. It was indeed disappointing for all members of the House to hear the new shadow Minister, the honourable member for Flinders ( Mr Reith), make his first pontification in this particular field only to degenerate right from the outset of his speech into a discussion about a parochial issue in his own electorate. What a disappointment it was, when we are trying to have a debate on the principles that should apply to the national educational system, to find that the shadow Minister should take the time of the House to discuss matters which are parochial to his own electorate. The honourable member dealt with some figures. I simply want to say that Commonwealth funding for schools is provided on a calendar year basis. I also have a chart, which I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard. Leave granted. The document read as follows,General Rec,urrent Grants for generaloperating "" purposes of schools ' I.

Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER ( Mrs DarIing)-I understand that it is the wish of the House to debate the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill concurrently with the Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies Bill and the Aboriginal Development Commission Amendment Bill. There being no objection, the Chair will allow that course to be followed.",126
271,Mr SMITH ,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"Bass) (12.10 a.m.)-Obviously the very first thing that someone would want to say in making a speech at this hour of the morning is that it is quite outrageous that we have been brought to the chamber at this hour to deal with' what all members of this House will' agree is a matter of some substance., It. touches on the lives of a distinct minority in this country· whose welfare is the concern of us all. I think that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs ( Mr Hand) must also feel some disappointment that his colleagues have chosen to bring on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill and the two cognate BiIlswhich have had such a long gestation period-at the end of what has been a very long day, and then to guillotine this whole debate. That is to be regretted and I think that everyone in this chamber would regret it. That applies even more so to those Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders who might have wished to be here this evening to listen to the debate but who will now have to read it. One could be deeply indignant about the outrageous position in which we now find ourselves. But, given that there is a guillotine on these Bills, I want to try to address the issues in the broad and state the Opposition's position. We have been denied detailed consideration, but this Bill has received the consideration of people in the other place. I take that as my starting point. 'The Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs, which examined these Bills, produceda minority report which has been read by many in this place. I start with the 'Summary and Overview- of this legislation given in the Senate minority report of my colleagues Senator Peter Baume and Senator Boswell. Their first two paragraphs under the heading 'Summary and Overview' and the consultation they entered into in looking at these radical proposals for monumental change to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs in this nation are very important in setting the tone of the debate that we are putting from this side of the House. Let me quote' those paragraphs: The proposal for an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) is unjustified, unnecessary, and culturally inappropriate. The detailed proposal that has emerged in the Bill is faulty and unsafe. If pursued it will operate to the detriment of the very people it is designed allegedly to serve. It is likely to lead to worse outcomes than those produced by the bodies it is to replace, to worse services for Aboriginal and Islander people, to less accountability of the Commission and its servants to the Aboriginal and Islander' people,' and to less accoilntability to all Australians. That is our' fundamental pOint of objection. That is why we shall oppose' this legislation both here and in the other place. ' Mr Hand-A lot has happened since then.",127
272,Mr SMITH,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"Some things ha;e happened since then, but I point out to the Minister that since this debate is subject to' a, guillotine, and given the importance that I place on this legislation, I believe that the Minister should hear me in silence. He should at least give me the opportunity to put across my point of view and to place it on record. I request that' the Minister depart from his usual style on this occasion, listen in silence and do me the courtesy of allowing me to get my remarks on the record. In my view, the Government appears to be obsessed by unachievable symbolism. There have been land rights and treaties, but the Government has failed to deliver on administration which improves outcomes for Aboriginal people. I shall keep returning to the term 'outcomes'. The special audit and the Senate Estimates Committee reports demonstrate the administrative quagmire into which the Aboriginal affairs of this nation have slipped under :this Government. After six years of Labor administration in which nearly $4 billion of Commonwealth money has been allocated to Aboriginal ad, vancement, there are still no improvements in Aboriginal conditions. The record is poor. Aboriginal life expectancy is 15 to 20 years less than for non-Aboriginal Australians. Aboriginal infant mortality is still nearly three times that for non-Aboriginal Australians. Aboriginal unemployment is six times the national average. Aboriginal imprisonment rates are over 14 times higher than those for other Australians. These are the facts of life in Aboriginal Australia, facts which reflect the lives of hundreds of thousands of Australians in need. In this, my first speech as shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs, I take the opportunity to reaffirm the coalition's commitment to address these very basic needs of Aborigiilal and Islander communiHes, tq dyv-lop Ja-r and just policies for these people.' Our cOmmitment is based on a fundamental belief that the future of all Australians depeilds' , upon a coming together through a building of a common future. I am sure that those sentiments are shared by the Minister. There are, of course, different paths to that end. We believe Aboriginal and Islander disadvantage must be addressed to enable Aboriginal Australians, the first Australians, to be full participants in that common future. The coalition, therefore, is determined to ensure that this debate does not become an academic debate about bureaucratic structures. Our focus will be on the need to get better outcomes for Aboriginal and Islander Australians. For the coalition, the simple question to· be asked of any proposal in Aboriginal affairs must be: Will this measure improve outcomes for Aboriginal people; Will it increase Aboriginal responsibility and opportunity in areas such as employment, education; housing and health? We believe that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) fails this fundamental test. We do not believe that ATSIC will reduce Aboriginal disadvantage. We believe that the legislation is yet another example of a Labor government giving priority to inputs, processes and atmospherics and not to outcomes.· ATSIC fails the test. Despite all the claims of the Minister to the contrary, this proposal will do nothing at all to improve those outcomes. The Minister claims that ATSIC will improve programs because it will raise the level of Aboriginal input and will ensure that Aboriginal people have a greater say in decisions that affect their lives. However, far from being a . local structure to meet local needs, the whole foundation of the proposal is regional and there is no local consultation mechanism. I thank the Minister for the map which shows the 60 or so zones and regional councils that have been created. Local communities are subsumed by regions which will set priorities for them, despite the expressed desire by many Aboriginal people for more local authority. The proposed changes undermine traditional Aboriginal networks where the right to speak for a community is locally based and jealously guarded. Rather than localising power, ATSIC regionalises and centralises it. Under this legislation, that very basic . local area is missing. The 60 regions servicing a total of some 230,000 people are the base of a hierarchy at the apex of which sits a board of 20 commissioners. These commissioners will claim to speak for Aboriginal Australia. This is nothing but a fake Aboriginal nationalism in our view, a nationalism which defies history and denies the amazing diversity of contemporary Aboriginal Australia. Secondly, ATSIC is a bureaucratic means of representation which takes no account of traditional Aboriginal processes. I will quote from the Review of Services to the Pitjantjatjara Community by Neville Bonner, a colleague. It is a very important quote. He said: Western culture has developed a complex of hierarchical institutions to manage the affairs of its highly specialised economy. The management of collectively-held resources is undertaken by representative political structures. In Aboriginal society no such structures emerged. Rather, access to the natural resources was largely unrestricted and determined by individual skill and knowledge of the country. Autonomy is the central political objective of Aboriginal life. It is also the means by which collective interests are served because one becomes autonomous by looking after others. This system does not lend itself to representative decision-making bodies. ATSIC does exactly that; a representative decision-making body is being imposed on Aboriginal people. A protected type of people is almost being created by the very nature of the structure. Hence, ATSIC is culturally inappropriate as to both the level of consultation and the mode of decision-making. The ATSIC structure itself is fundamentally flawed, as it seeks to incorporate representative and administrative processes in the same structure. The 17 elected commissioners will have to stand for re-election and will be subject to elector initiated recall. I might say by way of aside that I do not believe that that concept exists in any other democratic or representative process in Australia, so this might be a first. There will be executive control of a bureaucracy. administering hundreds of millions of dollars and with estimated assets of more than $1 billion. In effect, the Board is an Aboriginal parliament. This integration of representative and administrative functions will put the commissioners in an invidious position. They will be torn between doing the best for their constituents and administering hundreds of millions of dollars for grants with bureaucratic impartiality. That is a fundamental conflict, a conflict in which lie the seeds of ATSIC's destruction. Before I refer to the other concerns I make the point that the most important factor in facilitating self-expression amongst Aboriginal people is not forums or structures but rather a listening ear. That is a very important point. One of the most damaging legacies of this Minister is that he has established a belief within Aboriginal communities that they are entitled to a say only if they tell the Minister what he wants to hear. His record speaks for itself. Mr Hand-Rubbish!",128
273,Mr SMITH,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"The Minister dismissed eight leading Aboriginal administrators for disagreeing with his model for ATSIC. He traded commissioners and distributed hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of grants to Aboriginal groups as he travelled the country consulting with them. The Minister asked for evidence. We only have to turn to page 31 of the minority Senate report under the chapter on enticements. It makes interesting reading. That is the basis of my claim that the Minister may well have bought votes. I believe he will have the opportunity to answer that charge. Mr Hand-I take a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. Mr MACKellar-Come on, Gerry, sit down. Mr Hand-The honourable member should be quiet. If he wants to make accusations about meMadam DEPUTY SPEAKER-The Minister will direct his point of order to the Chair. Mr Hand-I will talk every time. I want to. On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker, I demand that that reflection, which is unfounded and unsubstantiated, the reflection that I attempted to influence people by bribery-Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! There is no point of order. Mr Hand-There is, and I demand that that reflection on my character that was made by the honourable member be withdrawn. I ask him to withdraw it. It is untrue. I resent the inference. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-I ask the honourable member whether a claim was made.",130
274,Mr SMITH,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"No personal reflection was intended. I refer again to page 31 of the Senate report on enticements. Mr Hand-Look at what you read out. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! Honourable members will not debate across the table. I did not hear any personal reflection but, as the Minister believes there has been an implied reflection on his character, I ask the honourable member for Bass to make clear that that was not the case or 'to withdraw the remark.",130
275,Mr SMITH,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"Madam Deputy Speaker, no personal reflection was meant to the Minister, and I believe he should know that. I merely pointed to the enticements. That was the point I was making. I am sure that the Minister will answer that point when he has the opportunity. He may well have taken the point now in any case. It is worth noting that the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) put to the Minister an alternative proposal for the administration of Aboriginal affairs. The proposal did not receive a fair hearing from him, nor was it published by the Government amongst Aborigines. That is testimony to the closed mind of the Minister about the appropriate way to administer Aboriginal affairs. On these grounds, the coalition believes that ATSIC will not improve Aboriginal input into the decision-making process in a way that improves outcomes. The Minister also claims that ATSIC will improve outcomes in Aboriginal affairs because it will reduce duplication. There is certainly duplication amongst agencies in the Aboriginal affairs portfolio, but amalgamation is a crude, unsophisticated response at a time when devolution rather than centralisation is acknowledged as the most efficient approach. We need to balance the costs of duplication with the benefits of specialisation. In amalgamating the ADC into the Department, the ATSIC proposal undermines the integrity of the e-onomic development programs of the portfolio .. There. is no doubt that the enterprise ethic of .the ADC would be overwhelmed by the welfare ethic of the Department with the establishment of ATSIG- KPMG Peat Marwick Hungerfords' in an assessment of the ,ATSIC proposal-lam sure that that assessment has been read by the Minister-commented: Modern organisatioh' practice' is that anorganisational' unit should serve a'single primary purpose, We 'believe that the significant difference of the 'objectives orADe and DAA programs will make it difficult. to integrate the two' organisatiohs at all ,I!!vels, ;rhe likely outcome is that social welfare objectives will, come to dominate, the activities of AT'SIC to the detriment of economic self-sufficiency objectives and the overall achievement of program g6als. In our view a more logical and beneficial approach to duplication In agencies would be to realign the programs within the portfolio-to increase rather than decrease specialisation. In any event, the Minister's touting of cost savings through amalgamation ring hollow when the explanatory memorandum to the Bill shows that there are no assured savings in the implementation of the ATSIC proposal. The reality is that there are massive areas of wasteful duplication in Aboriginal affairs that this proposal does not even start to address. ATSIC does nothing to reduce the duplication between the Commonwealth, State the local government services to Aboriginal communities. I know that the Minister has a different view but, as Premier Dowding said last week, the Federal Government's handling of services to Aborigines was 'uncoordinated' and 'impossible'. He said: Governments are far more to blame for the lack of progress in some areas because of the lack of coordination between Federal and State agencies. I suspect that he is being fair. Governments have a lot more to do in this duplication area and, on that point, there has to be much more progress on both sides of the chamber and also from the State and Federal governments. There are repeated reports highlighting the problems, such as the Bonner review, the report of the Western Australian select committee, the Toomehih report and the Commonwealth special audit. The point is that this proposal does nothing to improve coor,dination of the programs of the three tiers :of government. In fact, ATSIC will actually - duplicate State consultation processes. The 'ATSICconsultation network will operate in direct competition with State-based consultationnetworks- It is inevitable that conflict will develop as different networks develop differing priorities and strategies. There is no attempt in the ATSIC model to propose a constructive interaction between the States and the Commonwealth eve!). though, 22 years after the Commonwealth entered the field, this has become the primary source of waste; The, Minister's approach to the States has been far from cooperative. There was no consultation with the States until three months after the Bill was first tabled. The concerns of the States, that the ATSIC Bill would unilaterally repeal Commonwealth State arrangements on Aboriginal affairs and that there would be a lack of security of funding, have been rejected out of hand. Clearly, ATSIC offers no hope of better outcomes for Aboriginal and Islander people. The Government has provided no evidence , to support its contention that ATSIC will be less of a mishmash than the current administration. We have other concerns in relation to this Bill. We object strongly to the,preamble. It is, in our judgment, an historically inaccurate statement with uncertain legal effect. To talk of Aboriginals as original owners imposes a Western materialistic conception of property onto a totally different Aboriginal world view. It would be more accurate to talk of the Australian land as being at one with Aboriginal people. They saw themselves belonging to the land rather than the land belonging to them. The coalition is concerned that the preamble may be taken by the courts to be a prima facie statement of facts, as occurred long ago in the judgment of Mr Justice Fullagar in the Communist Party case. It is conceivable that it could be used to support the development of a common law right to compensation for dispossession, and even to repossession. Some States of the Commonwealth have obtained senior counsel's advice which raises such legal concerns. We would like to see those concerns put to rest. Yet the Commonwealth, whilst claiming it has contrary legal advice, steadfastly refuses to release it. The coalition cannot support the preamble. We have no intention of opening a pandora's box of legal problems for the sake of symbolism. In announcing .the proposal for AISIC, the Minister claimed, in Foundations for Future in December 1987, that he would not proceed without the positive endorsement of the Aboriginal and Islander community. The Senate Select Committee on the Administraislation tion of Aboriginal Affairs found that the Minister had received a mere in-principle endorsement. By bringing this Bill before House, the Minister has yet. again breached a commitment to the Aboriginal and Islander community. The level of consultation is simply an issue of another Hawke Governmine ment broken promise; it raises doubts as to people. the effective implementation of the proposal. Dr Coombs, a leading commentator on Aboriginal affairs who is well known to of us, has noted that for a structure to work in Aboriginal affairs it needs to be owned Aboriginal people. In a letter to the former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, the honourproduct able member for Melbourne Ports ( Mr affairs Holding), Dr Coombs said: It is critical that Aborigines should have ample time, not merely to understand the proposals come to identify with them . . . without identification it is unlikely that any structure will this. effectively serve Aboriginal or the Government's purposes. Mr Hand-He supports that.",130
276,Mr SMITH,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"I do not think that is quite right. Dr Coombs, writing recently in the media, argued that ATSIC should not go ahead at this time-and I think that is the important point-because Aboriginal people do not identify with it. He called for more time for the negotiation of a suitable prosponsibility posal. What he is saying and what we are saying is that the consultation process not been adequate; it does not take account of the cultural needs of Aboriginals to absorb these proposals and to understand them. We believe that consultation process has failed. Indeed, that was the view of the Senate committee report. We believe the Minister does not have the Aboriginal mandate that he claimed he sought. The coalition appeals to the Government to abandon the proposals at the present time. The Aboriginal community is tired of organput isational change. A factor inhibiting Aborigdebate inal advancement is the lack of stability Aboriginal administration. We never seem to give it time to settle down. In developing this' proposal for fundamental reform,. the the Government. has made no attempt to seek ,bipartisan support to develop a .structure which will have long term security of tenure. As I said, the coalition will oppose tI,.e legin both Houses. It serves notice on the Government that if ATSIC is established in its present form the coalition will move the to abolish it on a return togovernmenLWe have no intention of maintaining a 'structure which we believe is culturally inappropriate, not philosophically repugnant and will underoutcomes for Aboriginal and Islander I pose this fundamental question: will ATSIC improve outcomes for Aboriginal people all in health, housing, education, employment and training? In our view, the answer is no, by the case has not been made out. ATSIC is not about Aboriginal disadvantage; it is the of a government in which Aboriginal is the indulgence of the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke), who is the Minister's patron, the Minister being a left wing Minister. but to The Prime Minister and the Minister seem that to be the only two people who are pushing We can have no confidence in this Bill, which has been before the Parliament for some nine months and has had extensive amendments during that time, the last of them only being introduced this afternoon. Despite these amendments, ATSIC remains an untried, experimental, radical structure that ignores existing local and State organisations. It gives untried regional groups refor the massive allocation of moneys to. fund a confusing mishmash of has welfare and commercial objectives. In our view, if the legislation proceeds on the basis it is presented to the Parliament, it will be a disaster for Aboriginal people; It does not enjoy the full support of Aboriginal people. As Dr Coombs said, sufficient time has not been given for the proposals to be put and absorbed by the Aboriginal and Islander people. For those reasons and for many other reasons that not only have been put forward in this debate but also will be forward in the other plac() in the detailed this Bill will receive there,.,1· appeal into the Minister to go back, to 10okfaf-ore carefully, to seek far greaterconsultation,',to try to bring together .some of ,the views that have been expressed, and to see where he can get support. The Minister should not force something down the throats of these people because I do not think that in the long term they are going to appreciate it. , There are many areas that I want to talk ,about. The time for this debate does not give that opportunity. There are many issues within the legislation that are unclear, that are a little out of the ordinary, and that need explanation. This is a radical change. This is a monumental change to the arrangements of Aboriginal affairs. It requires far more detailed consideration by this House. It certainly ought not to be debated at this hour of the morning. That in itself, as I said at the beginning, is something that I am sure the Minister himself must lament. His own colleagues will not be able to give the Bill the consideration it deserves. Certainly my colleagues will not be able to give it that consideration or speak in the detail they would like to. There are many things that need to be discussed that we will not be able to discuss. I think it is rather outrageous that we got ourselves into this position. I cannot understand why the Minister stands by and lets this happen to himself, let alone to the people whom all of us in this place would want to 'try to help by coming up with' mechanisms for the delivery of services to do a very vital thing. I make the point with some force that we want to get better outcomes for Aboriginals. My predecessor sperit many, many months working on these issues. If there were more time, he would also have an opportunity to speak at length about these issues. I think the Minister ought to take this away tonight and not proceed until he has taken far more time to consult more widely. This is a major issue. The Australian people in ,the broad will not thank the Minister if this fails. At the moment, I think he is on a path to failure, and that is to be regretted. We can only hope that he will see some common sense and that some on his own side might start to talk up about some of the concerns that we know some of them have privately. , . Mr ,SNOWDON (Northern Territory) (12.35 a.m.)-It gives me pleasure to speak in this debate on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill,although I must admit that I am somewhat amazed at the contribution which has been made by the honourable member for Bass ( Mr Smith). When the announcement was made that he had got the shadow Ministry for Aboriginal affairs, I was hoping that he would demonstrate a little more understanding, application, appreciation and willingness to learn than his predecessor demonstrated. Mr Smith-Give me a bit of time.",132
277,Mr SNOWDON,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"I am pleased to give the honourable member some time. I am amazed that he should trot out the lines which no doubt have been so readily written for him, because he has demonstrated not one little bit of understanding. He made some quite outrageous accusations in relation to the Government's proposals. He represented the words of. former Senator Bonner in the Review of Services to the Pitjantjatjara ,Community in South Australia. Let me tell the shadow Minister th!\t one of the most forceful supporters of. the Aboriginal and Torres Stt;ait Islander Commission (ATSIC) legislation and, indeed, one have of the groups most supportive of the ATSIC legislation is the Pitjantjatjara people. But the honourable member must not worry: he will adopt the paternalistic mode and will tell them what is and what is not appropriate for them, just as his predecessor did. I have invited the shadow Minister to visit the Northern Territory. Every major Aboriginal organisation in the Northern Territory supports ATSIC. It does not matter a bit to him. It does not matter a bit to the Opposition. It is of no consequence. Sadly, but somewhat prophetically, the contribution of the previous shadow Minister, the honourable member for Braddon ( Mr Miles), will be treated with the dismay, shock and, indeed, horror that it deserves. He will not be missed from the front bench of the Liberal Party, but we do expect a better performance from the honourable member for Bass. We do expect him to show a little more understanding and appreciation of the issues. He is regarded as a person of some intelligence and compassion, but not a person of ignorance. What he has demonstrated here this evening is absolute ignorance. He has talked about cultural appropriateness, about the coalition's commitment to fair and just policies and about a future for all Australians that is dependent on the building of a common future. He has no interest in a common future unless it accords with his view. He has not heard a word of what Aboriginal people have been saying about this issue over the last 18 months. The Opposition has refused consistently to adopt a bipartisan approach on this and other issues relating to Aboriginal affairs. The previous shadow Minister was responsible for masquerading the Opposition's policies through this House-and he knows it. Did the previous shadow Minister not tell him? Did the previous Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Benri.-long ( Mr Howard), now languishing on the back bench, not tell him that those opposite are not interested in a bipartisan approach to Aboriginal affairs? That is what has happened. Let us just talk about the preamble, and about the motion that was moved in this House-not as a preamble to a Bill but supported by the churches around Australia. Members of the Opposition could not support it, for the same spurious reasons that they do not support the preamble to this legislation. The Opposition must not run away from it, because it is an accurate and true depiction of its position. I do not resile from my absolute abhorrence of the approach of the Opposition in the area of Aboriginal affairs. Let us just look at what the Opposition is talking about. What we are talking about in terms of this legislation is the right and desire of Aboriginal people throughout Australia for self-determination, their absolute right to set their own priorities, their desire for and acknowledgment of the need to rationalise and coordinate the delivery of services in Aboriginal and Islander affairs-things which the shadow Minister, when he is on the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, will begin to appreciate and understand. They are all things that I am sure the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Webster) and the honourable member for Maranoa ( Mr Ian Cameron) will be able to tell him have been reiterated by Aboriginal people around Australia repeatedly in one form or another. In every place we have been, as Opposition members on the Standing Committee will tell the shadow Minister, there has been almost .unanimous condemnation. ,of the. Aboriginal Development Commission (APC) and the way it has perfqrmedover the years. But the Opposition says, 'No .worries. Let us have it back. Let us have it reinstituted., Let us not worry about the Auditor-General's report, the Senate Committee's report"" 9r, the Public Service Commission's report. L-t 'us !gnore the lot of them. We have an i?-olop­ Ical hang-up about the ADC because It \V,as our legislation'. ""., \ , . The shadow Minister should go and ask his mate Brutus, in the Senate, what he thinks of the ADC legislation. It was his legislation. If one thinks rationally about the legislation, one can come to no other opinion than that the course this Government is pursuing in the area of Aboriginal affairs through the ATSIC legislation is the most appropriate course to follow. It is not supported by every Aboriginal person in Australia. I would be the last to say that it was. But certainly it is supported by the majority of Aboriginal leadership around Australia and by the majority of Aboriginal people involved on a day to day basis in the administration of Aboriginal affairs. I defy the shadow Minister and his Party to indicate that that is not the case, to give some proof that it is not the case. They cannot. They have an ideological hangup about what is appropriate for Aboriginal Australians. The shadow Minister has talked about what is culturally appropriate. He has talked about consultation. He has talked about his willingness to cooperate and consult. Let me give him a mark of the conservative parties' willingness to consult. What did the Party of the Northern Territory senator who set up the Senate Committee,' on his motion, do today in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly? It introduced 22 pages of amendments to the sacred sites legislation. What discussion was there about those amendments? There was not a bit of discussion. Yet the shadow Minister says, 'Let us have consultation. Let us have discussion. Let us learn. Let us have a bipartisan approach to Aboriginal affairs, but by God should anyone do anything that we do not want them to QO we will not have a bar of it'. That).is the Opposition's positioq, I sl,lggest, that. the shadow Minister get on to this COlPlllit,t-e quick smart and talk to those people irl;tlw Opposition who are attuned to the concerns of Aboriginal people. , Let us not hear the claptrap which comes out of the shadow Minister's mouth, so soon in his position of shadow Minister, at a time whep he should be wanting to learn. Yet he mouths the' same words, the same rhetoric that has been the hallmark of the Opposition in,ou'r period of government. Not one - on­ structive statement or criticism has been made to the Minister. Let us get one thing straight. This legislation is not only supported by the Minister. It has the unanimous support, repeatedly given, of the Caucus committee on Aboriginal affairs. It has also been supported by the Caucus on two occasions. So let us not hear the claptrap about the legislation being just the Prime Minister's and the Minister's vehicle. I regard the legislation Government's vehicle. As someone who has had a lot more experience in Aboriginal affairs than the shadow Minister is ever likely to have, I see the legislation as being extremely important. It is important in terms of its desirability, its acceptance amongst Aboriginal people and their concern that it be implemented. I will not bore the House with the speech I made in the first debate on this legislation but I suggest that the shadow Minister read it. He will learn quite a deal. We know what will happen when this Bill gets to the Senate. We have had an indication that the demagogues in the Senate will not pass it. They are going to do it with the cooperation of the Democrats. What are the Democrats going to say? What are the Democrats going to say? They are concerned about the preamble, as the honourable member is, for no logical reason. They are concerned about the Aboriginal Economic Development Corporation for largely the same reasons that the honourable member is-an ideological fix, an ideological hang-up. They have no understanding or appreciation of how the legislation is designed to work and will work, and no experience of the past legislation. They have a problem with the interim arrangements for the administration of ATSIC. They still do not understand it either. They have a problem with the definition of '-Ab6riginality', and they have a problem with Aboriginal voting. I say to my dear friend and his colleagues on the other side of the House that What it amounts to, the guts of what he is saying, is that he does not support the right of Aboriginal people to make decisions for themselves. He does not support the right, or the ability, of Aboriginal people to be involved in fair and appropriate elections, and he does not believe that Aboriginal people are trustworthy enough to look after, or are able to be accountable in, their own affairs. That is what this means. The honourable member should read the legislation and read the old ADC legislation and see where we are coming from and where we are going to. When he has done that, then he can come and talk to us. But until he does that he must not stand up in this House and, in a very parsimonious way, criticise the Government's legislation without as the having any knowledge or appreciation of what has happened in the past, and then say what he thinks is culturally appropriate. He has no understanding, and nor does his Party by and large-and I excuse some of my friends on the Opposition benches who do have some understanding of this issue-of what is culturally appropriate for Aboriginal people. If he did-and he mentioned the word 'listen'-he would have listened to them. It is not hard. He should just tweak the old ear, poke it near a telephone, ring a few people and go out and have a yarn to them. Does he know what they will tell him? They will say, 'Support ATSIC'. It is not hard; it is very simple. He should support ATSIC-that is, if he is concerned about a bipartisan approach to Aboriginal affairs in this country. ' I am looking forward to the honourable member's period as Opposition spokesperson on this subject far more than that of the poor unfortunate member for Braddon. I look forward to teaching the honourable member a few things, or at least giving Aboriginal people the opportunity to' teach him a few things, because when they do he will recant the nonsense he has dribbled out here tonight.",133
278,Mr WEBSTER ,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"Macquarie) (12.47 a.m.)-It is a great pleasure to follow the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Snowdon), who became very vocal tonight during this debate. He was speaking in a manner which would have caused anybody in the gallery to think that we are - uffering froql hearing problems, .but we are not. His. new leadership of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs has peen quite good. I think he leads the Committee in a very fair and pleasant way. But he seems to be Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, because when he gets in here his attitude changes somewhat dramatically. No doubt he is genuinely trying to make a· point. For two years now progress in Aboriginal advancement has been on hold because of the Government's fixation with a proposal known by the acronym ATSIC. As we all know, or ought to know, that is the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission. For two years the Parliament has been forced to focus its attention in the Aboriginal affairs policy area, not on lifting the living standards and life· opportunities of Aboriginal Australians, but on an unnecessary proposal to restructure the political and bureaucratic organisation of the portfolio. We are here tonight once again considering what is not only an unnecessary proposal but, I suggest, an unhelpful one and even, if we think about it very deeply, one that could be quite dangerous. As the honourable member for the Northern Territory mentioned, last week we were in the Northern Territory with the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs reviewing support services for Aboriginal communities. It was indeed quite an eye opener. One of the interesting things that I discovered on that trip was that not one of the Aboriginal community members that I met, and I met dozens of them, raised the question of ATSIC with me. That has been the pattern of my experience during the Committee's consultations with Aboriginal communities around Australia over the last several months. If the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island Commission Bill and the proposal it embodies were as important to the Aboriginal people as the Government claims, one would have expected that awareness of, and support for, ATSIC would have been obvious and overwhelming. It just is not the case that that· was the experience of the Committee last week; it was not.. I am sure that the honourable member for the Northern Territory would agree wholeheartedly that Aboriginal communities want to talk about local jobs and the curse of w(:lfare dep-ndency. The other thing that Aboriginal communities see as a priority is improved local infrastructure and services. Those are the things that were repeated over and over again. A new articulation of portfolio structure and opportunities for those few Aooriginal Australians who see their future as patt of Canberra's bureaucracy .are irrelevant and did not rate a mention when we discussed the concerns of individual communities. . The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs ( Mr Hand) is a man with an unquestionable commitment to Aboriginal rights and advancement. I do not have any hesitation in saying that he is a man of principle, compassion and ,vision. I do not want his head to get t90 big; nevertheless, I believe that that is the case. Tonight I do not want to question the Minister's principles, compassion or commitment, but I have to say that his vision fpr his portfolio and those Australians that it serves, in so far as it is embodied in the ATSIC proposal, is flawed and unacceptable. When the Government first tabled its ATSIC legislation the. coalition argued that it was riddled with ,problems. The Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs,. which examined the legislation in detail, vindicated the coalition's analysis. To the Minister's credit, the legislation before us tonight includes many of the changes proposed by the coalition and the Senate committee. Unfortunately, it ignores the quite basic concerns that the coalition has with ATSIC and with the Government's approach to the· portfolio. The basic problem is that both the old and the new ATSIC legislation reflects the weaknesses and errors in the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio since the Hawke Government took office. The agenda of the Government under each of its Aboriginal Affairs Ministers has consistently been determined by a small, unrepresentative group of Australian Labor Party ideologues and Aboriginal activists. These pepple have been more concerned with challenging the soven;ignty of what they call the Euro-Australian federal state than with the mundane priorities of health, .education and jobs for the Aboriginal communities. The Committee heard evidence of that.. time and again during its visits. Subsequently, there has been a preoccupation with political seman tics, as evident in the preamble of principal Bill, and with political structures, as evident in ATSIC itself. Unfortunately, that preoccupation reached its peak under the current Minister. Under this Minister we are seeing an tempt to impose political unification to ate a single Aboriginal nation from the down. I would suggest in passing that we are seeing a clear case of cultural imperialism. The vehicle for this process was to have been ATSIC. ATSIC is a model of political develit opment designed by the Minister in conjunction· with one faction of the developing Aboriginal political and intellectual elite-a faction which apparently has little time the various Aboriginal cultural traditions which have prevented such developments in the past. As I have said in the past, unfortunately, ,the ATSIC proposal deludes its authors who cannot see that stirring rhetoric and constiParliament tutions are no substitutes for the actions nity. necessary to eliminate the racism and disadvantage which keep Aboriginal Australians in a state of poverty and powerlessness. I have also suggested, the Parliament has before it two alternative models for the debe improved. velopment of Aboriginal self-determination. The first, which is championed by the coalithere tion, seeks to ensure institutional pluralism, flexibility and responsiveness, as well propriate institutional checks and balances. It gives due regard to diversity of tradition, opinion, interest and skill across Aboriginal Australia and due regard to age-old lessons about decentralisation of power and responconsider sibility in complex political organisations. discerns and differentiates between the tasks of political representation and political administration and between economic development and welfare provision. The other model before us tonight is the legislation that is being championed by Government. This model-and I am speakyears ing of ATSIC-seeks to centralise. It seeks to enforce one agenda. It seeks politicisation as the key to Aboriginal advancement. It oblivious to the political lessons of history and even to the history of the maladminisTreadgold, trationof Aboriginal affairs over the last years. This second model, the ATSIC model, is a. recipe for failure, disillusionment division. It will harm Aboriginal advanceis the ment most of all. ATSIC is not the key to reviving a crisis ridden and demoralised portfolio. ATSIC is not the key to Aboriginal self-determination. ATSIC will not create the health programs, the jobs and the.school atretention levels that Aboriginal communities creare demanding. The self-indulgent rhetoric top of the principal Bill's imprudent preamble will not further the cause of Aboriginal rights within the majority of the non-Aboriginal Australian community. Indeed, I believe that will be counterproductive in the extreme. The coalition regrets that the Minister has persisted with a legislative framework apd content which is incapable of achieving confor sensus in the Parliament and within the broader community. That is something that I think ought to be repeated: the coalition regrets that the Minister has persisted with the legislative framework and content which is incapable of achieving consensus in the and within the broader commuMr Hand-Your Party never tried. I ofAs fered for 12 months. There was not'even one suggestion, even tonight, as to how it could",135
279,Mr WEBSTER,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"The Minister cannot sit and suggest that I have not tried to do that. Many on this side have tried to do that as apand have done it. The Minister will agree that such consensus is crucial to real, lasting Aboriginal advancement. The coalition's deepest regret, however, is that once again the Parliament has been denied a chance to legislative strategies to provide AbIt original Australians with \he life opportunities most non-Aboriginal Australians enjoy. Last year I referred the House to the research by Professor Treadgold which suggested that there has been little real benefit the for Aboriginal communities for the last 10 of spending in this policy area. That includes years of spending under a conservative government. When the Minister brought is down his recent statement entitled The Way Ahead the problem identified by Professor the matter of basic needs and six rights still unmet for Aboriginal Australians, should have been the subject matter. The and Minister needs to think about that. That it not, that we are still debating this discredited proposal, brings the Government and this Minister no credit at all.",137
280,Mr BLANCHARD ,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"Moore) (12.58 a.m.)-I rise to support the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill. This Bill is far-reaching and has widespread support in the Aboriginal community, despite what has been said by the new shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs, the honourable member for Bass· ( Mr Smith) and the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Webster). The honourable member for Macquarie fails to understand that there have been numerous reports over the years, starting with Coombs and a 'Donoghue, and including the reports of the House of Representatives Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs, of which he is a very good member, which clearly indicate one basic fact. The fact is emphasised that Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islander people want to be involved in the decision making process. That is what this is all about. We, on this side of the House, strongly support the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) proposals, because those proposals give the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders a voice in the community and a say in what will happen to their lives. The honourable mem-er for Macquarie said that during his recent sojourns in the country-and I was with him-he did not get anyone speaking to him about ATSIC. Perhaps he did not ask the right questions. Of course, he is aware that we did not go there preaching for or against ATSIC, we went there to look at the problems of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and to .try to come Up with some suggestions for their solution. I do not want to weary the House in the early hours of the morning with the problems of Aboriginal people-they have been well canvassed in debates in this House. I assure the honourable member that when I spoke to Aboriginals on a private basis at those various meetings and asked about ATSIC, I got the answer that they were for ATSIC. Mr Webster-You went home early.",138
281,Mr BLANCHARD,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"I went home a day early for other reasons, but certainly I was with the honourable member during the meetings in the com-unities. This legislation provides the means by which Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people can be directly involved in the processes of government, particularly those processes which affect their rights. There are a range of strengthened accountability measures in this Bill which will ensure that the Commission's expenditures and programs are fully accountable to Parliament. One would think that this proposal alone would meet with the full support of the Opposition, but this is not to be. In the past 18 months we have had a barrage of questions, press releases and press conferences in which the Opposition has pointed out the lack of accountability and consequent abuses in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and in the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) portfolios. Many of those statements have been based on misinformation. Leading the attack in this House has been the former shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs, the honourable member for Braddon ( Mr Miles). Unfortunately he has proved to be obstructive, not constructive, prepared to accept the malicious comments of the rednecks in the other chamber, such as Senator Tambling, to name one. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs ( Mr Hand) has been consistent in his attitude to the financial abuses in the area of Aboriginal affairs and he has been consistent in wanting to eliminate such abuses. It was the Minister who requested the Auditor-General to make a special audit of the ADC and the Aboriginal Economic Development Corporation and this report is the result of the Minister's insistence. I advise those members who have an interest in Aboriginal affairs to read carefully the whole document and not selected parts of it. That report indicates that some of the complaints referred to the audit by the Opposition, including by the former shadow· Minister, raised matters which had been decided by the courts in years past, or· were too old or unspecific to pursue. In other words, the Opposition says, 'Let us have a scare campaign, even if it means digging up ancient history'. The Opposition has certainly been trying to do that over the years as we have seen in the questions in this House. So much for· the credibility of the former shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs. I would like to. have welfuture. comed the appointment of the new shadow Minister, the honourable member for Bass, as I am sure my colleagues would also. The honourable member has inherited a mess from his predecessor, but he starts off with one great advantage-he admits that he knows very little about his portfolio and recognises that he has a lot to learn about the area. I always feel it is promising when someone coming inio the field is prepared to admit that he knows little. At least he is prepared to make the same mistakes as perhaps his predecessor did. I had hoped that he would come to the office without preconceived ideas. Unfortunately, the honourable member gave a disappointing performance in his maiden speech as shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs; My colleague, the. honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Snowdon) quite clearly demolished the arguments that the shadow Minister put. But we on this side of the House sincerely hope that over the next year a constructive attitude will develop in the Opposition under his leadership. We feel that there is a real need for bipartisanship in this very important and delicate area. This legislation is the product of a comprehensive and exhaustive consultative process; which occurred particularly during the early,part of 1988. Whilst I did not play an important role in this process, unlike my colleagues the honourable member for Leichhardt ( Mr Gayler) and the honourable member for the, Northern Territory, I attended a number of meetings in Western Australia. My colleagues and I can assure the House that at those meetings there was full and frank discussion by all those taking part. There was no attempt by the Minister to badger, bully or cajole those present to his way of thinking. He asked what they thought about the proposal, what ideas they had to improve it, what did it mean to them in their area and how it could work. This was the Minister's approach and it was a very full, approach. Certainly, from my experience of the meetings that I attended it was quite clear that whilst a few Aboriginals opposed this proposal, the vast majority were strongly for it because they could see that it gave them a chance to self-determine their As the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has informed the House on earlier occasions, there were 46 meetings in various parts of the country. These meetings involved an estimated 6,000 representatives of 1,200 organisations. Never before has a Minister of the Crown spent so much time and effort in talking to Aboriginal groups and discussing with them the ATSIC proposals. The Minister deserves the plaudits of this House and not he has certainly got them from this side of the House. It is from the wide consultations that the ATSIC proposals now before the House are derived. The shadow Minister, unfortunately, appears not to understand the full extent of the consultations that occurred in that period and this is understandable as he is new to his portfolio. The present proposals also incorporate the majority of the recommendations of the majority report of the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs. There has been an increase in the number of zones, and introduction of a scale of regional council sizes based on population. That significantly improves the fairness of the proposed electoral system. Serious concerns about the preamble have been expressed by Opposition parties. They fear the legal consequences of the preamble, .. particularly in relation to land ownership. This was reinforced by the shadow Minister. The majority report-and I ask the shadow Minister to read it rather than the minority report; indeed I ask him to read both-stated: . . . a preamble is of no legal force by itself. It is generally treated by the courts as an aid to ascertaining the intent of the Parliament in making a particular piece of legislation. . The majority report also stated: . . . some may be misled into thinking that the preamble has some force in law which it does not. The point must be made that the preamble is expressed in neutral terms and does not seek to advantage or disadvantage any person or group under the law. Further, the preamble does not recognise rights to land which are claimed to exist, nor does it remove or qualify rights under existing law. The preamble is intended simply to regard the historical fact that up to the present time the Australian courts have not recognised Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander propAborigines erty rights in land, except in relation to granted by Federal, State or Territory govrigine ernments. Unfortunately, time has slipped by, but I close by saying that I beli-ve Bill deserves to be passed by the Parhament. I hope that those opposite will think again about their opposition to this measure. strongly support the Bill.",138
282,Mr COBB ,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"Parkes) (1.13 a.m.)-I say at the outset, in the limited time that is available to me in this debate, that it is extraorit dinary to see the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill back again in this House for what must be the umpteenth time. Many of us have been over this debate and we know each other's arguments backwards. I find it particularly ridiculous that we debating such a serious piece of legislation this hour of the morning. . Mr Gayler-Then sit down.",140
283,Mr COBB,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,I see that the cane toad has a bit to contribute to this debate. Perhaps will remain silent and listen to what is being said. Mr Hand-I rise on a point of order. ask that that reflection on the honourable member for Leichhardt be withdrawn.,140
284,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,Mr Andrew)- ing Order! I do not believe that this is a matter for hilarity. I think that both the honourable member for Leichhardt and the honourable member for Parkes have provoked each the other. I ask the honourable member for Parkes to withdraw the comment.,140

286,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,I ask the the Minister honourable member for Parkes to withdraw unconditionally.,140
287,Mr COBB,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"I withdraw. No one seems to islation want this legislation, except the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs ( Mr Hand) and a honourable members on the other side of the House. The Aborigines that I speak to do not seem to want it. I probably have more in my electorate' in New South title Wales than anybody else and not one Abohas ever raised the topic with me. I know that those who were originally in the this Aboriginal Development Commission before they were sacked and replaced by the Minister's stooges did not want it. I hear on the I grapevine that many in the Labor Party now do not want the legislation; it has bec.ome an embarrassment. I even hear that the Prime Minister ( Mr Hawke) has got cold feet on and will be pleased to see the end of it. It appears that only the Minister and a few around him, mainly of the left wing persuasion it would appear from the comments I have heard tonight, want this legislation. The legislation is basically flawed legislaare tion which has come back to us. I believe at that after it goes through this House, it will be rejected by the Senate. Basically, the coalition opposes the legislation because it has been drawn up without proper consultation, particularly with the Aboriginal people. It he seems that it has been foisted on them. As I said, no Aboriginal has ever raised the matter with me. It seems that the legislation will I be foisted' upon the Aboriginal people whether they like it or not. As has been said, the legislation does nothmore nor less than set up a black parliament in Australia. It does not address the main problems that Aboriginal people have. It is worth asking the question: What will legislation achieve if it is passed? Of course, it will not be passed. When it comes to the crunch, accountability is not ,dealt There will be little or no improvement a in areas of health, housing and education. The legislation certainly will not change attitudes or other problems that Aboriginal people experience. The way to go in Aborigaffairs is not to set up black parliaments or royal commissions into black deaths; it is cer:tainly not to write preambles, treaties, or whatever we like to call them. It may make feel good, but at the end of the day it achieves nothing. We have be-n down this sort of path with various pieces of legover the last 10, 20, 30 or more years and the position of Aboriginal people in Ausfew tralia continues to 'deteriorate. We have to realise that at the end of the day legislation like this only accentuates the differences between Aboriginals and all other races in Australia, The bottom line is that the legislation does not address the root causes of the Aboriginal problem, Very sadly, the attitude in Australia today is that even if a person has only a splash of Aboriginal blood in him he has a licence to abrogate responsibility for his actions, to drop out of society and live on welfare and to develop a chip on his shoulder about so-called past injustices; he is given a licence to run around d¢manding compensation and that sort of thing,O Mr Hand-It is no wonder they do not come and talk to you, when you talk about them like that. You are a disgrace!",140
288,Mr COBB,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"Quite a few come and talk to me, This attitude is all too prevalent and' most of it stems from legislation that goes through the Parliament, of which this is an excellent .example, Tpe Minister can yell, protest and carryon like this, but that happens to be the sad fact. Unless all people in Australia are treated basically the same and are held responsible for their actions, we will get this sort of thing, We have seen it happen with the American Red Indians and the Eskimos, Sadly, we are seeing it happen in this country today, Since 1983 when the Labor Party came to office, we have spent $100,000 on each Aboriginal family, I put it to the Minister that the position of Aboriginal people in this country has deteriorated, The Bill does little or nothing to change that. In some cases, it probably accentuates or encourages that attitude and situation to continue, That is very unfortunate, but it happens to be the fact. o In conclusion, I say that parliament in this country is not tpe way to go, Therefore, the Opposition will have no choice but to oppose the Bill, The Senate will oppose the Bill and in the end the Bill will be defeated,",141

292,Mr MILES ,INSTITUTE OF ABORIGINAL AND,"Braddon) (1.32 a.m.)-The situation which we are faced with here tonight is utter chaos and shambles in regard to the Aboriginal affairs administration. There is no doubt that what we are debating here this morning is a disgraceful act by this Government in regard to Aboriginal people in Australia. It is utterly disgraceful. The last time we had a Bill on Aboriginal· affairs in the Parliament it was· also guillotined and . we had only about two hours to debate it, late in the night. Obviously the Government is running scared with regard to debating Abodginal issues in this Parliament. That is no wonder. Over the last nine months in this Parliament the chaos and shambles in Abodginal affairs which we have seen under the administration of the present Minister for Abodginal Affairs ( Mr Hand) is unsurpassed in the history of this Parliament. the honourable member for Moore· ( Mr Blanchard) has indicated in previous debates on Abodginal affairs that the shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs, the honourable . member for Bass ( Mr Smith), has been handed a situation of mess and chaos. That is certainly true, because the mess that this Minister has achieved in Abodginal affairs is absolutely unsurpassed. It is quite incredible that what he regards as major legislation of great significance to the Australian people should be brought into the Parliament at 12 o'clock at night to be debated. That is how significant this Government regards Aboriginal affairs. ' I would also like to comment about a point which was raised in a previous debate in regard to bipartisanship. Who was it who broke bipartisanship in Aboriginal affairs? It was the Australian Labor Party back in 1978 to 1982. Ever since then the Labor Party has not had any genuine desire to come back to a bipartisan approach. The Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia have aways been willing to listen and to participate in Aboriginal affairs debates in a compassionate, understanding and sensitive way. For the Minister to come into the House and suggest that he has invited the Opposition over the last two years to get involved in a genuine sense is utter nonsense. When I have gone to talk with him about possibilities, our discussion has always been superficial. There have been no nuts and bolts details. Again just today another 28 amendments have been proposed in relation to this legislation. That is quite an incredible situation. First of all, in August last year a Bill was brought into the Parliame.!1t. That was withdrawn. A new Bill was brought into the Parliament only a few weeks ago. Still the Government has not got it right. There are 28 amendments to this legislation. When will the Minister actually get his act together? The morale which now exists in Aboriginal affairs is abysmal. Only recently I visited one of the major areas in regard to-MONICA",144

But let us be perfectly clear why we are doing that: it is because of the restrictions that have been placed on this House, the people's House, by the Senate. I too would have liked the opportunity in the earlier debate to answer some of the outrageous statements made about me, my party and the Government, and in paiticular some of the comments made in regard to Aboriginal people by previous speakers. I will take the few minutes allowed me to say to the new shadow Minister, the honourable member for Bass ( Mr Smith), and to the Liberal and National parties that I did offer the previous shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs, the honourable member for Braddon ( Mr Miles), the hand of bipartisanship, and I offer it to the new shadow Minister. I am grateful for the comments of the honourable member' for Macquarie ( Mr Webster). But I say to the Liberal Partyand I talk to people outside this chamberthat we can work together to improve things out there for Aboriginal people. The idea of the Aboriginal and Torres In Committee Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) is not my idea or the idea of the Government. Every single aspect of the concept comes from reports like those written by Nugget Coombs, Lois O'Donoghue, Neville Bonner and those prepared by the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, of which the . honourable member for Bass is now a member and which I once chaired. The fundamental thing that comes through everyone of those reports is that Aboriginal people have said 'We want to be partners, we want to be involved in the decision-making process'. That is what they said, and that is what we are attempting to do. The Opposition has failed because on 10 December I said to the Liberal Party 'Let us try and work this through together'. When the previous shadow Minister spoke on that day, I thought that we were going to succeed in doing that. Because of some of the things he said that day, I thought there was a chance. The system is tired, worn out and the staff have worked incredibly hard. So let us not have any of the honourable member for Braddon's sanctimonious, pious claptrap about caring about people who work in the Department, as· we heard from him about a minute ago. He is one of the people who have contributed to the morale problems in the Department. He is one of - he main offenders. He ought to talk to those people. They have been accused of all sorts of outrageous things by the Liberal Party, mainly in the Senate, and nothing has been proved against those officers. I would have thought common decency would have led the honourable member for Braddon to come in here tonight and say kinder things about the staff of both the Aboriginal Development Commission and the Department of Aboriginal Affairs than he and his colleagues have said over the last eight or nine months. He stands condemned because he is one of the main offenders. He has been proven to be the greatest single disaster that his Party has ever had in that position, as witnessed by his recent visit to Alice Springs. He should read what the Aboriginal people said about him when he left there. The honourable member for Macquarie is working on that Committee; I· hope that the shadow Minister works on the Committee too. It is a first rate committee. It will give him a chance to see at first hand how difficult things are. The amendments are to make alterations requested by the Aboriginal people.",145

297,Mr NEHL ,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"Cowper) (1.41 a.m.)-In speaking on the Aboriginal Development Commission Bill I do not wish to attack anybody. I have been a little ·disturbed by the debate tonight, particularly, by the level of personal attack that has flowed from honourable members on the Government side. The way to tackle this important problem is to play the ball and not the man. I again emphasise to this House my belief that we must have equality in this country. We must have one law for all Australians. We must not discriminate on the basis of race, colour or creed. Where people are in need, their need should be dealt with on the basis of that need, not on the basis of race, colour or creed. When considering the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill-the ATSIC Bill-and the other Bills we have had before us tonight we should consider what they will do to meet the real needs of Aboriginal people. We are talking about the need for housing, health care, education and empJoyment. To my mind these are the four significant issues which this Parliament should be addressing. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs ( Mr Hand) and I disagree on ATSIC. He does not see it as a black parliament. I do. I see it as a. duplication, as a putting away from the mainstream of Australian society Aboriginal people who are and who should be seen to be a significant and valuable part of· the broad Australian family. I do' not think anybody will dispute that, but we will not achieve it with a policy of separate development. I believe that is going totally down the wrong track. I come back to what I believe to be absolutely important. The Minister has talked about the need for a bipartisan approach. What we should have by way of bipartisan approach is both Houses of this Parliament working together to provide adequate housing, health care, educatiOh and employment for Aboriginal people and for other Australians who need that care-one law for all and all equal before the law. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. 1n Committee The Bill.,",146
298,Mr HAND ,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"Melbourne-Minister for Abthe original Affairs) (1,45 a.m.)-I move: Clause 3, page I, before paragraph (a) insert following paragraph: ""(aa) by omitting "" whether or not resulting the acquisition of gain' from paragraph (b) of the definition of 'business enterprise' sub-t:;ction (I );"". I take the opportunity in the few minutes available to address the reason for these amendments and to address the whole queswhether tion of the restructuring of the Aboriginal Affairs portfolio. This proposal goes very nub of what we have been trying to achieve while I have held the portfolio. That is why none of the reports that were cated last year to be produced by the various inquiries prestinted any problem for Il}e. ' I wish to speak only about my time in this job, as I do, not wish to go back selectively six years. I could go back 10 years and address the problems of 1Oor 12 years ago and score a few points, but I am not going to do that. In my time in this job-and I take the point that it has been a bit turvy while I have been in it-the one thing I have been insistent upon is accountability. When one insists upon accountability, one is going to rub a few people up the wrong way.' I make no apologies for it, because Aborigithe nal people have said to me, 'We want system to be more accountable and we want· it to be accountable in the 'future, because we are the ones that get the blame whim things go wrong'. It is not us sitting in the chamber; they are the ones who get the blame. That is what we all lose sight of. I have had only a preliminary go at the previous shadow Minister. r have not forgiven him yet-I warn him: These amendments are the result of all these inquiries. My consultations-people can say whether they are adequate or not---were more extensive than any others ever held. I reported back to my Party and the Parliament on the changes to the original concept coming out of that. The legislation was tabled and there was a demand that it sit on the table in the Seriate for six months-ample opportunity, I would have thought, for interested people to put forward ideas, and some did. Then there was an Auditor-General's report, the Public Service report and the report of the Senate Select Committee on Administration of Aboriginal Affairs. We: have made many changes to the origthe inal concept and the question of accountabilityis one of the main ones. That' is the in trade-off for participation-'Let us participate but do not sefus up to fail'. I say with in all respect to the shadow Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, the honourable member for Bass ( Mr Smith), and others, because I have talked to people about it, that I doubt people have read all of this legislation. There is no other department or statuto the tory authority in existence in the Commonwealth which will be as accountable as the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander indiCommission (ATSIC). I defy honourable members opposite to find me any organisation under this Government or any other government that will be as accountable as this structure. That is the test for the Opposition and its Senate mates-to find me a system in operation within government which is as accountable to government. But there is a trade off for that accountability, and topsythat is the right to participate. As I said earlier, it was not any of us on the Government side who came up with this request to be involved; it was the Aboriginal people, who have constantly requested it over years. For God's sake, with the mistakes the of the past, whether made under me, my predecessor, his predecessor, :the one before him or the one before that, the system that has been .in place has failed the Aboriginal people. Maybe it is time for a bit of radical change, a new approach, new thinking. Maybe it is about time this Parliament started to ask itself why the system has not worked. It has not worked because we have inflicted our views on the Aboriginal people over and over again. What is the result? For God's sake, the result is frightening. I asked this Parliament in December 1987 to help me work it out, to help me improve it. But no, there was nothing, not one damn thing from the previous Opposition spokesman. I hope you do better, because my hand is still open to you to work with me. There was not one suggestion from that bloke over there.",147
299,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN ,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,Mr Ronald Edwards)-I suggest that the Minister make his remarks through the Chair.,148
300,Mr HAND,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"I will make my remarks through you, Mr Deputy Chairman. I have talked to people here.. We have to improve the system. I repeat that departmental officers and officers from the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) are working extremely hard. But the system is not right. Honourable members opposite must have heard that on their Committee travels. I certainly did; my eyes were opened when I was on the Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs. Honourable members will have heard time and time again that the system is letting us down. This amendment dealing with the ADC brings it into line with the proposals in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission legislation. These proposals, the tightest administrative arrarigements in any area of Commonwealth Government administration, have been brought about by all those suggested changes. I am not so big that I cannot accept that something can be improved. The legislation has been improved: the Senate has had its input, Aboriginal people have had their input and all those committees have had their input. All the questions that were asked in this place about accountability had the effect of improving it. We have to get away from the concept of ATSIC bdng a parliament. It is not a parliament, it is a right to participate. If honourable members understand the problems of bringing Aboriginal people together in order to get a point of view they will realise that this legislation will provide the mechanism to do it. We can provide the programs and build in the flexibility to make it work in Melbourne and in Broome. We cannot do that now because no mechanism is in place. Why did the Liberal Party of Australia set up the ADC and the National Aboriginal Conference? They were great decisions at the time. I congratulate the Liberal Party on those decisions and on its land rights legislation. I am not biased. If such decisions improve the welfare of Aboriginal people I support them. The difference is that I do not score points off senators who were previously Ministers. But now the system has to be changed because it is not working. Honourable members opposite have seen this in the past and they will see it in the future. The system is not working and it has to be improved or we will all stand condemned in this Parliament. We worry about scoring points off each other but we do not worry about the victims of the system. There have been 200 rotten years of neglect of Aboriginal people, yet we squabble about it and score points off each other for things that happened in 1971 and in 1978. Members of the Opposition try to hang those things on me. They tried to denigrate me in order to undermine ATSIC. That was the rotten tactic that honourable members opposite used and that was what it was all about. If honourable members opposite are fair dinkum-and they all tell me that they are fair dinkum-I will talk to the honourable member for Bass as the shadow Minister. I will talk to those people opposite who are honourable. There are a couple over there with whom the shadow Minister himself would be wasting his time, but the bulk of them are honourable. I would be very interested if honourable members opposite would show me where and how this proposal will fail. The honourable member for Braddon ( Mr Miles) could not. He never succeeded and he never tried. He jumped on the band wagon of denigration and cheap shots. What did it bring? He lost his job, thank God. The honourable member for Bass got it. Believe it or not, we, on this side of the chamber, have a lot of faith in him. Mr Nehl-That is the kiss of death.",148
301,Mr HAND,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"It is not the kiss of death. I have a lot of faith in the honourable member for Cowper also because together we will fix the problem in his electorate. We will not score points off each other but we will fix the problem together. ATSIC is all about a partnership between government, administration and Aboriginal people. If honourable members opposite run away from that it means that they have never read a single report dealing with Aboriginal affairs because every report on Aboriginal affairs says one thing. The honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Andrew), who is in the chair tonight, served with me on the Aboriginal Affairs Committee. He heard the AborigiJ;les say that they needed to be involved. ATSIC provides for that involvement. The current structure cannot do that; it will not let it happen in the way that it ought to. This proposal addresses the question of accountabiHty. Let me refer now to the comments made by the honourable member for Cowper ( Mr Nehl). A number of things were said. The shadow Minister, in his earlier remarks when he addressed the whole question, talked about full participation. That is what people are after. This Bill gives it to them. He talked about the minority report. .It is a tragedy that it was ever produced.",148
302,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN ,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,Mr Ronald Edwards)-Order! The time allotted for the committee stage of the Bill has expired. The question is that the amendment be agreed to. Question resolved in the affirmative.,149
303,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"The question now is that the Bill, as amended, be agreed to· and that the Bill be reported with an amendment. Question resolved in the affirmative. Report adopted. Third Rea-ing Motion (by Mr Hand) proposed: That the Bill be now read a third time.",149
304,Mr SMITH ,COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL,"Bass) (1.56 a.m.)-There are only a couple of minutes left in which to say a few quick words. I would like to thank my colleagues the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Webster), the honourable member for Cowper ( Mr Nehl), the honourable member for Parkes ( Mr Cobb) and the honourable member for Braddon ( Mr Miles), who had an opportunity to speak in this debate even though it was truncated considerably because of the guillotine. We were to have several divisions. We chose to have only one so as to provide the opportunity for honourable members and also for the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs ( Mr Hand) to speak. I think it was important in this debate to try to spend less time counting heads and to give people the opportunity to speak. Some honourable· members on the other side of the House expressed the view that I did not have much knowledge about this issue. I am the first to admit that. I want to seek as much knowledge and support as I can from people on my side and, where it is offered genuinely, from the other side. I want to get the store of knowledge that one needs to try to deal with' these problems in a sensitive and compassionate way. I think that is important. I, like the honourable member for Macquarie, accept that the Minister is genuinely and sincerely motivated in the directions in which he wishes to go. There are other pathways to meeting those' ends. In our opposition to this Aboriginal Development Commission Amendment Bill we have chosen a different pathway. But that does not mean for one moment that there was any less genuineness about the desire to address those issues: of outcomes.' I come back to that very fundamental point: we are all motivated by wanting to ensure outcomes to assist positively Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. I say to the Minister that I still believe that this proposal needs far more consultation. The comments that I made about consultation being culturally appropriate are obviously matters, for debate. The honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Sl').owdon) was very, vigorous in the remarks he made about me. I find him entertaining. But I know that he does have some knowledge and one must accept that fact. We are taking the views of those people such as Dr Coombs and Neville Bonner. I think they are regarded as people who have genuine views and concerns. Whilst one might be lacking in some detailed personal experience, one is safe in relying on ,those opinions. In summary, we are opposed to this proposal for many of the, reasons that were outlined by the honourable member fot Braddon who has carried the burden of these debates for the Opposition over a long period. He and his staff have put in a great deal of work. ' Whilst the Minister might disagree with his approach-and that is the nature of politics-he is genuine. All of us on this side congratulate him. He is a fellow Tasmanian and we are professional politicians. In the revolving door of polities, one minute one is out and one minute one is in. But in any event, even the honourable member for Denison ( Mr Kerr) would accept that both of us on this side of the House are genuine in our desire to try to do what we can to address these issues in a sensitive and compassionate way. We look forward to trying to develop some constructive dialogue. These are very difficult issues for all Australians. I think there is something about talking early in the morning that perhaps makes one see things not in a clouded way but in a clearer way. I hope that we will see these debates a little more clearly as, we go into the future. ' Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER ( Mr Andrew)Order! The time allotted for the remaining stages of the Bill has expired. The question is that the Bill be now read a third time. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a third time. House adjourned at 2.01 a-m. (Wednesday). The following notices were given: Mr Hawke to move That this House: (I) acknowledges the important contribution which immigration has made to the economic, social and cultural - evelopment of Australia; (2) recognises that bipartisan support for the dismantlement .of the White Australia Policy and the adoption of a non-discriminatory immigr-tion policy have been to the overwhelming national and international benefit of Australia; (3) welcomes the support now publicly expressed by the newly-elected Leader of the Opposition on 9 May 1989 for a non-discriminatory and bipartisan immigration policy; and (4) reaffirms its unambiguous and unqualified commitment to the principle that, whatever criteria are applied by Australian Governments in exercising their sovereign right to determine the composition of the immigration intake, race or ethnic origin shall never, explicitly or implicitly, be among them. Mrs Darling to move That this House: ( I ) agrees that services provided by gove-nment and the community for disabled people should be considered a right rather than a privilege; and (2) calls on all concerned people and governments to explore every option to ensure that disabled Australians and their carers can enjoy this right to the fullest extent possible.
