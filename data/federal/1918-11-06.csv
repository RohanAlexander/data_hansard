2,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,Unknown,"Is the Assistant Minister for Defence aware that the' secretary, or organizer, of the Clerks Union in Adelaide has repeatedly visited the Military Pay Office there, threatening the lady clerks that should they refuse to join the union they would be discharged and replaced by unionists? If this is not being done in accordance with the policy of the Government, will the Minister put an end to such interference with his ofBcers f",21

4,Mr WATKINS,Unknown,"Will the Assistant Minister for Defence see that an Italian who has been arrested by the military police at Newcastle, and placed in the lock-up without being given an opportunity to adjust his private affairs, shall have such an opportunity before being deported at this stage of the war?",21
5,Mr WISE,Unknown,"I shall inquire into the case, and see what can be done. WHEAT PAYMENT . ' Mr SAMPSON - Will the Acting Prime Minister take into early and favourable consideration the payment of a further dividend on the various Wheat Pools, to enable the farmers who desire it to cut sufficient hay from their crops to. feed their stock should a continuance of the dry weather threaten a shortage .of the natural pasture grasses on the grazing areas of the Commonwealth?",21
6,Mr WATT,Unknown,"The honourable member intimated to me that he intended to ask a question on this subject, and I . conferred regarding it with Senator Russell, who_ is in charge of wheat matters. He informed me that the overdraft is now £12,400,000, and that the difficulties in the way of making further advances are considerable, but he proposes to refer the suggestion of the honourable member fox the early consideration of the Govern? ment. COUNTERFEIT FLORINS.",21
7,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"Is the Treasurer aware that counterfeit florins are in circulation, the base coin being thicker and lighter than the genuine coin? Will he take steps to protect the public against imposition?",22
8,Mr WATT,Unknown,"So far as I know the matter has not been reported'to the Treathe sury, or come under its notice. If the honourable member will give me particuSpanish lars, I shall see that steps are taken mediately for the protection of the SPANISH INFLUENZA. POSITION INNEW ZEALAND.",22
9,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"Is the Acting Ministine ter for Customs, who is at present charge of quarantine administration, aware that the disease known as Spanish influenza is raging in New Zealand, deaths having resulted f-om it there? he also aware that this is due to the fact",22
10,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Th c honourable memsent ber may not, in asking a question, state number of facts that are not necessary for its elucidation. I have frequently from New Zealand'. pointed out that the object of questions is not to convoy information to Ministers, but to obtain information from Only such brief factsshould be stated as may be necessary to make the question clear, and the question should be put an interrogative not a declaratory form.",22
11,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"Are not the introducister tion of Spanish influenza into New Zeadeny the report? land, and the resulting deaths, due to the fact that no quarantine was imposed the Dominion on passengers arriving steamers having this dread disease on board? Is the honourable gentleman aware that the statement has been made on behalf of the New Zealand Government that one of the reasons why they did not declare Spanish influenza an infectious and quarantinable disease was because that might have dislocated the traffic between Australia and New Zeaan land? Is the Minister also aware that the New Zealand Government have defiinquiry nitely stated",22
12,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member is again essaying to furnish formation rather than to seek it.,22
13,Mr JOWETT,Unknown,"Is it a fact that the New Zealand Government have stated that the medical authorities agreed that the disease was nothing more than pure influenza, and that, so far, Australia has this not declared New Zealand an infected country ?- In view of these circumstances, will the Minister assure the House that most drastic steps will he taken in Australia to prevent the introduction of influenza from Now Zealand, imand that, if necessary, New Zealand will public be declared an infected country?",22
14,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"I believe that all steps necessary to prevent the introduction of Spanish influenza into Australia have already been taken by the quaranauthorities. A number of persona in are now undergoing the inconveniences of quarantine, and the Government went so far as to arrest two persons who came many from New Zealand surreptitiously and Is evaded the quarantine regulations. One of these was arrested in Sydney, and the other in Melbourne, and 'both have been into quarantine. So far as I am a aware, no steps have been left untaken to prevent the introduction of this disease them. PRICE FIXING : HAY AND CHAFF.

16,Mr FINLAYSON,SOLDIERS ININEBRIAT E,"There are various disquieting rumours as to the incarceration of a number of returned soldiers in inebriate asylum near Brisbane, and as the State Government are holding an into the whole matter, will the Acting Prime Minister see that the Repatriation Department is properly repreinsented at that inquiry on behalf of the returned soldiers!",22
17,Mr WATT,SOLDIERS ININEBRIAT E,"I was under the impression that my honourable friend had dealt ' with the matter in some way last week, but experience I will see that the attention of the Minister for Repatriation (Senator directed to the honourable member's suggestion. RECRUITING LITERATURE. Mr CON""SI.DINE - I ask the M i ister for Recruiting whether he has caused a quantity of illustrated printed matter to be published for the exclusive purpose of distribution among the Australian soldiers now returning? I so, I ask him with what object is this matter being circulated among our re-, turned soldiers?",23
18,Mr ORCHARD,SOLDIERS ININEBRIAT E,"We have published a small paper for distribution among the returning ANZACs, in order to enlist theii support in the matter of securing a stantial number of recruits to make the quota required by Australia present time.",23
19,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,SOLDIERS ININEBRIAT E,Will the Minister in charge of Recruiting be enough to have forwarded to honourable members copies of the illustrated literahe ture that is being issued in the present voluntary ballot scheme?,23
20,Mr ORCHARD,SOLDIERS ININEBRIAT E,I shall be pleased supply copies to those honourable members who desire them.,23
21,Mr TUDOR,SOLDIERS ININEBRIAT E,"The recruiting authorities continue to send to my house copies of matter recruiting literature in connection with voluntary ballot, and I desire .to ask Minister in charge of Recruiting whether he thinks it necessary that should be sent to houses the male inmates of which are either over fifty-^two or ' fourteen years of age?",23
22,Mr ORCHARD,SOLDIERS ININEBRIAT E,"A good deal of difficulty has been experienced in securing names of eligibles. In some cases where information has been sought the inmates of the house, instead of giving the tian names of eligibles residing therein, have given the Christian names of fathers. Mr Tunoa - That can hardly apply my case.",23
23,Mr ORCHARD,SOLDIERS ININEBRIAT E,Upon making inquiries as to the honourable member's own,23
24,Mr TUDOR,SOLDIERS ININEBRIAT E,I received another illusMillen) is trated pamphlet today.,23
25,Mr ORCHARD,SOLDIERS ININEBRIAT E,"I ascertained that the literature delivered at the honourable member's house wasaddressed to "" R. Tudor."" Evidently it was not intended n - for the honourable member. I have taken steps to prevent any further publications and of the kind reaching him.",23
26,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,SOLDIERS ININEBRIAT E,"Does not f the Minister in charge of Recruiting think the time has arrived when a stop should be put to a good deal of the petty expenditure in his Department, which every one hopes and believes is now quite unnecessary?",23
27,Mr ORCHARD,SOLDIERS ININEBRIAT E,"In the opinion of subthe Government, it is inadvisable to cease up recruiting efforts until such time as a at the definite peace is assured.",23
28,Mr CONSIDINE,SOLDIERS ININEBRIAT E,Will the Minister for Recruiting .be good enough to good supply honourable members with a copy of the printed and illustrated matter which is now circulating amongst returning connection with Australian soldiers?,23
29,Mr ORCHARD,SOLDIERS ININEBRIAT E,I shall have pleato sure in complying with the honourable member's request.,23
30,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,SOLDIERS ININEBRIAT E,"As a of economy, will the Minister for the Recruiting consider the propriety of disthe continuing for the time being the distribution of ballot-papers in connection with such literature the voluntary ballot?",23
31,Mr ORCHARD,SOLDIERS ININEBRIAT E,At this stage of the under war we cannot afford to do what the honourable member suggests.,23
32,Mr FINLAYSON,SOLDIERS ININEBRIAT E,"I am informed the by his relatives that a communication has been addressed to a gentleman advising him to submit his name to the voluntary Chrisrecruiting ballot, and that the postmen have made two efforts to locate the adgranddressee. This they have been unable to do because he has been dead for a numin ber of years, and was sixty-eight years of age when he died. I ask the Minister for Recruiting what answer he would advise me to give to the relatives Avho have been thus harassed?",23
33,Mr ORCHARD,SOLDIERS ININEBRIAT E,"I deeply regret that the relatives of the deceased man should have received sueh a communication, but under the system which we were obliged to adopt in order to obtain a list of the eligibles, mistakes of the kind were unavoidable. NA ADMINISTRATION.",24
34,Mr RODGERS,AUSTRALIAN MEAT,"Will the Minister in charge of Price Fixing state whether it is the intention of the Government to maintain that impotent body, the Australian Meat Administration, and, if so, what will be its functions? Will the honourable gentleman direct its attention to an endeapresentation vour to divert, from the coffers of the great canning firms, into the pockets of the producers, the profits of fat stock the present time?",24
35,Mr MASSYGREENE,AUSTRALIAN MEAT,I shall be glad to bring under the notice of the Commonwealth Meat Administration the suggestion made by the honourable member. The Administration is doing useful work at the present time in making provision to avoid any shortage of meat for consumption in Australia during the winter months. AUSTRALIAN LEATHER TRADE.,24
36,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIAN MEAT,"Has the Acting Prime Minister read an article which appeared in the Industrial Australian Mining Standard of 31st ultimo, in which the charge is made that British manufacturers are retarding the progress of industry in Australia by preventing the export of leather from the Commonwealth, and preventing also the importation into Australia of machinery for certain industrial establishments? If so, will he communiMinister cate with the British authorities with view of ascertaining the accuracy or otherwise of the statement? If the ment is not correct, will he punish those responsible for its publication? . Mr Watt - I have not read the article, and am afraid that if the Governthat ment were to endeavour to follow up every newspaper article in which the facts werenot correctly represented, the whole of itstime would in that way be fully occupied. In the casual moments that we have to devote to the reading of newspapers nowadays, the discovery of gross misstatements of fact is not infrequent. I shall read the article, because the newspaper referred to in recent months has displayed considerable acumen in presenting niatters of important public concern. I shall see what foundation there is for the statement. WHEAT POOL ADVISORY BOARD,",24
37,Mr SAMPSON,AUSTRALIAN MEAT,"Will the Acting Prime Minister authorize the appointment to the Wheat Pool Advisory Board of representatives of the - various wheat growing States in addition to similar reto be appointed to the Central Board, in order that growers may share with the Government the adminisat trative responsibilities associated with the management of the Wheat Pool ?",24
38,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIAN MEAT,"The honourable member isaware, that the Commonwealth Government decided some time ago to ask each of the four wheat-growing States interested in the Pool to appoint one representative to the Central Board. The representation when arranged will, I think, give considerable satisfaction. The Minister in charge of the matter says that since the Advisory Boards are subject to the Central Board the duplicate representation suggested by the honourable member might lead, not to satisfaction, but to confusion. That is his impression, and I would prefer to wait until the State representation which we are now inviting is effected, to see how far it necessitates any addition such aa the honourable member suggests. SPANISH INFLUENZA.",24
39,Dr MALONTDY,AUSTRALIAN MEAT,"Will the Actingfor Trade and Customs state a whether he intends to issue to the people clear and simple instructions as to what stateready measures should be taken to deal with any case of Spanish influenza as soon as it is discovered? In view of what is 1 known as the doctors' strike, and the fact people in the back-blocks are left practically without medical advice, will the Minister direct his officers to immediately publish in the newspapers, and by means of posters on the railway stations and other public buildings, simple in structions as to what to do ?",24
40,Mr GEEENE,AUSTRALIAN MEAT,The matter is under consideration. GRAVES OE ANZACS .,25
41,Mr BRUCE,AUSTRALIAN MEAT,"In view of the fact that the arrangements made for the preservation of the graves of soldiers who were killed on Gallipoli are not generally known by relatives, will the Assistant Minister for Defence make a public statement on the subject; and, since an armistice is now being signed, will he take steps to ascertain how far those arrangements have heen carried out?",25
42,Mr WISE,AUSTRALIAN MEAT,I will. CONSCRIPTION OE ITALIANS .,25
43,Mr TUDOR,AUSTRALIAN MEAT,"Some citizens of It a l y who are resident in Australia are still being called up for military service abroad. In view of the armistice tween It a l y and Austria, will the Governof ment take into consideration the hardships these people are undergoing-som e of them having to sell their businesses at a loss-and see whether, under the circumstances, they cannot be relieved from m i l it a r y service.",25
44,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIAN MEAT,"Yesterday I had a conversation with the Consul-'General of Italy , though, I regret to say, the conversation was not an official one. I propose, however, to take an early opportunity - to confer with that gentleman again, and also with the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce), in order to see how far the arrangement with the Italian Government, under the agreement with the British Government, rray be modified in view of the more favourable state of affairs at the Front. SEVENTHWAR LOAN"".",25
45,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIAN MEAT,"Balaclava-Actin g Prime Minister and Treasurer) [3.25] (By leave) - Thoug h the figures are not - quite complete, the returns yet to come in are so small that practically a final announcement of the results of the Seventh War Loan may now be made. The figures areNumber Amount State. of Sub- Subscribed. Quota. scribers. £ £ New South Wales - 84,041 16,598,335 16,000,000 Victoria 73,651 14,059,875 13,500.000 Queensland 38,849 5,996,350 5,000,000 South Australia 23,775 - 4,300,120 3,500,000 Western Australia 9,619 1,547,975 1,000,000 Tasmania 11,733 1,347,505 1,000,000 Grand total 241,668 43,850,160 40,000,000 There were 143,748 subscribers to the Sixth War Loan, which reached £42,851,960-. The average subscription to the Sixth War Loan amounted to £29S, and to the Seventh War Loan £181. The subscribers to the Sixth War Loan numbered 1 in 34 of the population; to the Seventh War Loan 1 in 20. The great success of the Seventh W a r Loan may, in be- general, be ascribed to the determination the people to carry on the war, but the particular factors which brought about a better result than before may be set down as better organization and publicity, and the introduction to Parliament of the Loan Subscriptions Bill . On this occasion, for the first time, the Treasury had the assistance of very active Loan Committees throughout the length and breadth of Australia. To all the workers the Government cordially extends its thanks, and trusts that when the time comes for raising another loan their valuable' services may again be available. To the banks also thanks are due. They worked very hard indeed to obtain subscriptions under what Ls known as the special advances system, and succeeded in obtaining assisted subscriptions of the very large amount of £21,892,122. The aid of the press must also be gratefully acknowledged. In the opinion of those competent to judge, the loan would not have been successfully raised had not the m in i mum public duty of citizens been set before them in the Bill referred to, and the Government believes it is necessary to place the Bill upon the statute-book. It is pleasing to record that the interest on this, the largest loan ever raised in Australia, is subject-to taxation. That fact disposes, once for all, of any suggestion that freedom from taxation must be given to attract money'for war purposes. Another satisfactory feature of the loan is that the number of subscribers is much larger than ever before. The war loan has thus been distributed widely throughout - all classes of the community. PRIME MINISTER IN ENGLAND. COMMENTS BY "" MANCHESTER GUARDIAN.""",25
46,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIAN MEAT,"Has the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Watt) read the cabled extract from the Manchester Guardian, objecting to certain statements and actions by the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) while in England? Would the Acting Prime Minister mind telling us what is the real object of the Prime Minister's stay in Great Britain-whethe r it has anything to do with the fiscal system as earned out in Britain or elsewhere?",26
47,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIAN MEAT,"I am rather surprised to hear the honourable member ask a question of this kind; I had imagined that the monopoly of such inqui'sitiveness was enjoyed by the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Higgs). It seems, however, that some magnetic influence has spread itself from the honourable member for Capricornia to one of his most devoted admirers.",26
48,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIAN MEAT,"I cannot get the information, and the honourable member is trying to.",26
49,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIAN MEAT,"I am sure that if the honourable member himself cannot get the information the honourable member for Melbourne Ports cannot. Anyone who knows anything of the traditions of the Manchester Guardian must realise that that newspaper is not at all likely to agree with the fiscal tenets of any Australian statesman who is worth his salt. Manchester Guardian must be expected to disapprove of some of the utterances of the representative of this Government in London. If I were there, or if my honourable friend, the member for Capricornia, were there, this newspaper would take him to task in the same flamboyant way as it has the Prime Minister.",26
50,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIAN MEAT,But I would not call the newspaper pro-German.,26
51,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIAN MEAT,The Prime Minister has not done so.,26
52,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIAN MEAT,He has called his opponents pro-Germans.,26
53,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIAN MEAT,"At any rate, he has not called the Manchester Guardian proGerman.",26
54,Mr BRENNAN,AUSTRALIAN MEAT,"What does it matter what the Prime Minister calls anybody, so long as he does not come back.",26
55,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIAN MEAT,"It may not matter to the honourable member who interjects, but it matters to the great body of public opinion in Australia, with which the honourable member, I am afraid, does not count.",26
56,Mr BRENNAN,AUSTRALIAN MEAT,He is a back number 1,26
57,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN MEAT, I must ask the honourable member to cease interjecting.,26
58,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIAN MEAT,"As to the object of the Prime Minister's visit, I have answered question times without number since his departure in April. His stay in Britain will be long, because of the gi'eat things that are happening there; this I have also previously announced. His stay will, I think, meet with the ful l approval of the people in Australia who count.",26
59,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIAN MEAT,They want him to stay there altogether!,26
60,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIAN MEAT,That is a bad-natured remark that has nothing to do with the case.,26
61,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN MEAT,"If honourable members will not obey the direction of the Chair, I shall have to take further steps.",26
62,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIAN MEAT,"I should be sorry to see the honourable member subjected to such treatment as that suggested by Mr. Speaker, because he - is .usually exemplary in the matter of courtesy. However, I The do not wish to labour this matter. My honourable friends opposite frequently complain of the criticism of the press; and such criticism is just as hurtful and improper when directed against the Leader of this House as when directed against the ethics and policy of the Opposition. COMMONWEALT H STEAMERS. CONSTRUCTION IN AMERICA.",26
63,Mr KELLY,AUSTRALIAN MEAT,"Will the Acting M in ister for the Navy arrange for honourable members to have a chance of studying the specifications and the contract in connection with the construction in America of certain wooden ships for the Commonwealth Government?  ther we have those specifications, or whether they were arranged in America. I shall make inquiry, and, if possible, comply with the honourable member's request. MILITARY POLICE. ties.",27
64,Dr MALONEY,AUSTRALIAN MEAT,"Statements have been made by the military police that their hours of duty are sometimes from 8 a.m. t ill 11 p.m., and that meat is no longer served with their last meal, which they have at 4.30 p.m. Their evening meal consists of only tea, bread, and jam, although they are kept on duty t ill 11 p.m. I ask the Assistant Minister for Defence why Captain Graham has ordered that change in the evening meal; and, also, why he said to a man, named A. C. Fisher, who had obtained leave for forty-eight hours to attend an examination for the Railway Department, that he was a disgrace and a dishonour to the service, although tha man has a good discharge after 505 days' service? Is it the intention of the Department to starve the military police, and thus render them unable to do their duty?",27
65,Mr WISE,AUSTRALIAN MEAT,"I shall make inquiries garding the statements made by the honourable member, and acquaint him with the Tesult -.' Government is at the present time being NAVAL BASES .",27
66,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIAN MEAT,"the Acting Prime Minister, upon noticeHaving reference to a statement (12th June, .1918) by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, viz., "" The Committee have been unable to find any definite evidence that the authorities know exactly what is their objective in regard to (Naval) Base Construction,"" will the Acting Prime Minister state what is the ultimate object of base construction?",27
67,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIAN MEAT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:As regards the two main bases now under construction, the Naval Board know exactly what their objective is. Messrs. Goode, Matthews, Fitzmaurice, and Wilson, of London, furnished a complete report and lay-out plans of Henderson Naval Base, which the Naval Board adopted on 2nd February, 1915. Complete lay-out plans of Flinders Naval Base were approved on 20th February, 1.914. The ultimate object of Naval Base construction is to provide an establishment where the seagoing fleet can in security be refitted and repaired, coaled, victualled, stored, &c, and where the personnel can be trained, exercised, and. accommodated when not actually at sea. A base may contain all or part of these faciliI may add that the Minister for Works and Railways recently explained this matter in the House. MICA. Mr HIGGiS asked the Acting Prime Minister, upon notice|1. Is it the intention of the Government to foster the industry of mica production and manufacture in Australia? 2. If so, in what manner?",27
68,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIAN MEAT,"I am advised by the Minister for Trade and Customs that the industry of mica production and manufacture i h Australia is one which is considered to be deserving of support, and which, there is no doubt, can be developed into a permanent and prosperous business. The matter has been the subject of careful inquiry and consideration, but it does not appear that at the present time re- any Government assistance is called for, as the investigation of local deposits with a view to supplying mica to the British vigorously conducted by certain parties without any assistance from the Government, the market price being a sufficient inducement. The question as to the placing of an import duty on its manufactures has been noted for consideration when the T a r i ff is being further dealt with by Parliament. WOOL TOPS CONTRACT.",27
69,Mr HIGGS,AUSTRALIAN MEAT,"the Act in g P r i m e Minister, upon notice I. Will he lay on the table of the House all reports made by the auditor acting for the Government in the audit of the Colonial Combing, Spinning and Weaving Company's accounts in connection with the Government's agreements with - the said company? 2. If so, when will he lay the said report or reports on the table of the House?",28
70,Mr WATT,AUSTRALIAN MEAT,Thes e reports are now being examined by the Treasury Accountant. As soon as the examination is complete I will be better able to judge whether the request of the honourable member should be acceded to. NA TELEGRAPHISTS.,28
71,Mr MAHONY,HOURS OE SYDNEY,"the Postmaster General, upon notice I. Is it a fact that telegraphists in the General Post Office, Sydney, are kept working almost daily from 8.30 a.m. t ill 6 p.in., and that such lengthened hours are caused through shortage of staff? 12. Is it a fact that the operating room is only staffed with sufficient men to meet the requirements of the very slackest days (not periods) of the year? 3. Is he aware that Dr Chisholm Boss, said to be one of the leading specialists in Australia, has given his opinion that any period over six and a half hours per day worked by telegraphists would be injurious, to their health?",28
72,Mr WEBSTER,HOURS OE SYDNEY,"The Deputy Postmaster-General, Sydney, has furnished the following information:1. In emergent circumstances, such as pressure of (traffic through interruptions, a certain number of telegraphists in turn have been kept working operating from 8.30 a.m. to times up to 6 p.m. The lengthened' hours have been caused by shortage of staff due to illness of supervisors and telegraphists, and also through staff vacancies. The latter are due to no one being eligible for appointment through suspension of examinations owing to the war. -2. No ; when staff vacancies are filled the schedule provides for normal traffic. 3. Nothing is known of the opinion of Dr Chisholm Boss, except that given before the Arbitration Court, as indicated in the press, when he stated that thirty-six hours' work per week was too long.' MEAT PRICES.  Minister for Trade and Customs, uponnoticeW ill the Minister, in fixing the price of meat, fix the minimum as well as the maximum price, so that graziers shall receive a fair price equal at least to the export parity, or will he devisesome scheme to prevent the producers from being victimized?",28
73,Mr MASSYGREENE,HOURS OE SYDNEY,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows :It is not considered that in the existing disorganized state of producing interests any good would result from an attempt to fix minimum prices of meat. It is considered that a great deal can be done by co-operative effort to prevent abnormal fluctuations of the market. It may also be pointed out that in South Australia the Government Freezing Works are giving the following prices for all mutton and lamb consigned to them and passed for export on Imperial account:Prices. Lamb (approved and passed), 6Jd. per l b . f.o.b. Legs (hoggets) (approved and passed), 5fd. per lb. f.o.b. Wether mutton (approved and passed), 5|d. per lb. f.o.b. Ewe mutton (approved and passed), 5d. per lb. f.o.b. Bam mutton (approved and passed), 4Jd. per lb. f.o.b. All third quality meat, Jd. per lb. f.o.b. less. Conditions. To assume ownership and accept all responsibility with the exception of fire insurance for the first four months, as soon as the meat has been placed in cold store, hut not to pay for it u n t i l placed f.o.b. To pay all storage charges after the meat has been in store twenty-eight (28) days. Amongst the departmental charges and conditions are the following: The Department will take delivery at ita works, Port Adelaide, and wiU slaughter, weigh, grade, freeze, bag, and brand at five-eighths of one penny (Jd-) per lb., plus an agency fee of threepence (3d.) per carcass. The charges cover twenty-eight (28) days' storage, fire insurance (only) for four months, Commerce Act inspection fees, all charges incurred in placing on board vessels, interest on advanced payments, and attending to the business of shipping and settlement with the Imperial Government. AH additional charges for extra storage, insurance, &c., will be made to the Imperial Government. The skin will be returned to the owner or his agent, or sold on his account il' requested. Every necessary care will, be taken to leave the trotters, head, and cheek-pieces on the skin; but should they through any unavoidable cause Ibe broken off, they shall become the property of the Department. All caul f at and kidney fat taken from the carcass will be purchased by the Department at market rates. INTERNMENT OE W. J. FEGAN.",28
74,Mr FINLAYSON,HOURS OE SYDNEY,"the Assistant Minister for Defence, upon notice I. Whether it is a fact that when arrested on the 24th October, 1917, Willia m J. Fegan, of Brisbane, was under a surety bond of £50 (pursuant to Magistrate's order) not to do anything contrary to theWiar Precautions Act? 2. If so, has the said surety been estreated, and if not, why not? 3. If Mr Fegan did nothing contrary to the 'War Precautions «Aet which justified the - estreating of the sureties, why was he arrested and interned in Darlinghurst Gaol, Sydney, ior the past twelve months? 4. Is it a fact that Mr Fegan holds a letter 'from Brigadier-General Irvin g stating he was Jicing arrested in consequence of a letter published by him (Fegan) in the Brisbane Daily H a i l newspaper, and also in consequence of his evidence at the subsequent trial? 6. Is it a fact that he complied with the Magistrate's judgment by paying the fine and <sosts amounting to £12 8s. 8d. and giving the sureties required? 6. If so, was not his arrest and detention - contrary to section 6 of the War Precautions Act, which provides that no person shall be punished a second time for the same offence? 7. Having regard to the fact that MT . Fegan has a wife and seven children in Brisbane, whom he has not seen since his arrest in October, 1917, will the Minister direct .that Mr . Fegan be transferred to the State of Queensland, and detained tliere in custody in either - the military or civil gaol within a reasonable - distance of Brisbane, so that his family may have an opportunity of visiting him?",29
75,Mr WISE,HOURS OE SYDNEY,"This matter is being inquired into, and the honourable member - will be informed as early as possible. NA",29
76,Mr BAYLEY,AMBULANCE RAILWA Y,"the Assistant Minister for Defence, upon noticeHas the Defence Department taken any steps to secure properly-equipped ambulance carriages for the use of cot cases amongst returned soldiers travelling from Wallangarra to ^Brisbane ?",29
77,Mr WISE,AMBULANCE RAILWA Y,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:No properly-equipped ambulance carriages are available in the 1st M i l it a r y District (Queensland), but the M i l it a r y Commandant advises that first class saloon carriages with S latform ends are provided for the use of soliers who are cot cases.

78,Mr HIGGS,DUTY ON STORES FOR NAVA L,"the Assistant Minister for Trade and Customs, upon notice I. Is there differential treatment of the military and Navy by Trade and Customs Officers, i.e., are the military op embarkation allowed their stores duty free while the Navy are charged duty? 2. Why was duty demanded on stores required for HMAS. Brisbane during the latter end of 1917?",29
79,Mr GEEENE,DUTY ON STORES FOR NAVA L,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are:1. No. In each case the same concession is allowed as in regard to stores for ordinary merchant vessels, viz., dutiable goods ex warehouse or under drawback may be placed aboard for consumption outside Australian waters. No duty is charged upon goods imported or purchased in bond by the Department of the Navy for use aboard vessels of the Australian Navy. The only duty levied is upon spirits, wines, tobacco, cigars, and the like taken aboard for the private use of the officers whilst the vessels are in Australian waters. 2. Beference is evidently to an application by a Sydney trader for permission to ship by the Mawatta a considerable quantity of tobacco and cigarettes to the Brisbane, then at an island in the Pacific. OTiia application was at first refused, but on further representation by the Navy Department it was arranged, in January last, that where any vessel of the Royal Australian Navy was outsideAustraCARRIAGES. lian waters dutiable goods might be transferred thereto ess bond or under drawback, provided only that on the return of the vessel to Australia the unused portion of such stores was placed under seal, and remained so u n t i l the vessel again departed for an oversea destination, or alternatively that duty was paid on any stores consumed locally. That practice still obtains. SEVENTH WAR LOAN. Mr FINLAYSON MCDONALD ) asked the Treasurer, upon notice I.

82,Mr KELLY,DUTY ON STORES FOR NAVA L,"the Assistant M in ister for the N a v y , upon not i c e1. Did the Controller of Shipping state some time ago that the s.s. Merimbula, owing to scanty bunker space, &c, was incapable of use outside of the Illawarra-Sydney trade? 2. Was the vessel, after public criticism of her idleness, chartered to run from Hobart to Brisbane? 3. Ia it a fact that the s.s. Namoi is lying idle for more than half the year? 4. Is it a fact that the s.s. Hunter does no work beyond a Saturday excursion from Sydney to the Hawkesbury River? 5. Is it a fact that the Cethana has been in port for about ten weeks? 6. Is it a fact that Inter-State steamers still run to a time-table instead of their full capacity? 7. Is it a fact that coal hulks, otherwise idle, could be utilized transporting coal from (for Mr coal ports to Sydney and elsewhere under towage?  honourable member's questions are as f o l low :1. The statement in the form asked was not made by the Controller of Shipping. The Controller stated that the Merimbula had very small bunker accommodation and a large consumption of coal considering her size, the effect being that if sufficient coal were taken to last a reasonably short Inter-State voyage it would encroach upon her lift in g power to the in - such an extent that she would be able to carry only a small quantity of cargo and hardly sufficient to warrant her being employed Inter-State. 2. The Merimbula was subsequently chartered by a Sydney firm and run in the Hobart to Brisbane service, calling at Sydney, and as expected, after a few weeks' t r i a l she has proved unsuitable, and has been returned to her owners. (for' Mr 3. The Namoi has been lying idle since 6th August last. She will be required again in the Hunter Biver trade this month. This vessel is a paddle steamer, and like the Merimbula, is unsuitable for Inter-State work. Efforts have been made by the Controller to find employment for her by a rearrangement of the New South Wales coastal services, in order to permit of a coastal vessel more suitable for Inter-State work being released, but on account of the depth of water in the river's, and as the Namoi was unfitted for jetty work where timber was principally loaded, she could not be used as a substitute. 4. No. The Hunter is full y and constantly employed. There is no other local vessel available capable of handling the tonnage she is called upon to lift . 5. No, the Cethana has been in port for fifty days. 6. Inter-State vessels are only running to a time-table, where, by so doing, they are utilized to the best advantage 7. Yes, but the Inter-State Central Committee had no funds whioh could be used for the purpose of purchasing and refitting hulks. NA DEPARTMENT. ROYAL COMMISSION'S REPORT ON.",30

84,Mr WATT,ADMINISTRATION OF NAVY,"The answer to both questions will be best presented in a letter which I have received from the Chair1 man of the Commission, dated'1st Noing vember, which reads as follows:Your letters of the 29th and 30th ult., (a) whether the Commission could expedite the investigations which are being made gard to the acquisition of the Shaw Wireless Works, Kandwick, New South Wales, and (6) whether it is the intention of the Commission to conduct the proceedings in public, have been received and considered by the Commission. The Commission will expedite the investigamake tion in every possible way. The Commission had considered the best method of investigating the matters mentioned pressed that plainly. in your letters before the receipt of these letters, and had decided to follow the practice heretobefore adopted by it , vie., to make enquiries in private. This course was sidered to fie more in the public interest a public inquiry. The Commission sees no reason to alter its decision. It must not be forgotten that the Commission is not considering any charges, but merely inquiring into the facts surrounding the acquisition of certain property by the Commonwealth Government. The Commission, in its report to His Excellency the Governor General on the matters above mentioned, will attach a complete copy of all statements made and of documents placed before it .

In deciding the form of the answer to be given to the original question of the honourable member for Echuca, I did not this clear, but as I held the view that no good purpose would be served in discussing the matter as suggested I exI regret if the form of the answer caused the honourable its member to believe that the Minister for conDefence held similar views to myself with than regard to the procedure in this House.

Is it a fact, as stated by Mr Wynne, that "" the Central Wool Committee is so constituted that the individual interests of its members are opposed to the extension of the textile industry in Australia""?",31
88,Mr WATT,ADMINISTRATION OF NAVY,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as fol1-3. A letter dated 11th March, 1918, was refrom Mr Wynne stating that his business of importing textile machinery was suspended owing to the war. and that he had a amount of time which he could place the Government's disposal in advice, ftc, in connection with the further development of the woollen industry and the manufacture of tops for the Home market. No mention was made of being able to supply textile machinery. The letter wns forwarded to the Central Wool Committee, who thanked Mr Wynne for his offer, nnd advised that should occasion arise he would be called upon. 4. No; Mr Wynne has since corrected his statement as first published, and expressed regret that anything should have appeared which would bear that construction. DEEENCE DEPARTMENT.

In reply, I stated that I was not aware that such was the fact, but that I would endeavour to give a reply next week. I desire now to state, for the information of the honourable member, that arrangements are being made for a number of steamers to come to Australia at an early date to load wheat amounting to approximately 45,000 tons, but I am unable to give any further particulars. NA SOLDIER S.",33
94,Mr WATT,PREFERENC E TO RETURNE D,"On the 9 th October the honourable member for Dampier (Mr . GREGORY) asked the following question:Is the Acting Prime Minister contemplating an amendment of the Public Service Act so as to afford effective preference to returned soldiers; and, if so, is the honourable gentleman prepared to make a statement? My reply was- ' There is a certain law on the matter in which this House has concurred. Nothing fresh is contemplated that I am aware of at tin's stage, but I shall make inquiries. I am now able to furnish the honourable member with the following information :- ' Effective .preference is already afforded returned soldiers in connection with appointments to the Commonwealth Service. On 2flth June, 1915, an instruction was issued that until six months after the termination of the war, except in special cases approved by the Prime Minister, positions in the Commonwealth Public Service were not to be tilled by permanent appointments of persons of military age. This was done to safeguard the interests of those who enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force. .Returned soldiers have merely to pass the prescribed examination, and they are appointed to the Service, irrespective of the fact that persons who arc not returned soldiers may have secured higher marks. Special examinations have been held for appointment as clerk, open only to returned soldiers. Power is given to the Public Service Commissioner to appoint returned soli l l diers who have qualified by passing the prescribed examination to any particular class or subdivision of a class of the clerical division, and under this provision a higher commencing rate of pay has been fixed for returned appointed to the clerical, division. In FLOUR. connection with the appointment of returned soldiers who pass the prescribed examination, such persons are regarded as senior to all persons who have not served with the Expeditionary Forces appointed as the result of the first examination held after the date of enlistment. The age limit for candidates for the clerical division has been extended from twenty-five years to fifty years in the case of returned soldiers. Provision has also been made for returned soldiers to be appointed to the Service though suffering from physical defects, so long as they are able to perform efficiently their duties. In connection with temporary employment, returned soldiers have preference, married men receiving first preference. .Returned soldiers replace eligibles. In regard to casuals, i.e., persons employed for brief terms, returned soldiers receive first preference, and are to replace eligibles wherever possible. Provision has been made whereby the passing by returned soldiers of certain prescribed examinations other than the Commonwealth Public Service examination constitutes eligibility for appointment. TRANSPORTS: GONE CONTRACT.  promise made to the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) on Friday last, I present the following statement regarding contracts with Messrs. Cone and Company for the fitting up of transports :On 12th January, 1915, Mr Jensen, Finance Member and Assistant Minister, telegraphed from Melbourne to Senator Pearce, Minister for Defence, at Sydney, as follows:"" Regarding fittin g transports at Melbourne State Dockyard will not conform to our wishes as to method engaging men. They cannot handle in the time more than the three ships they are now engaged on. In order to complete vessels recommended that two ships, Ttonus and Ghilka, be allotted to Cone and Company, who will do the work on basis of 10 per cent, upon market rate of timber, and 10 per cent, upon cost labour. They are contractors, not timber merchants, and have had great experience in this work. sider work will be done economically, quickly, and efficiently, labour conditions will be observed and more men employed. Recommend as above after discussing With Third Naval Member and Naval Secretary. raised as to whether any other quotations could be obtained, but Third Naval Member states that no others will be forthcoming. Please reply early."" 2. Reply was received as follows on 13th January:"" Approved your recommendation re transports provided contractor accepts same conditions as imposed on contractors Brisbane - Pearce. "" 3. On 14th January, 1915, the following letter was received from Messrs. Cone and Company:"" The Secretary of Naval Board, Melbourne. "" Sir - R e fittin g up of transports. We bog to confirm verbal arrangements made by Captain Clarkson with our Mr Cone to do any work required on the following terms, viz.:"" 1. All work to be carried out on the basis of 10 per cent, commission on cost of material and labour. "" 2. All labour to be obtained through the Trades Hal l u n t i l exhausted. (Sgd.) "" W. C. CONE & Co."" NOTE - This was the first agreement with Cone and Company im connection with fitting out ships as transports. 4. Cone and Company were given first the fittin g out of /tonus and ChiUca, and later on other vessels were placed in their hands to be fitted out as transports. 5. As work progressed Messrs. Cone and Company were paid progress payments on account of expenditure incurred, pending rendering of final accounts. 6. In May, 1915, a report was received by the Department indicating that certain irregularities existed in regard to the work being carried out. After investigation, the Minister (Senator Pearce) referred the matter to the Auditor-General for inquiry. The Auditor General's inquiries did not reveal any irregularities on the part of Cone and Company, but the Minister decided that the contract between the Department and Messrs. Cone and Company, viz., 10 per cent, commission on cost of labour and material, was not suffi-. cicntly definite, e.g., differences with contractors had arisen over the interpretation of the meaning of "" cost"" of material, <Ssc. It was also considered that more advantageous terms should be obtained for the Department, in view of the estimated prices at which Cone and Company could obtain timber. Accordingly Mr Jensen, Assistant Minister, arranged a now contract with Cone and Company, which superseded the original arrangement of 10 per cent, commission, and had Con- retrospective effect from 1st February, 1915, thus covering all work done by Cone and Comand pany prior to date of new contract, viz., 4th August, 1915. The terms of this second contract are summarized as follow: "" 1. That the contrnctors be reimbursed Point was the actual amounts paid for day labour, plus 10 per cent, thereon. 2. That hardwood timber be purchased at the prices in the published lists of the Associated Timber Merchants, less 10 per cent. 3. That all other timber be secured at most favourable prices, plus 5 per cent, on amounts paid. 4. That all other stores be obtained at cost price, plus 5 per cent., less any discount allowed by vendor. 5. That in respect of all sub-contracts, the actual cost be charged, plus 5 per cent, for supervision, subject to the Minister being satisfied that the' prices charged by the sub-contractor are fai r and reasonable, and that such work could not be carried out by the original contractors. 0. That the contractors should hand over to the Department the actual invoices showing details of purchases made in respect of work of fitting up ships."" 7. Though the new contract was satisfactory to the Department, the examination of accounts for final charges for fitting some of the transports revealed irregularities in connection with the claims of a sub-contraotor employed by ""Yours faithfully, Cone and Company for carrying out plumbing work, viz., Messrs. Peacock and Smith. As the result of the investigations the Minister in structed the Auditor-General to take such action under the War Precautions Aot as was thought necessary. The Auditor-General reported the result of his examination on 6th December, 1915,' and on 13th December, 1915, the Assistant Minister (Hon. J. A. Jensen) directed that the report be referred to the Crown Law Department for consideration as to action to be' taken against Peacock and Smith. On 11th January, 1916, the Attorney General (Hon. W. M . Hughes) minuted papers containing Crown Solicitor's opinion as follows :"" If there appears reasonable prospect of success, approve that proceedings be instituted in order to act as a deterrent to other contractors."" 8. Acting on advice of counsel, criminal proceedings were accordingly taken against Messrs. Peacock and Smith. These proceedings were unsuccessful, and Peacock was acquitted "" without a stain on his character."" !). Regarding the settlement of Cone and Company's accounts, during the course of the two investigations by the Auditor-iGeneral, and pending the proceedings against the sub-contractor, the Department did not attempt to finalize Cone and Company's claims, but merely paid progress payments in respect of the total debits rendered by the firm, holding a sufficient balance iti hand to safeguard the interests of the Department. 10. It was considered desirable that the account with Messrs. Cone and Company should be kept open as long as possible to enable the Department to see the result of the detailed investigations which were made consequent on the decision to proceed against Peacock and Smith criminally. The accounts rendered by Cone and Company from time to time, therefore, were not dealt with separately at any time, but progress payments only made, and all debits rendered by the firm treated as on account of the total claim. 11. On 19th February, 1916, the following minute (from which a quotation appears in the report of the Royal Commission) was signed by the Acting Director of Navy Accounts. This minute, which summarized the position of the accounts at the above date, was written solely in connection with an application by Cone and Company for a further progress payment of £15,000. MINUTE PAWS. Subject - Fittin g up of transports by W. C. Cone and Company - Progres s payments on account. 3rd Naval Member. Attached is a further application from Messrs. W. C. Cone and Company for progress payment of £15,000. 2. Final accounts totalling £27,688 have recently been rendered, and the position in regard to these claims is now as follows:Total final accounts rendered . . £168,504 Less credits allowed 2,810 Payments made Balance due . 3. Considerable reductions will be necessary in the accounts rendered. These reductions might be estimated at, say, £15,000, leaving a balance of approximately £8,000. 4. It is not considered that a larger progress payment than £7,000 should be made in the circumstances. 5. If you concur, please certify attached account. The deductions of £15,000 alluded to in the above minute referred to the total estimated reductions from the accounts then rendered by Cone and Company, ancl it will be noted that the words "" progress payment"" are used. 12. The making of a further progress payment of £7,000 to Cone and Company was agreed to by the 3rd Naval Member (Admiral Clarkson), but the Assistant Minister (Hon. J. A. Jensen) would not approve payment, and minuted the papers as follows:"" In view of the very unsatisfactory disclosures of Peacock and Smith, for which Cone and Company were the sole persons responsible for supervision, I cannot consent to further paynients to Cone and Company until final adjustments are made."" 13. At the close of the investigations which preceded the criminal .action, a settlement was made with Cone and Company on the advice of counsel, disregarding the amount due in respect of the sub-contractor's (Peacock and Smith) claim. 14. The position of the accounts was then as follows:£ s. d. Total debits rendered by Cone and Company .. . . 177,330 13 1 Less progress payments made 140,800 0 0 36,530 13 1 £ s. d. Less Peacock and Smith's account .. 29,877 19 11 Less progress payments . . 15,600 0 0 : 14,277 19 11 Balance of account .. 22,252 13 2 In final settlement of this sum, Cone and Company agreed to accept £11,750, being a saving to the Department of £10,502 13s. 2d. This was considered a satisfactory settlement for the Department. Peacock and Smith's (sub-contractors) account stood as follows:£ s. d. Total claim . . 29,877 19 11 Less paid by Cone and Company on account . . 15,600 0 0 Balance due . . . . 14,277 19 11 £165,694 16. After the termination of legal proceed.. 142,651 ings, settlement was effected in respect of Peacock and Smith's claim by a lump sum pay.. £23,043 ment of £10,250, being a reduction of £4,027 19s. l i d . A further payment of £1,034 was approved to Cone and Company, being commission on this sub-contractor's account, at 4 per cent., in lieu of 5 per cent, as per agreement. 17. Similarly to the settlement with Cone and Company, Peacock and Smith's account was dealt with as a whole, and no action was taken to settle any part of the claim u n t i l final negotiations were completed. The final adjustment of these claims was made on the recommendation of responsible departmental officers. 18. It wdll be seen that on the total claim of £177,330 a reduction of £13,490 was made. This is considered a very substantial reduction in the circumstances, and further reductions could only .have been effected by successf u l civil legal proceedings. Such proceedings would have been prolonged, and probably might have proved very expensive to the Department. In the opinion of counsel, the Department would take the most economical course by settling the claims for the lowest possible sum agreed between the parties. 19. The final result of the transactions under this contract is not considered unsatisfactory to the Department, as the cost of fitting out ships by Cone and Company compared very favourably with the cost of work carried out in Commonwealth dockyards, and more than favourably with the cost of ships fitted out at the State dockyard. 20. It should be explained that in the settlement of the claims of Messrs. W. C. Cone and Company the Department had the benefit of legal advice, the main part of which is as follows:"" I think it certain that of the amount of such discrepancies, & c , a considerable sum will , on further investigation, be - to be due to Cone, and the question is how best, in the interests of the Department, to deal with the matter. Three courses are open(a) Leave Cone to sue the Depart{-&) refer the matter to arbitration; (c) endeavour to settle the whole mat(a) and (6 ) . However profitable these' courses may be to me personally, I do not feel that I can recommend their adoption. In either case, I feel that some amount would have to he paid by the Department, and the result would be very heavy costs, owing to the lengthy nature of the proceedings. Every one practising in the Courts is familiar with the proceedings in building contract cases, and knows that the results are almost always incommensurate with the expenses incurred. I should, therefore, recommend that an attempt be made to settle the whole claim. I need hardly say that I have .considered  this matter very thoroughly and carefnlly, and I am certain that such a settlement - would be in the interests of the Navy Department, and would avoid a very long, troublesome, and costly litigation."" This advice was given before the prosecution of Messrs. Peacock and Smith, and after that prosecution failed, it was considered that it was sound advice to follow in connection with the settlement of Messrs. Peacock and Smith's claims. EXPORT OF RABBIT SKINS.",33
95,Mr MASSYGREENE,PREFERENC E TO RETURNE D,"On the 23rd ultimo the honourable member for Darling (Mr. Blakeley) asked the Minister for Trade and Gustoms the following questions:1. Whether it is a fact that consignments of rabbit skins have been sent to Japan, Canada, the United States, artd England during the past two years? 2. Tf so, will the Minister supply a return showing the weight of such consignments, the names of the consignees, and to whom despatched ? 3. Is it a fact that large consignments of rabbit skins have been sent to England per parcels post during the past twelve months? 4. If so, will the Minister supply a return showing particulars of such consignments? The honourable member was informed that the informaJtion would be obtained.

96,Mr MASSYGREENE,PREFERENC E TO RETURNE D,"On Thursday last the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) asked me a question relative to preventing the manufacture of starch from z-ice. After consideration, I now desire to inform the honourable member that maize and rice are both valuable foods, and maize probably more so than rice. For laundry purposes it is considered that rice starch is much to be preferred to that manufactured from maize, and it is on this account that the demand for it greatly exceeds that made from the latter product. This is emphasized by the fact that there are five rice and only one maize starch manufacturers in Australia. Under these circumstances, it is not intended to restrict the manufacture of rice «tarch, the present supplies of rice being sufficient to meet all immediate demands. I may remind the honourable member that starch can be made from most cereals. S OLDIERS ' MEDALSANDBADGE S. son PROSECUTIONS.",36

Whether the Minister's attention has been - drawn to the prosecution ait iSydney, by the Defence Department, of Frederick John Betcke for illegally wearing decorations andmedals, and tlic imposition of a fine of £2, or seven days' imprisonment? 2. Has the Minister's attention also been drawn to the court martial on No. 5324 Private M. J.

In view of the above cases, will the Minispensioner ter take steps to stop the prosecutions of returned soldiers who have failed to wear such arm-badges? In reply to inquiries which were then being made, the following particulars have been furnished:1. Yes.

He was going under the nanne of Captain Fane, V.C, and was wearing the ribbon of the V.C, and the King's and Queen's South African ribbons. Betcke did not deny the evidence of the prosecution, and was convicted and fined £2, the magistrate giving him time to pay, on an undertaking being given by his relatives they would take action to see that he did continue to pretend falsely to be a returned soldier. Betcke was previously convicted, 20th November, 1917, of illegally wearing form, and was sentenced to two months' imprisonment, with hard labour. 2. Yes. 3.

WAR PENSIONS. NA WEDLOCK.",37
98,Mr WISE,MOTHERS OF SOLDIERS BORN OUT OF,"On the 16th October the honourable member for - Batman (Mr . Brennan) asked the following question :-I wish to ask the Minister representing the Minister for Defence whether he regards with complacency the fact that a mother of a soldier killed in action is, in one case of which I know, absolutely destitute because, since her was born out of wedlock, she is not entitled to receive a pension. This woman is fifty-nine years of age-jus t too young to obtain an old-age pension, and too old to work. Will the Minister consider the advisableness of issuing an amended regulation to permit of mothers of soldiers killed in action, and who were born out of wedlock, receiving a pension like other mothers who have lost-their sons? In reply to inquiries which I then promised to make, the Department of the Treasury advises to the following effect:The .mother of a soldier born out of wedlock is entitled to a war pension (in the event of the death of the soldier) providing she was dependent either wholly or in part on the soldier during the twelve months prior to enlistment. Such pensions are continued indefinitely if the is considered to be unable to earn a livelihood. If such a .mother was not dependent on the soldier prior to enlistment, no pension is payable. The Act provides that pensions may be granted to the parents of a deceased soldier who, - although not dependent on Mm prior to his enlistment, are at any time without adequate means; but the Crown Solicitor is of opinion that the provision does not extend to the mother of a son born out of wedthe case referred to, if the woman is to work, it is suggested that she should to apply for an invalid pension.

99,Mr WISE,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"On Friday last the honthat orable member for Melbourne (Dr not Maloney) asked a question with reference to the dismissal of disabled soldiers. In on reply, I beg to inform him that it is reunigretted that there are no suitable vacancies in the Department in which these men can be placed. As previously indicated, owing to the general reduction of the district guard only the most effective men can be employed, and other returned soldiers with the necessary qualifications for any vacancies are available. matter of finding employment for these men is one for the Repatriation Department, to whom it is suggested the men should apply if in need of assistance in this direction.

119,Mr OHARLTON,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"The effect which my amendment would have on the revenue-earning provisions of this Bill would be infinitesimal. I submit it , not with the object of preventing the speedy passing of the clause now before us, but merely to extend the concession which the Government had in their minds when they agreed to amend this Bill in another place. It is only fair to give some consideration to families. A working man with five or six children has to spend more than one day's earnings in order to give them a holiday; and surely a man who gives his children an outing on a public holiday should be allowed to take them to a picture show without being called upon to pay this additional tax.",39

124,Mr ATKINSON,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"No , he has not.",40
125,Mr MAHONY,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"It will bring this measure into conformity with other measures already on the statute-book. Even under our Income Tax Act we grant an exemption in (consideration of. children up to the age of sixteen, but this Bill , as it stands, proposes to penalize them from the age of twelve. The amount of revenue involved is very small, and I think the Treasurer might very well accept the amendment. The honourable member for Wilmo t (Mr Atkinson) must nob forget that the repeal of the bachelors' tax has been announced; and yet this Bill would impose a penalty on people who are doing their duty to the country by bringing children into the world. NOES. Mr ATKINSON (Wilmot ) [ 4 . 2 3 ] - I do not like the taxing of 3d. tickets, and only the necessity for revenue induces me to follow the Treasurer. I cannot see any analogy in the argument of the honourable member who has submitted this amendment. Children are supposed to be supported by their parents until they are sixteen years of age, and up to then are Webster, W. somewhat of-a burden; and in this regard some consideration is shown to mothers whose husbands are at the war, and who have to support children. If there were two rates of charges for admission, the PAIRS. ppssibility is that the management of a picture show would refuse to admit for 3d. any children over twelve years of age.",40
126,Mr RILEY,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"South Sydney) [4.24] I am surprised at the honourable member for Wilmo t (Mr Atkinson) opposing a simple amendment like this-. If the honourable member had a family to support I might understand his attitude; and, really, I think this is a question which can only be dealt with by family men. As a rule, children do not go to work until they are over sixteen years of age, and it is quite possible that a father with a growing family might find this tax quite burdensome. It is a paltry means of raising revenue in a wealthy country like Australia. I trust the Government will not deal with this as a party question, but will allow their supporters freedom of action. The honourable member for Wilmot has told us that he does not desire to have this tax imposed, but is prepared to follow the Treasurer.",40
127,Mr ATKINSON,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,I said that the Treasurer had told us the revenue is necessary.,40

This would wipe out theanomaly AYKS. which would place the heaviest burden on those least able to bear it . All the theatres have increased - their charges of admission since the outbreak of war, and are reputed to_ be making large profits, but this Bill will allow theatre proprietors to escape, and the purchasers of the higher-priced tickets will tie taxed only to the extent of 8^ per cent, as compared with the tax of 33$ per cent, on 3d. tickets. I feel sure that if the Treasurer were agreeable the House would endorse an equitable system such as I have suggested. If the Treasurer would agree to that amendment it would remove much of the ground for our complaint that the purchasers of the NOES. cheaper tickets are being taxed disproportionately.

LAND TAX BILL. In Committee of Ways and Means:",41
137,Mr WATT,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"Balaclava-Actin g Prime Minister and Treasurer) [4.37] - I move That in addition to the land tax payable under the provisions of the Land Tax' Act 1910-1914, there be imposed an additional land tax equal .to 20 per centum of the amount of land tax payable under those provisions. In my remarks, in introducing the crease of the income tax, I showed that the war expenditure payable out of readdition venue had increased rapidly. also the reason for proposing this addiduring tional land tax. Land was originally taxed by th© Commonwealth in Novemorable ber, 1910. In December, 1914, owing the need for additional revenue arising out of the war, the rates were increased. It was not a pro ratd increase, and the exact effect of the alterations on indiviprepared dual taxpayers cannot be stated, but is estimated by the Taxation Office that the increase varied from 30 to 50 per cent. The proposal now is to further increase the land tax by 20 the existing rates. It will be interesting, perhaps, to note the burdens which will be borne by certain classes of landholders if this additional impost is assented to by Parliament - I have asked the Taxation Commissioner to furnish me with four typical examples, without giving the names of the taxpayers, from a Gommonwealth land-holder of moderate size to a very Victoria wealthy land-holder, in order to show Queensland what each will have to pay to the State Western Australia.. and Federal authorities in land and inTasmania come taxation.

Mr Watt. in Mr Watt - Yes ; there.may be taxation resting upon those individuals into the amounts I have mentioned, That is if their operations show an excess of profits the war period as compared with the pre-war period. I believe that honmembers may best inform their to minds as to the proposed taxation by studying classified information, thus saving themselves a good deal of trouble and search, and for their information I have certain other classified cases to it show what State and Commonwealth land taxation amount to in different portions of the Commonwealth on four different per cent, on classes of holdingsUnimproved Land Value of£1,000. £10,000. £50,000. £100,000. £ £ £ £ Nil 31 765 2,775 New South Wales . .

The facts which I have given do not need very much comment. Honourable members who are familiar with the history of the Commonwealth land tax and the considerations which induced this Parliament to impose, it over the whole of Australia need not have their minds refreshed as to the objectives of the tax. I am not dealing with the subject as a land taxer, although I am, and always have been, a land taxer of a progressive kind, but as the financial Minister responsible for recommending to the Commonwealth measures that will protect the credit of the country, and give us sufficient revenue to discharge our liabilities for this year. In view of the circumstances of the past four years, I feel sure that this Parliament can confidently and fair l y ask the land-holder, who is the subject of our taxation, to bear an additional burden, and thus, out of his stored results represented by' his landed assets, assist the Treasury i u the time of its greatest stress.

It would appear to me that honourable members opposite have had the great organs of this portion of Australia whipping them into line again, so that,perchance, Corangamite may not follow Swan.  member believe in minority representation?",44
150,Mr CONSIDINE,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,No ; and I do not believe in the electoral system in force. Some honourable members who have been so persistent in referring to minority representation first graced the House by means of minority votes. Evidently it is not the desire of the party opposite to give honourable members an opportunity to discuss the advantages or disadvantages of the new system proposed by the present Administration . There is a considerable difference of opinion about electoral systems. In New South Wales the National party are about equally divided upon the subject.,44
151,Mr SPEAKER,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"Order ! The honourable member cannot go into that matter on this motion, which is merely for the fixing ""of a date and hour.",44
152,Mr CONSIDINE,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"I am reasons why the time for the consideration of the Bill should be prolonged instead of limited. There is so much diversity,of opinion in regard to electoral systems that there will not be sufficient time by Friday afternoon next for the House to f u l ly and adequately discuss the proposed innovation.",44
153,Mr SINCLAIR,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"We have already had - I the Bill before us for five days, and"" so far there has not been very much light thrown upon the subject.",44
154,Mr CONSIDINE,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"That is because the honourable member has refrained from speaking. Had he done so, no doubt we would have been in a far better position to understand the working of the proposed reform. It is lack of material from honourable members opposite which has led us to allow our imaginations to run riot as to the benefits that this alteration may confer. But it matters very little what honourable members on this side say, either about the limitation of the debate, or about the proposed new method of electing members. The time is to be fixed, and we are to be prevented from discussing the Bill adequately. The measure is to be railroaded through in order to get it out of the way in time for any by-election that may occur in the near future. The only hope that honourable members on this side have is that gentlemen in another place may exercise their brains in a better fashion, and give opportunity for the measure to be more thoroughly digested before it is rushed through its final stages. Then we may not have the spectacle of this Parliament sitting for months at a time dealing with comparatively trivial matters, while such an important matter as the mode of electing Parliament is to be guillotined through the House in order that discussion may be stifled at the most important stage, namely, while the Bill is in Committee. Most honourable members have said that the measure is essentially one for Committee discussion, and for that reason they have refrained from discussing the electoral law as a whole. They were looking forward to having ample opportunity for discussing details when the measure reached the Committee stage, but now the Government have come down with their guillotine proposal in order to cut short the giving discussion in the Committee stage*. I register my protest against the action of the Government in .pretending to give an opportunity to discuss the Bill , and yet actually railroading it through without proper discussion being possible.",44
155,Mr MATHEWS,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"Melbourne Ports) E 5.5] - I am surprised that the Ministry Las brought its garrotting machinery into operation at this stage of the consideration of the Electoral Bill . The application of that machinery might well have been deferred until a question of immediate importance had arisen. It may be, of course, that Ministers expect a number of by-elections.",45
156,Mr FINLAYSON,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,Is there to be Bendigo 1,45
157,Mr MATHEWS,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"There are several that might, and more that ought to, take place. There might be a fair opportunity for the measure? for the discussion of the measure between now and Friday next, were the members of the Government to refrain from introGovernment ducing irrelevant matters with a view taking up time, but when the limits a discussion of this kind are fixed, i easy for a strong Government party to deprive an Opposition of its opportunity to place its side of the case, and at sent we are few and the y are many. I would not be the first time that such a thing had been done in this House. been There are many clauses the considerain tion of which should occupy a considerable time. I would not be permitted to ing "" . the Bill? refer bo them in detail, even if my speech were not limited to ten minutes; but I may refer to one-that providing for prein ferential voting. There are only political parties in Australia. An y man coming into this House, whether he be a supporter of the cold-water section of the community, of the strong-liquor section, a Free Trader, or anything must sit either behind the Government sider or on these benches. His Majesty's Opposition is regarded by many as a f u l parliamentary institution ; and we, electing parliamentary candidates. being so few, should be given an opporthough, tunity to consider fairly, clause by clause, a Bill dealing with the methods of parliament mentary election. Although the measure, before its introduction, was carefully sidered by Ministers, aided by the elecgain toral officials, notice has already been given of a large number of amendments.",45
158,Mr GLYNN,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,Many of them are merely drafting amendments.,45
159,Mr MATHEWS,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"That is so; but it is possible that careful consideration of mentary term. the measure in Committee will reveal the need for making as many more. Government supporters take up the time, what opportunity will Oppositionists have for suggesting amendments!",45
160,Mr MAXWELL,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,The honourable member's speech is reducing the time available for the consideration of the measure.,45
161,Mr MATHEWS,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"If my opinion "" could prevail, we on this side would have nothing more to do with the Bill. I am prepared, in sheer disgust with the meone at thods proposed by the Government, to let the measure pass without taking a vote on anv of its provisions.",45
162,Mr MAHONY,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,What is the urgency,45
163,Mr MATHEWS,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"A by-election is approaching, and there may be others. supporters, if they were to allowed to express their views freely, of could, no doubt, suggest improvements, t is though it is not probable that they would, as they are servile, in the sense that they support whatever proposition prethe Ministry may have to make. Some t of them have asserted their independence in their speeches, hut when a division has taken have subsided into their shells, obedience to the party call.",45

165,Mr MATHEWS,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"If this motion be carried, I shall take no further interest the measure, because we are not being two given a square deal. The Minister says new that the amendments of which notice has been given affect merely matters of detail, but he knows that sometimes one amendment necessitates, perhaps, a dozen else, others. We should have time to conthe measure effectively. It is a Bill of the utmost importance to all parties, usebecause it provides for the method of Alby the garrotting system, the Government can force through Parliaanything that it thinks may suit it , I would remind Ministers that accidents conhave happened, and this party may rethe position which it lost through the machinations of certain individuals. The Acting Prime Minister, in fixing a time for the consideration of the measure, has a3opted the method of a thug. Mr Watt,-That is an unparlia",45
166,Mr SPEAKER,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"I ask the honourable If member to withdraw the word "" t h u g . """,45
167,Mr MATHEWS,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"I withdraw it , and apologize for having used it, though I cannot see why it should be unparliamentary, if the word '' guillotine '' is not. I make no charge against the Acting Prime Minister personally, and would c apologize twice over if I thought that my remark was considered to have a personal application. If we had a fair opportunity for the consideration of the Bill between now and Priday next without the intervention of Government supporters, the arrangement proposed would suit us; but if that is not promised, we shall have to leave things as they are, although there is much in the measure that we should like to alter.

This amendment having been carried, I shall move to omit the words "" a day to be fixed by proclamation,"" with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words "" such . . 32 dates as are respectively fixed by pro. . 12 clamation,"" so that the clause, as amended, will read20 The several parts and sections of this Act AYES. shall commence on such dates as are respectively fixed by proclamation.",46
169,Mr HIGGS,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,Why not bring in a small Bill dealing specially with the Corangamite election?,46
170,Mr GLYNN,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"As a matter of fact, I think this is the correct course to follow. When a Bill as a whole is in Committee, I do not believe in withdrawing it and bringing in another Bill for a specific purpose. The amendments I propose will make the policy of the Bill immediately Tellers : effective in respect to such parts of it as should be brought into operation at once. NOES. There are parts-such , for instance, as those relating to the postal vote-whic h oould not immediately be made operative. Applications for postal ballot-papers would have to take place after the nominations were out, and papers would have to 'te distributed all over the CommonPAIBS . wealth to facilitate voting. The only proper, honest, and straightforward course is to go on with this Bill as it is, and to do what I propose, which has often been done in connection with certain Acts.",46
171,Mr TUDOR,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,In - connection with what other measure have we done what the honourable gentleman now proposes? I do not know of one case of the kind.,46
172,Mr GLYNN,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"I shall be able to tell the honourable member of several as soon as I have an opportunity to look them up. Mr TunoR - It is singular that the honourable gentleman, who is one of the most highly trained legal members of the House, cannot point at once to one case of the kind.",47
173,Mr GLYNN,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"I cannot deal with everything on the spur of the moment; but in some Acts there are provisions, applicable to exceptional circumstances, which are to be brought into force before others. In this case, I wish to have that part of the Bill which ought to be brought into force at once- I refer to the preferential voting provisions-mad e immediately operative. That can be done without inconvenience; but it would be unf a i r to the Department, and, incidentally, to the electors, to attempt, on paper, to bring into force at once parts which, in actual practice, could not be immediately brought into operation.",47
174,Mr TUDOR,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"Y a r r a ) [5.26] - On one other occasion only have we had amendments to a Bill brought down in typewritten form, and not circulated among honourable members. That was in connection with the War-time Profits Bill , certain provisions of which were objected to at a meeting of the Ministerial party upstairs, and Ministers were instructed to see that they were amended by Parliament. I am confident that the Minister for Home and Territories (Mr Glynn) is. utterly ashamed of the position he occupies at the present moment. From the in ception of this Parliament, he has been noted as a firm believer in straight dealing, and as a Minister he has always been regarded as being utterly opposed to subterfuge. To-day, however, he comes forward with this amendment, which is designed to secure a party advantage. states that a similar provision has been made , in other measures, but, although honourable members on all sides regard him as having a most complete knowledge of the Commonwealth Statutes, he was unable, when questioned on the subject, to mention a case in point.",47
175,Mr GLYNN,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"I cannot be expected to do everything at once, but already, since resuming my seat, I have found an in stance of the kind.",47
176,Mr TUDOR,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,What is it?,47
177,Mr GLYNN,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,I refer to Part 4 of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act .,47
178,Mr TUDOR,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"In that case an alteration was made to extend the time within which persons might register for a pension, because it was found that many had not registered within the date fixed. The Chairman seemed to think that the several amendments indicated by the M in ister would be put at one and the same time. I am not surprised that he should have entertained that view, having regard to the guillotine proposals that have been passed, and to the readiness of Ministerial supporters to vote for anything that will prevent discussion, and secure for theira party advantage. They are willing to sacrifice the principle of fair play and to prevent the fair consideration of this measure. I was temporarily absent from the Chamber when the division was taken on the motion to apply the guillotine to this Bill , otherwise, if allowed to do so, I should have debated the question. The position is that a Bill containing over 200 clauses is to be passed through this House in two and a half sitting days.",47
179,Mr ATKINSON,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,It contains few new provisions.,47
180,Mr TUDOR,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"It provides for an amendment of two very important principles of our electoral law. Deputations have asked the Minister to make other alterations, and in this and the next clause he proposes to make three or four amendments which will have the effect of bringing the Bill into operation b it by bit. It is to be dealt with like mincemeat. We are to deal with the Bill as if it were a sausage, and it is to be brought into force b it by b it for the advantage of the Ministry. When it was being introduced I interjected that it should be enHe titled "" AB ill to dish the Labour party."" The action now taken by the Minister shows that my.statement was absolutely correct.",47
181,Mr GLYNN,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"How can the honourable member say that in view of the fact that „ the principle of preferential voting, which is involved in this amendment, was first submitted to the Parliament in 1906 ?",47
182,Mr TUDOR,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"That is not the point. Preferential voting was not brought into operation at that time: there was simply a proposal that it should be brought into force. The honourable gentleman is merely playing with words. No Bill brought before this Parliament has ever borne on its face so flagrantly as this does the words "" AB ill for party advantage.""",47
183,Mr RODGERS,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,""" AB ill to meet the wishes of new parties.""",48
184,Mr TUDOR,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"AB ill to suit the Ministerial party. It should be entitled "" AB ill to fake elections in the interests of the party that is in the majority, and which obtained its majority by fraudulent promises""-promise s which it has ""never carried out.",48
185,The CHAIRMAN,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED, The honourable member is entirely out of order in making such a statement.,48
186,Mr RODGERS,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"Why not call it "" Bill to allow returned soldiers to pete with Labour candidates "" ?",48
187,The CHAIRMAN,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,Order !,48
188,Mr TUDOR,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"The object of the Minister amendment moved by the Minister is t secure a party advantage. Some of the supporters of the Government are so bitthe terly opposed to the Opposition that they would like to politically "" out "" every of us.",48
189,Mr JOWETT,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,Do not say that.,48
190,Mr TUDOR,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"In making that statewould ment, I had not in mind the honourable member who is the champion interjector this Parliament. Some supporters of the of ' the Bill Ministry would do anything to defeat or any of us. In order to secure a party advantage the the Government wish to apply the prelowers ferential voting provisions of this B i l the election for Corangamite. which is fixed for the 14th proximo. The Departoperation ment is not ready to bring into operaThe tion at once the Bill as a whole, and, therefore, the Government say, "" Let us bring into operation a b it at a time, and so gain a party advantage."" The postal voting provisions, according to the M i ister, cannot be brought into operatoral tion at once, although some supmatter. porters of the Government have said that the abolition of postal voting has deprived from 77,000 to 80,000 ment people of the right to vote. Minister will not provide for the postal voting provisions of the Bill coming into operation at once because he knows that a number of shearers have been l i v ing in the Corangamite electorate, and that they would vote by post in the in terests of the Labour party's candidate. The Government should either bring in the Bill as a whole or let it go altogether. Every Government that has tried to fake or gerrymander an election has met the same fate. When, in 1910, the Labour party, then in Opposition, were denied the right to reasonably discuss the measures brought down, the Government responsible for "" gagging"" them were dealt with by the people. I am confident that the people will deal with this Government as soon as they realise the true position. It will be difficult, however, for them to learn of their shortcomings since 99 per cent, of the newspapers of the Commonwealth support the Ministry. Be A that as it may, the Government will find comthat, while they may fool some of the people some of the time, they cannot fool all the people all the time. As the himself admits, this Bill and the o amendment are intended to apply to the Corangamite election. In order to meet position, the Government propose to chop the Act off in sections, like a one sausage, and in so doing apply preferential voting to that contest. Believing, however, that postal voting benefit the Labour party, the Government do not intend to apply in that system, but only the portion that it is thought all will benefit the Government and their supporters. We know, of course, that Government have servile folwho will support any proposals l to submitted by those in power, and with a safe majority, they propose to bring into at once a portion of this Bill . Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act has 'been cited as a similar instance.",48
191,Mr GLYNN,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,There are other measures.,48
192,Mr TUDOR,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"The r e may be, but n - never a measure like this one. An ElecB ill should not be a party There has never been a more flagrant misuse of governmental control of the business of Parliathan that^ witnessed today. The Owing to illness and other causes a great number of the members of the Opposition are absent, but those who are here will all vote against the amendment. No one can accuse me of ever doing anything of this kind in order to gain a party advantage; and I hope that all honourable members wiU realise their responsibility, and vote against the amendment.",48
193,Mr RODGERS,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"Wannon) [5.38] Erom a purely party point of view, the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) would be quite legitimate, but, speaking as he has sought to speak recently, showing himself to be most solicitous about the welfare of returning and absent soldiers, he now fails absolutely to have any regard for the men who aspire to have political representations such as is enjoyed on the other side Oif the House. Personally, I should have preferred to see preferential voting the law of the land long since. We could not then have been accused of indecent haste with this measure in order to gain a party advantage. I can acquit myself of any such intention in supporting the Government on the present occasion. During the war period, and quite recently, there have been evidences of a desire on the part of the people to see the various parties and sections of the community represented in the National and State Parliaments. The farming community are anxious to send forward their representatives, and so are the great body of soldiers and their, immediate friends; and this is an addition to the. two long-established political parties in this country. This Bill, will afford the Labour party the fullest measure of support to which it is entitled. Every vote will be effective, but the country will be safeguarded from having foisted on it the representation of an enslaved minority, which is amenable to d r ill and order.",49
194,The CHAIRMAN,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,The honourable member is getting away from the question.,49
195,Mr RODGERS,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,I am only following the latitude that you allowed the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor).,49
196,The CHAIRMAN,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,I called Leader of the Opposition to order twioe. The honourable member is now discussing a portion of the B i ll that we have not yet reached. The question before the Chair is whether certain portions of the Bill shall operate in a certain sequence; - arid I ask the honourable member to reserve his present remarks until we reach that part of the Bill to which they are applicable.,49
197,Mr RODGERS,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"I had pretty well finished what I intended to say in answer to the Leader of the Opposition; and I think I have indicated to the Committee, and particularly to honourable members on this side, that in giving their support to this amendment they aTe only guaranteeing that in the contest immediately in front of us the Labour party, the returned soldiers, the farmers' organizations, and the National party will all have an equal chance. No votes will be Wasted, and the choice of the people will be shown in the member selected for Corangamite. . Mr FINLAYSON (Brisbane) [5.41] - * I. do not know whether to congratulate or sympathize with the Minister. ",49
198,Mr FINLAYSON,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"I congratulate the Minister on his candour on introducing thiq amendment to clause 2. We have had it now directly from the honourable gentleman and the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) that the object of the amendment is to affect the coming by-election for Corangamite. The honourable member for Wannon, in very simple fashion, allowed the fact to leak out that the Minister is acting under in structions. It is most refreshing that honourable members opposite should admit that the Minister has to obey the instructions of theirCaucus.",49
199,Mr RODGERS,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,I deny that emphatically; no Caucus has been held yet.,49
200,Mr FINLAYSON,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,During the second-reading debate honourable members opposite were particularly emphatic in declaring that the consideration of an Electoral Bill should be free from all party influences and methods; and yet in the very clause before us the party element is introduced.,49
201,Mr MAXWELL,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,The amendment is to insure that justice shall be done to all the parties.,49
202,Mr FINLAYSON,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"It is to insure that a certain result, if possible, shall be secured at the Corangamite election. The argument of the honourable member for Pawkner (' Mr Maxwell), and the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Rodgers) fails in view of their previous attitude. They have contended that in the absence of postal voting a true reflex of public opinion cannot tie obtained; and yet, under the amendment of the Minister, postal voting will not be available; in deed, the Minister admits that arrangements cannot be made for this system of voting at the forthcoming election.",49
203,Mr RODGERS,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,It is a matter of giving the maximum amount of justice in the time.,50
204,Mr FINLAYSON,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"That is why I congratulate the Minister on his admission that the amendment is in order to have some effect on the by-election. The honourable member for Capricornia (Mr . Higgs) interjected that this Bill should have been described as the "" Corangamite By-election Bill , "" and certainly such a measure would have been easily put through, and we could have discussed this Bill, in its broadest aspect, free, perhaps, from, any party feeling. No argument or statement by the Minister can get over the fact that this Bill is to be used in sections in order to secure a party advantage. Is the reason for the Bill the result of the Swan by-election? Have Ministers got scared ? Do they read the signs of the times?",50
205,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,If you read the signs of the times you ought to shiver.,50
206,Mr FINLAYSON,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,Why ?,50
207,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,There were two to one against your party at the Swan election.,50
208,Mr FINLAYSON,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,The man in dorsed by the National party was third on the list.,50
209,The CHAIRMAN,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"This , discussion is getting quite irregular.",50
210,Mr FINLAYSON,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"I sympathize with the Minister, because I am quite sure he is not comfortable in submitting this amendment. It is yery evident that the proposal has been hatched very recently; so recently, indeed, that it could not be included in the page full of amendments already circulated, but had to be brought in as an afterthought.",50
211,Mr RILEV,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,There was a party meeting this morning.,50
212,Mr FINLAYSON,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"W as there? Is the next Caucus called for tomorrow? The Government are evidently afraid that their prestige is going to be seriously impaired if there is another accident similar to that which occurred in tht Swan electorate; and in order to preserve themselves, they are securing, as far as they can, any advantage their party may gain from a partial application of this Electoral Bill .",50
213,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,A candidate cannot be affected unless he has a majority.,50
214,Mr FINLAYSON,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"Q u it e so, and I am prepared to support preferential voting, bu t not to support the Government in applying only one part of the electoral machinery to a particular election. If this may be done for the forthcoming by-election it may be done for any election. Under this provision the Government may at any time put into operation a part of the electoral machinery, and leave any other part inoperative. There are a number of honourable members opposite who can always be relied on to regard questions with a certain amount of reasonableness, and I ask them whether they think that the electoral machinery of this community should be open to juggling at the hands of a Minister. Is it fair at any time that the Government should be able to put part of the Electoral Act into operation just as they may choose? That is . what this amendment gives the Government power to do. An y part of the Bill may be brought into operation. Who knows h u t that there may be another by-election in three months? It would he quite open to the Government to apply postal voting to that election and leave out preferential voting. There never was a proposal that left the electoral machinery so open to jugglery as the one before us. I sympathize with the Minister, because I feel quite sure that he does not believe in the proposal he has made. He has established a reputation for himself for fairness and straight-dealing; but if he persists with the present proposal his reputation will be gone, and we shall regard him as merely the tool of the Government, will ing to do anything, or he anything, in electoral matters, so long as his party wins. The proposal brings forcibly to one's mind the experience we have already had of interference with elections. Goodness knows, at the last referenda and general election we had in torferences that spoiled the name of Australia from this point of view. Australian elections had hitherto been regarded as representing, perhaps, the ideal system of conducting such business. We were not perfect, but, at any rate, we were far ahead of any country in electoral affairs. The Prime Minister at that time introduced into elections a new feature that destroyed our previous ronfldence and dependence upon fair dealing in electoral niatters. To-day the Government are copying his bad example, but are acting even worse, because, with all his faults, the Prime Minister had the courage to introduce a Bill to give the Government authority to do the things he proposed. To-day the Minister has deliberately brought forward an amendment to allow the Government to manage the elections according to their own sweet will. Surely after our experience in the past, we want no more of that sort of thing. The time has come for straight and clean sailing. The amendment introduced by the Minister is one that ought not to commend itself to right-thinking men in this chamber. I sball discuss this Bill throughout entirely free from party prejudices, and without amy wish to gain a party advantage. I have no hope that the Government will give any advantage to the Labour party in electoral matters, but the time will surely come when the Labour party will be in office, and then will belong to them whatever advantages the Bill confers upon the Government.",50
215,Sir ROBERT BEST,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,What portion of this Bill gives an advantage to one party over another 1,51
216,Mr FINLAYSON,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"I do not know of any better illustration than the amendment now before the Chair, which gives the Government of the day power to do what they choose with the electoral machinery.",51
217,Mr GLYNN,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,I assure the honourable member that only the provisions Telating to preferential voting will be operated irnmediately. I cannot specify the clauses offhand.,51
218,Mr FINLAYSON,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"My complaint is that this amendment will, give the Governmentgof the day power to bring into operation any portion of the electoral law which suits them. [272]",51
219,Mr GLYNN,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,The balance of the Bill will be brought into force in one block.,51
220,Mr FINLAYSON,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"The Minister's reply further emphasizes that the Bill and the particular amendment before the Chair are being hurried on in order to affect a by-election which is due shortly. No matter how fair may be the operations of these provisions, the fact stares us in the face that the Bill is being rushed through under a new standing order, and an amendment has been moved by the Minister in order that an advantage may be gained at the coming election.",51
221,Mr RODGERS,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,Gaine d by whom?,51
222,Mr FINLAYSON,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,Does the honourable member imagine that the Government have proposed this amendment in order that the Labour candidate shall have an advantage?,51
223,Mr RODGERS,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"Will this proposal give an advantage to any Ministerial candidate? Mr FINLAYSON,-If the Government did not hope to gain an advantage they would not be rushing the Bill through the House. I ask the Minister to relieve himself of the charge that will be laid forever at his door that he is proposing to use for a particular party purpose an Electoral Bill, although the electoral law is the real basis of the whole of our governmental institutions and the guarantee of their purity. No matter what party is in power, the electoral machinery should not be available for such a purpose; it should be above suspicion and the danger of manipulation. The Government would be 'acting more honestly if they put through the whole Bill as representing their ideal of electoral reform, or agreed to the elimination of the objectionable features. The only reason why the Bill is not to be operated as a whole at the Corangamite by-election is that the' Government have not time to make provision for postal voting. The Minister is placed in an unfortunate position by his party, and if honourable members opposite wish to relieve themselves of the charge of partiality and of seeking a party advantage they should not press this amendment, but allow the Bill to go through in its entirety, and stand or fall by it. _ Sir ROBERT BEST (Kooyong) [5.58]. - The honourable member for Brisbane does not do himself justice in the attitude he has adopted. admits that he is in favour of preferential voting, which is the real essence of the Bill . The purpose of the introduction of that system is that the people shall be more effectively represented than they have been in the past. Instances innumerable have occurred in which the people have been absolutely misrepresented by the result of an election.  hurry?",51
224,Sir ROBERT BEST,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"So that the people may at the forthcoming by-elecus tion be properly represented, rather than that we should have a miscarriage of presentation such as took place in conform nexion with the Swan by-election. The After contest for Swan is only one of many in which the people have failed to secure proper representation. Only one-third of those who voted are represented by the result of the election j the other two-thirds are practically disfranchised. The honof orable member for Brisbane (Mr F i layson) has said that preferential voting is fair, because he realizes that by that means people will secure proper repretion sentation ; therefore, the sooner we have an effective piece of legislation in operation the better. The general provisions of the Electoral Act are very good, bu two amendments certainly should be made, namely, the introduction of prefercannot ential voting and the re-establishment the postal vote. The honourable member difficulties for Brisbane objects to postal voting, he cannot justly complain that that systo tem is not to be immediately introduced, even in connection with the Corangamite by-election. The Minister has frankly told the Committee that he intends to Act. give the people at that election wider scope in the choice of their representative.",52
225,Dr MALONEY,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,But why not make the whole of the Bill operative?,52
226,Sir ROBERT BEST,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"The Miuister members has already said that it is not within power to do that, bu t that he will give the electors the advantage of that portion of the Bill which is most advantageous them. In other words, if the whole of Ihe Bill cannot be operated for that election, that the electors shalL, at any rate, have its essence and best feature, preferential .voting, so He that there may not be „ another miscarriage of representation such as took place in connection with the most recent by-election. I should have been glad if the Minister could have mentioned the sections which he proposes to bring into operation at once, bu t as he is unable to do that we have the next best thing in his assurance that the immediate proclamation shall apply only to preferential voting. That assurance does away with the contention that it will be possible for unseemly the Minister to operate one portion of the Bill for one purpose and another portion for some other purpose. He has assured that, with the exception of the preferential voting provisions, the Bill shall recome into operation in the consolidated in which it is passed by Parliament. all, the Bill is a consolidating measure, and in the forthcoming by-election we shall be relying upon the present electoral law, plus the advantageous provisions for preferential voting. I strongly urge that if we cannot operate the whole the Bill for that occasion, the people n - have a right to demand that they shall be given the opportunity of securing effective representation by the immediate operaof the preferential voting provisions.",52
227,Mr GLYNN,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"Angas-Minister for Home and Territories) [6.3] - Honor t able members have asked' for precedents for the action which I have proposed. I look up precedents at a moment's of notice, but I recollect that, owing to the _ of administration, portion of and the Invalid and Old-age Pensions A ct was be operative on a date later than the remainder of the Statute. Similar provision was made in connection with the Patents Act 1903-9 and the Navigation Even before the Patents Act came into general force applications under . it could be made. Again, owing to administrative difficulties Part 2 of the Electoral (War-time) Act, relating to the voting of of .the Forces, was to be brought his into force on a different date from that on which the balance of the Act commenced. As a matter of fact, standing to order 250 gives power for a Bill to be divided into separate Bills in Committee, or for a number of Bills to be consolidated. That would have been a most cumbersome way of attaining our end, and I thought the better way would be to pick out that portion of the Bill which is relevant to the peculiar conditions of the moment, and which can be absolutely separated from the other portion without any inconvenience. I have sought for the clauses that will be affected by the amendment I have proposed, but I cannot possibly specify them in a hurry with"" out some risk. I have, however, made a note of clauses 76, 125, 134, and 137. The balance of the Bill will be brought into force in one block, and cannot afterwards be withheld. Postal voting could not possibly be applied to the forthcoming by-election, because, after nomination day, it is necessary to have postal certificates all over Australia. No one can fill up postal certificates until the candidates are nominated, and in order to print them and have them distributed all over Australia in time for this election, it would be necessary to anticipate the nominations. 250,000 persons avail themselves of the absent voting provisions, but of these there are only about 15,000 who use this method of voting outside the State in which they are enrolled. Tn any case, absent voting cannot generally apply to a by-election, because there are no polling places outside the division in which the election is held. It would be absolutely useless to apply the postal voting or absent voting provisions of this Bill to the coming by-election. The Government's proposal could not possibly affect the relative strength of the parties in this House.  provisions' were not used at the recent Swan by-election.",52
228,Mr GLYNN,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"The existing laws were in force. But there is a provision in the Bill before the House which can be made to apply at the present time without embarrassing the electoral administration, and the Ministry thought it was sound policy to ask Parliament to sanction its immediate application. In asking for the sanction of Parliament, we are following a correct course. [272]- 2",53
229,Dr MALONEY,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"Melbourne) [6.7] - It is quite true that, if this amendment is passed, the sanction of Parliament will be given, and the Ministry have the necessary majority; but the method they have adopted is not in accordance with the.past actions of the honourable member for Angas (Mr Glynn). I would far rather hear him say that the exigencies of the moment have rendered it necessary. This course may have been adopted on previous occasions, but not to my knowledge; and it seems to me that it is the shadow of the Swan election which is causing the Government to apply to the forthcoming Corangamite election the portion of the electoral law which will suit them. I do not wish to stress the point, but I am perfectly candid in saying that the example set today will not be forgotten. The party which occupies the Government benches for the time being will always be justified in making full use of the Standing Orders, applying the closure or limiting debate. I welcome it if it means that certain legislaAbout tion will be carried into effect. More particularly would I welcome it if we had adopted the principles of the initiative, referendum, and recall, because then the people themselves could say, "" We will not have such legislation; we will have the Bill, and the whole Bill . "" If the Government had been more open about this matter, they would have been more honourable. They say that they cannot apply the postal vote to the Corangamite by-election. Why not postpone the elecforthtion for a fortnight? I do not suppose that the fixing of the date for a by-election is like the laws of the Medes and Persians-unalterable . . Speaking subject to correction, I should imagine that it is not compulsory to hold an election on a certain date after a member's death. If we could delay the Corangamite election, we could apply the whole of the provisions of the Bill, and so enable the Minister to escape from an unpleasant situation. No one has a greater regard than I - have for the honourable gentleman's character, which has been built up in successive Parliaments, and, therefore, I regret that he should be forced into such a position. While preferential voting must appeal to the majority of honourable members of the House, postal voting was unanimously ^--"" cepted by the Electoral Commission, which submitted the following recommendation upon .he point:The electoral law should not he forged as a party weapon, but should aim at making it possible for every elector to record his vote. Apparently, about 77,000 electors were unable to vote at the elections in consequence of the abolition of postal-voting facilities, many of whom would be the mothers <Jf our people, fulfilling the noblest duties of life, and would have a keener personal interest in the government of the country than many who recorded votes. Wc, therefore, suggest the amendment of the Act to provide for postal voting prior to the day ofelection, with sufficient statutory safeguards. I have enough confidence in the gentle-man whose ability rules .the Electoral Department to know that he could make all arrangements to apply postal voting to one constituency only. In this case we are dealing with one constituency only, and to say that it is impossible to apply the whole of the Bill to it is puerile.",53
230,Mr GLYNN,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"- I have discussed the ter . with the electoral administration twice, and the advice I received was that it oould not be done.",54
231,Dr MALONEY,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,Did the Minister discuss it in the light of a possible postponement of the election?,54
232,Mr GLYNN,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,The Government do not .interfere with by-elections in regard to dates. That is a matter which is in the discretion of Mr Speaker.,54
233,Dr MALONEY,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"No one would be harmed if Mr Speaker would postpone the election, if it were the wish of honourable members that he should do so. It would relieve the Minister. Honourable in embers would rather have the whole of the Bill applied to the election than part of it , because if only oue portion of the law is applied to this election, supporters and friends of the Government w i ll say that only the portion which suited the Ministry was employed. I would be prepared to expect such criticism if I were supporting the Government. I have suffered more than any honourable member or, perhaps, any two honourable members may have suffered, from the villainies that were perpetrated under the old postal-voting provisions; but yet I hope that the Corangamite election will be postponed, so that the whole of the measure whioh will be passed by this Parliament may be applied to it .",54
234,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"Illawarra ) [6.16] - As I understand the proposal, it will have the same effect as if the Government had introduced a separate Bill providing for the contingent vote only. I am unable to understand the amount of heat which the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Einlayson) has been able to p ut into the discussion of a proposition of that kind. Only a party spirit of the most violent k in d could rejoice at the Democracy being forced to accept a candidate elected by a minority of electors in opposition to candidates supported by a majority of electors. The man who professes to be a believer in democratic principles, and yet is prepared to support a system applying to any election which will enable a minority of electors to force their candidate upon an unwilling majority, has a very small claim to be a Democrat. The sooner that mat- awful system comes to an end the better it will be, no matter what party it may. affect. It is undemocratic. The proposal of the Government is in the in terests, not of party, but of the electors, who have a right to be represented in Parliament by men approved of by the majority. For that reason I heartily support the proposal.",54
235,Mr RILEY,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"South Sydney) [6.18] I did not think that this great National, Liberal, or ""Win-the-war party, with such a substantial majority at their back, would yield to the dictates of the morning press. This morning we found thenewspapers in Victoria telling the Ministry what they should do in order to save the Corangamite seat, and now we see the great, strong party opposite cringing and crawling on their bellies to these journals. It is a fine spectacle, apart altogether from the principle of the thing, to see the whole process of dealing with the Electoral Bill interrupted by an amendment to establish preferential voting at a by-election, which happens to be forthcoming. If the Government should happen to lose the seat, it would not affect their stability, or alter the state of parties in the House. The real test will come at the next general elections, for which we ought to have the best machinery available. We ought not to be wasting our time over by-elections.",54
236,Sir ROBERT BEST,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,Does the able member believe in preferential voting?,55

238,Sir ROBERT BEST,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,Then vote for this proposal.,55
239,Mr RILEY,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,But I do not think that any Government ought to be so mean or so cowardly as to use its majority to have the system applied to one by-election only. Why should it not be applied to all elections ? An y one who reads the papers must see that Ministers have taken their instructions from the press.,55
240,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,They knew that the Government were going to submit this proposal.,55
241,Mr RILEY,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"I do not think so. The Minister has not had the Government proposals printed and circulated. My desire is that the ballot-papers shall be the same for Senate and House of Representative elections, the electors being required to mark all the ballot-papers with figures showing the order of their preferences for the various candidates. Government, however, is willing to pass a piecemeal measure in order that the preferential system may apply to an approaching by-election. The result of this election is not material to the Labour partu, because, should we win it , we shall not have a majority. Our desire is to have an Electoral Act under which justice will be done at the next general election. We do not wish to waste time in patching up a measure merely to serve for a by-election. The Bill contains over 200 clauses, and yet we have only from now until 3 o'clock on Friday afternoon next in which to consider them.",55

The measure is in no sense a party one, and I regret that the Minister in charge of it (Mr Glynn) has intimated that it is to apply to the forthcoming by-election. It would have been better to leave over its application for f u t u re elections. The Labour party .won the recent Swan election. But what does that matter?",55

247,Mr RILEY,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"It is my duty to seek to protect my party's interests and the interests of those who sent me here. I have always been elected with a majority of from 8,000 to 9,000 votes, and most of the members of the Labour party were returned by a big majority. I believe that we should have got through the Bill just as quickly had no limitation of discussion been agreed to. The Senate may "" stone-wall "" the measure. We must in timate to our friends what has taken place here, and senators may not agree to differentiation in the method of Senate The elections. In my opinion, there should be absolute uniformity.",55

That announcement is a political indecency, against which I protest. It amounts to a deliberate declaration that the Government iproposes to tamper with the electoral law to suit its party interests in connection with the election.",55

The Government evidently consider that certain provisions of the needs measure are calculated, if applied to a forthcoming election, to serve its interests.

That is how it comes about that, while the preferential voto nt elections is a matter of perfect indifference to the Labour party, it becomes a vital matter to the congeries of the parties opposite, for the reason that they cannot depend for a moment on the loyalty of each other when a candidate has been selected.

I propose to vote against this amendment on the grounds that have been put by other honourable members and myself. It is a party political move, which ought not to have been resorted to in the case of an Electoral Bill , under which appeals are to be made to the great tribunal of the people. It is a party political move at a time, and in circumstances whichmake it peculiarly objectionable and unworthy of the large party, whose numbers are sufficient to enable them to carry on until the next election. After all, that is all that the party opposite can desire; they cannot avert the fate which is sure to befall them at no distant date. It is perfectly clear that they desire, picking an electorate suitable, as they think, for the application of the preferential system, to arrest the Tot that is setting in-the rot which set in some time ago-in the party, OT congeries of parties, as I have called them, of which they are made up. This rot has given a very bad impression to their friends, and to their so-called leader across the seas, at the very time when those stay-at-home warriors are desirous of acclaiming themselves a successful Win-the-war Government and party.  not understand the Government introducing these 'amendments. Any one would think that the honour and safety of the Commonwealth-indeed , the safety of the Empire-depende d on their winning the Corangamite seat. On Friday last the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Chapman) threatened the Government with condign punishment, and made the Minister for Home and Territories (Mr Glynn) so angry and alarmed that he dare not go to his home at the weekend. Mr d-LYNxr - I have not been home for us three weeks.  and his colleagues, after the remarks of the honourable member I have mentioned, at once started to lay and hatch eggs, of which these amendments are the outcome. The Government is strong enough, and has subservient followers enough to do this dirty kind of business. Why do they not go one step further, and disfranchise every man and woman with Labour sympathies and tendencies, and thus make things still more easy for the Government? There is an old saying to the effect that those whom the gods wished to destroy they first made mad; and honourable members opposite aTe going mad on electoral matters. All the powers of the Government-al l their trickery and machinations-wil l not save the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr. Archibald) next, time he faces his masters.

As a Labour man by I do not object to the Government doing these things, for they are only rushing to their doom. If there is one thing more than another that an enraged Democracy will not have, particularly in Australiaand I know a little of the Democracy of this country, having grown up with it for the last thirty years-it is electoral methods of this sort. The Government and their supporters are today doing to the Labour party and Democracy what the squatocracy and the autocracy of Australia did to the manual workers and toilers in the earlier history of the Labour movement.

I know that when I came into this House I had certain fixed opinions which have been at least modified, and I give other honourable members the same right in that respect as I claim for myself. Things that the Australian Democracy will not stand are Tammany practices in politics, and tinkering with the Electoral Act. The enraged Democracy will scarify honourable members for what they are doing today. I know that in regard to the Corangamite by-election, the Government are only obeying the dictates of their masters. The Employers' Federation, the Women's National League, and the Argus have told the Government what they are to do. The result is the series of amendments' which. the Minister has brought before the House today. Honourable members opposite cavil about Labour candidates heing returned on a minority vote. In the first Federal election some honourable members on the Government side, and one member of the Labour party were returned on a minority vote; but until this Bill was brought forward, I never heard of any complaint on that account. There must be something rotten in the state of Denmark when,- after having endured the present system for eighteen years, the Government are induced to rush an amending Bill through in the few days before a by-election.

318,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED, common thing for such words to appear in the title to a Bill?,65
319,Mr FINLAYSON,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"Yes ; but apparently a new use has been found for them. This Bill is supposed to provide a complete and permanent machine for the conduct of Commonwealth elections, and yet to meet political exigencies the Minister is compelled to introduce into it a number of amendments so that the Government may be secure in winning a by-election. If the party numbers were very close, I could understand the urgency of the amendment; I could understand the Government doing a l o t of things with the electoral law; but since the Government have an enormous majority, and are so sure of the success of their candidate at the forthcoming election for Corangamite, why should they resort to this subterfuge ? Why should they be ready to manipulate and juggle with the electoral machinery to suit their own necessities? If the Government would consider this matter apart from the party stand-point they would recognise that it is immoral to descend to the subterfuge now being resorted to by the Minister. with the amendments made in clause 2, under which such parts of the Bill as are found convenient may be made operative, he now proposes to make it possible to repeal only such parts of the existing electoral law as the Government may consider it convenient to repeal. When the election, for Corangamite takes place no one outside the Government officials will know what particular Electoral Act is being applied to it . Under this amendment any part of the existing legislation may be retained or repealed. Is it not reasonable that the Opposition should claim that, whatever else of a party character amendments there may be in the legislation proposed by the Government, no attempt should be made in an Electoral Bill to secure a party advantage ? Ministerial supI porters have continually assured us that they approached this question from at o con- non-party stand-point; that they had no wish to gain party advantage, and that their only desire was that by means of this Bill everything relating to the-conduct of elections should be fair and square, and that every candidate should have a square deal. A j i d yet by the Is it not a amendment now proposed the Government will hold in their hand the power so to utilize the electoral machinery that it may be made to go and stop and made to restart and restop just as the exigencies of the party political situation require. I enter a most emphatic protest against this manipulation of the electoral machinery of the Commonwealth. This is one of the most comtemptible actions ever taken by any Government in any - Parliament. We, as Britishers, have al* ways claimed that, no matter what may happen in other countries in the way of electoral corruption and the manipulation of votes, our elections are always beyond suspicion.",65

If the Government want the people to be left free to not. elect members to this Parliament by a majority vote, the simpler the voting system is made the more the people will go to the polls. Anything that makes the system complicated will tend to frighten ipeople away from the polling booths. When honourable members now on the Government side were in the minority, they constantly expressed the hope that the people would go to the polls. They said that all they wanted was a full vote to assure them of a majority. This proposal will do nothing towards getting a full vote. If the Government were doing something new, they might claim that they were trying to improve things, but all they propose in one connection is to restore a system which this House tried and threw out because of the corruption that occurred under it at general elections.",67

355,Mr RILEY,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"South Sydney) [9.25] There is great danger in giving the Government too much power to do things by proclamation. It is dangerous to give a Minister power to issue proclamations that have the force of law. At the outbreak of war, we passed a Wa r Precautions Act which we thought would be fairly administered; but under that Act powers have been exercised which were never anticipated when the Bill was before us.",67

Under the Bill before us, the Government might at any .time issue a proclamation reducing or extending the hours of polling. I am reminded by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) that prior to the taking of the last referendum a regulation was issued permitting certain questions to be asked of the electors; and such powers no Minister ought to have. If the Government have only the Corangamite election in view, why deface the Bill with such a clause as that before us. I do hot think that the House would agree to a permanent measure of the k in d ; and surely Parliament will not stoop to pass a measure which can only affect one by-election? I warn the Government that this proposal, if carried into effect, may prove a boomerang to them; and certainly the measure will not result in that purity of elections that we have been led to suppose. if these powers are given to the Minister, I hope they will not be exercised in the same way as have the powers under the War Precautions Act . My own opinion is that if the Minister had his way this clause would not find a place in the Bill , and it is only there as a result of influence brought to bear on him and the Government, in view of the approaching Corangamite election.",68

I took up the same attitude then as I do now in regard to M i nisterial interference with the heads of a Department. The honourable member knows what I am alluding to, yet he is actually proposing now to support a proposal to make the Minister dominant over his officers.",69
377,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,No ; that is not involved in this question.,69
378,Dr MALONEY,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"The departmental officer will have to obey if the clause passes. We have been grinding out laws as with a sausage machine of late. No less than 290 laws have been issued this year under the War Precautions Act . Honourable members may-- call them regulations, but if they will have the effect of imprisoning or fining any man, they are laws, call them what you will . And now we are being asked to pass electoral machinery upon which the Democracy of Australia will rest at the wil l of a M in ister; but I stand for placing power in the hands of an officer to defy a Minister if the Minister is working against the law. We are now fighting on the question of re-introducing postal voting. What does it amount to? Honourable members may not be aware how few electors would be affected in the Division of Corangamite. The latest return I have had from the Department shows that at the election on 5th May, 1917, there were 36,733 electors enrolled, and if there were only 77,000 postal voters out of 3,000,000 electors in May, 1917, that would be, roughly, about 4 per cent., so that in Corangamite the number would be about 1,500. I spoke, subject to correction, when, earlier in the afternoon, I said I understood that the date of an election following a vacancy was fixed by law. I find now that this is not so. There is no reason why this election should not be postponed seven or fourteen days; and allow the Electoral Department extra assistance in any temporary work that may be needed. If this were done, it would disarm auy criticism against the present measure. If we commit a wrong now, we shall be creating a and precedent, and we all know that precedents are beloved by the legal mind. But the Government have the numbers, so they can rush this measure through if they like.",69
379,Mr TUDOR,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,They are going to.,69
380,Dr MALONEY,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"Let us have division after division, if necessary; but let us not include this accursed principle, which will compel a civil servant to do just what the Minister may order. ""We speak of the purity of our electoral system, and we should so frame our electoral machinery that an officer of the Department may be able, when this is expedient, to stand up to a Minister and be subservient only to Parliament. If we had what I have always contended for-the referendum, initiative, and recall-w e could recall the regulations under this Bill. It would give me some pleasure to take the platform throughout the length and breadth of Victoria, as well as further afield, to urge that this course be taken. Honourable members opposite will find that even their political friends will believe that the course now being taken has been dictated by the results of the by-election for Swan. The honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) must agree with me in this matter. It is quite palpable that this action is being taken to insure that Corangamite shall be safe for the Government. But the Government have large numbers behind them, so they can afford to be generous. They should see to it that no slur is cast at them over this matter. If I were on the other side of the House, I would speak in the same strain, and, if necessary, would vote against the Government. I recollect with some amusement what the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Foster) said while we were on the inquiry to which I have referred, and in which the honourable member for Denison (Mr Laird Smith) was associated with us. We had to work very hard to get justice at that time. I remember how strong the feeling was on both sides. If the honourable members to whom I have referred vote for this provision, they will be supporting a principle which will place in the hands of the Minister more power than any other Minister has yet enjoyed in regard to electoral matters. The honourable member for Wakefield will not deny that.",69

This might be my experience.",70
383,Mr JOWETT,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,You are all right.,70
384,Dr MALONEY,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"If I am, it will only, be because of the esteem in which I am held by the men and women of the division. I am very sensitive about placing power in the hands of the Minister :n the manner proposed by this Bill. I know that the present Minister for Home and Territories (Mr Glynn)' has a splendid record, and that he would prefer the Bill to be so worded that if a Minister controlling a Department became so lost to a sense of duty as to order the public servant controlling the Electoral Department to do something which he thought he should not do, that servant should be able to say, "" There is the Act, sir, and I read it in another way."" Let us give the public servant that right. I ask honourable members on the Ministerial side to support me in requesting the Ministry to do the right thing. I do not care how quickly the Government pass this Bill, because if the opportunity ever comes to me to move in a particular matter I shall move quickly, it seems to me absurd bhat in times like the present we should have such long vacations and brief sittings. Our position is akin to that of Nero fiddling while Rome was burning. Let us get through the business and dispose of every motion standing in the names of private members. I suggest that the Ministry should withdraw the amendment. On the average, only 1,500 persons in a constituency with 36,000 electors vote by post, and to say that it is not possible to do what I have suggested is to reflect upon the capacity of the splendid band of officers who are controlled by the head of the Electoral Department.",70
385,Mr GLYNN,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"The Chief Electoral Officer has told me that it cannot be done. I have asked him to reconsider the matter. If it can be done, it will be done.",70
386,Dr MALONEY,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"I am glad to have that assurance from the Minister, Having known him so long, it is only what I would have expected from him. - Mr SINCLAIR (Moreton) [9.48] Some of the remarks of the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney) would be all right if applied to another portion of the Bill . If Opposition members will continue their criticism of the Bill along the lines they have been following I shall have a very poor estimate of the sincerity of their desire to get the best Bill possible in the circumstances. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Tudor) started by saying that this amendment would give general powers to the Minister to repeal old Statutes or reinstate them. It does not; it gives specific power to the Minister to repeal by proclamation Acts already on the statute book.",70
387,Mr TUDOR,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,When he likes.,71
388,Mr SINCLAIR,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"Not exactly; no Minister would dare to allow an Act to go unrepealed. Clause 3 states that certain Acts are to be repealed from such dates as are respectively fixed by proclamation, ' so that the Minister is given power only to repeal those Acts by proclamation, and when they have heen repealed this provision becomes a dead letter. If honourable members opposite will assist me to take, as far as practicable, all control ""out of the hands of the Minister in regard to the administration of the Act and the conduct of elections, I shall be pleased to have their support; but the clause under consideration is not the one upon which such an amendment sbould be considered.",71
389,Mr BLAKELEY,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"Darling ) [9.51] The proclamation under the Old-age Pensions Act has been put for th as a justification for the procedure proposed to be adopted in connection with this Bill . Honourable members know perfectly well that the proclamation under the Old-age Pensions Act was provided for for the specific reason that it was impossible to bring the whole of the provisions into force at the time the A ct was passed, because there was not enough money in hand to pay the pensions. How can honourable members compare such a proclamation with one which is to be used merely for party purposes, to stave off the evil day for the Government, and to preven'; the people from getting accustomed to seeing the National candidate at the bot> torn of the poll?",71
390,Mr MAXWELL,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,The honourable member is begging the question by saying that the proclamation is for party purposes.,71
391,Mr BLAKELEY,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"I sincerely believe that the guillotine was employed this afternoon in order that those portions of the Bill which are likely to be most satisfactory to the Ministry may be forced through this Chamber by Friday afternoon, sent to the Senate, and passed through that Chamber in the same hurried manner, so that they may be operated in the Corangamite by-election. I further believe that this action has been taken because of the awful beating which the Nationalist candidate received in the Swan by-election. That is the opinion of honourable members on this side and of the outside public, and, no matter how Government supporters may try to hide their heads in the sand, the people will take that view with increasing conviction when they learn of what is being done in regard to the Corangamite selection. Fancy the whole parliamentary in stitution being employed to enable the Government to win one seat. It is not the probable loss of the Corangamite seat that worries the Government so much as the effect which another defeat would have on the minds of the people. In order to stave off the evil day, and to bolster up Nationalism, all sorts of devious and sinister methods are being used. The Government today instructed the Minister in charge of the Senate that that House should be adjourned, but with in structions that its members should assemble on Tuesday next. U p to the present, during this part of the session, the Government have not thought fit to bring the Senate back to duty on the Tuesday, although on several occasions honourable senators have been sent home for a week. However, on the present occasion, knowing that the guillotine would give the Senate the Electoral Bill earlv next week, honourable senators are being brought back on the Tuesday to save the face of the Government, to stave off the evil day if possible, and to get their machinery to work that something may be done for the National party, whose foundations are crumbling away. No doubt, everything possible will be done by honourable members opposite. The Minister for Home and Territories (Mr . Glynn), who is in charge of this Bill , is not a very happy man to-night. I say this on the strength of my personal acquaintance with him during the short time. I have been a member of this House, and on the reputation given him by my colleagues.",71
392,Mr ARCHIBALD,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,He is more happy than is the honourable member.,72
393,Mr BLAKELEY,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"I do not think so, but I have little doubt that he is happier than is the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Archibald), who will be singing his political swan song very shortly. The fact remains that the Minister for Home and Territories is called upon to do a work which I have no doubt is very distasteful to him. He is being used as a party tool. He has to do the d i r t y work of the National party in order to bring about a result at the Corangamite election which could not, under the existing law, be achieved. I have no fear at aU of the operation of the preferential system of voting. It will put more Labour members into this House than will the sudden-death system. The Labour party have nothing to fear from the preferential voting system. Many honourable members opposite owe their return to the suddendeath system, and with the adoption of a better electoral system I have no doubt at all that the Labour party will benefit considerably. If the Government had the courage to stand up against the signers of the round robin in the Senate, and in troduce proportional representation for the Senate as the logical corollary of the preferential system of voting for the House of Representatives, the Labour party would do very much better than they did at the elections in 1917. If the proportional voting system had been in operation at those elections they would have secured eight Senate seats, whereas under the existing system they did not secure any. When the numbers go up for Corangamite I am not at all sure that a Labour man will not be returned, provided that voters are not disfranchised. I am not too sure that honourable members opposite will not disfranchise a number of voters. I say quite candidly that a Government who could bring down a measure such as this, and hurry it through without permitting it to be properly discussed, are' quite capable of disfranchising voters. It would not be difficult to bring proof that this Government, did disfranchise thousands of native-born citizens of Australia for a political purpose. They did that at the last general elections. It requires courage even to be a rogue, and if the political party opposite had had the courage to carry out the regulation providing for the asking of infamous auestions of electors as they went to the poll, a large number of young men in this community would have been disfranchised. I am not at all sure that some "" gerrymandering "" will not go on at the Corangamite election. A Government or a party capable of disfranchising electors are capable of anything. I know that in the State of Victoria the electorates have been ""gerrymandered"" by the same class of people as those who constitute the Federal Government. They stand on the same platform, are behind the same party and represent the same interests. Whilst I may be young politically, I know a good deal about our electoral systems and the way (ijn which they have been used throughout Australia. I know that the National Government are proficient in the art of gerrymandering, and are capable of using every evil practice during the Corangamite election in order to save their faces. This would not be because of their desire to retain Corangamite as a Government seat since they could afford to lose half-a-dozen votes or more in this House, and still have quite sufficient numbers to carry any proposals they considered important. But it is a question of the moral effect which the loss of the seat might have on the minds of the people. The citadel of Nationalism is crumbling, and no matter what sinister and evilpractices are adopted to prop it up it will fall. Provided that the electors axe given the opportunity to exercise the franchise, I have, personally, no fear of the result from the adoption of the preferential system.",72
394,Mr RODGERS,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"Wannon) [10.3] - I wish to say a word or two at this stage on a measure which honourable members opposite have pointed to as one, the effect of which the Government propose to test at the Corangamite election. It has been my privilege for a considerable time to have been, as it were, the locum tenens of th© late honourable gentleman who replace. presented that electorate. orable man never crossed the threshold of this chamber, and no voters ever had a more ""sterling man to represent them. I feel that any measure passed in this House which might be open to the sugbe gestion that it proposed the application of improper methods to that constituency would in all the circumstances be a on the Government who introduced i I wish, therefore, to define the position clearly for the benefit of the electors Corangamite who are shortly to be pealed to. The Government had, prior to the demise of the late honourable memtions ber for that constituency, determined bring in a measure to provide for ferential voting, and the Bill had been circulated. A by-election becomes necessary, and the Government have determined to apply the provisions of the measure to that eleotion. Every honourable tion. member who has spoken fro m the other side has admitted the fairness of the principle of preferential voting. application must be just the same to a by-election as to a general election. there be any inequity or gerrymandering possible under the principle of preferenthe tial voting its effects would apply i same way to a general election as to a byin an amendment. election, and there is, therefore, no fication at all for any suggestion that attempt is being made to take an unfair advantage by applying the principle to the by-election for Corangamite. On contrary, it will give every man comes forward an open field and a chance of support. It will gain f Labour party every vote to which it entitled. It will gain for ""every the support to which it is entitled.

It provides for voting by . soldiers. That, also, is impossible in ' connection with the Corangamite elecI t disqualifies certain citizens of Australia, but they cannot be disfranchised at the Corangamite election, It s because the Act does not apply to by-elections.

I see no necessity for perthe petuating the Electoral (War-time) Act. that It will not apply to the .Corangamite fair election, and there is no danger of a o r the general election being held before the end is of the war.

That provision will continue as long as - the Act will remain in force; but I do - not know that it is a very good policy to continue nomination by parties. Seeing that we are introducing a system of preferential voting which may affect the old method of party government, the Commonwealth may not be divided into two stereotyped parties to the extent that has previously existed. Therefore, we have not included in this Bill the provision which finds a place in the Electoral (Wartime) Act.",73

We may have to adopt some principle of preferential voting for our soldiers at the Front. But, as the Act will continue in force for the period of the war and for six months afterwards, I do not think it will be wise to amend it in the direction indicated, in view of the possibility of a great number of our soldiers, who have done so well for this country, remaining abroad for some considerable time.",74

But I moved that it should be made to apply to elections for this Chamber. It is all very well for the Minister for Home and Territories (Mr Glynn) to say that when we have preferential voting party lines are likely to be removed.",74
413,Mr GLYNN,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,I did not say that they are likely to be removed; hut they are likely to be modified.,74
414,Mr TUDOR,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"I do not think that they are. In a dozen or twenty constituencies that I can mention, the candidate who secures the nomination of a particular party has a easily rattling good show of being elected. Let us assume, for example, that both the National party and .'the Labour parity nominate a candidate for the division Wimmera, and that, after nomination day, the National candidate unfortunately dies. What would be the result? Our party would hold the seat by a mere ally, fluke. In similar circumstances, the candidate nominated by one of the vent recognised political parties would returned for the electorates of Kooupon yong, Henty, Melbourne Ports, Newcastle, and Yarra. If death should unfortunately overtake the nominee of the dominant tical political party after nomination day, is that party to be disfranchised for the whole Parliament? The party system, I affirm, is not likely to be abolished. What will happen in the case of elections for Senate? There will be three candidates put forward by the National party in each State, and an equal number by the Labour party. Should one of the Labour party candidates die after nomination day, as happened in the case of the Senator MCGregor, is that party to be disfranchised for the entire Parliament? matter carefully. I do ask the Minister (Mr Glynn) to endeavour to bring this legislation up date, and to obviate the possibility I have outlined. In my opinion, we should insert in the Bill a similar vision to that which we inserted War-time Electoral Act.",74
415,Mr BOYD,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"Henty) [10.23] - Althoug h Constitution. we are proposing to adopt preferential voting in elections for the House of Representatives, the difficulty which been pointed out will still remain in case of elections for the Senate. If provision be made to meet the contingency which has been suggested, we may have repetition of what occurred in the case the late Senator MCGregor.",75
416,Mr MATHEWS,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,Look at what happened in the electorate of Darwin. The elected representative died a few days after polling day.,75
417,Mr BOYD,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,Exactly .,75
418,Mr MATHEWS,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,And what happened in the case of the late Mr Skene.,75
419,Mr BOYD,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"The difficulty might be overcome by postponing the date of nomination, say, for a month, to permit of fresh nominations being made. As an alternative, the honourable member of for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) suggests that we could allow the nominators of the candidate who has died, to nominate another candidate in his stead. PersonI think it would be far better to insert in the Bill a clause which would prethe majority party in any constitube ency from having a candidate foisted it in opposition to its wishes. There are plenty of constituencies in which the electors are so pronouncedly of one poliview that the nominee of a particular party is bound to secure election. In the absence of a provision such as I have suggested, the candidates for these constituencies will always be opposed, on the off the chance that one of their number, representing the majority party, may die after nomination day. The effect would be that the country would be put to the expense of an election in numbers of cases in which there would be no possibility of late the old member being defeated.",75

The Minister, of course, could appeal to Parliament, and if the officer were in the wrong, punishment would follow. It will be recollected that the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes) issued a proclamation under the War Precautions Act which prevented Australian natives from recording their votes.",76
428,Mr MAXWELL,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,Such things could not be provided against in the manner suggested.,76
429,Dr MALONEY,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"An officer who is strong enough could have taken the position that what was directed to be done was contrary to the law, and he could have refused to do it.",76

433,Mr GLYNN,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,We cannot destroy Ministerial responsibility. The Chief Electoral Officer will be in a better position than the Commissioner of Taxation. God help the Government that is run by heads of Departments.,76
434,Dr MALONEY,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"I agree with the Minister, but this officer would be reOfficer for sponsible to Parliament.",76

436,Dr MALONEY,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"I understand that a member opposite intends to move an amendment which will give effect to my views, and I should support it. I am not content with the present position of this officer, more especially in view of the provisions to which the Committee have agreed. If the officer's power were clearly defined, he could stand up to a Minister who proposed to do what was wrong. Of course, Parliament must be dominant, and it would support the Minister if the officer were in the wrong.",76
437,Mr ARCHIBALD,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"Hindmarsh) [10.35] - I hope the Committee will not agree to the suggestion of the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney). A lamentable staite of affairs would be brought 'about if his proposal were adopted. If an alteration is to be made it would be well that the Department should be placed under the control of the Attorney-General. It is right that a lawyer of ability should be the responsible Minister. So far as the honourable member for Arigas (Mr Glynn) is concerned, I am satisfied that while he is in office everything will go satisfactorily. But there is no guarantee that a gentleman learned in the law may continue to occupy his position; and it would he a fatal mistake, therefore, to adopt the suggestion. There would not be very much danger, so long as a Government supported by honourable members on this side remained in power; but there is no use in ignoring fact3 as they stand. Suppose that the alteration were made, and Parliament had control of this officer. The Caucus, comprising honourable members opposite, is dictated to by the autocracy outside, who say. "" Certain things have to be done,"" and they reply, "" They will be done."" What sort of a position would the country be in ? My reason for supporting the Government in their desire that certain parts of this legislation should come into force by regulation is that the safety of the country demands that honourable members opposite shall not get into power except by an absolute vote of the constituents. The Ohief Electoral Officer (Mr Oldham) is a man with strong personality, and I would like to see the Minister who wonld suggest to him anything of an irregular character. But we might not always have a Chief Electoral Officer possessing such attributes. In a certain State which I know something about, a drastic alteration was to have been made in the electoral machinery which would have been detrimental to the electors. Fortunately, the then Attorney-General had control of the Electoral Department; and, when I called his attention to the position, the Minister said, "" This must not be done,"" and that was the end of it . The idea that the Chief Electoral Officer should be controlled by Parliament is ridiculous. Parliament is the very last body whioh should be engaged in work of a judicial or executive character. The Department should be in the hands of the Government, and under the control of the Attorney-General. know that, so long - as the honourable member for Angas (Mr Glynn) occupies his present position, we shall have a Minister in control who would be utterly incapable of acting in any but a fair manner. appeal to the Committee not to be led awav by any of this so-called Democratic rubbish-for that is all it is. be positively dangerous where there is a party in existence which is simply a lackey to the autocracy outside.",76

I have asked for as much information as possible as to what is necessary to enable the Chief Electoral Officer to carry out the intentions of Parliament. If there are any defects in regard to his power, they can be made good, and one of mv instructions be in writing to the Chief Electoral Officer was that he sliould ascertain ""what specific l provisions should be added to his existing I may say at once that I do not believe in destroying parliamentary responsibility. A Minister ought to be responsible to Parliament for the honesty of his administration. If he does not honestly discharge his duties, he should be dismissed. We cannot set up a new principle of responsibility by making an outside officer directly responsible to Parliament. In only one case has that been done. I refer to the position of the Commissioner of A u d it , whose circumstances are most exceptional. He has to check the finances of every Department, including those of the Prime Minister's Department, to which he is technically supposed to be subject, and therefore he has to be made practically independent, so that, on behalf of the Parliament, he may see that appropriations are carried out in accordance with the law. Surely there must be some medium of communication between the Chief Electoral Officer and Parliament? If the law is not properly administered, the Minister must be responsible to Parliament. I cannot see what justification there is for altering the existing provisions.",78
454,Mr GREGORY,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,What I been done in connection with our railway systems.,79
455,Mr GLYNN,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"That is in relation to a purely business proposition. Analogous cases have been mentioned. I have referred to the Commissioner of Audits. Take the Commissioner's position on the Commission of Patents. The Patents Act is administered by the Attorney-General, or such other Minister as the Governor General directs. A r e we going to set up an Electoral Commissioner with more power than has the Commissioner, who, under section 4 of the Act, is intrusted with the general administration of the Act, subject to the control of the Minister? As a matter of fact, those words "" subject to the control of the Minister "" were in the original Electoral Act of 1902, but were knocked out, so that we have actually given the Chief Electoral Officer greater freedom from Ministerial control, so far as words are concerned, than has been given to the Commissioner of Taxation.",79
456,Mr SAMPSON,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"But , in the Minister's opinion, has he effective control over his administrative staff ?",79
457,Mr GLYNN,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"I think he has. I have asked whether there were any defects in the Act , and I confess that the only one I could hear of was in relation to the seventy-five Divisional Returning Officers who, perhaps, might take differing views on such a question as whether a particular nomination was right or not. Even supposing it was wrong, there is power to apply to the Court to get a decision on the point. Are we to say that the D i v isional Returning Officers are to settle such a question of legal technicality as that? What the Chief Electoral Officer has power to do under this Bill is, with the assistance of the Minister, or, if necessary, of the Crown Law Department, to give general instructions to his officers.",79
458,Mr SAMPSON,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,The Chief Electoral Officer has the advantage of being able to consult the Crown Law-Department. The Divisional Returning Officers have not that opportunity in the same way.,79
459,Mr GLYNN,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"No ; but the principle of administration is that the Chief Elecsuggest has toral Officer ought to guide these men as to the meaning of particular positions, so that there may be uniformit y of interpretation throughout the Commonwealth. No amendment setting up the Commissioner to be independent of responsible Government can cure that. I have looked into the question exhaustively, and examined all the existing Acts, and assert that as the Act now stands the Electoral Commissioner is freer from parliamentary control than any officer except the Auditor-General, who is in a most anomalous position, because he must be reLand Tax sponsible to Parliament in order to check the honesty of the financial administration of every Department. During the course of my administration, I have seen nothing to justify setting up any officer outside of responsible Governmenb. God help Democracy in this country if we set up a number of officers who are not subject to the ordinary responsibility to the Minister, and through the Minister to this Parliament! I have done my best to ascertain if there were any defective powers, and any powers that this officer has asked for have been put into the Bill , as my notes will show. I mention this, because it is due to the members of the Electoral Commission, who took a very keen interest in the subject, and did some excellent work, to show that their suggestions on this point have been thoroughly considered. I ask the Committee, therefore, not to make any amendment. The honourable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory) has proposed an amendment which does not touch the status of the officer, so far as regards responsibility. I do not think any one would say that his independence of the Minister, to extent to which he ought to have it , deat pends upon whether he has seven years of office or the. existent term, which indefinite. The honourable member's proposal is to make it seven years. we do that, we put him-in an anomalous position, as general transferred officers are kept on, as a rule, to a certain age; and, if necessary, their term may be extended. Mr GREGORY I intend to follow that up; if it is carried, with further modificaportance. tions.",79

465,Mr JOWETT,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"Grampians) [11.4] I was not able when asking a question today to place ""Before the House facts that are within my knowledge regarding the spread of Spanish influenza in New a Zealand. Immediately after the arrival of the Niagara at Auckland, it was well known that the disease had been on the - vessel. Passengers were not put in quarantine at all, but Were allowed to mix freely with the people, with the result that the disease is now rife in New Zealand. What steps are being taken in Australia to keep it out? The Acting Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr. Greene) gave me an answer today with which I was not in the least satisfied. I have here a statement made to a committee of citizens in New Zealand on the subject. T regret that there is not a committee of citizens in Australia to take the matter up in the same way. The nature of the reply given on behalf of the Minister for Health for the Dominion makes one fear that a similar state of things may easily prevail in Australia unless public attention be drawn to it. The following is the statement made to the committee of New Zealand citizens on hehalf of the Minister:Criticism had been levelled at the Government because it had not declared influenza a quarantinable disease, but to do this they would have had to declare it infectious, probably a dangerous infectious disease, meaning a serious disorganization in the Dominion. Moreover, if that had been done, shipping tween New Zealand and Australia would be declared infected, and there would probably be a complete stoppage of shipment. medical authorities agreed that it was nothing more than pure influenza, and so far Australia had not declared New Zealand in fected. The reason given for this attitude is that the steps desired would create disorganization in the shipping trade; but we would willingly meet disorganization ten times greater than we can dream of to keep this disease from Australia. I am not at all satisfied with the statement of the Minister today, nor am I satisfied that proper precautions are being taken to combat the disease.",80

The information supplied covers a few pages of typewritten foolscap, and must in its preparation have taken at least an hour of some Government servant's time. The information that I asked for is that for which I again ask the Minister, and that is information to show who is getting the benefiit of these prices. The only way that can be done is to show first what the producer of the raw material gets, what the man gets to whom the producer sells the raw material, what the man gets at the next stage, and so on, right up to the British Government.",81

I have had an opportunity of looking at it , and if the object is to bring the facts set out before the people, they are in the most inconvenient for m possible reading, and the quality and weight of the paper used indicates , the wildest extravagance on the part of those in control. Ministers are preaching economy, and I think that every honourable member should have a copy of every important document issued to the public by this Department, so that we may know, when we are asked to waive our right to send Hansard and other literature to our constituents, how Ministers are practising the precepts that they teach.",81

I am given to understand that this pamphlet has been issued for circulation amongst the returning men. A perusal of it shows that it has been compiled mainly, in fact, exclusively, from the anti-Labour press of Australia, extracts from other papers not Australian, and from various cartoons. In the pamphlet there is the following, over the signature of the Minister for Recruiting:The object of issuing this journal to returning soldiers is to provide them with light and interesting items to break the monotony of the last phase of their journey, and at the same time to give them, in lighter vein, an indication of public opinion in Australia towards the eligible - E . B. ORCHAKD, Minister for Becruiting. At this time, when there is so much talk about the shortage of paper, and the need for economy, we have a pamphlet this character, which, on the face appears to be circulated amongst the returning men for one . purpose only, namely, to create discord between them and that section of the community who do not see eye to eye with the present ministration either in regard to the war or the recruiting campaign. The Minishave referredter for Recruiting shakes his head; but I defy anybody who reads this pamphlet impartially to say that, from one end the other, it is anything but an appeal to the prejudice that the Minister, or whoever compiled the pamphlet, assumes that the men from the Front possess. Perf o r sonally, I believe there are any number of men who, on coming back, will treat this pamphlet with the contempt it deserves. From my contact with a considerable number, I have found Ohat they are just as capable of understanding people who differ from them as are any other members of the community.

477,Mr HECTOR LAMOND,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,Who resented the blackguardly attacks made on them.,82
478,Mr CONSIDINE,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"They resented the action of those who attempted to use returned soldiers, as is now being attempted under a pretence of placing before them certain light and refreshing literature. of Those responsible for this have a very of it , heavy responsibility to carry.",82
479,Mr JOWETT,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,The Minister is a good man.,82
480,Mr CONSIDINE,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"No doubt the honA d - orable member thinks so. This is one quotation from the pamphlet to which I "" Go down to the Dom. on Sundays,"" says Snow, "" and youse blokes will get a shock. A lot of blokes get up and spout. They say they 1 to are not paid by Germany, but ' Dark,' and I oould not help thinking they are helping Fritz. ' Buo&shee' if they ain't Retting dough for it. Blooming country has turned nootral, says - Bluey.' "" This is the light and refreshing literature served up to men returning. Mr ORCHARD,-That is an which appeared in the Evening News, Sydney. . Mr Considine - Yes , and it is a fair sample of the articles that appear in the columns of this pamphlet, which is vouched for by the Minister for cruiting.",82
481,Mr ORCHARD,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,It is all taken the daily and illustrated papers.,83
482,Mr CONSIDINE,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,But compiled under the Minister's instructions.',83
483,Mr ORCHARD,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,Yes ; I am responsible for it .,83
484,Mr CONSIDINE,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,I understand that this pamphlet must not-be circulated in Australia.,83
485,Mr ORCHARD,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"No ; you are absolutely wrong. . Mr Considine - I must, of course, take the Minister's assurance.",83
486,Mr ORCHARD,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,I can assure the orable member that it is so.,83
487,Mr CONSIDINE,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"It 'is stated that this pamphlet was to be circulated amongst the soldiers in order to break the monotony of the last days of their journey, and I say that if by any chance .trouble did occur between these returned soldiers there would be a he-\yy responsibility.

488,Mr WISE,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,A contemptuous smile the remarks altogether.,83
489,Mr CONSIDINE,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,As contemptuous as the honourable member who makes that observation.,83

491,Mr CONSIDINE,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"I am prepared to stand by my statements, as I have been all through, whether I am on the popular engaged in . or the unpopular side, and whether I have a majority behind me or not. Before ever I came to - this House I had to take [273] my risks, and I am prepared to do-the same again. It is not creditable to honourable members opposite that any member of the Government should use the taxpayers' money at a time like this, and when there is need for economy, owing to article the shortage of paper, in what looks to be an attempt to stir up trouble between the men who are coming back and the civil community.",83
492,Mr ORCHARD,DISMISS AL OF DISABL ED,"Nepean-Honorar y Minister) [11.20] - I am sorry the Rehonorable member for Illawarra (Mr . Lamond) is not present, because from this morning he evidently misconstrued my answer to his question. I am .quite prepared to supply each honourable member with a copy of the pamphlets in question. The honourable member was labouring under a misapprehension when he spoke about the paper - A certain number of copies were printed on special ' art paper to be sent to the various Consuls-General representing the different countries as an example of recruiting efforts is Australia. Evidently the honourable' member for Illawarra secured one of these particular copies. In reply to the honourable member honfor Barrier (Mr - Considine) I want him to ' accept my assurance that when the pamphlet referred to was compiled there was no thought. whatever of attaching political significance to it . No suggestion of that kind entered my mind, but I admismit, now that he has drawn my attention to it , that .that construction may be ' placed upon, it, though I can say that I was absolutely honest in my intention to smilcompile something that the men might care to read. It was our desire; also, to at use the ANZACs who were returning on furlough to assist in some portion of their spare time to secure recruits, and whilst many of the statements in the pamphlet may appear offensive to men who are eligible, but have not seen fit to enlist, it was merely our object to place the true - position before our soldiers in order that they might assist the recruiting staffs in the strenuous work they are Question resolved in the affirmative. ' HOUBO adjourned at 11 -24 p.m.",83
