2,Mr ELLIOTT,Unknown,"parramatta - Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (9.31. a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Insurance Laws Amendment Bill amends three acts. Firstly, the bill amends the ance Act 1973. This act provides the basis for the Insurance and Superannuation Commission's financial and prudential supervision of general insurance companies conducting business in Australia. The opportunity is being taken to make minor amendments to this act. The proposed amendments will remove anomalies involving the valuation of shares in related insurance companies and investments in related unit trusts. They also provide for more commercial and administrative flexibility in directions made by the commissioner where there is doubt as to the viability of an insurer, and make minor amendments to provisions dealing with the principal banker of an insurer. Secondly, the bill also amends the Insurance Laws Amendment Act 1991 to make clear that phasing-in provisions dealing with the capital and solvency requirements of· registered life offices apply only to those life offices registered under the Life Insurance Act 1945 at the date of the original amendment. Thirdly, the bill will give effect to measures that substantially increase the effectiveness of the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act 1984. This act protects the insuring public against the negligence or misconduct of an insurance agent or broker and encourages practices consistent with the interests of the insuring public, including standards of conduct and quality of advice. It makes insurers responsible for the actions of their agents and provides a system of registration of insurance brokers. and those agents acting on behalf of unauthorised foreign insurers. The proposed amendments will enable the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner to more effectively discharge his responsibilities and will provide greater protection to purchasers of insurance through intermediaries. The amendments were developed following a comprehensive review of the operations of the act by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, in consultation with industry, consumers and other interested parties. They are based on this review and do not include consideration of matters arising from subsequent inquiries such as the Insurance and Insur- Superannuation Commission and Trade Practices Commission reviews of life insurance. These will be subject to further legislative proposals later this year. The bill was introduced into the Senate in December last year to allow broader public scrutiny of the measures it contained. As a r-sult of this process the government moved one amendment involving a minor. policy issue and this has been agreed by the Senate and incorporated into the bill now before the House. I will now provide a brief outline of the key amendments to be made to the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act 1984. The proposed amendments introduce a maximum 37-day period in which agents may hold premium moneys. This replaces a requirement that such moneys be passed to insurers as soon as it is reasonably practicable to do so, which has not worked effectively in practice. The effect of this amendment is to set a maximum time that agents may hold premium moneys, while allowing normal commercial-monthly settlement-arrangements to operate. Special exemption arrangements will apply to underwriting agents who, because of the nature of their business, are not reasonably able to comply with these settlement arrangements. The proposed amendments clarify the liability of insurers for the actions of their agents by making clear that insurers have joint and several liability for agents who deal with more than one insurer. This will ensure that consumers are protected in the case where a multi-agent acts beyond the authority granted by his or her principals; Multi-agents will be required to declare to all insurers with whom they have agency agreements the existence of any agency agreements they have with other insurers. The proposed amendments ensure that the clients of brokers and unauthorised foreign insurers are better protected by requiring a . no avoidance of claims clause as well as run-off cover in their compulsory professional indemnity insurance contracts. Any cancellation of such contracts will be required to be notified to the commissioner. The proposed amendments provide for the commissioner to determine. the type and form of audited accounts to be furnished by registered intermediaries. They also increase the power of the commissioner to inspect documents and obtain information about the activities of intermediaries, whether for purposes of routine supervision or for prosecution. Subject to appropriate safeguards, they provide the commissioner with the scope to refuse, suspend or cancel the registration an intermediary who becomes insolvent or bankrupt, provides unsatisfactory accounts or otherwise fails to satisfy the ordinary obligations of an insurance intermediary. The proposed amendments extend from one to three years the time allowed to the commissioner to prosecute offences under the act. This is necessary because of the particular. nature of many of the fiduciary offences under the act which, by their nature, take time to come to the commissioner's notice. The opportunity is ""also being taken to update the penalty provisions in the act and to introduce more meaningful penalties for serious offences such as failure to properly deal with premium moneys. Finally, the proposed amendments lower the threshold at which there is considered to be an association between an insurer and a broker from a test of 50 per cent ownership or control to one of 25 per cent ownership or control. They also make a number of other minor technical changes to the legislation to improve its operational effectiveness. Financial Implications The proposed amendments enhance existing industry supervisory arrangements and are not expected to incur any additional costs. I commend the Insurance Laws Amendment Bill 1994 to the House.",11
3,Mr ROCHER,Unknown,"As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott) has pointed out, we are dealing with the.lnsurartce Laws Amendment Bill 1993 and will later be discussing the L,surance Law:::: Amendment Bill (No.2) 1993. These bills represent a major overhaul of the arrangements for the financial and prudential supervision of insurance companies in Australia. The legislation follows widespread dissatisfaction with some aspects of the insurance industry over many years. That dissatisfaction has been expressed by consumers and within the business community. The industry has developed a bad reputation for commission-driven sales that show scant regard for the real needs of consumers. The industry has· also come to be seen as being secretive and thereby lacking accountability. There is currently little transof parency in the activities of insurance companies. The level· of information disclosure and financial .reporting required of insurance companies is well below that required of other entities affected by and operating under Corporations· Law. The industry has seen some spectacular corporate failures, such as the aborted sale of the Regal and Occidental Life companies. Many of the problems that have been seen in arriving at this legislation have been attributed to inadequacies in the existing legislative framework and the lack of powers· for the industry regulator, the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, the ISC. . The Life Insurance Act 1945 is the source of many of these inadequacies. Many of the insurance products sold today simply did not exist when· the Life Insurance Act was first conceived. For example, deferred annuities, one of the· most common rollover products, are not differentiated under the act from any other annuity products. The regular reports required by the ISC under the act are therefore unable todetennine the extent of deferred annuities as against other annuity products. Financial reporting to theISC und-r the act concentrates for the moment only.on the solvency of a relevant company. There is no focus on company profitability, which means that it is impossible to put a value on a life company or to make comparisons between one company and another.. Also, there is widespread uncertainty about accounting practices used by insurance companies. There is considerable debate, for example, about how property investments are valued and the status' of loans made to agents,. known as agency . development loans. All income received by an insurance company is reported as revenue, regardless of its origins. So. deposits. by . investments into savings plans are shown as income. whereas a similar deposit. at a bank. would be shown as a liability. There is no legally required accounting standard covering the a<,:countsof life insurance companies. While there exists Ii number of ISC. circulars on the subject which seek to. guide industry practice, they are not binding. A general accounting standard was introduced for the general insurance industry which has required a drastic overhaul of company reporting systems, but this standard has already come in for a lot of criticism from the industry. . There are also no specific solvency standards at present. The ISC requires minimum reserves to protect investment portfolios from losses, but companies can easily conceal their true financial strength by showing a single amount for policy liabilities determined on just about any base by the companies' actuaries. In 1990, Deloitte Ross Tohmatsu undertook a comparison of the methods used to value shareholders' investments in 16 shareholder owned life companies and the methods used for the inclusion of those life companies' profits in the holding companies' accounts. It came up with 16uniquely different combinations of .financial reporting. - There have been a number of attempts to come to grips with the many' problems with the existing supervisory and prudential work for the insurance industry. The House may recall that in 1991 the parliament passed several bills affecting the insurance industry, particularly those relating to acquisitions and takeovers. ,That legislation was an attempt to avoid any recurrence of the Regal and Occidental Life debacle, although it obviously amounted to closing the stable door long after the horse had bolted. Under the 1991 legislation, the ISC must be notified of a. change in ownership of more than 15 per cent of an Australian insurance company. The legislation also puts in place a 'fit and proper persons' test for· the directors and managers of such companies. The ISC was given greater powers to undertake investi. gations and to obtain financial statements more promptly. This latest bill represents an attempt to redress' the full range of problems with the existing insurance legislation. As the parliamentary secretary has pointed out, the bill before us was announced by both the then Treasurer and the Minister for Consumer Affairs(Ms MCHugh) on 14 July last year and was introduced into the Senate on 16 December 1993. It should be noted, however, that the then proposed changes to the existing insurance legislation announced in July last 'year are more extensive than the measures contained in this bill and in the Insurance Laws AmendmentBil1(No. 2) 1993. Both bills now under consideration are chiefly concerned with the consumer protection aspects of the changes that were announced last July and of' the relevant changes to the ISC's powers. We are still waiting on legislated changes to give effect to' the government's proposals for prudential supervision of the insurance industry more generally, although we have been advised of the broad outline of those proposals. To that end, further proposed legislation is to be introduced later this year, hopefully in a fonn that is complementary to and consistent with amendments we are considering today. . This bill seeks to amend three acts: the Insurance Act 1973, the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act 1984 and the Insurance frame- Laws Amendment Act 1991. The· proposed amendments to the Insurance Act 1973, though minor, remove anomalies involving the valuation of shares in related insurance companies and investments in related unit trusts. The ISC will be able to issue directions about the disposal and treatment of certain assets, or classes of assets, where there is doubt as to the solvency of the insurer. There is also a provision to update that part of the act that deals with an insurer's principal banker. However, the vast bulk of the bill is concerned with amendments to the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act 1984. Insurance brokers sell both general and life insurance and are required to be registered under the 1984 act. The act aims to protect consumers and requires brokers to act for the policyholder, have indemnity insurance, and comply with rules for the handling of insurance premiums and claims. As we all know, brokers play an important role in the insurance industry. In 1992-93 they dealt with almost half the total premiums paid in that year. There were 1,034 registered brokers at the end of 1992-93 handling premiums of $3.9 billion. The original act sought to protect consumers from negligence or misconduct by an insurance agent or broker. It sought to encourage standards of conduct and quality of advice consistent with the interests of insurance consumers. The amendments contained in this bill will provide further protection for consumers and allow the ISC to more effectively discharge its responsibilities under the act. The bill also stipulates a period of a maximum of 37 days during which agents may hold premium moneys. This amendment supersedes the existing requirement that agents pass on moneys to insurers as soon as practicable, something which has not always happened in practice. Special arrangements are to be made to exempt underwriting agents who cannot comply with these settlement arrangements because of the nature of their particular businesses. The proposed amendments also clarify the liability of insurers for the actions of their agents. These measures aim to protect consumers against negligence or misconduct by an insurance agent or broker. The amendments to the act enable the Insurance· and Superannuation Commission to more effectively provide greater protection to individuals who purchase insurance through intermediaries. Professional indemnity insurance held by registered intermediaries will be strengthened. The commissioner will have to be notified in writing before such contracts are cancelled and· insurers will have to honour such contracts even where non-disclosure or misrepresentation has occurred. Insurers have joint and several responsibility for agents who deal with more than one insurer. Consumers will thus be protected where agents for more than one insurer act beyond the authority granted by the principal insurers. Multi-agents with agency agreements must declare the existence of those agreements to any other insurers with which they also have such agreements. The biII provides for the ISC to determine the type and form of audited accounts that must be provided by registered intermediaries. The ISC is given greater powers to inspect documents and obtain information about the activities of intermediaries, either for the purposes of routine supervision or for prosecution. This includes the power to require the production of documents and conduct inspections of the premises of registered intermediaries. Where an intermediary refuses to comply with a request, the matter can be referred to a magistrate and an application may be made for a warrant. The ISC is given the powers to refuse, suspend or cancel the registration of an intermediary on becoming insolvent or bankrupt, for providing unsatisfactory accounts or otherwise failing to satisfy its obligations as a registered insurance intermediary. The time allowed for the ISC to prosecute offences under the act is extended from one to three years. This will allow more time for the ISC to become aware of fiduciary offences under the act. The penalty provisions of the act are also strengthened to provide for more severe penalties for a range of offences. The biII also lowers the threshold at which there is considered to be an association between an insurer and a broker from a test of 50 per cent ownership: or control to one of 25 per cent. 'i'hebiIl·also seeks to amend the Insurance Laws Amendment Act 1991 by' making it clear that the phasing in of capital and solvency requirements for registered life . officers applies only to life officers already registered at the date of the original amendment under the Life Insurance Act 1945. As far as I can make out, this is only a clarification provision. We have been told that it is not expected that any budgetary impact will result from the bill. However, the provisions dealing with the strengthening of cover in professional indemnity contracts will increase the cost of this cover for brokers and foreign insurance agents. The government assures us that this extra cost will be offset by benefits of increased protection for the insuring public. What the government has failed to mention so far is that this increased protection and increased regulation come at a cost to the industry which will ultimately be passed on to the consumer. In the end, it is always the consumer that pays for extra regulation. There are two elements of this legislation that I want to discuss in some depthproposed section 9B and the increased powers of the ISC. The coalition is in favour of measures to increase consumer protection, especially when dealing with agents and brokers, but we do have some serious' concerns about several provisions which are shared by the Insurance Council of Australia and the industry at large. Among the offending clauses are proposed sections 9B(3) and 9B(4). They are the runoff and the so-called non-avoidance clauses: Proposed section 9B(4) originally provided that acceptable contracts of professional indemnity insurance for foreign insurance agents and registered insurance brokers must contain a run-off clause made within three years. As a result of recent negotiations, the government has agreed to amend this three year period. The bill now before us makes a minor amendment, but in no' way addresses the industry'S major concern about the provision apart from saying that it will specify the extent of the run-off period in the regulations. This will transfer out of the bill the contentious clause relating to a three-year period of run-off and places it in the regulations. The ISC maintains that the run-off period will be less than three years,and the figure it decides upon will be formulated after further consultation with the industry. The coalition believes the run-off period should not be a matter for regulation but should be spelled out clearly in the bill.Prbposedsection9B(3) states that, even where a person has failed to comply with the duty of disclosure or made a misrepresentation on entering into il contract for professional .indemnity' insurance; the insurer cannot avoid the contract or reduce its liability even where the misrepresentation was fraudulent. In effect, the professionillindemnity .insurer will have po comeback for nondisclosure or misrepresentation, whether innocent or fraudulent. The potential impact of this clause has grave implications on the nature of future insurance contracts and premiums. It appears that the government has given no thought to these implications. The - government amendment will only encourage insureds not to disclose actual or potential claims when taking out professional indemnity insurance. An insured - person should be legally bound to disclose all potential and actual claims prior to taking out insurance. This would inevitably lead to a higher premium, but it is normal practice which, if not observed, is actionable at common law. However, where full disclosure does not occur and a claim is made, all ultimate consumers of relevant insurance will have to foot the bill for the payout in the form of higher premiums to recover the cost to insurers of higher indemnity insurance'The only other legislative non-avoidance provision in Australia operates inreIation to professional indemnity insurance for solicitors . in New South Wales. In the New South Wales scheme, the premiums have simply'skyrocketed. If the government wants non-avoidance provisions for the consumers of professional indemnity insurance, it will be the consumers of the product who will bear the increased cost through increased premiums, The Insurance Council of Australia and the National Insurance Brokers Association of Australia believe that a three-year run-off period, in conjunction with non-avoidance provisions, could increase premiums by a minimum of 65 per cent. That would be on top of an increase of 30 to 100 per cent that has occurred in the past 12 months, some of that increase being in anticipation of these and future amendments. An increase in premiums of at least 65 per cent on top of recent increases in premiums will threaten the viability of many brokers. Many brokers that remain in the industry may be forced to reduce their insurance cover in order to maintain some cover and still be economically viable. The inclusion of the non-avoidance provisions in this legislation brings the extra problem of a threat to erode the level of competition amongst the providers of professional indemnity insurance. According to NIBA, only two insurers will continue to write policies if non-avoidance becomes law. As can easily be seen, this will reduce the operation of free and open competit.ion and will certainly bring about pressures to further increase premiums. The National Insurance Brokers Association pointed out in its submission to the government that presently the NIBA facility requires underwriters to provide terms for all risks proposed. Underwriters have indicated that, with the broad scope of cover, they would require the opportunity to be more selective in their risks, which could result in brokers not being able to purchase that cover. That would present consumers with a difficulty. Underwriters have indicated that they will need to review audit certificates to ensure the solvency of brokers proposing to insure and estimate that 20 per cent of the risks will not find insurance. This process means that the underwriters, in a sense, become the regulators of the industry. I assume and hope that this is not the intention of the government. The National Insurance Brokers Association again highlighted that the combination of these two provisions-that is, run-off and non-avoidance-means that an unscrupulous agent may well buy, effectively, one year's cover and a three-year run-off at a premium which does not reflect the risk. For that reason, it is necessary to have a minimum run-off period perhaps of one year. That could reduce the cost of potential payouts and keep premiums in check as well as minimise the potential for any scurrilous behaviour by consumers of professional indemnity insurance. This proposed legislation also has the aim of increasing the powers of the ISC Commissioner and improving the focus of the ISC on the provisions of the various insurance acts. The ISC certainly has a huge task in overseeing the operation of insurance legislation together with superannuation legislation. The coalition hopes that there, are sufficient resources, both monetary and human, for the ISC to be able to undertake this task effectively. In clause 28, the commissioner's new powers over the behaviour of insurance intermediaries are aimed to overcome the problems experienced in investigating alleged breaches of the act and, naturally, to increase consumer protection when dealing with intemlediaries. Proposed section 41A aims to give the commissioner powers to make decision making principles in relation to registrations, suspensions and cancellations of registrations and the provision of information by intermediaries. This is a practical step that will assist reviews of the commissioner's decisions. Clause 27 deals with the situation where the contract has not been accepted. A broker must, within 37 days, give notice to the insured advising that the risk has not been accepted, and return the money. Whilst the 37-day period obviously alleviates administrative inconvenience for brokers, in our view it is important for a consumer to be advised immediately-not over a month later-that the cover is not placed. If consumers are not advised immediately, they will unwittingly be caught without the appropriate cover. Clauses 29 and 30 clarify that premiums paid to subagents are taken to have been paid directly to the agent, and that premiums received by an agent must be passed to the insurer within 37 days, unless exempted. The legislation currently requires that the moneys be paid to the insurers as soon as is reason for ably practicable. Insurers are bound by agent's act and actions, and the remittance money is a matter between the insurer. So it is that the amendment does not benefit consumers at all; therefore, why it been made? Insurers would prefer that no amendment be made or that the time period commence from the date of inception of the contract and not as stated in the act. The increase in the time frame for prosecuparties. tion for breaches of the Insurance (Agents Brokers) Act from one to three years is something that the coalition fully Often it requires more than one year for a breach of the act to become apparent. Some breaches are not made known to the ISC until one year after their occurrence and those that are known of in the first year are often cult to prosecute due to the limited time available to prepare a case. This amendment will hopefully allay fears in the community and the insurance industry that shady operaarrangements tors are avoiding prosecution because· of statutory prosecution time frame. The current amending bill is the result review of the operation of the acts by ISC, in consultation with consumers and the industry. The bill does not include matters arising from other inquiries, including the reviews of life insurance carried out by the ISC and the Trade Practices Commission. It is a bit of a worry that further amendment bills will not be debated in this place later in the year. It is past the time for government to get it all together and introduce all its insurance laws amendments in one bill, or at least at the one time. , current ad hoc situation is not a good method of developing good laws for insurance or any other area, for that matter. We can only hope that future bills relating to prudential supervision of the insurance industry will be presented in a form that is complementary to the provisions in this bill. The coalition will not oppose this bill.",12
4,Mr SNOW,Unknown,"I thank the acting whip for giving me the unexpected privilege of speaking on the Insurance Laws Amendment Bill. As Winston Churchill once said, 'If you want me to five minutes, give me an hour's notice. If their you want me to speak for an hour, give me of five minutes notice'. But I will try to contain agent and the myself in this speech. The provisions in this bill help the conhas sumer. The honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) has obviously studied the legislation in full. He ought to be aware that there has been good consultation with the industry, with consumers and with other interested This legislation will protect the public and from negligence and misconduct of insurance agents or brokers. This is worthwhile legislasupports. tion for the consumer. There are minor amendments to the bill. For instance, anomalies concerning the valuation of shares for insurance companies and investments in related unit trusts are attended to. Up diffiuntil now, if the commissioner has had a doubt concerning the viability of an insurer, the commissioner has lacked flexibility in the directions for commercial or administrative that the commissioner can give. the The provisions which deal with the principal banker are also attended to through minor of a amendments. The bill also amends the Insurthe ance Laws Amendment Act to make clear that phasing-in provisions dealing with the capital . and solvency requirements of registered life offices apply only to those life offices registered under the Life Insurance Act 1945 at the date of the original amendment. The bill increases the effectiveness of the until Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act 1984. the But I repeat: it protects the public from the to negligence or misconduct of an insurance agent or broker and it encourages practices The consistent with the interests of the insuring public, including standards of conduct and in quality of advice. The bill gives us a system of registration of insurance brokers and those agents acting on behalf of unauthorised foreign insurers. It also makes the insurers responsible for the actions of their agents. It provides greater protection to purchasers of insurance through intermediaries. The situation now is that moneys held by insurance agents are passed to insurers as soon as reasonably practicable. That has not worked very effectively in practice. The speak proposed amendments introduce a maximum 37-day period in which agents' may hold premium moneys. The maximum time, being a monthly settlement, allows normal commercial arrangements to operate.' The maximum time that the agents· may hold premium moneys is also convenient for the consumer. There will be special exemptions for ,und!!rwriting agents who are not reasonably able to comply. Consumers are protected when the. multi-agent-who is an agent dealing with more than one insurer-acts· peyond the authority granted by his or her principals. The proposed ameridments clarify the liability of insurers for' the actions of their agents. Multi-agents will be required to declare all insurers with whom they have agency agreements and the existence of any agency agreements they have with other insurers. The no avoidance of claims clause and the three-year run-off cover in the compulsory professional indemnity insurance contracts ensure that clients of brokers and unauthorised foreign insurers are' better protected. There is a requirement for the commissioner to be notified of any cancellation of such contracts. The proposed amendments provide for the commissioner to determine the type and form of audited accounts to be furnished by registered intermediaries. They also increase the power of the commissioner to inspect documents and obtain information about the activities of intermediaries, whether for purposes of routine supervision or for prosecution. The commissioner also has the scope to refuse, suspend or cancel the registration of an intermediary who becomes insolvent or bankrupt, provides unsatisfactory accounts or otherwise fails to satisfy the obligations of insurance intermediary. The proposed amendments extend the time allowed to the commissioner to prosecute offences from one to three years ..The particular nature of many of the fiduciary offences makes this necessary under the act as they, by their nature, can take time to come to the commissioner's notice. The penalty provisions in the act are updated and made more meaningful fot serious offences, such as failure to properly deal with premium moneys. Finally, the proposed amendments lower the threshold at which there is considered to be an associa· tioil between an insurer and a broker from a test of 50 per cent ownership or control to one of25 per cent ownership or control. They also make a number of other minor technical changes to the legislation to' improve its operational effectiveness. (conCIudeby reiterating what I said at the beginning: it is quite untrue to say that the cOnsumer' does not benefit' from this legislation. However, there are problems. Honourable members may not have had many problems-I have had only two or three major problems with insurers in my 11 years of service in this House. Nevertheless, if every member had two major problems through negligence or misconduct by insurers in 11 years, that would justify the legislation that has been introduced into this House today.",17
5,Mr CADMAN,Unknown,"It is a pleasure to speak on the Insurance Laws Amendment Bill. I draw the attention of the House to a 1991 article by Anthony Boyd in the Australian Financial Review, entitled 'Life industry reform slow and tortuous'. Anthony Boyd was absolutely right. In 1991, he predicted it might take two years for reforms brought on by the Occidental-Regal problem to see fruition in this parliament. It has taken a little longer than that; it has taken the establishment of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, a whole lot of bureaucracy and, in my view, some needless legislation to come to grips with some of the matters exposed in the Occidental-Regal scam. In that most interesting article, Anthony Boyd puts· the proposition that, despite the flurry of activity which occurred in the sake an of the $65 million Occidental-Regal scam, a new act and new arrangements with respect to superannuation could be two years away. We move slowly to solve problems such as that. The article goes on to say: .. That sort of timetable would fit in with the experience of Canada, which is in the final process of refonning its life insurance industry's supervision, financial reportirlg and solven-y. However; it is worth remembering that the sorts of policies not defined in the Act and now comprising the bulk of industry sales such as investment linked and investment account policies have been around for more than it decade. That is a very interesting article. It is salutary that we refer to that now-three years laterand as well note the comments of the then Treasurer, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). The head of the actuarial committee advising  that would go into the legislation were quite predictable. Again, this is from the same period. The article continues: . Mr Glading said any amended legislation would have to be based on three core strands: * Standards of solvency or capital adequacy. * Meaningful presentation of. regular financial statements. * Proper disclosure of alJ relevant information to policy-holders. We are moving a bit beyond that today. In this current legislation we are also looking at proper reporting standards and the duties of brokers. The article goes on: The most significant advance in terms of financial reporting would be the adequate disclosure of valuation methods for assets and liabilitiesit is very interesting after the property boom to be reading thisassumptions adopted in the actuarial bases for the valuations and of the considerations involved in distribution of surplus. The property boom is over. Everything has gone. All of that poor behaviour by Australian corporations is now washed out of the system and we say that it did not happen. But now we are going to introduce legislation to cover situations that were identified way before 1991. This is so often the case with our government system. We have a raft of bureaucratic controls that are only moderately necessary now that times have changed. We moved past them during the period in which the needs were first identified. The government failed to act quickly. I do not think the industry identified the problems as quickly as it could have, nor was it as forthcoming as it could have been. I do not know whether the measures that we are taking are completely appropriate either. When we first dealt with the brokers legislation, the 30-day proposal was put forward by the appropriate life commissioner or general commissioner for insurance from the federal bureaucracy as being necessary. The industry said that it did not need that sort of deadline, that it could have a code of conduct that it could live within and that the 30-day rule was not necessary. We are now seeing the 30-day rule becoming law. I have not been able to determine how many instances there have been of abuse by brokers during that period, what happened to those brokers and what powers were already possessed by the ISC or the appropriate commissioner to take action against them anyway. I think we use a great mallet to crack a nut in so many instances. When announcing the increased funding requirements necessary to resolve the problems experienced by companies such as Occidental-Regal, the then Treasurer advised that companies would be required to submit to proper tests. Anthony Boyd's article continues: The Treasurer, Mr Keating, has announced increased capital requirements for life company owners ($2 million to $10 million), the introduction of pre-vetting of changes in control, a quasi ""fit and proper persons"" test, greater power for the ISC to undertake investigations, and a reduction in the period after balance date for submission of annual financial statements. the That was in 1991. It was not the most activist sort of thing, despite what the Prime Minister postures here at the dispatch box. He likes the headline; he does not like the substance. So we have moved to that point, but very slowly. Mr Trevor Matthews of Legal and General said: During the 19808 there was a large amount of so called key men or business insurance sold on sophisticated tax leverage ... Also the development of groups of young high-pressure salesmen and saleswomen selling relatively long-term savings plans has created a further generation of clients who are likely to continue to express their disenchantment with their life insurance products. This is all fact and was all said years ago. Now we have almost daily complaints against insurance companies about superannuation packages, investment packages, poor payouts and the contribution of the investor. We are gradually moving to do something about it. In some ways, I guess that to have been too active would not have allowed us to identify what needs to be done. On the other hand, when the community is suffering it seems to me that this government, more than any government, is big on the statement but slow on the action. One can only suspect that, as with negative gearing, banking legislation and tax legislation, the movers and shakers in the Australian Labor Party have their own agenda, their own relationships and their own frierids to account for. One only has to look at the areas of media·and communications to .understand how the minds of the leaders of the Australian Labor Party operate. The caucus committees have no influence. The left wing, which is supposed to be the conscience of the Labor Party, has no influence. So the key people at the top of the cabiriet are. the ones who make these decisions. I use the example of insurance to demonstrate the way in which the Labor Party has operated in office. It makes great statements about a terrible thing. There was condemnation of the insurance industry when the Occidental-Regal scam was first notified and then years and years of comment .with a gradual movement towards some sort of resolution. Today we are seeing some of the latter stages of that in legislation. Mr Bruce Scott-They must have had a few mates there.",18
6,Mr CADMAN,Unknown,"I am not making those accusations, but, it seems to be a modus operandi for the Australian Labor Party. It can be big on the conscience and big on support for the battler until we come to look at the substance-whether it be in taxation laws, taxation changes or new taxation. We will get another bout of taxation at the coming budget which I believe will just hit for six a community that does not need to be hit for six. The government will not be able to fulfil its promises unless it increases taxation. So whether it is taxation, insurance or communications, the Labor Party is big on talk and little on action. If there is action,it is delayed . action. I would like to hear members of the caucus get up and refute that with fact and say, 'On this date we took a decision. On this date an action occurred. The following week we took a decision. From that flowed this report, and from that report there was immediate action by the government to endorse a change'. They cannot do it,but I would like to see them, try. I would like to see them demonstrate how authentic their government is in these iJl1port.ant areas' where people's. savings and' their expectations over years c'an be sudd-nly put aside by s,omething like the Occidental-Regal scam"" yet shareholders in that company or in other companies. have the whole thing paid for: The PriineMiriister 'postures, yet the whole thing is pa!d foT by current policyholders. I do not think itinakes sense that current policyholders should in fact pay the penalty for Occidental-Regal, yet they have paid. The main amendf""lerits to the Insurarice ' laws Amendment Bill 1993 will alter the rules for the calCulation of value assets for general insurance-surprise, surprise; the very thing the Prime Minister and Mr Glading were talking about three years ago. The amendments will require insurance brokers to have an acceptable indemnity contract-the very thing that the Prime Minister was talking about and making front-line statements about three years ago. They will clarify the liability of insurers for action of their agents-another one of the. matters raised three years ago, The amendments will widen the circumstances in which the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner may refuse to register brokers or councils or may suspend their registration-a natural consequence of the previous decisions. They will increase the commissioner's investigative powers"""":'of course, that always happens; the power of bu,reaucracyis increased whenever something .like this is done. That seems an ultimate and logical conclusion: we do not necessarily have to just look at the results; we have to increase the powers of people to do investigations. The amendments will introduce secrecy .provisions to make it an offence for the commissioner or officers of the commission to disclose information gained in employment. That is very sensible, because they may gain very important and confidential infornation about individuals and the health of companies. One has only to understand that a run on an insurance company.is nota very. good thing to occur and that bankruptcy. or loss of an insurance company is not a good thing to occur. These laws are going into place. They started in the Senate. The main provisions under the Insurance Act 1973 and the Insuranc- (Agents and Brokers) Act 1984 are the sorts of changes that, as far as I can detennine, give ,the results of the claims of the objects of the bill. In clause 28 we have a new. section to increase the powers of the commission to investigate the actions of insurance agents. The provisions are standard nature for investigative bodies and include the power to direct intermediaries to provide information, to require intennediaries to produce documents, to enter premises with consent or with a warrant issued by a magistrate, and to issue warrants by telephone. The provisions also provide that the commissioner and officers of the commission are not· to disclose information that has been acquired through their perfonnance of functions under this ad except where the disclosure is in the execution of functions under the act to the minister or a court for the purposes of the act, or to a person .whom in the minister's opinion it is in the public interest to have that information, or to a secretary or authorised officer of a department for the purposes of advising the minister of that department for the purpose Of making a submission connected with the administration of this act. That is a very interesting increase of powers. So we have a customs-like power now being given to our Insurance and Superannuation Commission. I just hope that the raid mentality that customs seems to have will not develop, because abuse of power in this area would be a tragedy. I think there has been a high degree of cooperation. Generally, except for the activities of the superannuation commissioner, I have been pleased with the professionalism of the previous bodies in general insurance and life insurance. Their supervisory powers have been well expressed. Sometimes they seem to have lacked initiative· to investigate certain areas that have been of interest to me, but that is a personal matter and may relate toparticular cases that have come to my attention. However, generally they have been professional and well behaved. .. ' My beef-and the beef of many ministershas been with the superannuation commission and its establishment. That was one of the most hopeless exercises any government has ever gone into. The tunnoil and chaos it caused amongst retirees is one of the most dreadful indictments of this government, and it should have it rammed down its throat on every possible occasion. It was a half-baked idea . and it was .poorly prepared. It was launched on the Australian community because the current Prime Minister felt it needed to be done. I think it was criminal that officers in various cities were required to answer questions that were impossible to answer. Then they left the phones off the hook so that callers gotthe engaged signal for hours and hours. There were no adequately trained staff. I think it was absolutely criminal to put people through the torture of wondering whether they were going to get a fine from the taxation commissioner. All that was protecting them was a press release from the Treasurer saying that they would not be fined. The Treasurer claimed, 'I am at anns-length to the taxation commissioner. I don't have any influence or control over him', yet here he was with the life and well being of a whole section of the Australian community resting on a press statement. How ridiculous to claim on one hand that he was at annslength and not able to direct or communicate with or have any influence upon the taxation commissioner and to claim on the other hand that he could control that person by dint of a press release and that taxation decisions on the investments of many retirees were going to be held up because the Treasurer had issued a press release. It was wrong in principle and wrong. in application. In conclusion, let me draw to the government's attention the dilatory nature of the action in regard to these matters. I note the statements that have covered the newspapers-headlines which have been consciously sought by ministers and Prime Ministers-as to how they are going to fix the insurance industry. Government members have had three years from the time they started making those statements to rectify that fact. It has taken one year longer than it was predicted at the time, and here we are in the final stages of the process. This is not good administration, nor is it good behaviour. The government has lacked. the impetus and the drive. It may come forward in the debate and say, 'We had an election'. That has nothing to do with what this parliament needs to deal with. Since the election it has had one year of the new parliament, and it has taken it one year toconc1ude that work. I do not think this is the standard that Australians want to see from their elected representatives. We have high-flying businessmen and salesmen flogging investments of all sorts, based on inflated valuations of property and buildings that were the very basis of the boom that Australia went through and the basis of poor, unethical behaviour and the expression of greed the likes of which we have not seen in Australia before. The government is part of that, and until now it has not recognised that it has been part, consciously or unconsciously, of that process. The Prime Minister continues that processand I believe it is part of his nature-by using behaviour in this House that Australia bagged Merv Hughes for. He thinks the loud mouth and the carry-on is acceptable here but will condemn Merv for doing it in South Africa. It is part of the same psychology and the same attitude. That needs to change as well.",20
7,Mr HARRY WOODS,Unknown,"I am very pleased to support the Insurance Laws Amendment Bill. I want to point out the enormous ambiguity that the opposition comes up with in these sorts of debates. We hear the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) saying that this legislation is too slow and it has taken too long to get it in and on the other hand that it is not necessary. He says it is a mallet to crack a peanut. I cannot work that out. We have him on the one hand saying that it is not really necessary and then on the other hand absolutely contradicting himself. In these debates those opposite have hide to come in here and start talking about taxation when the reforms this government has made over the last 10 years have resulted in a low tax regime that is competitive, certainly with our trading partners and with the rest of Asia, and in company tax being lowered. We are truly a competitive nation in the taxation sense. Before the last election the opposition had the hide to come in here and talk about taxation. It said, 'We are going to come into government and introduce a goods and services tax' - a massive tax on every aspect of our society. Of course, the Australian people rejected that. Yet here we have those opposite saying, 'Your taxation policy has been no good' - when theirs was rejected. And here they are now, in an absolute void of policy in every area, including the taxation area which the honourable member for Mitchell talked about. So they have an absolute hide to come in here and start talking about taxation and about slowness in legislation when the conservatives did absolutely nothing in the years prior to the Labor government. The conservatives knew what was to be done. They knew that there needed to be tariff reform in those years, but they never did anything. MCEwen built the tariff walls. He . knew that they should not have been there. It was to the cost of his own constituency-rural Australia-that they were built. The situation went on and on, and it took this Labor government to fix it Taxation in all these respects is being fixed. The Labor government has brought· forward the reforms. It is so ambiguous, so two-faced, of the opposition to come in here and criticise this government for slowness. The reforms are there; they are on the record. They are why Australia is now entering the 1990s and looking to the year 2000 with a new identity, a new means of being competitive. That would never have happened under a conservative government. If a conservative government had been elected at the last election we would have seen the most repressive taxation regime this country has ever had. It is no wonder the Australian people rejected the opposition. We are now seeing a recovery which the opposithe tion does not like. Opposition members whinge and whine about it all the time because they would like to see Australia going down the hole. The sort of talk they carry on with demonstrates that. The : general insurance industry operates Under the Insurance Act 1973, which provides insurance fcir a whole range of things:· motor vehicle insurance, house contents insurance and third. party insurance. Life insurance comes under a separate act, the Life Insurance Act 1945. In June. 1993 there were 160 .private. general inshrance companies in Australia plus .the government insurance companies. The top five companies shared 49 per cent of the market The next six to 50 companies shared 41 per cent of the market. The remaining companies had about 10 per cent of the market. ThoseJ60 insurance companies had assets of about $28 billion. at June 1993. The government insurance companies had asset- of .about $12 billion. Premiums were about $8 billion in. 1992.' So· it is a large industry that for Australians reaches into nearly everyone's life in one aspect or another. It is worth noting that as part of the policies this government has introduced in the last few years we are seeing a recovery in the share price index of the insurance category of companies. We have seen that share price index rise 30 per cent from July 1993 to February this year. The opposition does. not like to see that recovery. It does not like to even acknowledge it. It likes to tear Australia down all the time. But the recovery is going on and it has been produced by this government. It would be reasonable to take the opposition's line that the recovery would have happened anyhow if we were only running the same sort of average recovery that the rest of the world is running, which is growth of a:bout 1.1 per cent for OECD countries. But that is not the case; we are running a recovery far in excess of that. We are leading the world. There is no other explanation for that than the policies this government has introduced over the last few years. The key features of the Insurance Laws Amendment Bill aim to give greater protection to consumers. That is necessary. To many people,insurance is a fairly complicated matter, made no less complicated often by brokers and insurance companies. There have been-as the honourable member for Eden Monaro- (Mr Snow) pointed out earliercomplaints, problems and all manner of indiscretions and illegalities that have cost the consumer in the past. This sort of legislation is - imed at protecting those consumers. It is necessary. I know from personal experience that it is very easy for an insurance company to get an advantage over the average consumer. The cost and the complication of objecting to a ruling not to payout a claim is rather a high hurdle for the average consumer to get over. So there need to be legislative controls, regulations, to protect the consumer. Some of those controls are contained in this legislation, which is consistent with the government's general thrust towards protecting consumers and making industry competitive and, at the same time, accountable. Subject to appropriate safeguards, the commissioner's power to refuse, suspend or cancel the registration of an intermediary is to be extended in this legislation to cover the situation where the intermediary becomes insolvent or bankrupt, provides unsatisfactory accounts, or fails to satisfy the ordinary obligations of an insurance intermediary. As part of that commissioner's discretion, regarding the registration of brokers, the industry supervisor would invite the public to place some level of trust in the person registered. At present, provided applicants have not actually been convicted of an offence such as dishonesty, the commissioner is obliged to register all applicants who pay a registration fee and who have professional indemnity. The amendments contained in this legislation will remove the obligation on the commissioner to register delinquent brokers., At the same time, brokers are protected from unfair treatment in the decisions, and those decisions are in accordance with the decision making principles which will be tabled in pariiament. The investigative powers of the commissioner will enable more effective investigation of intermediaries. In particular, that facilitates the prosecution of offences against the act by insurance intermediaries. . Another feature of the act is an obligation on multi-agents to declare to all insurers with whom they have agency agreements the existence of any agency agreements that they have with other insurers. That ensures that insurers are infonned of such agreements the purposes of joint and several liability obligations. The legislation also provides the clarification of the liability the actions of multi-agents selling their products. The clarification of joint and several liability of insurers dealing with multi-agents will ensure that consumers are adequately protected in their dealings with multi-agents in a manner consistent with that applying to sole agents. The bill also provides for the introduction of a maximum 37-day period during which tion agents may hold premium moneys. This replaces a requirement that such moneys be prosecution. paid to insurers as soon as it was reasonably practical to do so, which was a very loose arrangement and easily able in one way or another to go on for too long because in the self-interest of the broker it was to his tage to keep that money as long as possible. failure to deal properly with premium monThat provided an additional cost for insurer, which was eventually passed on to the consumer. Thirty-seven days is quite a reasonable time. In nonnal commercial practice, 37 days credit is quite a long period. Most businesses-most wholesalers or manufacturerscertainly do not provide that length Thirty-seven days provides a considerable increase in cost, which has to be passed through the insurer to the consumer. My only criticism of it is that I believe the maximum period is still too long. Attention should given to shortening it in the future. This bill provides for the upgrading of minimum level of professional indemnity cover for registered intennediaries by requirwaking ing no avoidance of claims cover and run-off cover. in professional indemnity insurance contracts. That is required so that people dealing with registered intennediaries better protected against professional error and/or negligence. Any cancellation of such contracts must be notified to the commissionreply-I er. This bill also provides for an extension from one to three years of the time allowed to prosecute offences under this bill. change is necessary because, by their nature, the fiduciary offences under the act take time for to come to the commissioner's notice. The amendments provide for the Attorney-General for to also authorise proceedings outside that of insurers for three-year limit. Under the provisions of this bill, authority is given to the commissioner to detennine the type and fonn of the audited accounts to be furnished by registered intennediaries and for the clarification of what constitutes satisfactory accounts for the purposes of the act. This also increases the power of the commissioner to inspect documents and to obtain infonnaabout the activity of intennediaries, be it for the purpose of routine supervision or The provisions of this bill also contain the updating of the penalty provisions in the act. There is the introduction of more meaningful advanpenalties for serious offences, such as a , the eys. The proposed amendments lower the threshold where there is considered to bean association between an insurer and a broker from a test of 50 per cent ownership or control to 25 per cent ownership or control. A number of other minor technical changes are made to the legislation to improve its of credit. operational effectiveness. . I support this legislation. The way the on opposition has come in here and agreed to support the legislation but talk about all sorts of ambiguities is quite amazing. It should be really work out that, on policy matters, this government is making the running. The the opposition has no policy. Its criticism is . without basis. The Australian people are up to its real lack of leadership and intellectual ability in attacking these issues. This is good legislation that should be supported wholeheartedly by the opposition and are not in a two-faced way.",22
8,Mr ELLIOTT,Unknown,"In thank the various honourable members who have contributed to the debate today on the Insurance Laws Amendment Bill. I particularly thank my colleagues the honourThis able member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) and the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) for their contributions and for their strong support of the Insurance Laws Amendment Bill. I take this opportunity while summing to make a few remarks about the comments of the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) and the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman). I say in passing that the range of measures here do not go quite far as the contribution by the honourable member for Mitchell would suggest. They registration should be seen in the constructive and consula tative approach that we have taken in develview oping these amendments. That is important because strong consumer and industry issues need to be addressed. One can reflect on the past and what needs to be done for the future. The honourable member for Mitchell has suggested that, through these measures, we are building whole series of layers of new bureaucracy and regulation. We have tried very hardto strike what is inevitably a delicate balance between the need for prudential and supervisory arrangements and regulation requirements far as insurance is concerned and at the same time give consumers the protection they need its clients. without an overly intrusive arrangement. The honourable member for Curtin referred to a few matters that I would like to quickly respond to. If I can go to the concerns raised about proposed section 9B(3), which provides that professional indemnity contracts must contain a clause stating that insurers cannot avoid a contract or reduced liability on the grounds of non-disclosure by the agent or broker, the question essentially revolves around whether the government has conas sidered the impact of this on the duty of disclosure, which is fundamental contract. I make the following comments in response. The government considers that the most important issue at stake is that a broker's client should not suffer financial loss because of a broker's dishonesty to his or her insurer. This provision effectively picks up the point that was raised by the honourable member for Curtin. Further, it will have impact on insurance policies generally be that, cause it is no different in principle to compulraised sory third party motor vehicle accident cover, which is well established in the Australian and other insurance markets. It protects third up party claimants in a similar way. The provision is also structured so that if an insurer feels that his interests have been prejudiced by an intermediary it is open to him to cancel the policy at any time after as notifying the ISC. Professional indemnity insurance cover is a prerequisite to gaining from the ISC either as a broker or registered agent. The government is of the that very few brokers will risk making fraudulent non-disclosures to their insurers. I believe that the range of measures will ensure that, where difficulty in these arrangements is encountered, alternative cover can ensue. Turning to the various issues regarding the combination of the non-avoidance of claims a clause, run-off cover and professional indemnity cover, there was a suggestion that it will involve huge extra costs to registered intermediaries and, ultimately, their clients. The concern raised by the honourable member as was whether the government has considered the change and its impact on the industry and The government has certainly considered these issues. It has done so in the context of such things as the recent court decision which showed existing professional indemnity cover requirements to be seriously flawed. The government has a responsibility to ensure that the legislation gives some real measure of protection to those it purports to protect. We are advised that there will be increases in the cost to professional indemnity insurance cover a result of the amendments contained in the bill and that these extra costs will inevitably to any be passed on to clients. We anticipate, however, that the professional indemnity premiums will affect the claims experience that occurs over time. The matching of claims experience with premiums will provide an automatic competitive advantage own to those registered intermediaries which maintain high standards of professionalism. It will increase the quality of services to policyno holders who deal with them. Flowing from the honourable member for Curtin also the issue of fixing these provisions in the legislation regime rather than in the regulations. The government has made clear the requireAs ment of non-avoidance claims and mandatory run-off coverage likely to lead to increased costs for brokers. The provision relating fixing the time in regulation reflects the need to maintain. flexibility in approach to. these matters and to try to judge them as time and experie!lce .determine. I would suggest that that is an effective way of responding if particular issues arise in that regard. That the reason for placing those particular matters in the proposed regulation regime. The question is whether the government is using the professional indemnity provisions of the act to do its work in supervising registered into agents and brokers. To cover those issues in response, registered insurance intermediaries have been required to have professional indemnity insurance cover since the Insurance (Agents and Brokers) Act came into effect in 1986. The government has made to the way in which professional indemnity cover is used to protect the public in dealings with registered intermediaries. Important court decisions and the government's experience with the administration of the act have revealed significant gaps in its coverage which forthwith. will be remedied by the bill presently before the House. To some extent, the insurance industry'S ability to grant professional indemnity insurance cover and to fix premiums may be considered to be an element of industry regulation. This is .certainly not a new provision. Commercial and regulatory constraints work in parallel to some extent in all industries· in this way. The government sees reason to introduce special measures to move: protect registered intermediaries from normal commercial disciplines applying to their industry. Criticism was raised by the honourable member for Mitchell and the issue was reing ferred to by the honourable member for slimer Curtin in relation to the ad hoc legislation provision with these measures compared with the further issues that need to be addressed. It is certainly true that there is a range issues arising out of the review and inquiries by the Insurance and ·Superannul:ition .Commission and the Trade Practices Commission. I· indicated earlier, in the second reading speech, the important point to be made here is that - he government is certainly seeking to to have thOSe. matters dealt with this year. To address the concern of the honourable member for Curtin, the intention would be to ensure that. the provisions ,introduced at that time are consistent with the protective measures contained within the bills before the is fIouse today. It will t,ake time to go through some of the. other issues.· I think it is appro:priate to have the protective measures .contained in. these provisions dealt with, processed through the House and implemented law with a view to having the other matters, which I would suggest will be complementary, able to be debated by the parliament later this year. Having made those remarks, lthank all honourable members for their contribution to the debate on the Insurno change ance Laws Amendment Bill. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved Bill (on motion by Mr Elliott) read a third time. NA BILL (No.2) 1994 Consideration resumed from 22 March. Second Reading MrELLIOTT (Parramatta-Parliamentary no Secretary to the Treasurer) (10.59 a.m.)-I That the bi\l be now read a second time. own The Insurance Laws Amendment Bill (No; 2) 1994 will substantially increase the· level 'of protection for members of the public purchasinsurance products generally and con .. credit insurance, in particular. The bill gives effect to the government's decision, announced in July last year, on issues raised in a 1991 Trade Practices Commission report of on consumer· credit. insurance and a :subsequent report by a working party of officials. It was introduced into the Senate in December last year to allow broader public scrutiny of the measures it contained. As a result of this process the government moved a number of amendments involving minor policy and technical issues and these have been agreed by the Senate and incorporated into the bill now before this House. The major effect of this bill is to amend the Insurance Contracts Act 1984 to make the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner responsible for its general administration.The Insurance Contracts Act was introduced in 1984 to reform and modernise the law.relating to insurance contracts. It aims to ensure that a fair balance is struck between the interests of insurers, insureds and other members of the public, and that· the provisions of insurance contracts and practices of insurers operate fairly. It lays down a framework for insurance contracts, covering such matters as the duty of utmost good faith and information to be provided before a contract of insurance is effected. The act has been self-administering, with no power for government intervention to ensure that it is operating effectively. Administration by the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner will ensure that the operation of the act is more closely monitored and, where necessary, enforced. The commissioner will have power to monitor compliance with the act, ensure that appropriate publicity and education functions are undertaken and, where it is in the public interest, take repre-entative action on behalf of consumers. The government is introducing this legislation in order to give added protection to members of the public who purchase insurance products. However, it acknowledges that the life and general insurance industries, through initiatives such as those in relation to complaint handling and dispute resolution, have brought about significantly better industry practices. Further amendments to the act are expected to arise from the commissioner's administration and from a broader review of its provisions which is being conducted by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. I will now outline the amendments proposed to be made in the Insurance Laws Amendment Bill (No.2) 1994 now before the House. The amendments: make the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner responsible for the general administration of the Insurance Contracts Act, and provide for representative action on behalf of insureds by the commissioner where this is in the public interest; require pre-sale, point-of-sale and post-sale notices to be given by insurers to purchasers of consumer credit insurance products. They also provide that similar notices may be prescribed for other types of insurance. These notices will improve the capacity of purchasers of insurance products to make informed decisions about insurance, particularly where it is sold as a part of a .complex package involving other financial transactions. provide a 14-day cooling-off period for purchasers of consumer credit insurance products; amend section 15 of the Insurance Contracts Act and repeal subsection 87(1E) of the Trade Practices Act to clarify the right of access of insureds to the protection of the Trade Practices Act in relation to unconscionable conduct; amend the General Insurance Supervisory Levy Act 1989 and the Life Insurance Supervisory Levy Act 1989 to raise the statutory upper limit of levy which may be collected from $15,000 to $17,000 for general insurers and from $28,000 to $70,000 for life insurers. The increase in the maximum levy which may be charged allows for recovery from the industries of the cost of administration of the Insurance Contracts Act. In the case of the life· insurance levy, the amendment also provides for the increased costs of supervision that will arise from amendments to the Life Insurance Act which were announced by the government in July 1993 and which are expected to be introduced into the parliament later this year. Financial impact statement The measures for added protection for purchasers of insurance products generally, and consumer credit insurance products in particular; will result in additional supervisory costs being incurred by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. The Insurance and Superannuation Commission estimates that the additional resources needed to give effect to this package of measures. will be $130,000 in 1993-94-to be absorbed into the current ISC vote-and $336,000 each following year.. These additional costs will be recovered through increases in the general insurance supervisory levyand the life inslirance supervisory levy as already outlined. I commend the Insurance Laws. Amendment Bill (No.2) 1994 to the House.",24
9,Mr ROCHER,Unknown,"The 1984 Insurance Laws Amendment Bill (No.2) 1993 is the second of two insurance bills to considered by the House today. This bill first introduced into the Senate on 16 December 1993. It is claimed to be the product extensive consultations between the Insurance and Superannuation Commission and industry groups. The proposed amendments aim to increase substantially· the level of protection to the public purchasers of insurance products generally and, in particular, those purchasing consumer credit insurance-CCI. Consumer credit insurance is deSigned protect a consumer's ability to meet loan repayments on personal loans and credit card finance in the event of death or loss of income due to injury, illness or unemployment. It is an add-on, sold as an adjunct to a finance contract often entered into for the purpose purchasing consumer durables. CCI is rarely sold as a separate item. According to available statistics, approximately 80 per cent CCI policies' are sold at the premises of credit provide-. Most of the remaining 20 per cent of CCI policies are sold by car dealers conjunction with the purchase of a car, along with all the options such as rustproofing the like. These proposals represent a major overhaul of the arrangements for the financial and prudential supervision of insurance companies in Australia. Also provided for is a new role and increased powers for· the ISC. This proposed legislation follows from dissatisfaction with the insurance industry over many years, as expressed by consumers and the.businesscommunity in general. The industry, rightly or wrongly, has a badreputation for commission-drivensales that often show scant regard for the real needs of consumers, The industry has also come to be seen as being secretive and lacking accountabiIity. There is currently little transparency in the activities of insurance brokers, as I had occasion to note earlier this morning. Many of the problems in the industry have been attributed to inadequacies in the existing legislative framework and the lack of powers given to the ISC. The Insurance Contracts Act is the source of many of these failings. Many of the insurance products sold today be simply did not - exist when. the Insurance was Contracts Act was first conceived. More important is the growing trend toward of consumerism. The buyers of insuranceproducts want increased product knowledge and an easier means of settling disputes with their insurers. In the immediate postwar period, customer - loyalty was still very much in vogue. In that sort of environment insurance companies were able .to concentrate their competition on providing efficient service and to underwriting on risk and exposure. Most sectors of the industry were then profitable. According to Michael Millard of MCLarens Australia the 1970s brought about a revolution in the. insurance industry, not only in terms of the introduction of newer technology, of such as computers, but also in the emergence of a consumer rights movement. Consumers began to win cases in consumer claims tribuof nals, that had the effect of weakening the a common law basis of insurance contracts. The result of this process was the codification of in the common law pertaining to insurance contracts in the form of the principal act-the and Insurance Contracts Act 1984. The act has been criticised by consumers, largely because it is costly and cumbersome for individuals to take legal action where a breach of the act has occurred. The bill before us in part aims to amend the act to solve this problem by giving the ISC the responsibility for the general widespread administration of the act. The other issue of major importance in the bill is disclosure. The ISC has been taking action to ensure that there is. greater disclosure about benefits and early exit penalties. Many poliCies that were aggressively' sold by, insurance agents contained punishing early termination penalties and were quite misleading' about benefits and commissions. In 1991 the ISC issued circular No. 291 which required greater disclosure of the effects of fees. ;md charg-s on regular premiUIn policies and on early termination,. Although the disclosure of the. amount of the commission ,paid was, not required, illustrative surrender values had to be given which served, to expose the existence of high sales commissions. This legislation represents an attempt to address a wide range of problems with the existing legislation. The bill reflects the recommendations of a 1991 report by' the Trade Practices Commission on consumer credit insurance. The TPC report said, amongst other things: It is usually difficult or iriconvenient for consumers to shop around for the best buy among the alternative eel products offered by different irisurers. seems to reflect· five tI1ain factors. They are: CCI is almost always sold as part of a package, most'retail.agents for CCI have sole agency arrangements with a particular insurer, consumers may not have a sufficient incentive to shop around; many consumers find it difficult to compare the value of alternative CCI policies,andthere is limited published information about CCI. Some of the recommendations made by the Trade Practices Commission are covered in this bill, including improved disclosure that includes ensuring the amount ofcommissiori and· fees are clearly stated, a cooling-off period of a minimum of 14 days in which a policy can be cancelled without penalty, and the provision of post-sale information; The TPC also recognised problems faced by consumers in seeking remedies from insurance companies, largely, due' to the complex and costly nature of legal action. For these reasons the TPC argued that consumers are obliged to rely on compliance with the law by 'insurers and their agents and enforcement.of the law where disputes arise. Unfortunately, no agen;. cy has, at present, enforcement powers over the Insurance Contracts Act. The bill gives the ISC these much needed powers, though the TPC initially recommended that the state consumer affairs departments and the TPC should have the role of enforcers. A government working party then set aboutformulating a legislative response to the report. The proposed legislation under discussion armounced by the Treasurer (Mr Willis) and the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Ms MCHugh) on 14 July last year-as mentioned earlier-was introduced into the Senate on 16 December 1993. It should be noted, however, that 'the proposed changes to the' existing insurance legislation announced in July last year are more extensive than the measures contained in these bills-the same point I made in relation to the earlier bill. These bills are chiefly concerned with the consumer protectiori aspects of the changes that were announced last July and the relevant changes to the ISC's powers. ' We are still' waiting on legislation to give effect to the government's proposals for the This prudential supervision of the insurance industry, although we have been given a' broad outline of those proposals. This further legislation is to be introduced in this year, again hopefully in a form that is complementary to the' bill now under consideration. Further amendments to the Insurance Contracts Act are expected later this year or even in 1995 following the ISC's experience with administration of the act now to be amended and a broader review of its provisions. This bill serves to amend the Insurance Contracts Act 1984, the General Insurance SupervisQry Levy Act 1989 and the Life Insuram;e Supervisory Levy Act 1989. It also repeals a subsection in the Trade Practices Act 1974. The overwhelming content of the bill Is concerned with changes to the Insurance Contracts Act. The existing act has been self-administering until now. The government has had no power to intervene to ensure its effective operation. The bill intends that the operation of the act will be monitored and enforced' by the ISC. The ISC will have the power to monitor compliance with the act and to take representative action on behalf of consumers. These changes are said to be designed to complement those being introduced by the insurance industry itself to bring about improved industry practices. As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Elliott) has pointed out, the bill requires pre-sale, point of sale and post-sale notices to be given by insurers to the purchasers of consumer credit insurance products. Similar notices may also be prescribed for other types of insurance. Such notices aim to assist purchasers of insurance products to make informed choices, especially where it is part of a complex package. There is to be provision for a 14-day cooling off period for the purchasers of consumer credit insurance products. The relevant section sets out the grounds for the cancellation of a contract of consumer credit insurance and specifies the amount to be repaid if the contract is cancelled. The amendments clarify the right of insurance consumers to access protection measures under the Trade Practices Act due to unconscionable conduct. To fund its extended supervisory and regulatory functions, further resources will be obtained by amendments to the General Insurance Supervisory Levy Act and the Life Insurance Supervisory Levy Act. It is estimated that the increased resources needed by the ISC to administer the Insurance Contracts Act will be $130,000 in the current year and $336,000 in each subsequent year. These amendments will increase the statutory upper limit of the general insurance supervisory levy from $15,000 to $17,000 and the life insurance levy f(om $28,000 to $70,000. The explanatory memorandum explains that this increase in administering the Insurance Contracts Act will focus on monitoring the consumer credit insurance class of business, ensuring the operation of the act is well understood by the general community by means of educational measures and ensuring action is taken to enforce the act where that would be deemed to be in the public interest. The increase in the levy for life insurance companies is to be approximately 400 per cent. That is of some concern as there is every possibility that if the regulatory functions of the ISC are more costly than anticipated it is highly likely that the levy will be further increased. My colleague Senator Watson when discussing this matter in the Senate noted that the increase in the levy will have a serious impact on the competitiveness of smaller players in the life insurance iridustry. The increased levy poses a direct threat to potential new entrants as wel1 as s.maller companies. It is general1y supposed' that new entrants and smal1er companies are the most innovative in the development of new insurance products: This industry dynamism is not a feature that the coalition would want to see diminish. The amendments in the bill and the Insurance Laws Amendment Bill 1993, which received passage just a while ago, only cover a small range of the legislative proposals for the insurance industry that have arisen out of the Trade Practices Commission report and that were flagged by the government on 14 July 1993. I understand the remainder of the proposed amendments will appear in legislation to be introduced later this year and they will focus on amendments to the Life Insurance Act. Many of the amendments now before us are designed to be complementary with future legislative changes. At the heart of both bills which have been discussed this morning is a desire to improve the level of protection afforded to consumers of insurance products. The increased powers given to the ISC and the increased levels of disclosure for consumer credit insurance products are moves in this direction. In October 1993 the ISC issued circular 304 that furthers the objectives of circular 291, to which I referred earlier, and is a direct result of the TPC report. Circular 304, though not binding, is an influential document that gives an indication of the issues in which the ISC believes some form of regulation is necessary in the life insurance industry. The circular relates primarily to information provided at the point of sale. A detailed customer information brochure like a prospectus must be provided and must contain a brief· description of the product and benefits payable- an indication of the surrender value of the policy if surrendered in the first 10 years; all fees and charges, including a standardised illustration that could make comparisons between .competing products. possible; the investment portfolios available; standardised information on investment performance and fund size; and the t:emuneration,. including commission, of the intermediary selling the policy. Although the circular is a useful guide to future legislative changes, it may also be important in terms of this bill. As previously mentioned, the bill requires pre-sale, point of sale a1'ldpost-sale notices be given by insurers to the purchasers of consumer credit products and similar notices may also be prescribed for other types· of insurance. The coalition isa little concerned that the government may use this as a backdoorapproach to increase the level of regulation rather than deal with it in the legislation. Regulati-n as such need not be of great concern where it can be properly justified, though it must be remembered that increased regulation always results in higher costs that will be passed on to consumers. Given that the ISC has already outlined a need for greater levels of disclosure in the life ance industry, it is highly likely that the ISC would use the bill to implement circular 304. Circular 304, which is effective from 1 July 1994, requires that a detailed customer information brochure must be provided. I have already described what it should include. The insurance industry, and intermediaries in particular, are concerned that they will have to disclose their remuneration. They fear that consumers will regard their income as salary and as not just gross business income from which expenses have to be paid. Other issues, such as disclosure and obtaining remedies, are also important for consumers. The focus of amendments such as these is the protection of consumers. . Currently, disgruntled customers have access to complaints bodies, but complaints bodies established by the insurance industry. The Insurance Industry Complaints Council and the Life Insurance Federation of Australia complaints scheme are examples, yet they do not have the confidence of many consumers. Fortunately, these attempts at providing increased consumer protection have been initiated by the industry and, to date, have not depended on government action. The provisions in this bilj giving the ISC the power to enforce the act should be a major contribution to restoring consumers' faith in the regulatory framework within which the industry operates. The insurance industry is one of the few industries that do not have an industry wide. independent regulatory structure, even in the form of an ombudsman or an independent review panel. Public disdain for the insurance industry will. not disappear unaided. Cynicism will continue, unless steps are taken to restore public confidence in the system and to win back the public's respect and trust. Some in the community believe that the industry shows an arrogant attitude towards them. The reality of this arrogance is not the point, as we are dealing with perception. The public perception is that the LIFA complaints scheme and the Insurance Industry Complaints Council do not adequately deal with the complaints of aggrieved clients. The situation could be perceived by some consumers as insur- somewhat akin to wolves looking after sheep. Many who feel aggrJeved by the actions of an insurance company have no faith in receiving natural justice from a complaint process operated by industry bodies. They are prone, therefore, to not even lodge a complaint. Only when the public perceives that the insurance industry is regulated by an independent body will it be satisfied that its complaints receive natural justice. If the industry believes that it currently provides even,.handed investigation of complaints, of course it has nothing to fear. from the ISC or, for that matter, some future insurance ombudsman. The openness of the industry is important if consumers are to have faith in it-and it is no more important to them than it· is to· the industry itself. Mr George Pooley, commissioner of the ISC, has said: I am confident that improved information disclosure will benefit not only consumers, but also theJife:insurance industry. As customers become better infonned about the products on offer, competition will increasingly result in product designs and pricing structures which are more closely attuned to customer needs, and this in tum should generate lasting business. Apart. from the regulatory aspects of the bill, the ISC is given increased supervisory powers. The ISC commissioner is given extensive powers to require insurers to produce documents and information, under proposed sections lIC and lID. The proposed legislation states that the commissioner has the power to do all things that are necessary or convenient to be done in connection with the administration of the act. This includes reviewing documents issued by insurers, given in compliance with proposed section lIC, and reviewing particulars, such as statistics and documents, given in compliance with proposed section lID. The Insurance Council of Australia recommends that the commissioner also formulate guidelines to enable the industry to understand the scope of the ISC's information gathering power. The ICA has concerns about the scope and meaning of certain terminology, particularly with the scope and width of such terms as 'review'. The ICA is especially concerned that the commissioner has the power to review organisational structures and even administrative arrangements. According to the ICA, this does not appear relevant to the administration of the Insurance Contracts Act. Further, there are concerns that insurance companies may be required to produce information and documents that are confidential, commercially sensitive or have legal professional privilege attached to them. This is very important in a highly competitive industry . such as insurance, where firms are always looking for the competitive edge. It is of concern that confidential information that is passed over to the ISC could be accessed by interested parties using freedom of information requests. Documents given to the ISC should therefore be classified according to the degree to which they are confidential; and those documents that are commercially sensitive should be protected, under the secrecy provisions, from being made public. The consequence of commercially sensitive information being made public could be immense financial damage to some insurance companies. Unlike section 346 of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act, confidential documents of a sensitive commercial nature are not protected by this bill under section 38 of the Freedom of Information Act 1982, which would allow the ISC to refuse freedom of information requests for documents acquired under these provisions. The only types ofinformation that insurers can refuse to supply to the ISC are those that will incriminate the insurer, which are covered in sections lIC(4) and lID(5), and information pertinent to the insurance cover provided to an individual, which is covered in section l1C(3). Individual information can be accessed by the ISC only where an individual or other legitimate person has made a claim on .a policy and has given the ISC written permission for the commissioner to seek information. Under proposed section llH, the ISC will have to give the Treasurer, for tabling in the parliament,an annual report on the workings of the act. That of course is welcome, as always. The report will give the ISC the opportunity to name offending companies; if it so chooses. Naturally, this is opposed by many in the insurance industry, but it does have the full support of the coalition. The coalition supports the broad thrust of the Insurance Laws Amendment Bill (No.2) 1993, although we do have some reservations with various provisions-and I have already mentioned those. The bill provides increased levels of protection for consumers. The improved disclosure provisions for consumer credit insurance are commendable measures that will greatly assist consumers in making sound decisions. Such disclosure rules should be applied to other forms of insurance only where a clear-cut benefit to consumers can be shown to either exist or be in prospect. Regulation should be kept to a minimum, in the view of the coalition. The other aspect of this legislation that is a positive development is the appointment of the ICA as the administrator of the Insurance Contracts Act. This administrative role ties in well with the enforcer role where the ISC can take action against an insurance company on behalf of an aggrieved consumer where to do so is deemed to be in the public interest.",28
10,Mr SWAN,Unknown,"I rise to speak in support of the Insurance Laws Amendment Bill (No.2). This bill, like the first amendment bill, makes important changes to the administration and operation of insurance schemes. This bill, along with the Insurance Laws Amendment Bill, will go a long way towards restoring public support for, confidence in and credibility in the insurance industry. It is important that we recognise that most Australians use insurance in some form or another. Those consumers trying to understand insurance are frequently faced by a daunting amount of technical jargon. Many consumers, indeed the bulk of Australians, do not enjoy the privileges of professional financial advice which may come easily to some members of this House. They therefore needs some consumer protection, which is provided in this bill. A number of the provisions in this bill will help consumers to be able to understand and select appropriate agents. So the consumer protection and information provisions in this bill are very important. It is vital that we ensure that Australian consumers are protected, that they feel secure in the knowledge that their insurance will be managed responsibly and that, if they feel cheated, they will be able to access some means of recourse. I am happy to speak in favour of this amendment bill as it will help Australian consumers to be confident that their insurance will be well managed and that there will be legislative structures to protect their consumer rights. The government made a commitment to reform delivered in this bill after the 1991 Trade Practices Commission report on consumer credit insurance and the subsequent report by a working party of officials from Trade Practices Commission, the federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs and the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. Both of these reports highlighted a number of problems with consumer credit insurance and the ability of individuals to exercise their legitimate rights as consumers. This bill brings to effect part of the government comn;litment to regulate the consumer credit insurance and life insurance industry. Firstly, let me deal with consumer credit insurance. When taking out a personal loan with which to buy a car, furniture or many other necessities, many Australians choose to take out consumer credit insurance. They do this to prepare for the possibility that illness, disability, unemployment or some other unforeseen factor may prevent them from meeting their loan obligations. It is therefore very important that we make sure that borrowers can be confident in the security and integrity of their consumer credit insurance policy. It is our responsibility to ensure that consumers can be secure in the knowledge that their rights will be protected. The Insurance Laws Amendment Bill and the amendment bill No. 2 of 1994 give powers to the Trade Practices Commission and the Insurance and Superannuation Commission so that they can enforce the Insurance Contracts Act 1984. The Insurance Contracts Act 1984 is the act that currently governs the conduct of insurance companies and their· agents. These amendment bills mean that the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner is now empowered to ensure compliance with that act and that will ensure that appropriate publicity and education functions are undertaken and, where it is in the public interest, to take representative action on behalf of policy holders. At the moment there is little consumer protection for those consumers making use of this kind of insurance. Many constituents in my electorate have raised with me their concerns about the charges and administration of their consumer credit insurance and they feel that there should be more direct mechanisms to protect their rights as consumers. the This bill will ensure that the consumer is directly protected. The amendment bill No.2 will give greater power to the Insurance and Superannuation Commission and to the Trade Practices Commission and this will allow Australians to feel more secure than ever before that the costs and operation of their insurance policies will work in their favour. The am.endment. bills are the result Qf broad community inpuLDuring their passage through the Senate, a number of. policy and technical changes were made to accommodate the;concerns and problems faced by interested consumers: The amendment bill No.2 amends the General Insurance Supervisory Act, the Life Insurance Supervisory Leyy Act and the Trade Practices Act. An important component of this reform is the right of consumers to expect concise information from their insurer . and their agent. Amendments to the act mean that the insurer and the agent must supply information in plain English at pre-sale, point of sale and post-sale to the purchasers of corisumer credit insurance.. An important principle. 6f this reform is that· the consumer should be· empowered to make the most' informed personal decision possible. Furthermore, the amendments to the act give greater powers to the Trade Practices Commission to take action against insurers or agents who make misleading representations. The Trade Practices Commission will be empowered to prosecute an insurer or agent who is g-ilty of misrepresentation concerning their product. Guaranteeing consumer confidence in the integrity of the information offered to them by their agent and insurance company will restore the credibility of the general insurance industry. In particular, low to middle income Australians who do not have access to the privilege of personal ·legal or financial advice can therefore be confident that they will be able to get clear and concise information about their insurance products-something which does not necessarily occur at the moment. I realise that many members opposite may not necessarily understand the problems and concerns of ordinary Australians facing this dilemma and that is why this regulatory framework is necessary. I am pleased, however, to see in the House today that there has been general support for the provisions of this bill. Australians have every right to expect that insurance agents should be subject to the same arrangements as any other provider of a product to consumers. It wiUbe a great source of security to many Australians to know that consumer credit insurance agents and companies will now be regulated by the Trade Practices Commissio.n and that they will be empowered to investigate unconscionable conduct and to prosecute if necessary. The amendments to this bill will make the Insurance and Superannuation Commission responsible for administering the Insurance Contracts Act 1984. The ISC will now have the power to enforce the provisions of the act and oblige insurers to observe them. The ISC will also be empowered to. ensure that information is supplied by insurers regarding their product. Furthermore, the ISC will be able to impose civil penalties against directors who breach the obligations of the act. The commissioner of the ISC will also have specific powers, including monitoring of complaints, reviewing of documents and figures, monitoring of legal judgments relating to the insurance industry, and promoting education about the objectives and requirements of the act. It is also important to recognise that the insurance industry itself has come some way along to achieve these aims through self-regulation and controls and measures and codes of conduct. However; I do not think that they have been enough, which is why this legislation is necessary today. Interested parties in the industry have had repeated input into the formulation of the amendments in this bill. Obviously, it is not always possible to strike a reasonable consensus between the industry and consumer and there are some disagreements, for example, on the question of whether insurance commissions should be disclosable or not. But I do agree with the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) that a full regime of disclosure, as put forward in this bill, will ultimately lead to the benefit not only of the consumer but of the industry itself as it becomes more efficient and credible in the eyes of the consumer. As I said before, some within the insurance industry view some changes here as unwelcome and unnecessary. But the Trade Practices Commission report did identify the need for the public enforcement of the Insurance Contracts Act of 1984, which was simply not occurring under the voluntary code that was in place. There is a need for meaningful penalties to be introduced to protect the rights of the consumers. These two bills do give effect to the recommendations of the Trade Practices Commission report. The government believes that, if insurers are guilty of precontractual unconscionable conduct, the Trade Practices Commission should be empowered to resolve the dispute, if necessary, in a civil action. The provision of this additional consumer protection will result in some additional supervisory costs being incurred by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. It is estimated that the additional funding required for the rest of this financial year can be absorbed by the current ISC funding. There will, however, be additional costs of around $336,000 each financial year. The general insurance supervisory levy and life insurance supervisory levy will be increased to cover these costs. The ISC expects that the increase will be around $2,000 per annum per insurer. The original purpose of these levies was to cover the cost of the administration of the 1984 Insurance Contracts Act. The increases in the levies will now allow the ISC to continue this role. Extensive research has found that it is necessary to directly enforce the provisions of the act and to provide the consumer with direct protection. The increased administrative costs are necessary to achieve this end. In conclusion, I believe that this legislation will enhance the credibility of the insurance industry. We do not have to be experts on the insurance industry to understand that there is a great degree of scepticism in the general community. For example, we would not need to have extensive qualitative research into the insurance industry, as has been suggested by Mr Tony Abbott, to know that there is a credibility problem there. It has now been recognised by the insurance industry, by the Trade Practices Commission, by the ISC and by the government that there needs to be action in this area. I am also pleased to say that it has been recognised by opposition members. I am pleased to see that they are supporting these measures; it is welcome support for very important legislation to protect the rights of consumers in the insurance industry.",33
11,Mr ELLIOTT,Unknown,"in reply-I want to thank the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Swan) and the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) for their contributions to the debate this morning. The Insurance Laws Amendment Bill (No.2) represents a very important change by providing additional protection and the enforceability provisions relating to the ISC's role. To take up one point that was raised by the honourable member for Curtin, this is being done in a way which is meant not to produce a heavy hand but rather to ensure that there is the appropriate level of consumer protection and consumer confidence in the insurance contracts provisions. I think it will be done in such a way that over time the industry will recognise that these changes are in its interests as well as in the consumers' interests, and it will certainly be working constructively to ensure that happens. The range of disclosure of information that the honourable member for Curtin referred to, in circular No. 304, is clearly a matter that we are going to have continuing consultations about to ensure that we get those provisions adopted in a way that achieves the consumer objectives as well as being helpful to the broader competitive structure of the insurance industry. I think that empowerment of consumers can be only beneficial in that process. With those few words, I commend the bill to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Elliott) read a third time. NA Suspension of Standing Orders",35
12,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"I move: That standing order 217 (day fixed for second reading) be suspended for the remaining sittings this week. As honourable members will be aware, thisis the last sitting week in this period of sittings and after this there will be a six-week before the budget sittings. As is nonnally the case at this time of the parliamentary process, a difficult set of arrangements occurs for managers of government and opposition business as materials flow between the two houses. After these particular sittings this problem will be far more manageable than I can remember for some very considerable time because of the changes to processes that have been put in place. Nevertheless, occasions will arise in the next two days where .bills that have been intf(-duced into and passed through the Senate come into this chamber for consideration. The legislation we will receive from the Senate which we wish to see passed in this sitting involves a number of key bills, including Industrial Relations Amendment Bill, which will provide for the appointment of the President of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, and the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Amendment Bill, which will allow the Inspector-General to· provide information and documents for a judicial inquiry into ASIS. Other bills, includporary, ing a health bill, a transport and communicaparliament tions bill and bills relating to the International War Crimes Tribunal, are all going to if standing orders are confonned to, a day's deliberation prior to their consideration in chamber. In other words, we will receive them on one day and be unable under the standing orders to debate them until the next day. To the government it does not seem that this requirement really needs decent deliberthe ation in this chamber to be sustained. must remember that these are bills which facilitate originated in the Senate. Any bill which originates in the House and is considered and amended by the Senate arid referred back us can be dealt with forthwith under the current standing orders and no suspension for its consideration is needed. However, bills introduced in the Senate do, as I said, and this change to the standing orders deals with that. Those· bills considered in the Senate have already had due deliberation in the opposition processes because by virtue· of their being introduced in the Senate . there was a.. gap . between their introduction and ultimate gap co-ideration by the Senate. The amend-ents that have been moved successfully to them .in the Senate will also be familiar to oppositi()n members who sat in the chamber while those amendments were considered and voted upon. So, whilst it is nonnally considered desirable that we have that day's gap between the introduction of bills here from the Senate and· . ultimate consideration, it really is not neces. sary that this take place for honourable members .to effectively ·infonn themselves, given the urgent requirement upon us to conclude . business by the end of this· week. Therefore, the government is moving this suspension of standing order 217 to make sure the bills that I have referred to and possibly some others can be considered forthwith in this chamber the when they are received from the Senate.",35
13,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"The opposition does not support the suspension of standing order 217. It is an absolute joke that these much heralded new arrangements that were going to give a sleek; modern, conteminto the next millenn·ium tone to this have fallen at the first barrier. This standing order was adopted on only 22 Febrequire, ruary this year-not 1894, 1994. The Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) this comes into this place and says, 'This is terrible. We nonnally would give you a day, but we live in abncinnal circumstances. We want a bill to sort of facilitate the appointment of somebody who belongs to the broad right wing New South Wales· Labor orbit to presidency of the Australian Industrial We Relations Commission'. He expects .us to that! He treats this· House with utter contempt. What he said a moment ago was . quite extraordinary. It was delivered without to a flicker of embarrassment: 'Nonnally we would give you a day to· acquaint yourself with the bill, but that is not really necessary'. Why does the government bother calling the parliament together at aU? It has the numbers. Why does it not getup at the beginning and say, 'We would nonnally allow you to debate things but it does not suit our convenience'. The whip is nodding his head, which is just a measure of how that mob carries on. We have had a lot of debate over the last few weeks about alleged reforms to parliament and I have heard the Leader of the House wax lyrical and long about just how good the place was going to be under these new refonns. What does he do? He says we do not really need a day. He is doing this because it suits the government's convenience to get the parliament up after a derisory sitting of only three days this week. That is why he is doing this. He is doing this because the government is too lazy to have the parliament sit for another couple of weeks. He expects us to just roll over and agree to anything that suits the government's convenience. I think the public want us to spend more time in this place. They are not very impressed with arguments that say that the government wants to whip through a bit of legislation because it suits its convenience. The two pieces of legislation in question are hardly matters of national priority and importtionhad ance. If we were dealing with the welfare of the long-tenn unemployed or if we were trying to do something about poverty stricken families, of which there are hundreds and thousands after 11 years of Labor government, we might be a bit more sympathetic. The government wants us to assent to the Deirdre O'Connor benefit industrial relations bill. It is typical of the adhockery of the government that it makes a change to the standing orders but before the ink is dry wants to amend that change. The government amended the Industrial Relations Act only a few months ago, but before the ink has 'dried and, indeed, before the new bill has come into operation it finds it necessary to change one of the provisions. The government really must be joking if it expects us to roll over to facilitate that. We will not be rolling over that. The government will have to get the numbers in this place if it wants to get that passed. We do not agree with the suspension of standing orders. It is a farce. It proves what a· montage of adhockery the changes to the parliamentary sittings have been. We said that the new parliamentary sitting times were a joke, and the government is demonstrating that. lthink the Australian people areincreasingly seeing them as a joke. The last thing we will agree to is anything that shortens the capacity .of the elected representatives of the Australian people to scrutinise the government's legislation. The Australian people are very suspicious of the government and they are doubly suspicious of its legislation. There will not be any short cuts by the leave of the opposition.",36
14,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"I cannot let those comments go past without comment As far as the Australian public is concerned, the opposition has just had three genuinely lousy by-elections. Mr Costello-Did you like Bonython?",37
15,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"I certainly like it a heck of a lot better than Port Adelaide. The last time there was a by-election in South Australia in these circumstances-and we did end up winning the subsequent election-the opposia 13 per cent swing. I prefer the Bonython result to that; I prefer the result in John Kerin's former seat where we had a below the nonnal average by-election swing; and I certainly prefer our Fremantle result where we had a two per cent-plus swing in our favour. Yes, I quite like the public judgments upon the conduct of the government since the last election. It is very rare that a government in this country has done that well in three by-elections after it has been in office for so long. It certainly compares very favourably with the performance of the British conservative party in by-elections in recent times,. We will settle for those by-election re-ults and public judgments any day of the week. So we will get that out of the way, as it relates directly to a question about what the opposition. on regarded as public tolerance for this government. Tne second point that was made was that these issues are coming into this chamber having had no consideration by the opposition. What a: load of .nonsense! These bills have been sitting around in the Senate for a very considerable period. The opposition has had an. opportunity to scrutinise them in very great detail during the last few weeks. The Senate managed to pass no government legislation last week. So all. these bills have been sitting in the Senate for a very considerable period. If those opposite are incapable of reading those documents during their Senate consideration, in the· opposition party rooms and in committees, that is a judgment upon themselves, not upon the government's conduct of affairs in this chamber. The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) said that these bills are not of sufficient urgency to be considered by the public and that we ought to be putting through bills relating to employment or whatever, as he would consider them to be sufficiently emergent. I remind the honourable member of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Amendment Bill, which allows the provision of information and documents to the judicial inquiry into ASIS. Only a couple of weeks ago, members of the opposition were standing up in this chamber and recoiling in horror that they had no government minister to question on that subject and that it was an urgenf issue which required an immediate judicial inquiry. This matter has also been through the Senate and these documents were provided to those opposite, but yet again those opposite require 24 hours notice for their consideration in this place. Normally, the opposition would get that extra time, but it happens to be the end of the sitting period. So those opposite will be deprived of one day out of three or four weeks of deliberation on these materials that they have already had. We can be absolutely certain that those opposite would not have exerted any more common sense by having an extra day to consider the material which, to this point, it would normally have had. The government's justification for this is eminently sensible. Those opposite have had plenty of time to consider these bills. Normally, this standing order would apply to effectively 80 to 90 per cent of the sitting times in this place. This may provide those opposite with their normal excuse to get up and make a political attack on the government, but I do not think they can be serious in any of the propositions that they put forward.

Second Reading",39
17,Mr LEE,Unknown,"Dobell-Minister for Communications and the Arts and Minister for TourCom- , ism) (12.13 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill will ensure a cc;mtinuation of the government's policy in the area of telecommunications pricing. It will inhibit the development of poteQtial anti-competitive effects of and will strengthen mechanisms for enforcement of that policy. The policy was detailed in the government's statement on telecommunications in November 1990 and, remains an important part of the measures we have adopted to develop a competitive, world-class, consumer oriented telecommunicatIons industry. <' Before addressing the detail of the legislation, it ,is necessary to put the proposed changes in context. In introducing major reforms to the telecommunications sector in 1991, the government paid particular attention to the need for long-term, commercially sustainable competition to develop in a relatively short period of time. The Telecommunications Act 1991 incorporates an integrated package of competitive safeguards designed to ensure that a dominant telecommunications carrier does not abuse its position so as to unfairly restrict the operation of new entrants. The experience with the current regulatory regime has been very positive. Competition between Optus and Telecom in the long distance and international markets means that in real terms today's prices are, on average, some 40 per cent lower in these areas than they were five years ago. Both carriers are facing price and service competition from Vodafone in the digital mobile market, and even in this increasingly competitive environment Telecom has recently declared a record half-y.;arly after tax profit of $997 million. has been able to do so because, as the government expected, competition has not only lowered prices but also driven up demand and has spurred Telstra to improve its efficiency and customer service faster than it lost market share to Optus. As a result, Australia now has a bigger, better, more efficient telecommunications services sector. The achievements are a tribute to the company and its workers. Nonetheless, the act as originally drafted has led to some unintended consequences that now need to be corrected in the light of experience in an increasingly competitive market. This is essentially finetuning of a system that is working well. Purpose of the bill In broad terms, the bill is intended to do two things. Firstly, it will remove any doubt that a dominant carrier can offer certain charging options that would otherwise be discriminatory and hence in breach of the Telecommunications Act. Austel, as the specialist regulator, will have a role in determining whether charging options are discriminatory. Secondly, it will enable Austel to disallow tariffs that materially and adversely affect the development and/or maintenance of commercially sustainable competition. Why the bill is needed It has become increasingly apparent that a number of tariffs introduced by carriers since the advent of competition may breach the anti-discrimination provisions of the Telecommunications Act in a technical but unintended sense. Telecom's flexiplans, providing usagetailored discounts to both residential and business customers for a fee, and strategic partnership agreements, providing large corporate customers with volume discounts, are the most prominent of these, although there are almost certainly others that are affected. It is now also apparent that there is the potential for some carrier pricing practices to have the effect of inhibiting the development of competition in telecommunications. These effects need to be addressed to maintain progress in competition, innovation and customer benefit. The government has conIt sulted extensively with the industry to address this situation so as to ensure that, while the integrity of the package of competitive safeguards embodied in the act is maintained, there is no inadvertent prevention of pricing initiatives that benefit consumers and that are not anti-competitive. This bill achieves these objectives. What the bill does: Exemption from discrimination provisions The act currently prohibits price discrimination by a dominant carrier, except where the discrimination is based on differences in costs. The bill retains the anti-discrimination provision, and recasts the exemptions so that the following types of discriminatory tariffs will be permitted: (a) Those that are generally available; that is, of broad appeal to customers and potential customers. Tariffs under which a service is available to be acquired on the same terms and conditions by major customer groups, such as business customers, residential customers or those in a class of persons determined by Austel will be allowed, but those that are narrowly targeted, in such a way that competition is inhibited or the benefits of competition are narrowly focused, will not. This change will, among other things, effectively permit the majority of existing Telecom flexiplan tariffs. There are currently some 2.3 million flexiplan customers; (b) Those where discrimination-even if narrowly focused-is, in Austel's opinion, justified by differences in the 'carrier's costs. Some Telecom SPAs would be expected to be assessed under this provision. This approach provides significant practical scope for Telecom to demonstrate its commercial case to Austel as to the cost justification of specific tariffs. The amendments will explicitly allow broad network cost savings to be taken into account and will provide considerable flexibility to accommodate the commercial realities of the industry; (c) Those justified by the community interest in promotion of universal access to the standard telephone service. This would include, for example, existing community and pastoral call rates offered by Telecom; and (d) Trial programs, pilot programs and demonstrations, such as Telecom's current trial of calling line identification. Some of these types of tariffs will require Austel to exercise some judgment as to whether they fall within one of the above categories specified in the bill. In view of specialised nature of this area of regulation, and the need for swift action to enable commercial decisions to be made, the government wishes these matters to be dealt with in substance by Austel rather than the courts. Additional pro-competitive measures There is general agreement within the industry that pricing behaviour that adversely affects competition should not be allowed. The government considers that Austel, as the appropriate independent regulatory authority, should have the authority to act to stop such behaviour. This is particularly important for the development of the telecommunications sector, which is still in a transitional phase from monopoly to competition. This form of safety net is a logical complement to the broadening of exemptions from the antidiscrimination prohibition. Accordingly, the bill proposes a new power for Austel to disallow a tariff of a carrier that is in a position to dominate a market if it is anti-competitive. To ensure consistency with the government's overall pro-competitive regulatory framework for telecommunications, an anti-competitive test is defined quite specifically as one that would materially and adversely affect the development and/or maintenance of commercially sustainable competition in a market. This test, which only applies to tariffs of a dominant carrier, is deliberately different from those applicable under the Trade Practices Act. This reflects the still developing nature of competition in telecommunications and the barrier to competition that would otherwise be represented by Telstra's incumbent position. . It should be noted that the new power to disallow anti-competitive tariffs will extend to tariffs that are permitted by virtue of the new discrimination exemptions. That is, a tariff that is exempt from the anti-discrimination provisions, for example because Austel considers the discrimination is cost-related, may still be subject to scrutiny and disallowance because of its anti-competitive effects. Ministerial direction It is important that Austel's proposed new power be exercised in a way that is consisthe tent, and is seen to be consistent, with government policy. The bill enables the minister to give directions to Austel about how it is to perform its functions under the new tariff disallowance provisions. Such a direction will be a disallow able instrument. A draft ministerial direction to Austel has been prepared under this proposed new provision, and I will be seeking leave to table it at the conclusion of this speech. The draft direction: . requires Austel to develop, in consultation with industry, a framework and procedures under which it would exercise its powers; . specifies matters"" that Austel must take into account in deciding whether a tariff should be disallowed, such as assessing the overall effect on the market of the tariff, although this list is not meant to be exhaustive; . . requires Austel to consider whether a tariff is anti-competitive, as defined in the bill,. if specified circumstances exist. I want to draw particular attention to the government's policy on bundling of telecommunications services by a dominant carrier. Bundling occurs where a; tariff contains components of different services, such as uncompetitive basic access and local calls bundled with competitive services such as long distance. It is government policy that a carrier that is in a position to dominate .a market should not be permitted to bundle telecommunications services where. that conduct isanti-competitive. The draft directi()n reqiJires that Austel examine al1bundled tariffs and decide whether they are anticompetitive. It is important to note that the minister will belimited to spelling out policies and principles and will not be able to direct Austel to disallow a particular tariff. Period for examination of tariffs At present Austel has only two days in which to consider a tariff filed with it under the act before the tariff becomes operative. The new arrangement· proposed in the bill is that a tariff for a basic carriage service by a dominant carrier does not come into force before the 15th business day after Austel receives it, or an earlier date if Austel so decides. There are two reasons for this change. The first is to ensure that a dominant carrier does not introduce an anti-competitive tariff and benefit from its effects before Austel has had a reasonable opportunity to consider whether it should be disallowed. The second reason is to give Austel sufficient time, if necessary, to apply all necessary scrutiny, including application of the criteria specified in the ministerial direction. Other matters The bill repeals existing subsection 184(3) of the act because its meaning has been found to be uncertain in practice. The new provisions inserted by the bill clarify the government's policy intentions. None of the measures in the bill displace the operation of the general competition provisi()ns of the . Trade PraCtices Act, and this is made clear in the bill. Implementation· Thepropos-d date of commencement for the amending act is 15 March 1994. This is the date on which the government anno-nced the changes embodied in the bill. This fixed date is desirable to provide certainty to industry, .including carriers and their customers. Austel resources Administering these new provisions will be a significant task fot Austel. It will need to exercise judgment in relation to exemption of tariffs from the anti-discrimination rules; develop a framework for exercising its new tariff disallowance powers; and scrutinise dominant carrier tariffs to determine whether they are anti-competitive. It is critical that Austel be properly resourced, as the success of these measures will largely depend on Austel's ability to administer them. The government will be providing additional funding for Austel in this regard for the period 1993-94 to 1996-97. I should note that Austelhas proved to be a highly successful regulator of an industry that has undergone signific-nt change in a short period of time. It has managed difficult and complex issues such as interconnection and the preselection ballot, as well as provided advice on a. range of special issues, and done so in a professional aTidtimely manner. Consultation with Industry There has been extensive consultation with the telecommunications industry on these proposals. The bill's objectives have general acceptance, and the government considers that bill puts in place w()rkable arrangements to implement its policy. . Further Review The longer term operation· of . the price discrimination provisions of the Telecommunications Act,includingthequestion of consistency with' the general competition policy framework, will be given further consideration as part of the previously foreshadowed review of telecommunications arrangements to apply after 1997. I commend the bill to the House. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill and table the draft ministerial direction to Austel.",39
18,Dr KEMP,Unknown,"I preface my remarks on the Telecommunications Amendment Bill 1994 [No.2] by pointing out that we are debating a bill which has just been introduced into this chamber. This is not one of those bills that the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) was referring to as coming back from the Senate after debate in that chamber. This is a bill which has been freshly introduced into this chamber. The opposition is being asked to immediately debate the bill and to respond to the government's second reading speech. The oppositiori has had the courtesy of viewing a draft-in-confidence, but changes do occur between drafts-in-confidence and bills when they are finally introduced. The fact is that the opposition has just set eyes on the final bill as .it has been presented to this chamber. I have had the opportunity to look at the bill before me while the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) was giving his second reading speech and I have detected no obvious discrepancies between it and the draft-in-confidence version. Mr Lee-There are no changes.",43
19,Dr KEMP,Unknown,"There are no changes to the bill, the minister assures me. I am pleased to have his assurance on the matter. I note that the minister is fairly new to his portfolio but 1 point out that the Australian Telecommunications Users Group referred to this legislation in the December/January 1993-94 issue of Australian Communications. The executive director of the group, Wally Rothwell, wrote: All being well, a very important piece of legislation will have entered the Parliament during November, as an Amendment to the Telecommunications Act 1991. It is now March and the government is seeking to ram the legislation through this place without giving the opposition time to properly scrutinise it. According to Mr Rothwell, the issues dealt with by the bill were raised by the department 'some months ago'. At that time, the Telecommunications Users Group made a submission suggesting some solutions to the problems which this bill seeks to address. In early November 1993, some four months after the time it had made its original submission, the group received a draft bill and two draft ministerial directions and was given four days to comment on it. Despite all this, the bill is only now being introduced into this place; It is appalling that legislation which was prepared essentially in November 1993 is only being introduced in March 1994 with such claims of urgency that it must be debated on the day it is introduced and passed in the current session. This bill amends the Telecommunications Act 1991 to relax prohibitions on price discrimination and set a process under which Austel will be able to test telecommunications for anti-competitive effect. The bill is designed to deal with the apparent illegality of various pricing options introduced by both Telecom and Opt us. The most important··of these have been Telecom's flexiplan schemes and the. strategic partnership arrangements entered into by Telecom customers. At present, litigation is taking place in the Federal Court in which Optus alleges that the flexiplan schemes and the strategic partnership arrangements are illegal under the antidiscrimination provisions of the current act. The bill will not affect that litigation, I understand. Section 183 of the act prohibits Telecom as the dominant carrier in many service markets from price discrimination in those markets against any person. At present, the only exception which exists to this prohibition is when price differences can be justified on a cost basis. It is generally agreed that the intent of the original legislation was not to rule out innovative pricing schemes as such, but certain provisions such as section 184(3), which rules out the bundling of two or more services, appear to do just that. Both Telecom and Optus offer flexiplan-style pricing arguments and neither wishes to see them declared illegal. This said, however,' there has been concern that some Telecom flexiplans bundle services where there is competition, such as STD connection, with services in which Telecom is dominant, such as local calls. It is clear that in such cases only Telecom is in a position to do this and accordingly it could be seen to contravene the legislation. There is ,also some· concern that discounts offered under Telecom's strategic partnership· arrangements with large corporate customers have not been cost justified. The Telecommunications Amendment Bill 1994 will take effect from 15 March this year and attempts to address the problems which have become apparent in relation to pricing policies by the telecommunications carriers by removing the more ambiguous anti-discriminatory provisions from the act and seeks to clarify certain clauses. In addition, it broadens the carriers' rights to price discriminate. The anti-discriminatory provisions of the act are to be extended to include 'legitimate charging options' which are defined as optional pricing packages which are made widely 'available'. In addition, the antibundling provision is to be excised from the act. The opposition will be moving an amendment to clause 6(1) of the bill to clarify, the meaning of the word 'available' in the definition of a legitimate charging option. It is possible for options to be technically widely available yet not possess wide appeal. I notice that in his second reading speech the minister brought these two concepts together, as if somehow or other they were identical. But it is quite possible for an option to be made generally available and yet to have quite a narrow or specialist appeal. The intent of this bill is to allow customers access to packages of wide appeal in an effort to increase competition between carriers. Accordingly, the coalition feels that this clarification is necessary. Under the new provisions, Austel may decide that specified discrimination may be permitted if it can be cost justified,· is in the community interest in terms of the objects of the act, or is desirable on a trial basis. Such decisions may be subsequeniIy revoked if circumstances change or if the information upon which the decision was based was incorrect. Where a carrier is dominant in the market for a particular basic carriage service, Austel will be able to disallow all or part of the new tariff on the grounds that it is anticompetitive. This provision will apply only to Telecom for the foreseeable future and is an entirely new power. The carrier may not implement the tariff for 15 working days after it has posted the tariff with Austel and Austel may disallow it at any time. One··section which is of some concern is that part of clause 15 of the bill which inserts section, 238C. into the act. This section 'will allow the minister to give Austel written directions on how Austel is to perform its . disallowance functions in general terms. The section also states that the minister may not direct .c\ustel to allow or disallow particular tariffs. The opposition has only just received copies of the ministerial direction. The opposition would have appreciated being able to carefully scrutinise the tabled version of the directions prior to the debate. The minister can be assured that any subsequent directions will be monitored closely. If they contravene the procompetitive effect of the legislation, we will certainly move to have them disallowed. The coalition welcomes increased opportunities for competition 'between service providers. While we-along with the Telecommunications Users Group, the telecommunications carriers and other interested parties-would have appreciated a more realistic opportunity to properly scrutinise the bill and the government's proposals, we will not oppose the legislation.",43
20,Mr GRIFFIN,Unknown,"I am pleased to support the Telecommunications Amendment Bill 1994 [No.2], which amends the Telecommunications Act. It is clear that the telecommunications reforms put in place by the government in 1991 have proved successful. Their objective was to improve telecommunications services and to reduce costs to both residential and business consumers. Even in the early stages of competition that we now have, the results have been impressive. There have been significant decreases in prices across the board. Both business and residential customers are benefiting from the changes introduced by this government. For example, the cost of a five-minute call between Sydney and Melbourne at peak rates has fallen by 18.5 per cent to $1.54, and the cest ef a five-minute international call at peak rates. from Australia to. the USA has fallen by 12.7 percent in the 12 menths to. 30 June 1993.. A range ef new services such as digital mebile, mebile data and satellite mobile have been intreduced into. the Australian market. Further infIevatien has been efferedby service providers such as AAP, Infelink Netwerk encouraging Services, Q-Net, SITA and BT Australasia, whicheffer a range ef services, particularly competitien. to. business users. Cempetition has also. resulted in substantial grewth in the telecemmunicatiens market. The carriers generated revenues ef $13 billien in 1992-93 cempared with $12.3 billien the befere. The mebile market grew by approximay mately SOper cent in 1992-93 to. in excess 650,000 users. There are new ever ene millien users. This has all been achieved while centinuing to. improve the access ef erdinary Australians to. the standard telephene service. Austel has reported that Telecem, the universal service provider, is meeting its obligatiens to. previde this standard telephene service at a reasenable price. It is impertant to. remember that the three carriers-Telecem, Optus and cemponent Vedafene-pay cn a pre rata basis to. provide universal.access. Censistent with the, gevernment's ebjec40 tives, Optus and Vedafene are taking their place in the Australian market. rolling eut their netwerks at an estimated capital expenditure ef $6 billien and $500 millien respectively. This is in additien to. $3 billien er so. expenditure prepesed by Telecem each year. Optus is already empleysituation ing ever 2,500 peeple and Vedafene 130 peeple, with these numbers expected to. increase to. 5,000 and 1,000 respectively. Against this background, Telecem is perferming well. Last week, Telecem neunced an after-tax prefit fer the six menths to. December 1993 ef $997 millien. It has recemmended an interim dividend ef $361 millien to. the gevernment. This is a streng perfermance. This bill is aimed at finetuning tery arrangements to ensure that unintended censequences which have been identified relation to pricing matters are corrected. It is , important that the gevernment take this actien to. enable attractive pricing packages which de not hinder the centinued development of competition .. For example, the flexiplans which are used by millions of ordinary residential custemers and provide the type of innevative pricing that the gevernment is will be able to continue, provided that they do not hinder the development of The amendments will aiso 'ensure that community and pasteral call rates, which are lengstanding rates to rural and remete custemers, and other rates, such as peak and off-peak year rates, do not beceme invalid because they be censidered discriminatory. This is an ef effective way to deal with unintended censequences which have arisen frem developments in the market. Briefly, one telecommunications development covered by this bill which has had a positive impact in my electorate is the reachout trials. Reach-out trials looked at flexibility in the size ef local call areas to meet the varying needs ef people fer telephene usage. My electorate ef Cerinella centains a large ef the so\.!th-eastern growth area of Melbourne, particularly the Cranbeurne shire. This area will. grow by semething like per cent in the next three to. feur years and from abeut 100,000 residents to. over 200,000 Beth are in the next 10 years. Cranbourne is partially in the 03 Melbourne telephone zone but also partially in the 059 the telephone zone. That has meant that many residents in Cranbeurne are in a difficult regarding access to. telephene beeks . and in relation to the cest of services. 1'elecom and this gevernment have recegnised those preblems and leoked to see what still can be dene through new technolegy to. anaddress them. Some months ago, I took a delegation from the local shire to. Canberra to discuss these issues with Telecom and the office of the previous minister. They were discussed in some detail. Telecem infermed us ef what it was endeaveuringte de to. the regulaaddress these situatiens. The result is that trials are now. being held in througheut Australia. Telecom custemers in Cranbourne will have the choice of making untimed calls .to anywhere within a 75kilometre radius for a Oat charge of 35c. The charge will apply to all calls within that radius. Wonthaggi, Warragul, Healesville, Kinglake, Werribee and Queenscliff all fall within the 75-kilometre radius. This will be most attractive to Cranbourne residents who make frequent or lengthy calls outside the 059 area but within that 75-kilometre limit. These customers will reap substantial savings and at the same time not have to rush their calls. These new charging options area direct result of the government's communications policies and will give customers greater control over the price they pay. Approximately 11,000 Cranbourne and 4,000 Pakenham Telecom users have been included in the Illarkettrial; along with a number of other metropolitan and outer metropolitan exchanges. It will not stop there. As new technology develops and a continual change in development occurs, there will be even greater flexibility and improved customer service. As the technology increases in its specificity and complexity, it will be possible to identify individual phones and work out zoning areas. It will allow customers the capacity to really tailor their costings to their telephone usage. One thing that needs to be stressed is that before consumers move on to these sorts of systems they should monitor their phone usage to ensure that they choose the most appropriate option. Many people could look at this and say that, on their perception of their telephone usage, this system will be best for them. But only by reviewing the detail of their phone usage on their bills will they be able to establish the best possible system. This and some of the other initiatives that this bill seeks to clarify and ensure will not be subject to court challenge will make sure that we have a better and a more responsive and effective system. I commend the bill to the House.",44
21,Mr TUCKEY,Unknown,"O'Connor) (12.42 p.m.)As usual, the Telecommunications Amendment Bill 1994 [No.2] is quite interesting legislation. If it is cut down to its fundamen:.. tals, it shows that the opposition is again giving the government a helping hand to fix up one of its messes. We are being told that the original legislation did not meet the intention of the parliament. We apparently all knew what we were supposed to be doing, but the original legislation provided to. this House by the government did not meet that intention. It has been sifted through by the legalfraternity, and the government has had to come back here, humiliated, to advise the parliament that it got it wrong again. The first point that I want to make about this legislation is that we· are here doing the government's work for it on a second occasion. It is no wonder that we need a second chamber in this place. We have to regurgitate just about every piece of legislation the government brings here. It cannot get its policies or administration right. Let us hope that the second chamber will at least avoid the log jams of the government's past maladministration. The second point I draw to the attention of the parliament is that, outside of a relatively minor amendment, we are not opposing this legislation. We are again prepared to extend a helping hand to the government. This stands in stark contrast to the rhetoric it sends via aNiMaLS to the press gallery. Members of the media confronted us this morning with the question, 'Isn't it a fact that when the budget comes out you will be the blockers again?'. That particular bit of mythology is not supported by history. As evidenced by the legislation we are dealing with today, roughly 70 per cent of all legislation-this will be highlighted by the second chamber-is not opposed by the coalition. When it comes to blocking, it appears that a relatively small percentage of government proposals or legislation is not supported by the opposition. More importantly, just to address the history of our support or otherwise for this legislation, the coalition does not do these sorts of things. For instance, the coalition did not run a scare campaign when the government chose to start to sell tranches of the Commonwealth Bank, considering its national identity as an institution. Older people, in particular, saw it as a very important financial institution in government ownership. How easy it would ha:Vebeen for the coalition to have run a scare campaign· of the type run during the last election by the Keating Labor Party... There are dozens of examples of the big picture, such as the Commonwealth Bank, where in the interest of the public and' good government we did not oppose what the government proposed. The only reason the government got those major proposals through was that we did not run 'the roiten scare campaign, which the government thinks is such a big joke,' in the pursuit of power as compared to responsibility.",46
22,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Order!' I remind the honourable member for O'Connor that the debate on'this bill has been very narrowly confined to the bill itself. I would ask him to refer to the bill. Mr TUCKEY.:.. - I certainly intend to do that. That is what I am doing in pointing out that we are supporting the legislation. These opportunities have to be taken to remind the parliament that we are supporting the legislation .. We propose a minor amendment. The point I am making is,47
23,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,The point I am making is that the debate on this bill has been very narrow. I request the honourable member for O'Connor to refer to the bill.,47
24,Mr TUCKEY,Unknown,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I believe I am. Most importantly, in stressing our support for this legislation I want to put to bed a lie, an untruth, that is around the parliament this very day: that we oppose for the sake of opposing. This is not supported by our position on this bill; it was not supported by our position on the Commonwealth Bank; it was not supported by our position on micro-economic reform in many areas where the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) struts around saying, 'I did it all myself'. Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank you for your advice on what the legislation is about.· I assure you that I will make some comments on that. 1 hope I will have your indulgence to stress some of the other aspects of the role of Austel, as I see it, and this particular market. The legislation is a response to some of the more competitive actions of government. I argued with the Premier of Western Australia the other day-as I would argue with Telecom and this government, fora very good reason-that it is about time governments stopped the practice' of shipping people from the country into the city and then complaining about the loss of population in the bush. In 'making that point, I said to him, '1 presume you are now bulk 'buying your communications and, therefore, it does not matter, much where you put people in terms of their ability to communicate or the cost thereon' . He said, 'We have a bit of a problem. We have bought one of the$e packages'. The bundling proposals-:-not bungling; that is what. we are dealing with here-were negotiated between Telecom and the state government. of Western Australia. Western Australia has been told that it cannot do it, anymore because there, is currently a case in court. We are fixing ,up that arrangement. It just might be that by then Optus, the competitor, may have got itself sufficiently established in WA to want to compete in that area. That is fairly positive, but I am also'. concerned that Telecom is the dominant carrier and as such would' have an advantage at this point in dealing with a consumer the size of the state government of Western Australia. Having recognised that those sorts of deals to very large customers cannot be lega1\y entered into at the moment, here we are attempting to fix that situation. Civil servants keep telling me that they have to be in St Georges Terrace in my state so they can have meetings with one another and get the economy progressing,. when I know they do not walk.down the corridor to talk to each other; they pick up the telephone. They can equa1\y have useful operating units in my electorate, add something to decentralisation and the lifestyle of other people who are there to earn a living and in that process not be disadvantaged through. communications, either by way of technology or cost. On the one hand, it is it good idea that state governments and others can buy their communications as cheaply as possible. On the other hand, quite clearly, ·if. the competitive system we are establishing is to work, we have to make sure that the little competitors have sufficient business or they will cease to exist and we will get back to the monopoly that we had in the first place. We are looking at ways through this legislation of achieving that. I have not had the opportunity to read the. legislation; I have to work from a summary of what is supposed to be in it because of this bill being ambushed into the parliament. As I understand it, Austel will still have a regulating role so that all of these competitive arrangements can be made but not in an anticompetitive sense. That is to be approved. Let us hope it works. Whilst the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) is in the chamber listening-perhaps he will put forward some arguments in the cabinet from time to timeit is worth noting that this legislation will allow some very big customers to· get some very good deals. Provided these deals are transparent in any business, I think that is a good idea. I have always held the view that we do not do individual deals; we do them on a form. For instance, when I ran a trucking business, we published our rates. They did get lower for big customers, but they were available to anyone who could meet the criteria. If someone gave us regular business of more than 20 tonnes of freight a month, there was a price for it. If someone wanted to send one parcel a month, it was considerably more expensive. But, as long as these deals are transparent and provided everybody can get a bulk buy, I think that is appropriate and proper. Clearly, there are economies of scale for providers. They should be able to seek big customers provided the terms are otherwise equal, which we are trying to do here. The flexiplan systems are, again, open and transparent for little people, which is good. A lot of little people in my electorate cannot get a mobile phone. Why? It is because there are no stations out there to do anything about it. We are being told at the moment that Telecom and Optus are not expanding those networks because there will be a change in technology from analog to digital. There is a bit of a hiatus at the moment. The matter is somewhere between heaven and earth. As a result, no more money is being spent on analog in terms of repeater stations and nobody in my electorate has got around to building the digital stations. This is an interesting point, because I wrote to Telecom a coupJe of years ago when it was running the Chuckie as. There was Chuckie driving around in his four-wheel drive, in areas far more remote, obviously, than my electorate, being handed a mobile phone that worked.. Chuckie was way out from Carnarvon by the look of the terrain. The honourable  House-he is lucky as he has a big city in his electorate and I think mobile phones work there-that he does not have to drive too far out of Bunbury or Albany and all the way to Perth",47
25,Mr TUCKEY,Unknown,"He does, but he does not have the use of his mobile phone. On the other hand, even with phone calls now costing 40c, he will be able to use a telephone box because he has a credit card. He is not as disadvantaged as the people I am talking about. I was reminded throughout the Kelly debate that there was this focus on needs-we know whose needs were being served then. If the government were to ever allocate mobile phones on a needs basis, it would start in my electorate. I can think of no group of business people, be they farmers or those who service them, who have a greater need for that technology. They are never near the phone that is screwed to the wall or sitting on the table; they are somewhere else, be it down at the shed, on the tractor or in a vehicle, either travelling somewhere or providing a service, as businessmen do. In the context of our nation and of giving people a fair go, it is imperative that the issue of mobile phones be addressed. We are changing technology, so let us get on with it. The government should give people in remote areas a break-either give them a satellite or the repeater stations they are entitled to. I do not think they should be left out because, as I said, their need .is greater than that of a typical metropolitan· businessman who is never more than a minute away from a telephone and therefore requires less advanced technology. I make that argument for the people in my electorate. I have gone as far as to say-and I guess this legislation could be relevant-that if country people, such as people in Wongan Hills, who are extremely interested, are not going to get a deal on just mobile phones they will have to sit down with their local authorities and say, 'Okay, we are going to farm out as one single contract our entire telecommunications for our shire'. They might be able to go to Optus and Telecom and say, 'If we give you all our hardline stuff, what is the price and, of course, will the deal include mobile phones?'. I see nothing wrong with that and I am recommending It to the people in my electorate because it seems that they are going to have to play hard ball to get something they need. I guess the minister would agree that the present position is getting interesting. It is not going to be much longer before people will not be writing to politicians about their telephone services because we will have no control over them. It will not be a case anymore of talking to the government instrumentality; the government will sell Telecom, which will then have to cope out there in the real world of business. People will have to do the deals that we do with other providers and say to Telecom, 'I'm sorry, mate, I'm no longer satisfied with your service. I'm moving to the competition'. I think that will be healthy. This attitude is probably disappointing. I have always said that, if someone asked me to change the tax law, it would be a bit of a worry. However, if someone's phone will not work, I know I can make a friend. I made an art form of it in the early days of my election to parliament. I want to repeat this interesting point: although through this legislation we are allowing more big deals to be made with big customers, there is a group of Australians not very far from most capital cities who cannot use mobile phones. Something has to be done about it. It should be done even in the context of this legislation because the accent is on more competition. I think some of those people should be encouraged, working through local government, to try to sell off the district phone calls. There would not be a shire in my electorate in which the total business is done on wire and which is getting into faxes and all these sorts of things that would not be very attractive to, say, Optus if Telecom did not want to get on with the job of giving these people a service that they expect. In the three minutes remaining to me, I want to make the point that, while Austel is looking at these other matters and using the powers we have given it, a very grievous breach of faith has just occurred in rural Australia; that is, the splitting up of the country telephone directories-despite censiderable opposition from people in country areas. Country people were guaranteed that extra copies of directories, be they for adjoining areas or areas further away, would be free. Telecom is now charging 80c a copy and a $5 administration fee. People can get as many copies as they like for $5. The administration fee applies only once, but the 80c applies to each book. I find that a great breach of faith, because people did not want their directories to be split up as they were. It was done only to guarantee additional Yellow Pages sales. People are now having that promise broken. It might be worth putting on the record, for people who do not understand, that there is a solution: do not buy the directory; ring 013 and let Telecom provide the service free of charge. The opposition, as I have explained, is not opposing this legislation. It is a pity that it could not have been thought through properly in the first place, but I guess that if people do not come from a business background they frequently do not notice what the problems of this nature are, and that is a pity. But my own view is that the changes seem to be for the better and as such should be supported, although I also, of course, support the amendment that will be moved by the opposition, which is aimed at clarifying the word 'available' by changing the wording to 'available and of broad appeal'. I think that is quite sensible, and I think the government would be wise to take our advice on this issue. If it does not and it does not accept that rather simple amendment, the bill will be back here in a year or so and we will be trying to patch up this particular problem which the opposition has done the government the· favour of pointing out to it. We are called 'blockers', but frequently all we are doing is saying that if the government does not change legislation it will be back - here. Time and time again we are proved to be right. . I thank the House for its time, and I sincerely hope that the minister responds in regard. to the availability of mobile phones under the new regime. and what competition there will be in that area.  very pleased to speak in this debate on the Telecommunications Amendment Bill 1994 [No.2]. I think it is fair to say that the ourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) usually does not make a contribution in the House without drawing a response or two from people on this side. Without wanting to incur your wrath, Mr Deputy Speaker, I shall very quickly run through a couple of' the things that he raised. The people of Australia should note that, according to the honourable member, their vote in the last election in rejecting a GST was not a carefully thought out action but was merely a response to what was allegedly a scare campaign. I think this is a very disturbing thing for the public of Australia to understand: the opposition, and particularly shadow ministers, are still as strong about the necessity for a GST for Australia as they were at the last election.",48
26,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable member should confine his remarks to the bill.  allow the honourable member to wander a little longer than you are giving me indulgence to, and I was going to make only one more point about the bipartisan thing. I might return to it later. I find it very interesting that when the honourable member for O'Connor talks about community' service obligations he is really talking about the attempt by the public carrier to try to ensure that rural and provincial Australians have access to adequate communication services that are clearly loss making. In fact, when this stuff was going through. in 1991, the shadow minister, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp),was really arguing very strongly that CSOs'should be put· on the budget and that inevitably these things, whether we had a Liberal or a Labor government"" wOl,1ldbe cut. I find. it, very curious that he is now raising this matter. I want to warn the good ratepayers of Wongan Hills Shire that the proposal to let Telecom off the hook was something' that was very near and dear to the department at the - ime. It was suggesting that, where the department . or Austel was not convinced, there should be a bidding process for various areas, . and Telecom .could bid and anyone else could bid. However; the real point is that Telecom is honbeing let off the hook from paying for the services to be provided. In other words, it would be a financially attracti vcsituation for the dominant carrier Telecom or for Telstra not to provide the services it is currently providing· to rural and provincial Australia. The real losers would be the very people for whom the honourable member for O'Connor, quite rightly, wants to provide a better service .. . . Does the honourable memb-r really believe that a shire would be able to .acquire. gratis that part of the network that is operating in Wongan Hills? That is very foolish, even for someone with the business experience that the honourable member for O'Connor constantly reminds us he has. It was a proposal that was bitterly resisted at the time, nptwithstanding the fact that it was advocated quite strongly by the department. I' think the honourable member ought to try to immerse himself in a little more detail so that he better understands the point. We ,have to get away from thinking of community service obligations in traditional terms. Let us use a few cliches. In this day and age, people are going to be either information rich or information poor. A lot of that information is going to be provided by the superhighway, which effectively will be a communications highway. While,we used to think of meeting community services obligation through an ordinary telephone service, we are now depriving people in rural andprovincial Australia if we do not think about providing the facilities that are required to ensure that all .people have equal access to the superhighway. They currently do not have it. There are electorates in the metropolitan area, such as my own, where-notwithstand­ ing the extraordinarily high penetration rates of . ordinary services-people do not have access to these services, much less the enhanced facilities. This is an area not only of communications policy but also of social policy which we could all benefit from taking a closer look at. I make no apologies for having an interest in this, because I have always been conscious-even though I am a member of a metropolitan electorate-of the disadvantages that rural and provincial areas of Australia suffer. To return to the Telecommunications Amendment Bill [No.2], which did not occupy a lot of the time of the honourable member for O'Connor, I want to place on the' record the fact that members of this House should record their appreciation that the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) is the first minister to honour a commitment to do something about this. It is nice to have the words; it is even better to have the action. Why are we doing it? Ironically, when competition is introduced, particularly case of telecommunications, it is actually necessary to provide more regulations if sustainable competition is what is wanted. That was the case with the 1991 reforms. Even then, it is not always possible to get it 100 per cent right. I think this bill acknowledges the finetuning that is required. Mr Lee-And the market forces.  minister points out. However, with competition, not only are there lower prices-and I think we have had a full measure of that through the competition that has been introduced by the government-but, similar to what has happened in banking, different product packages are developed. That is exactly what has happened in the communications area. This is the precise area that the is operating in-in response to pricing packages for products that were not available to customers prior to 1991. As the minister said in his second reading speech, the act currently prohibits price discrimination by a dominant carrier, except where the discrimination is based on differences· in costs. This will allow for a wider number of exemptions. I will not go through it but I am sure we have all seen the advertising, for example, for flexiplans that Telstra offers. This is an example that would be included under these exemptions. Therefore, I think the exemptions ought to be supported. The minister has also. introduced a safeguard in the bill to ensure that this set of exemptions does not lead to anti-competitive behaviour-that is, a situation where a dominant carrier, say Telstra, widens the exemptions permitted for these different pricing packages that have proved to be very popular and that have been referred to by opposition members. Where a new package can be seen to be anti-competitive, the bill provides for Austel to have powers to deal with it. I am pleased to see that the minister still has some say and, in fact, has tabled his draft instructions. I think we need to point out to the House the most important feature of the minister's approach, which I totally support: Austel is not to develop this in isolation; it is to develop it in consultation with all members in the of the industry. I want to make another point about the reform packages. I guess I am returning to the CSO issue. At the time of the reform, one of the key elements that members of the government saw as absolutely critical, and that in a sense convinced the government to get on board the reform package, was the fact that the government would have an independent inquiry into the deregulation process. After the government has introduced path-breaking reforms, I do not think that members of the government should be in any way embarrassed to get the old thermometer out to check how well those reforms have performed in different areas. That independent review was supposed to look at industry policy. Again, I remind the House that we introbill duced competition not only to get sustainable competition but more particularly to ensure our fair share of exports both in the manufacturing area and in the services area. In fact, an ambitious $2 billion target was set. I find a little ironic now that some people are suggesting that achieving $2 billion by 1996 is somewhat conservative. It certainly was ambitious in 1991. Look at the way the industry equation is working. In particular, look at the way ordinary consumers are operating. I think it is important. that we not forget about Mr and Mrs Average. Look at how CSOs are performing underthe new the House. deregulated regime, look at how Austelis performing and then look to 1997. Certainly the government has a stated policy objective about what is to occur post-1997. Do we to modify that in any way in the light of experience as a result of this inquiry? I bitterly and deeply regret that it is the department that is undertaking this review. This is no independent review. There are people that industry can look to, that consumclauses. ers can look to or that caucus can look to undertake this review. It is to be the department, ment. Whether or not we agree with the department, throughout the debate it took very partisan, ideological view review. I know these decisions were taken well before the present minister assumeq his important responsibilities. I ask opposition members as well as government members: to what harm is there in having a review done by people we respect and whose decision can accept as the decision of the referee the umpire? I am sure that for a whole range of things the review will say we have. got right. By and large, this reform process and explilnatory memorandum.' model is being touted as an approach over. seas. I am sure. that, despite the best will the world, there will be some things that have not done as well as we would' have liked. That will give us an opportunity for further finetuning, particularly when we on the brave new world of 1997. Again, I want to say that I strongly support this legislation. I am very pleased to be here supporting the minister. It is good to see that he has actually done what others have said that they would do. I think that this legislation is in the best interests not only of many very a month. large customers of Telstra but also of many smaller customers and small businesses that it have taken advantage of different packages which are'now on offer but which were.not on offer prior to competition. This is not a bill about the failure of competition. This is a bill about the success of competition, and about ensuring that our competitive environment in communications in Australia condo tinues to grow and to serve the nation, our industry. and the people of Australia. I thank",50
27,Mr LEE,Unknown,"Dobell;.....Minister for Communications and the Arts and Minister for Tourism) (1.16 p.m.)-in reply-I thank all honneed ourablemembers on both sides of the House for their contributions during this debate on the TelecommuniCations Amendment Bill 1994 [No.2] .. I will start by responding to the opposition's foreshadowed amendment, which no seeks to insert certain words in one of the The governmenFs concern is that, if to we were to agree to the opposition's amend that might not remove the uncertainty that we are concerned about., Our worry a would be that it might generate more uncerabout the tainty rather than remove it. The honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) mentioned in his speech some of the comments that I made about this very issue in my speech, about the way that we have tried deal with this question about being generally available, and the appeal of particular we tariffs. An example given in.my speech tried or to address this. We believe that we have covered it adequately and with some clarity. it I also draw the attention of the House to the . The last thing we would want is for s-me in people to argue that, if the opposition's we amendment were successful, some particular tariffs could be in doubt. Let us focus on just one small. area of the market: small business. take At the moment, small businesses can choose between a package called business circlewhich gives them certain discounts for a fee of 11 dollar per month:-and a second available package called business saver a.t $50 a month. Or there is .corporate flexiplan No.1, at $65 amonth; or corporate nexiplan No.2, at $100 . I would not want us to be in a situation where the lawyers were trying to argue that one of these plans was not of broad appeal and was therefore in some legal doubt. sure the honourable member for Goldstein would not want the businesses that get benefits of these particular tariffs to some doubt-nor would he want Telecom be in some doubt and therefore withdraw tariff-becauSe of some concern about whethprotect er or not it met the definition of broad appeal. The government shares the opposition's concern that we want to make sure that. are creating the right competitive environdifficulties ment. The way that we have sought to address that is, firstly, in the words that I have in my speech, which the honourable member for Goldstein referred to; and, secondly, proposed section 238A, which says that, if a cations. tariff materially and adversely affects the development or maintenance of commercially sustainable competition, then it can be struck down by Austel. That is the safety net that have introduced to ensure that we are addressthe ing the issues that the honourable member for Goldstein has raised. Notwithstanding the government's differ'j ence of opinion with the opposition on the SPAs. proposed amendment, I would like to thank the honourable member for Goldstein, House and Senator Alston, who is the tion spokesman on communications, for giving this issue the attention that it deserves, and for approaching the issue in a sensible way. Despite some of the comments by the opposition about its being unhappy with the timetable which we have worked to, we didto as I think the honourable member for there Goldstein conceded-provide the opposition with the draft bill last week, once it was through cabinet. The shadow minister, the honourable memfriends. ber for Goldstein, referred to some comments made by ATUG-I think he mentioned that it was in a December or January edition of magazine-to the effect that ATUG had seen the draft legislation and that it was expected to be introduced in November. The honourbundling able member for Goldstein therefore had some criticisms of the government and perhaps of me as the minister for the fact that, though the legislation had been foreshadowed in November, it was now appearing in the House only just before tL'eak. The reason the legislation did not appear in I am November is that this package is different from the proposals which were around in the November. The former minister for communihave cations, the current Minister for Resources to (Mr Beddall), announced in September that the the government would be legislating to flexiplans that were generally available. Yes, those amendments are included in this package, but it was not until late last year we that the industry advised the government of with SPAs, the strategic partnership agreements, and that required quite used lengthy and detailed consultation not only with Telecom but quite rightly with Optus, in Austel and other stakeholders in telecommuniThat is the reason that legislation which may have been provided for discussion with we industry in November is very different from legislation before the House today. One clear example is the provision for Austel to be the forum in which decisions are made about the cost justification of packages such as I also noted the concern of the shadow the minister, the honourable member for opposiGoldstein about the removal of section 184(3). His concern was that that was an antibundling provision, and that removal of that provision would raise concerns in the opposition's mind about the impact of competition. Section 184(3) was inserted in the act protect resellers, and our concern is that 'is some legal advice indicating that the meaning is very uncertain and it may invalidate some very desirable tariffs, including the most common of the flexiplans, family and The opposition claims that this is an antiits bl.lndling provision, but it was never intended to be one. The government's policy in relation to bundling is made clear in the package: is to be prohibited if Austel considers that it has an anti-competitive effect; even and the proposed ministerial directions spealcifically require Austel to examine bundled tariffs. So I hope in that way we are addressing that issue which has been raised by the shadow minister. The honourable member for Goldstein also expressed concern about section 238C, which gives the minister power to direct Austel in relation to its disalJowance powers, and he was concerned that the opposition had not seen the draft direction until I tabled it in House this morning. I should remind the House that it is still a draft direction on which it is a fact that the industry has been consulted, but it remains a draft. The direction will not be final until the legislation is by both houses and given assent, and the direction. remains a disallowable instrument. So at some time in the future when the final direction is issued, if the opposition has a difficulty with the final direction, it could seek to have it debated in either house of the parliament since it is a disallowable instrument. The honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), with a little bit of rhetoric, accused the government of not getting its policies right and said that the fact that we were moving amendments to the Telecommunications Act was evidence that the government's initial policy was wrong. I simply make the point that this legislation ensures that the original policy stands. We are amending the law to ensure that the government's policy allows for the development of greater competition in telecommunications. The honourable member went on to express some concerns about the availability of mobile phones in his own electorate. I would make the point that we have had a dramatic increase in the number of Australians who are using mobile phones-from 650,000 in 199293 to over one miIIion users today. Mr Deputy Speaker, I am not sure whether you are one of the users",52
28,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,I cannot be drawn into the debate!,54
29,Mr LEE,Unknown,"Over one miIIion Australians now have access to and use mobile phones. The three carriers are rolling out their digital networks but they have not stopped investing in the analog system. I am sure that there will be continuing growth in the numb-r of Australians with analog mobile phones and a continuing investment by Telecom in this area for some time to come. The answer to the honourable member for O'Connor may be a new telephone package which may be available through Optus in the not too distant future which .provides for mobile telephony to be provided through the Aussat, through the satellite system. It will not be cheap because it will have to recover the costs of using the spectrum concerned but I do know that Optus has been working on a mobile telephone system that could be used passed by a farmer who was driving in the remote parts of the honourable member's electorate. Finally, concerning the comments made by the honourable member for Chilley (Mr Price), I note that he and his family have a very keen interest in telecommunications matters. He was very kind in his comments towards me but I would make the point that the Minister for Resources initiated the government's action in this area with his press release in September last year. And as I mentioned, until the issues were raised with the government about strategic partnership agreements it had been intended that legislation would be finalised in November last year. With those comments I thank all honourable members for the constructive,comments that they have made in this debate. I would explain to opposition members that after giving due consideration to their proposed amendment we are unable to accept it at this time. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail BiII-by leave-taken as a whole.",54
30,Dr KEMP,Unknown,"I draw the House's attention to the fact that we have precisely two minutes to consider the biIl as a whole in detail. I have to say that the very long response of the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) to the debate has again prevented the opposition from exercising its normal right to present its views to the House in a way which fulJy expresses our concerns. In response to the minister I say that it is the opposition's view that the philosophy of this legislation is very much about competition. We are concerned that where packages may be 'generally available there may nevertheless bean opportunity for a dominant carrier to .offer a package to a quite specialised group within' the industry because the package, although generally available, does not have wide appeal. . It is because of our concern that the philosophy of competition be reflected in current legislation-and that is not as much as it should be in our view but in so far as it is that we believe this bill should reflect that philosophy. It does not do so and, consequently, I move: Clause 6, page 3, line 2, proposed subsection 185 (2C), omit ""available"", substitute ""available, broad appeal,"". Amendment negatived: Bill agreed to.

Forestell Securities (Australia) Pty Ltd Australian Cattlefacts Not-for-profit Nursing Homes",54
31,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,Unknown,"The old saying 'you cannot see the forest for the trees' was never more appropriate than in the current situation regarding pine forests and the company Forestell Securities (Australia) Ply Ltd, now in liquidation. The rellfforestation scandal has been the subject of items on the 7.30 Report and on The Investi. gators last night, and of at least one major comment in the Sydney Morning Herald. From information available, over 5,000 investors from around Australia have paid $25 million for licences to secure pine and pistachio forests, strawberry farms, freshwater lobster farms and various other enterprises in the Forestell chain, only to now find that the company is in liquidation and that the National Bankmay, even at this stage, have entered into possession of the land as mortgagees. It is difficult to understand in a society so highly regulated by this government, and given the powers of the Australian Securities Commission, that this situation was allowed to develop at all. The present deterioration in the position of the company reflects badly on this government, its regulators and the bankers. The end result is that 5,000 investing Australians are holding the can for the ineptitude ·of all those I have named. Over 50 of those investors come from in and around my and of own city of Mackay, and it was one of them, Mr Aldo Rover, who, when in Canberra and wanting to view his investment, was told that Tumbarumba had been sold; that the buyer company, Forestell, was in liquidation; and that the land was mortgaged to the bank. All this time there was no report to investors, and many were still paying off their management fees in instalments to the same bank that had-unknown to the investors-lent money on their security. Let us look at some of the facts that come from the reports. Firstly, the investors in Tumbarumba are typical. A glossy prospectus, apparently approved under the Australian Securities Commission guidelines, promised 1,000 per cent return on money invested. Some prospectuses issued by the group were deliberately. misleading in that loans from a group, Equus, were not mentioned. The investors were never fully consulted by report. Secondly, the Australian Securities Commission did nothing in this matter of prospectuses or about the fact that it was .aware of the failures of many of Forestell's other schemes. Thirdly, while what the National Australia Bank did in securing by mortgage the former Tumbarumba land on an original loan of $850,OOO-which has now blown out to $l.5 million-might be said to be normal banking practice, that bank must have been aware of the prior right of licence holders of timber on that land to secure their interests. I would have thought it prudent business for a bank aware of these licences not to make a loan unless it had the knowledge and approval of the investor licence holders. Lastly, the government and the Attorney General (Mr Lavarch) are aware of the deficiencies in legislation and the deficiencies of the government's corporate watchdog. The government also must in some way be responsible. While Forestell is in the hands of the liquidators and, on my understanding, the land is in the hands of the bank, and other companies have an interest in the split-up of the assets, I believe there is a way through this if reason and justice are to prevail; that is, while it is acknowledged that the investors do not own the land but have licences over the timber on it, an opportunity should be given for them to protect their asset by having the opportunity of acquiring the land. In no way should their rights be compromised by a sale of land that does not recognise those rights and licences. Five thousand small investing Australian battlers deserve better treatment than this. I believe this Attorney-General and this government can ensure that better treatment, and appropriate action against those who neglected their responsibilities and those who deceived their investors. There is a second matter I wish to address, concerning correspondence between a constituent of mine, Mr Brian Heme of Australian Cattlefacts, and the then Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the present Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean). Letters of 23 September 1993 and 7 December 1993 from Mr Heme to the minister have not· yet received any official response. Although I realise that the ministerial portfolio has now been transferred to Senator Bob Collins, it does little to recommend the efficiency of this department to realise that the originating letter is now over six months old. Mr Heme, the constituent, formerly published a magazine, Australian Livestock and Property. In one of its articles, of May-June 1991, there was heavy criticism of Ausmeat and its blunder for continuing with butt profile. The major critic of that system, according to the article, was Dr Ray Johnson, an internationally recognised meat specialist. Since then, and with the backing of local graziers-there have been no government supporting funds for this project- Mr Heme has researched and developed a system, Cattlefacts Market Intelligence, and has on repeated occasions explained the system to the Cattle Council of Australia, the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation, the Cattlemen's Union, the Australian Graziers Association, ABARE, Ausmeat and many others that he thought should be interested. But the latest information is that the Meat Research Council is· to use research funds to implement Cattlefacts under another name. It intends. to reinvent the Cattlefacts wheel but there has been no invitation to Mr Heme to assist, research or tender for the program in any way. - With this background, I now go back to the letter to the then minister of 23 September, which made substaritial claims. I will read from the first two paragraphs of that letter. It says: It has been brought to my attention that individuals in the Cattle Council of Australia appear to have acted corruptly either alone or in collusion with others, in that they have stolen a private commercial cattle marketing strategy called Australian II CattIefacts"" from myself and cattlemen I represent, and are offering it to the .cattleindustry as their own and seeking industry funding to research, develop and implement it. I am requeSting, on advice from the Trade Practices Commission and others, that you immediately take measures to stop progress of this theft and deception and that you instigate a full police inquiry into the circumstances, the organisations and the individuals who appear to be involved. These are substantial claims. I am advised that the marketing scheme, Cattlefacts, or any of its equivalents can only be properly managed and serviced through private sources. A government agency would not have the respect or quality or the disciplines of a private agency and this is borne out by the inadequacies and high costs of services carried out by various quangos already in meat inspection and assessments, and by the quality of some of those quangos' market research. In spite of this, the Meat Research Council will insist on spending taxpayers' dollars to run a program identical to Cattlt-facts. The advice of the Trade Practices Commission that was sought _and given is relevant, namely, that the minister take steps to stop progress of this theft and deception and that a full police inquiry into all the circumstances and organisations and individuals concerned be implemented. The last matter I wish to address is a letter of complaint I received. The letter was addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) as minister for the aged. The letter was under the signature of the administration officer of a not-for-profit nursing home in my electorate and bears out complaints I have-had from other constituent not-for-profit nursing homes. I wish to read relevant extracts from the letter. The letter says: In June of 1993 Commonwealth Nursing Officers · .. visited our Nursing Home as the RCI Review team. This team detennined that sixteen (16) of our residents were to be de-categorised because of insufficient d<><:umentation · . . they were not prepared, nor had the flexibility or desire, to change their assessment because the correct fonns were not used to support the initial category. . Specifically, this documentation related to flow charts and care plans for which we had no prior direction or knowledge. The letter continues: · . . your department can drop the category of any resident by only one category, but we are unable to apply to have the residents category upgraded unless we can justify an increase of two categories. This regulation is unjust, and impossible to achieve, as your department chooses who they will assess. The letter further continues: We were even accused of not understanding the funding system of CAM, nor being able to control it. Our understanding of it is enough to know that it is unjust and biased. We sent a letter of complaint to the Manager of that office dated 20 December, 1993 and his reply of 23 February, 1994 bluntly infonns us that, because we did not appeal, that the decisions of the RCI review are confinned and cannot now be contested. It appears quite clearly that the priority of your department is in withdrawing financial support wherever possible for our aged in Nursing Homes, than over the care and concern of their needs and dignity. Recently, we had the same RCI Review team visit our 'Home' and de-categorised four more of our residents . . . one reason for his category to be lowered was because he could not put on his own pajamas. In a sense he can do this, but when he puts two legs into the one section, or tries to wear his bottoms as a top, then do we leave him like that, allowing him the freedom, or do we assist in dressing? Sir, we strongly request an urgent review of the regulations and guidelines of the Resident Classification Categories. We consider the present system unfair, unjust and biased against the philosophies and principles of the Nursing Home, and the needs and dignity of the residents .... It goes on: . . . we extend to you an invitation to visit our 'Home' so that you may familiarise yourself with the difficulties we encounter, especially after reviews from an RCI team that is biased, inflexible and unhelpful. This complaint has much in common with many other complaints. In the 3 112 years that I was the shadow minister for aged care, I was repeatedly told of similar aggressive and uncompromising _bully tactics used by the departmental officers - The complaints in this letter are typical of the complaints I have heard and they should be put on the record. More particularly, it should be realised that almost 100 per cent of nursing homes are caring places. They provide a necessary community service for the aged, and attention needs to be drawn to this matter. (TIme expired) World Summit on Social Development",55
32,Mr LANGMORE,Unknown,"It is commonly remarked that members of the community often feel a sense of alienation from the political process. People in many countries have lost confidence in the capacity of governments to cope well with current trends. However, there are many activities of government which give people cause for hope. I want to report on one of those; that is; the United Nations is going to hold the World Summit on Social Development in Copenhagen in March next year. The Australian government strongly supports the holding of that conference. Many people are experiencing an increased sense of anxiety about social trends. High unemployment is causing loss of capacity for self-reliance, as well as loss of dignity amongst theunemp]oyed. Sickness, family breakdown, substance abuse and even suicide can be. consequences of unemployment. Unemployment is also the principal cause ,of poverty. Conflict within families and family breakdown are commonplace. Violence in homes and communities is widespread. In many countries, ethnic violel'\ce is increasing. Inequity is growing and gender discrimination persists. Minorities, such as Aborigines and recent migrants, commonly continue to feel excluded. All these factors are contributing to a generalised sense of insecurity and uncertainty. There are many causes of these characteristics of societies, but one which is receiving increasing recognition is the neglect of the social consequence of narrowly focused economic strategies. In many countries there has been a preoccupation with economic growth in ways which have involved neglecting the impact on communities and individuals and the environment. Recognition of these problems has led the United Nations to decide to hold a world summit on social development next year. As the United Nations is a gathering of all nations, it reflects the attitudes of existing governments. This summit is going to be a landmark in social development policy. The three core issues to be discussed at the confergrowth ence go to the heart of the causes of anxiety which many people are experiencing. The three core issues are: ways of aiming to increase productive employment; ways of alleviating and reducing poverty; and ways of enhancing social integration, particularly of disadvantaged and marginal groups. At the beginning of February, the first preparatory conference for the world summit was held in New York. I attended that conference as part of the Australian delegation. That conference decided to add two major themes to the discussion, thus making a total of five core issues. The fourth issue is an enabling economic environment: the importance of economic policies, of economic development which will allow progress towards creation of employment, creation of greater security of income, so that poverty is reduced and social integration is strengthened. The fifth issue was discussion of the structures alld policies of the United Nations system and the internationalfinancial institutions which are part of the UN system, such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. Participants in the first preparatory commit'tee recognised that the seriousness· of .current social problems requ-res the development of a new common vision for the future of humankind in which partnership and the search for the common good link with social devel;. opment, improved living conditions and the resolution of all forms of conflict. The aim of increasing human security is .a striking and succinct way. of expressing those goals. Human security is what most people in the community fundamentally want. The central focus for the summit is to be the recognition that economic development is only a means to an end, not an end in itself; that development must be people centred so that human security, freedom and justice become the principal goals of' societies, governments and the international community; that social and economic development are entirely interdependent - social development cannot be left until the end of the process of economic development but each has to occur simultaneously; and that improvements in equity must receive as much attention as of efficiency. Commonly it is said by narrow economists that we have to concentrate on efficiency and lel.lve equity till later, but there are many policies and many ways of approaching economic strategies which ensure that improvements in equity and efficiency can be achieved simultaneously. . An ethical perspective on human affairs is necessary, where dialogue and tolerance replace violence, where human dignity is the central value and the spiritual and cultural aspects of the human condition are encouraged harmoniously with the material in a context of good government. The urgency of addressing the core issues must be obvious to everyone. It must also be clear that they are interdependent. I shall deal with employment first. Nothing increases poverty ordaQ1ages social cohesion more powerfully than unemployment. Lack of opportunity to work is the principal cause of crime· and street violence. The first requirement for an effective strategy to achieve opportunities for work for all who want it is the commitment to the goal of full employment. National governments must adopt policies which concentrate on expanding employment opportunities. This would be more feasible in an encouraging global economic environment. The Detroit summit of the G7-which was held the week before last and about which the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) spoke to the House yesterday in question time-is avery important symbol of the change in attitude, with the emphasis now being given by' all major countries, including Australia of course, to growth of employment. One of the achievements of the Australian delegation to the first preparatory conference was to encourage the summit secretariat to commission a paper which will discuss ways of increasing international cooperation so as to stimulate growth of employment. If all major industrialised countries simultaneously adopted more expansionary macro-economic policies, this would be mutually reinforcing, as the exports of all would rise, so avoiding the danger of increasing current account deficits. The second theme is about poverty. Reduction of poverty also requires both national and international action. For example, in all countries, improvements to education and training are vital. As John Kenneth Galbraith wrote recently: There is in our time no we11-educated, literate population that is poor, and there is no illiterate that is other than poor. So it is vital to build up education and training everywhere. Vital too is the provision of basic infrastructures such as transport, clean water and community health services. They are central, straightforward goals that many developing countries are now adopting. We must encourage all such countries to adopt them and help with resources so they can achieve their goals. Another requirement for the reduction of poverty is ready access to credit, so that people with the initiative to start small businesses can get access to the capital to enable them to do so. Another, of course, is the importance of land reform in many developing countries because agricultural poverty is one of the major problems in many of them. These are some of the policies which will empower'the poor. The third goal is social integration, which can be enhanced by attempting to ensure equality of opportunity through, for example, equity of access to all community services. Central to that too is the universal availability of education. So there are many policies which we in Australia can adopt, which we can advocate at the international level and which will be the subject of this important su-mit. I look forward to reporting to the House in due course on the developments in planning for the summit. Women: Representation in Cabinet",57
33,Mrs SULLIVAN,Unknown,"Moncrieff) (1.50 p.m.)Political women were right to be angry when, as was reported in our daily newspapers, Prime Minister Keating recently dealt flippantly with the issue of cabinet representation of women during a caucus meeting. We are informed that when questioned by one of his own female backbenchers regarding designating a high profile minister as 'Assisting the Prime Minister on the Status of Women' following the resignation of the honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Kelly) from cabinet and the ministry, he gave a silly reply about British MPs-apparently referring to the bizarre death of a member of the House of Commons. The import of his answer was that if he put on a skirt then-in the United one Kingdom, at least-he could adequately fulfil this role. The dismissive, degrading and derisory nature of the statement angered many women including those in his own party. This Prime Minister has got off altogether too lightly on the subject of the standing that he has accorded women, both within parliament and outside. Posing as a drag queen will not give him any greater insight or credibility regarding the particular challenges facing Australian women today. Twenty-four hours later he tried to dress up his response as antisexist. However, he cannot escape the fact that his leadership of the Labor Party has not given him the necessary credentials to get away with such an outrageous response. The issue is not whether or not the job of the honourable member for Canberra should be taken over by a woman minister, it is that Paul Keating. cannot credibly take it on. He reveals that whenever he speaks-other than to a prepared script-and there is no better example of it than his caucus faux ·pas. The matter of his attitudes--as expressed his government's policy-towards Australian women is something that time will not permit me to deal with today. It will be the subject of many debates in the life of this parliament, I am sure. The issue that I wish to pick up is that of the present political status of women in this parliament, and particularly as it has been treated by the parliamentary Labor Party. This week has seen the swearing in of a new woman member of the House of Representatives-the former Western Australian Premier, Carmen Lawrence. I welcome the election of a woman of Dr Lawrence's status and wish her well in her time in this place. However, the hoopla that has surrounded her election only serves to distract from the present parlous state of women Labor members. There are those in the Labor Party who are beating a drum about an objective for that party to have 50 per cent female representation in parliament by the year 2000. Loudly proclaiming this objective has obscured the simple fact that parliamentary representation of and-even more importantly-power !'iharing by Labor women in the national parliament has not been living up to the party's rhetoric for years- In general terms Labor women MPs fared rather better under Prime Minister Hawke than has been the case under Prime Minister Keating. The simple fact is that the Labor Party factional system does not assist the advancement of its women. They appear to have long since hit the so-called 'glass ceiling'. When former Prime Minister Hawke insisted after the July 1987 election that the number of women in his ministry be increased from one to three, he could not get this result . from the three factions. Those who run the factions-all men-had their favourite male candidates and were not prepared to extend their support to any of the women MPs. Prime Minister Hawke had to increase the size of the ministry in order to add the two further women. When Senator Ryan resigned from parliament in January 1988, her faction proposed a man to replace her. Following the March 1990 election, Mr Hawke promoted the by honourable member for Canberra into .the cabinet. However, he could not persuade the Centre Left faction to include a woman amongst its candidates for the ministry, despite that faction having the opportunity to put forward new people. It was not until the present Minister for Consumer Affairs forced the issue, following Senator Richardson's resignation from the ministry in 1992-her candidature was clearly against the wishes of Prime Minister Keating-that the number of women in the ministry was restored to three, the previous status quo. There can be no doubt at all that several men have been promoted to the ministry over the last six years who are inferior to at least some of the women who have been forced to languish on the government's back bench. Furthermore, of the present 10 government parliamentary secretaries-the ministers-inwaiting-the Prime Minister has seen fit to appoint only one woman. Within the Keating government, the parliamentary gains for women have been more apparent than real. This is illustrated by some tables I have prepared which show the number of women members of the Senate and of the House of Representatives for all parties since the beginning of the 1980s. At the end of my speech I shall seek leave to have these tables incorporated in Hansard. In the early 1980s, the number of women Labor representatives did increase, but, as from 1985, the situation in the Senate has essentially been one of decline. In the House of Representatives there has been some fluctuation, resulting in only a modest increase of two between 1987 and 1994 (including Dr Lawrence's recent election). Whilst the total number of Labor women in parliament has increased, it too seems to have plateaued in the same way as its number of women ministers-the increase is almost wholly due to the very modest progress in the House of Representatives that I·have already outlined. In the light of these facts, claiming an objective of 50 per cent female representationby the 21st century clearly is more a case of hype for public. consumption rather than reality. The simple fact is that, whilst women account for nearly 14 per cent of Labor Party parliamentary representation, their three ministers (assuming that the honourable member for Fremantle will be a minister by the end of this week) and one parliamentary secretary amounts to only 10 per cent of ministry appointments. A poor result. In the jockeying that has this week surrounded the forthcoming ministry changes, it is noteworthy that the second vacancy is to be filled by yet another male candidate nominated by the Right faction. Whilst I have no axe to grind with the honourable member for Bowman, it is surely obvious that there are other women who are equally capable of this job-and certainly other Queensland women, . if having a· Queenslander is to be an overriding factor. For example, why has the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford) never been appointed as a parliamentary secretary, and thus given the opportunity to indicate whether she has ministerial capabilities? She is a hard working member who came to this parliament with credentials equal to most of her colleagues and she has been consistently ignored. Affirmative action is obviously a sham within the parliamentary Labor.Party. As for the coalition, women represerit 11 per cent of parliamentary membership-in the case of the LiberalParty alone, 14per centbut hold 16 per cent of shadow ministry positions: six shadow ministers and one parliamentary secretary. Leader of the Opposition John Hewson has never been given any credit for this by the press or women's groups, .a fact which tempts me to say that reporting on the issue of women and power sharing in the parliament is particularly oneeyed. Of course, there are other positions of authority within this parliament in addition to that of membership of the front-bench. The Labor Party has made much of the fact that it has had a female Chairman of Committees and Speaker of the House of Representatives. However, since the retirement of the .former honourable member for Lilley,· Elaine Darling, as temporary Chairman of Committees, there have been no women on the Labor side given the opportunity to train for one of these positions of authority-it has remained exclusively a male preserve. Nor has it ever seriously attempted to identify a woman President of the Senate, despite using a couple of its women senators as temporary chairmen of committees. The Labor Party has never had a female whip in either the House of Representatives or the Senate-apparently the Labor fellows cannot handle being given their riding instructions by a woman. I see you smile, Mr Deputy Speaker. There have been several women whips in the Senate from the coalition ranks: four Liberal and one National Party. As well as appointing a record number of women to his front-bench, instead of setting spurious numerical goals, last year the Leader of the Opposition initiated within the Liberal Party moves towards identifying and training more women candidates. As I predicted at the time, the effect of encouragement from the top to would be female candidates has had an immediate, strong response. I look forward to being joined in this Parliament by many more female Liberal colleagues, whilst the Labor Party no doubt will be putting its major objectives into continued window dressing of a party which, at heart, cannot handle real power sharing with women. The obvious first step for them to take would be through their factions. How-ever, there is no suggestion that change is going to take place at that level. No wonder the discouragement amongst Labor women is presently so strong that they have had to depend on high profile women like Joan Kirner and Carmen Lawrence to get the attention of their co-party members. Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard a table entitled 'Female representation in. the Australian Parliament-1981 to 1994'. It sets out the numbers for all parties in the Senate and the House of Representatives and gives the combined totals for the Labor Party and the Liberal-National Parties in the two Houses. I have shown this to the parliamentary secretary at the table.

34,Mrs SILVIA SMITH,Unknown,"I rise today to speak of the youth situation in northern Tasmania and in particular in the city of Launceston. First, I would like to bring to the attention of the House the operations of a drop-in centre called Youth Unlimited. Youth Unlimited has in recent months undergone some very turbulent times. It has had problems finding a permanent home but now, due to the tireless efforts of those involved, a permanent home has been found in St Johns Street. Support for the Youth Unlimited Street Relief Workshop has come from all aspects of the community. Websters, who own the property, have given Youth Unlimited heavily reduced rent for six months. The Launceston Federal Casino has donated carpet for the centre, and service organisations of Launceston are giving freely of their time and efforts for the centre. In fact, the centre had the resources to get just about everything: everything but the kitchen sink, so I made a donation to buy that Co",62

Let me highlight to the House why a centre such as this is so important to the youth of Launceston. I would like to quote from the Launceston Examiner of 7 May 1993, from a time when it was thought that Youth Unlimited might close: Christine Percy is a young, single mum who would be very alone if Launceston's Christian Outreach Centre was forced toc1ose the doors of its Youth Help Centre. With her baby girls, Teri (10 weeks) and 18 month old Toni, Miss Percy said yesterday that she would be ""isolated and lonely"" without the Youth Unlimited Street Relief coffee shop in St Johns Street. ""I live at Rocherlea and if I couldn't come here I'd be doing nothing"" she said. ""I'd go silly sitting at home. I would hate it."" Without the crowded, two-room, volunteer-run coffee shop, Miss Percy, 23, believes that her age and children would bar her from any other help organisations. . ""It is like a family here."" A regular, like Miss Percy, at the centre, Mr King said that the frien$he'd made at the coffee shop had given him something to occupy his time. ""Without this I'd be hanging around town doing nothing in the Mall or outside Target"", he said. ""When it closes I go home and be bOred out of my skull for a couple of hours', he said. These examples highlight the need in human terms for this service and services of this nature. That is why initiatives such as this should be supported heavily by government at all levels. I mentioned earlier that there was potential at one stage for the Youth Unlimited service to close. During periods when the centre was closed, the level of disturbances in Launceston's Brisbane Street Mall and around the city increased notably. There is no better argument than this for the Youth Unlimited Centre to be maintained and supported. I also wish to bring to the attention of the House another example of community support in northern Tasmania, for the problems of our youth. I quote from the Examiner of 13 February this year: Steve Cloudsdale has quit the Launceston City Mission to pursue a mission of his own. His dream is to provide a place for young people with hard lives to learn love and security-a youth farm. The former Evandale Hospital, where old people once retired, will be a place for youth to rebuild. The hospital infrastructure is like the young people who will live, grow and work there-in need of care and repair. Faded signs protesting against the controversial closure of the hospital 18 months ago remain on the property, as do signs of daily hospital life. 'It looks like an institution. But we'll change all that, we'll get rid of things like the hospital curtain rails on the ceilings,' the former superintendent of Launceston - s. City Mission. said. The youths, aged between 15 and 18, will pay bOard, and work on the farm and the buildings. 'In turn, they will be given hope and counselling, they will be taught job-related skills, self-management and conflict-resolution,' Steve says. AbOut seven youths wiU be taken in at a time by referral from benevolent groups,· with the standard stay being arounafour months. 'But if someone needs to stay longer, we're flexible. By the same taken, they can leave at any time they like', he said. The assessment will be rigorous. The bOarders must be prepared to fit into the community. It's not just somewhere to say. The work will be hard. ' Steve says that w01""king the farm and renovating the hospital will give the young people a sense of purpose, a sense of achievement. 'People are devalued so often. Here they will be valued, and told they are valuable', he said. A four-bedroom house that also belongs to the property will be used for family respite. 'A whole family that needs to get away can come and stay out here, have some quality time together. Maybe mum and the kids need to get away from dad, it can be a safe place.' Steve, his wife Anne, and his four children live in the former male section of the hospital. Wards, even a one-time kitchen, have been ,converted to bedrooms. The lounge area is huge and doubles as an office. 'It's like we're just camped here. We've got a lot of work ahead but it's very satisfying work', Steve . says. This is a fantastic concept. It gives back to its participants the self-respect that they have been robbed of and gives them a real reason for being. This brings me to my next point-that of youth suicide. It is centres like the two I have mentioned in northern Tasmania that play a major role in the prevention of youth suicide. They provide an outlet from the pressures which affect many of our youth. Most importantly, they provide hope and a recognition that our young people do not have to face their problems alone. .Suicide is recognised as one of the major causes of death for those between the ages of 15 and 24, particularly young males. I am very pleased fa note that the Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council has established a joint Commonwealth-state working group to develop a national policy on child and youth health. Suicide is also one of the priority issues being considered during the development of the mental health goals and targets. It must be noted, however, that the draft report of the National Health. and Medical Research Council's working party, which was released at the Public Health Association's national conference on suicide prevention, commented on the deficiency in suicide data and also called for more research. A recent report by the Victorian coroner found that suicide was higher in areas of high unemployment but that unemployment was not the direct cause of the rising suicide rate. The study was unable to explain these geographic links and suggested that further research was needed. Indeed, further research is· needed. We, as a government, need to put greater resources into the prevention of. suicide as a specific issue; and I, as a member of this government, am working towards that goal. We, as a nation, need to be alerted to and understand better the problems of our youth. And we, as a community, need to foster and support organisations like Youth Unlimited and the Youth Farm to give our youth the support they require.",62
36,Mr CLEARY,Unknown,"During last December's Uruguay Round of the GATT, the Australian Financial Review splashed out the headline 'Australia set for GATT bonanza'. When the big boys of the G7 met in Detroit to discuss their joint unemployment problems, US Treasury Secretary, Lloyd Bentsen, told us the summit. would see 'jobs and growth move right up to the top of the agenda' for the July G7 summit. Given the economic crisis, it is no wonder they wanted to talk about jobs and growth. But where, we might ask, is the bonanza? Faith in globalisation, however, has not been confined to the regular suspects. In February this year, the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) added his and, I presume, the Left's support for internationalisation when he said that industry policies running counter to internationalisation would probably be ineffective or harmful. WiII Hutton in the Guardian Weekly of 20 March offered a more jaundiced view of free trade. The growth of the working poor and the economically inactive, .and insecure labour, and what he describes as 'an explosive growth not merely of unemployment but of jobs which neither pay a living wage nor survive very long' are what Hutton sees as the major features of the prevailing crisis. A decent society should link internationalisation to an equitable distribution of wealth in the context of environmental considerations. Unfortunately this is not what internationalisation means. The prophets clamour for micro level reform, including flexible labour markets. Once this is realised, they say, the goodies will flow our way. WiII Hutton's interpretation of this as 'propaganda masquerading as economics' could not be closer to the truth. In the minds of the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), flexible labour markets mean workers without unions; workers on the edge. Workers in WiIIs, as with workers elsewhere who have lost their jobs or fear for their jobs following deregulation, internationalisation and restructuring of Trade the Australian economy, have a different view of the virtues of flexible labour markets. Unfortunately, in Australia the minions of the market predominate on both sides of the House. It was a Labor government, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you will well remember, which deregulated the financial system, floated our currency and is now in the process of making our labour markets more flexible. It should not come as a surprise that the Hawke and Keating governments have been at the helm during a decade when wealth has been distributed obscenely from the bottom rung to the top 10 per cent of income earners. In this context, it is also not surprising that the major thrust of the unemployment green paper, a jobs compact which provides a worthwhile job for the long-term unemployed, is justified in terms of the rhetoric of market efficiency. Only yesterday the Minister for Employment, Education and. Training (Mr Crean), in response to a dorothy dixer on the G7, was quick to draw a connection between lack of skiII and unemployment. There are two major problems with this market approach to unemployment. Firstly, by identifying the worker's lack of skiIIas the reason for unemployment, the market system gets off scot-free. And, secondly, it opens up the dangerous possibility that workers will be forced to work for the dole, thus ensuring active labour market participation and competition. A matter of further concern is the proposal for a training wage for the long-term unemployed. The minister was at pains to convince us that he is not 'talking about making available slave labour or cheap labour or anything like that'. The state secretary of the. New South Wales TWU, Steve Hutchins, was less than enamoured of the minister's proposal, which he described as 'amazing coming from a former president of the ACTU'. I do not know why he thought it was amazing given the former Prime Minister's record. Hutchins's union, he said, 'would not be part of any ghetto wage system'. The internationalisation of the market is driving a large part of the Australian labour force out of jobs into insecurity, casualisation and low wages. We have every right to be sceptical of claims that increased employment opportunities in Australia will arise as a consequence of the GATT. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training said as much yesterday. As Humphrey MCQueen wryly pointed out in the Australian on 12 March, the key players are quick to up the ante whenever one or another country appears to be baulking. It is appropriate that MCQl,leen should attack those who refuse to consider the social costs that result from global corporations controJling national economies. He puts it this way: Australia is supposed to make US$1 billion extra in export returns from improved access to world markets for our agricultural products. This alleged gain has to be balanced against the costs of unemployment after the closure of food plants in our own country towns because of increased processed imports. Most in the National Party of Australia know exactly what MCQueen is talking about. Those who are still tempted to believe that we are on the verge of a windfall from expanded world trade should. consider the assessments of two very sober watchers of the gyrations of global capitalism. Jenny Stewart from the University of Canberra, who is about to publish a significant book on industry policy, had this to say in the Australian of 8 December 1993: The round has degenerated into a series of negotiations between the US, Japan and the European Union ... If the Europeans are bludgeoned into doing. anything about their agricultural trade practices, the chief beneficiary will be the chief bludgeoner, the US. The honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Knott) during his contributioJI to the defence debate yesterday painted a less than favourable picture of US foreign policy. Mayhe he will lead the charge on US trade policy-in other words, maybe he will lead the Left in the charge. In the March edition of Quadrant, Colin Teese, a former deputy secretary of the Department of Trade until 1986 and the Australian government representative to GATT from 1972 to 1977, focused on the unemployment consequences. According to Teese, the US trade deficit will only come into balance if 2112 million offshore workers lose their jobs. The view, as expressed by some members of the House during the defence debate yesterday, that the US is both a defender of liberty and a harbinger of good times is just plain stupid. How uplifting it is to see the French film industry defending itself against the US's atterript to acquire cultural hegemony in that country. Our biggest problem is that, as a consequence of our unilateral tariff and quota reductions, we have got no bargaining chips. Members of the caucus unemployment task force know that a jobs compact looks pretty insipid in the face of globalisation. My own electorate of WiJJs has suffered disproportionately. The members of that caucus committee and I know that it is unlikely that an Australian economic recovery-or for that matter an international one-will by itself bring prosperity back to the area. The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) not only recognises this problem but has attempted to address it-hence his recent statement that 'the challenge for the government was to tackle the profound effects of structural change on le-s-we1J-off groups and areas around Australia'. Unfortunately, the young tyros-or maybe the tyros from the Rightare trying to shift him out. Without a regional development policy and a comprehensive industry policy, this problem cannot even begin to be resolved. Bronwyn Bishop, by contrast,cannot see the wood for the trees. While Will Hulton argues in favour of 'more imagination and urgency if the economic and social divisions that disfigure our society are tg be challenged', Mrs Bishop resorts to a series of tired, trite cliches. manner of an outdated, old-style footy coach cum charlatan motivator; she e-horts us to believe in ourselves and charge through the brick wall of government regulation. That is absolute rubbish, and it is astounding to think that she could. possibly lead the Liberal Party. A bigger, problem than that is the fact that many in the House actually agree with her. Banking Industry",64
37,Ms DEAHM,Unknown,"Macquarie) (2.18 p.m.}-I would like to draw the House's attention today to the conduct of banks in our community and, in particular, to the recent conduct of the Westpac Bank in my electorate. I would like to start by quoting from the review of the recommendations of the recent banking inquiry: Understanding better the needs of customers is one thing, establishing a sound relationship with them is another. The experiences of the 1980s and the changing nature of the relationship between bank and customer has seen the public perception of . banks fall to an historic low. There is an urgent need to restore some of the public trust and dence which used to exist in banks. I would suggest that the Westpac Bank's conduct in the Blue Mountains over recent months certainly has not restored any of that confidence and there is certainly a long way to go before the bank wins back customers in that area. . A few months ago Westpac closed its Lawson branch in the mid-mountains. It is a small community, but it has a shopping centre and only one bank. They now have no bank. To get to a bank the shop owners have to travel down a busy highway which takes the main traffic to the west as well as considerable tourist traffic. They.have - o leave money on their premises overnight, thus increasing security problems. In protest, two . of my elderly constituents-I think they are both in their 70s-chained themselves to the doors of this bank, to the great embarrassment of the young police officer who had to cut them loose,· Now the ba.nk has decided that it will close its branch at Blackheath, a much bigger community than Lawson. The bank has been in Blackheath for 80 years, and there are In the people there who have used its services for most of that time. Indeed, there is a Commonwealth Bank there, but people have used the Westpac Bank for all of that time and they do not want to see it go. Clearly, the bank there has no real sense of community. The Blue Mountains is made up of a strip of towns and villages covering a considerable area across the mountain range. We do not have a centre as other places do. We cannot close a bank on the periphery and go to the one in the centre. There is no centre' of the Blue Mountains. So with the bank branch closing down people· have to. travel· further with no adequate transport. Old people cannot climb station steps to get a train to Katoomba, which is where the nearest branch is. So I suggest that the bank is being very short sighted and is showing a lack of community interest by closing that branch. This morning I heard that the Blue Mountains City Council, at its meeting last night, resolved that it is to give serious consideration to ceasing its association with Westpac. confiCurrently, the council does all its banking through Westpac. It is calling for tenders for its banking services. From memory, the council· has a turnover of about $45 million. At the moment a $1 million loan is due for renewal and the council has decided not to renew it with Westpac. It is seeking offers from other institutions. Westpac will not be invited to tender for that offer. So closing this branch is an extremely short-sighted move on the part of this particular bank. We are paying for the past mistakes of the Australian banks. The free and easy lending policies of the 1980s are being paid for by ordinary customers, small business peopl-, and ordinary households. They are paying for those mistakes. I came across a . glaring example of this in my electorate last week. A small steel fabrication company started three years ago with a staff of four. Its turnover was $70,000. In three years, it has built a staff of 22, including three is something that cheers my heart considerably, because hardly anyone is taking on apprentices these days. The fact that this firm is taking on apprentices is to be applauded. This company has small rented premises in an industrial estate in Lawson. The people have to work two shifts- something which unfortunately has been brought to the notice of the council by the neighbours because they do not like steel fabrication work going on at night. The owner has had to put on extra power in order to cope with the work. He said to me, 'I think we might be getting towards an unsafe situation'. I am sure none of us wants to see any worker working in an unsafe situation, while at the same time we do want to see companies expanding. The owner of this company wants to rent other premises, but he cannot find any. There are no suitable premises in the area. He would like to buy a piece of land in this industrial estate and put up a factory. The whole thing is going to cost him $300,000. Do honourable members think this man can find a bank in the area that will lend him that money? Not on your life! Not one of them will do so-not Westpac, not the Commonwealth Bank, not the National Bank, not the credit union. They say that he has not got enough money to put in, he has not got enough collateral to start off with, so he has been knocked back. He has asked me for assistance. I will do all I can, and hopefully someone will come to the party and help him out. This situation is absolutely deplorable. Entrepreneurs of the 1980s only had to lift up the phone-they did not even have to go into the bank-to get themselves a loan, and yet this honest, hard-working man is having problems. He has developed his business over the last three years. He is not a greedy person. He is a community spirited person. He personally took some artefacts from a war memorial in the area, refurbished them, polished them, and put them back in time for last year's ANZAC Day celebrations, at no cost to the local community. He gives donations to the local community. He works in youth groups and generally supports the local up to community. Will the banks support him? Not apprentices. That on your life! We need to take a long hard look at what is happening with the banks. I applaud Mr Speaker for having chaired the inquiry on banking a few years ago. We have had a review of the inquiry since then. Perhaps we need another review. Perhaps we need to give a few of them another kick up the pants. I would like to conclude by reading some quotes from the original banking inquiry. On quality of service, it says: Banking is a service industry which must maintain good customer relations by offering good customer service. Westpac has not given good customer service to the residents of the Blue Mountains. The report also says: Quality of service is much harder to measure than quality of goods. . Let us think about that. How are we going to measure service? We can measure it easily by the actions of Westpac in the Blue Mountains: there is no service. The section in the report on geographic access is referring to rural areas. The Blue Mountains is a semi-rural area and, because of the travel problems that I have described, access is not easy. The report says: While not a preoccupation for effective competition, physical access to banking services is nonetheless an important one in a country the size of Australia. I would suggest that, looking at each region one at a time, honourable members will see that access is something that the banks are clearly not addressing; and they are not addressing it in small communities like Lawson and Blackheath, where there are a lot of retired people who do not find it easy to travel long distances to do their banking services. I will end on that note by roundly condemning the West pac Bank. I think it will find that it is going to suffer, particularly in the Blue Mountains area. Rural Unemployed Migraine Sufferers Community Grants",66
38,Mr RONALDSON,Unknown,"Ballarat) (2.26 p.m.)I wish to grieve today for those forgotten Australians, the non-metropolitan Australians, that are carrying the can for this country and are getting little or no reward for the weight that they are carrying. On the day the February unemployment figures were released and the day after the national news-· papers and the government were talking about a turnabout in the unemployment situation and talking about the worse being over, the Ballarat Courier told a totally different story-indeed, a story that, I .suspect, has been repeated in .other regional centres throughout the country. The banner in the Ballarat Courier read 'Record joblesson Ballarat total closes on 9,000 barrier'. The 9,000 is 9,000 people-9,000 living and breathing people: not numbers, not statistics, hut men, women, mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, grandmothers and grandfathers. I do not want, and they not want, crocodile tears or false cries indignation from this government. Rather, want some action. The government's sudden interest in regionto al policies is an obscenely belated, politicallyBallarat motivated concern for regional rural Australia. It is not motivated by any genuine concern, but rather by retention of ial government presided over by a dictatorial Prime Minister (Mr Keating). In the papers on 11 March we saw such comments as 'The recovery has already clearly taken hold in the job market with unemployment rising for the sixth month in a row during February'. That was in the Age. In the same paper the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) hailed the growth figures as great news for Australia and for the unemsuch. ployed in particular. Later on, the minister said that he was confident that the focus government's election target of half a million jobs in three years would be exceeded and the at. .unemployment rate would be reduced during 1994. In the Australian on the same day we saw the banner 'Jobs rise confirms jobs growth surge'. The .Australian Financial Review banner was 'The nation goes back to work'. Like hell the nation goes back to work! Some parts of it might be, but I can assure this House that in many parts it is not. The ones that are not going back to work are the ones In non-Inetropolitan Australia, the forgotgreat ten Australians, the ones we assume the after government believes are the dispensable Australians. They are the ones who live at the end of the bus routes or the end of the tram routes and who have carried the can for this recession, and they are the ones making the major contribution to this country's economy and the ones who are getting nothing from it. There are hundreds of thousands of Australians who are waiting to see whether the government's action matches its rhetoric, and past experience there is little to beconfident about. I think we should put this into some sort of perspective and look at some of the figures. These are Department of Social Security figures from Ballarat: in February 1994 there were 5,361 in the Ballarat office do and in January, 5,142 people. In the Wenof douree office, the figure was 3,538 for Febwe ruary, and in January it was 3,434respectively, increases of 4.3 and three per cent on the previous month. Let me go back 1993. In February 1993 the figure for the office was 4,771 and in January 1993 it was 4,533; and in the Wendouree office the January figure was 3,053 and the month power by a dictatorbefore, 2,922. In 1992 the Ballarat office figure was 4,369; the month before it was 4,246. The Wendouree office figure was 2,745 and the month before it was 2,681....,.respectively, over two years, a rise of nearly 1,000 people at the Ballarat office and nearly 800 people at the Wendouree office. It is fortunate that the resilience. of non-metropolitan Australians is that they try to sol ve their own problems. In the Ballarat region, there is a major towards developing those things that we are good at and those that we wish to be good The establishment of the state government's information technology centre will provide a strong fillip for a new growth area in· the region. What have we heard from the federal government in relation to this matter? Virtually nothing. Have we had any calls from relevant ministers for their colleagues to give commitments to outsource Commonwealth government information technology into the Ballarat region? Not on your sweet nelly! Have we had an indication from them that they will consider this proposal? Again, nothing. In the time left to me there are several matters that I wish to raise. I thank the honourable member for Macquarie (Ms Deahm) for the comments she made about banks. I assure her that in the rural sections of my electorate this is a matter of extraordinary concern. It is not just the banks that concern me; it is the withdrawal of services from country Victoria and country Australia back into the regional centres and then the withdrawal of those services back into the major metropolitan services. I hear talk about the recession having started in this country in 1988-89. It started a damn long time before that. It started in regional rural Australia, and it went from the smaller centres to the regional centres back into the metropolitan centres. We were first in and you can bet your bottom dollar that we will be the last out. The major focus of politics in this country is in metropolitan Melbourne and metropolitan Sydney. I think it is about time that this House as a body-I am sure members on the other side will agree-started to respect the wants and aspirations of regional and rural Australians. It has been a long time coming, and it had better start. I am sure there would be a lot of support for that position. There are a large number of people in this country that suffer a large number of ailments. I do not think there can be one group that suffers more than those who suffer from migraines. This is an extraordinary medical problem. Touch wood, I have never had a migraine, but there are tens of thousands of Australians who suffer from migraine. There is'a sort of relief at hand-and that is a drug called Imigran. .The other name for it is Sumatriptan. This drug provides extraordinary relief for migraine sufferers. It is a drug that should be made readily available to those that need it, but it is not available to people at a reasonable price. I have urged the government for the last 18 months to do something about this. If there is something in train, the government can accept my apologies. If there is nothing in train, then it needs to apologise to the migraine sufferers in this country. A letter from the Ballarat and District Migraine Support Group states: Our firstmeeting for this year was held on 22nd February and on this occasion several of our members were discussing the use over the holiday period of the new drug Sumatriptan. All who. had used it, including myself, had very successful results but agreed it was far too expensive to consider any regular usage. This in tum led to several inquiries as to the progress, if any, of getting this drug on to the National Health List. We all signed a petition that was forwarded on to you early last year and have not heard any feedback on its outcome. I wrote to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Human Services (Mr Howe) prior to getting that letter in relation to some other enquiries to see what was happening with it. As yet, I have not had a reply. I hope that is forthcoming very shortly. I have just one more matter. Very briefly, I want to refer back to the sports rorts incident and to pose again the question-I am not talking about whiteboards; that is passe; let us get back to the absolute heart of this matterthat has still not been answered by the now disgraced former minister or by anyone else for that matter: what was the rationale for the decisions of this government when it was allocating funds? I will read out the names of some organisations that would very much like to know why there were applications that were granted in category 3-that is the lowest of all of them-instead of those in category 2. The Ballarat and District Lapidary Club would like to know; the Avoca Tennis Club would like to know; the shire of Balian, for the construction of its community leisure centre, would like to know; the Natte Yallock Recreation Reserve Committee would like to know; the city of Stawell, for the construction of two multipurpose courts at the Stawell leisure complex, would like to know; and the Ballarat Regional Athletic Centre Incorporated would like to know-that is where one of our great Australians, Steve Moneghetti, is unable now to train because the state of this track is simply not good enough for people of that quality to train on and, indeed, is dangerous for our young people-the answer. I can go through it. They want to know, I want to know, and there are many-in fact, about 2,100-Australian organisations that would like to know why they were not given the funds. (Time expired). Queensland Liberal Party",68
39,Mr SWAN,Unknown,"I rise today to grieve for the state of. the Liberal Party in Queensland and what it stands for. I also rise to dispel the untruths raised in the Queensland Legislative Assembly on 23 February this year by the Liberal state member forflayfield, Mr Santoro. In the north-eastern suburbs of Brisbane, we have seen a takeover of the Liberal Party by the New Right-disciples of laissez-faire economics, worshipping at the feet of the H.R. Nicholls Society. At the forefront of this group in the north-eastern suburbs of Brisbane is the state member for Clayfield, Mr Santo Santoro. Mr Santoro has proudly told the Queensland Legislative Assembly that, although he is not a member of the H.R. Nicholls Society, he has asked for a membership form. Of course, the H.R. Nicholls Society is an organisation committed to overturning the arbitration system. Mr Santoro's comments are an affirmation of his commitment to low wages and the abolition of the industrial umpire. Mr Santoro has repeatedly congratulated the Victorian government for its 'take a pay cut or face the sack' industrial relations policy. He has assured Queenslanders that a coalition government in Queensland would follow the same path as Jeff Kennett in Victoria. In the Queensland Legislative Assembly Mr Santoro has continuously attacked the provisions of state awards. He has argued that VEAs and individual contracts have 'a fundamentally important role to play in the Queensland economy'. Mr Santoro, therefore, is obviously a new right hardliner, the type of person who would like to see a kind of 18th century workplace where there are no minimum award rates and there is no umpire. In the Brisbane suburbs of Kalinga, Eagle Junction, Wooloowin and Clayfield, we have seen Mr Santoro's style of politics at work. Mr Santoro did the numbers for his dry Right buddy, Alderman Clay, to squash the more moderate sitting Liberal alderman, Carrol Cashman. In doing so, she was disendorsed for the forthcoming council elections. Alderman Cashman was dumped in the waste bin of political history by the number crunching of Mr Santoro. Mr Santoro's vicious use of numbers has alienated a number of people in my electorate. It is no wonder that they feel alienated when their representatives like Mr Santoro push the New Right laissez-faire rubbish that has been espoused by Mr Santoro. It is no surprise, of course, that Mr Santoro is, and was, a vocal supporter of Fightback and a weIl-known proponent of the GST-that is, a 15 per cent tax on all the necessities of life. To achieve their ends, Mr Santoro and his disciples of the New Right in the northeastern suburbs of Brisbane will go to any lengths. They will go to the lengths of roIling not only Alderman Cashman in the ward of Kalinga, but also the Leader of the Liberal Party in Queensland, Joan Sheldon. Could this be an example of the New Right's attitude to women in representative positions in politics? The people of Brisbane are now facing the same breed of New Right politics and hypocrisy that has come from Mr Santoro, in the city council elections. Their mayoral candidate in the city council elections, Alderman Ward, has said that the Liberals in Queensland will be concentrating on putting extra density into residential B areas. It is clear that this is the policy fuIly supported and formu-' lated by Mr Santoro and his dry Right buddies in the Queensland Liberal Party. There can be no confusion as to what they stand for. Mr Santoro and Mr Ward are what we would call 'urban density kings'. It was Alderman Ward and his faction king, Mr Santoro, who gave Brisbane the density problems which are now being so much debated in the Brisbane City Council elections. This New Right grouping has tried very hard to convince everyone in Brisbane that density problems in Brisbane are somehow the result of a Labor Party conspiracy, when the fact is that all of the density problems Brisbane were introduced by Alderman Ward, supported by Mr Santoro, in 1987 when Alderman Ward was the chairman of the development committee of the Brisbane. City Council. It is time to have a look at some of the high density policies supported by Mr Santoro and Alderman Ward. In the 1987 town plan brought in by AIderman Ward, supported by Mr Santoro, it··was the Liberal Party that introduced no controls over the block splitting of 32 perch blocks irito 16 perch titles. It was the Liberal that allowed the building of boundary walls five metres high on the boundary. It was the Liberal Party that allowed 'six pack' developments right up to the sides of blocks. It was the Liberal Party that allowed no control over the development of three-storey blocks. It w-s the Liberal Party that showed no concern for the character of development in quiet residential areas. It is very clear that all the urban density problems that currently exist in Brisbane are the result of a town plan introduced by Alderman Ward, supported by MrSantoro, in 1987. It has nothing at all to do with the density policies of Alderman Soorley, the Mayor of Brisbane. All of this adds up toa consistent pattern of policy approach. The pattern of policy approach from the Liberal Party in Queensland, from its deputy leader Mr Santoro and from Alderman Ward, is that of the New Right-very simply, to support policies such as Fightback, to support a GST, to oppose very valuable social programs such as Medicare, to propose the abolition of labour market programs and generally to support the redistribution of wealth in our community from average income groups in the community to those at the very top: This can be seen in the Liberal Party's approach to development in .the BCC. The Liberal Party basically gave developers in the Brisbane City Council area open slather to develop any area. of the city at any time in any way that the developer decided. It was a policy introduced for their developer mates at the expense of the residents of Brisbane. The policies of the Liberal Party have produced a situation where, without the action of Alderin man Soorley, we could have seen thecharacter of Brisbane destroyed forever. Brisbane does indeed have a unique character, symbolised by Queenslander homes and large urban blocks. It is a character which has been threatened by the 1987 development plan supported by Mr Santoro and introduced by Alderman Ward. When we look at members of the Liberal Party in Queensland-which has the support of people such as Mr Everingham, a former member of this House, and people of the type Party of Mr Santoro and Mr Ward-'-it is a shame to see that they are so out of touch with the electors of Queensland that they could continue to support policies espoused in Fightback, that they could continue to support a GST, that they could continue to support high density policies as symbolised in the 1987 town plan and that they could continue to support things like the abolition of Medicare and of labour market programs. This group of people is so out of the touch with the ordinary community is it any wonder that, at the federal level and at the state party level in Brisbane, it faces leadership proh.. lerns? Now Mr Santoro is moving against Mrs Sheldon. We have seen in the federal Liberal caucus the instability of recent days. Former Prime Minister Fraser has described the Liberal Party as being a policy vacuum of little worth to the general community, irrelevant and out of touch with the community. Why is it so irrelevant and so out of touch? It is because it spends no time mixing with ordinary people in the community. That is how and why it put forward the policy it did in Fightback. Anyone who could stand up and offer to the Australian people a 15 per cent GST on everything and then wonder when the people of Australia hold their nose at the stench of such a policy is seriously out of touch. Anyone who could then thrash around for some-. thing like 12 months wondering what went wrong must be out of .touch with the needand aspirations of ordinary Australians.",70
40,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"Mr Hollis)Order! It being almost 2.45 p.m., in accordance with the resolution agreed to on 22 March 1994, the debate is interrupted. I put the question: That grievances be noted. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA Public Phone Charges",72
41,Mr NEVILLE,Unknown,"I find it somewhat strange that on the day the government announced a 33 per cent increase in public phone charges I should have received a letter from Telecom declining to provide the citizens of the small community of Lawgi with such a facility.Lawgi, once a railhead for the dairy industry, has no shops, no pub and no post office. Community life revolves around a community hall, which is used for meetings, dances, indoor sports, church services and CWA meetings. The Lawgi hall committee and the CWA have developed a park and recreational facilities around the hall which provide a popular stop-off point for caravaners, truckies and travellers using the Burnett highway, 'vhich is in effect the Queensland extension of the New England highway-an important artery. With 17 kilometres to Thangool and 67 to Monto, Lawgi has no phone for travellers' emergencies or for simple local access, to say nothing of the needs of the people who use that isolated hall. I find it quite extraordinary that there is 85 kilometres of major highway without a public phone. Lawgi's situation is indicative of so many unselfish rural communities that share facilities with the travelling public. All they ask in return is the most basic of basic services. It sad to think that Telecom's universal service obligation has been so rigidly interpreted that small communities are deprived of things that the rest of us take for granted. Clean Waterways Program",72
42,Ms DEAHM,Unknown,"I rise to draw attention to the New South Wales government's recent decision to disband its $7 billion, 20-year clean waterways program. Under this program the waterways-including the beaches, streams and rivers-of New South Wales were to be systematically cleaned up by improving sewage treatment works and through other environmental measures. This program was arrived at after full consultation with environmental groups, local councils and anyone else who was at all interested. The government has substituted this program with a document entitled Choices for clean waterways. This will be put out as a consultation document over the next 12 months. This is what could only be called a Clayton's consultation-a delaying tactic. Is it not ironic that in 12-months time we will have a state election? So the decisions will be made just when the government is going into an election. The choices include whether we want to spend $1 million, $2 billion, $20 million-anything to get away from the $7 billion which has already been committed. This has been roundly condemned by previous chairmen and senior officers of the water board who have resigned in disgust at this government's activity regarding waterparticularly clean water. As I have said, the choices have already been made and this consultation is just a pretence. (Time expired) Bonython By-election",72
43,Mr MACK,Unknown,"The Bonython by-election result contains several lessons. The voters' message was 'a plague on both your houses'. An amazingly high 22 per cent did not vote for either of the major parties. The real lessons of the Bonython by-election, however, are to be found in the minor parties' votes. Grey Power, representing the elderly, has campaigned for some years with little result. This time it received a is substantial 7.3 per cent of the vote-a superficially surprising result given its minimal campaign and narrow appeal. Yet for some hundreds of thousands of older Australians suffering the chaos and unfairness of the government's constant reduction of their pensions, the unfairness of counting capital gain as income and threats to superannuation, the result was understandable. Unless the government recognises these inequities and the problems of this ever increasing group of voters, it will pay the penalty. Another salutary lesson was provided by a Melbourne man who drove to South Australia and campaigned on a shoestring for a few weeks against the major parties' immigration and multicultural policies. He obtained 6.8 per cent of the vote. This was a reflection of the fact that whatever the merits of these policies, they are not understood by a majority of the voters and they do not have their support. All in all the voters showed, yet again, that they get it right more often than any elite-and that is why democracy works. Nursing Mothers Association of Australia",72
44,Mr SWAN,Unknown,"I rise to congratulate the Nursing Mothers Association of Australia on its 30th anniversary and, in particular, to congratulate it on its successful state conference held in Brisbane last weekend. The nursing mothers are typical of so many volunteers in our community who give their services for no immediate return, except the gratification of helping people. If the community had to pay volunteers such as those in the Nursing Mothers Association or Meals on Wheels, it would be simply beyond the taxing capacity of government to provide such services. The Nursing Mothers Association of Queensland is very active in my electorate of Lilley and very active across the state of Queensland. It had something like 250 delegates at its state conference. They were there to discuss not only the self-help role of nursing mothers but also how that organisation could become a more active and lobbying voice for middle Australia. It is an organisation which is frequently unrecognised in terms of the value of the work it does in assisting parents, but this value has been recently recognised in that the government has supported the Nursing Mothers Association of Australia with a grant to the tune of $20,000. It is a' grant that the organisation has indeed earned and one which I hope that over time the government can build on to support these volunteers that do such valuable work within our community. Campaign Against Compulsory Lights On",73
45,Mr HAWKER,Unknown,"Today I would like to draw the attention of honourable members to a very important launch that will occur at the Sydney Town Hall on Friday morning. That is the launch of the national campaign against compulsory lights on. This nationwide campaign, which will be launched by various motorcycle groups, is opposing the government's Australian Design Rule 19/01 which makes it compulsory for all new motorbikes in Australia today to have the headlight wired on. This will be a very significant national campaign. It will be conducted in the lead-up to the next election. This group is very angry with the government. The group claims to represent 300,000 motorcyclists right throughout Australia. I pay special tribute to Greg Hirst from the New South Wales Motorcycle Council and also to Damien Codognotto from the Motorcycle Riders Association, who are supporting the campaign. It is part of an ongoing campaign which I have been directly involved in through my private member's bill, which I will be reintroducing since the government has refused to accept it. I will be very pleased to be there to support this campaign. My colleague the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp), who is the shadow minister for transport, will also be there. We intend to make sure that everyone is very much aware of just how fed up the motorcyclists throughout Australia are with this government. (TIme expired) Housing",73
46,Mr ADAMS,Unknown,"In this Year of the Family, one Of the biggest single costs a family faces is housing. Although some 70 per cent of Australians own or are buying their own home, another 30 per cent will never be able to aspire to this. Those people have very few options. They can either rent privately, which will often cost them between 40 and 70 per cent of their incomes, or they can attempt to be housed in public housing. But public housing is not public housing any more. It is barely welfare housing. In Tasmania it is seen as special needs housing. Only those who are in dire straits, have been assaulted or have some life threatening illness are even considered. People go through all sorts of hell to be put on the waiting list and they are still not housed. I know of a woman with three children who lived in a car for nearly a month; tl:ley had nowhere to go. The waiting list Tasmania is over 5,000 families-about 12,000 people-and it has been like this for many years. The state··government likely to build or buy more than 80 houses to the end· of this year. This is not addressing the problem. It barely touches the waiting lists. If people are not properly housed, it makes it impossible for them to find work. How they tum. up to an interview without clean clothes or without having a shower? In this Year of the Family, we have a commitment to ensure that everyone has accessible, affordarea. able and secure. housing. (Time expired) Queensland: Infrastructure and Services",73
47,Mr SLIPPER,Unknown,"With the Premiers Conference being held this week, it is approof priate to call for increased federal funding the state of Queensland, which has a high of interstate migration, providing pressure our state's infrastructure and services. This particularly obvious in seats such as Fisher and Fairfax, which are amongst the fastest growing electorates in Australia. . On current boundaries, the Fisher Divisional Returning Officer estimates that, by June 1998, the number of people on the roll in electorate of Fisher will grow to 107,786 the February 1994 enrolment of 79,006, which is an increase of 36.43 per cent. . these and other people move from the rust . bucket states of southern Australia to a place where we have a great lifestyle and great opportunities, it is appropriate for increased .funding to be given to Queensland .. I am very concerned that at the Premiers Conference Premier Goss will fail to obtain . the assistance that Queensland needs. After all, Australia's population is moving north. The people of Queensland are entitled· to fair go. I call on the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and this government to make sure that Queensland receives increased funding to provide appropriate infrastructure for our growing population. Big New South Wales Bike Ride",74
48,Mr KNOTT,Unknown,"I announce to the House that my electorate of Gilmore has been in successful in attracting the RTA Big New South Wales Bike Ride. With a great deal of work by my staff, by me, and by the councils is not involved-Shoalhaven, Kiama arid up Wingecarribee-we have secured for 1995 a bike ride which will bring in the vicinity of $700,000 into the electorate. I have pledged to work towards jobs, jobs, jobs and I am pleased to announce to the House that this is some way towards delivering on the rhetoric. can Unfortunately, m·ost politicians, including . those on the other side, d() not deliver on rhetoric. We have actually delivered something in terms of physical requirements for the Bishop, Mrs B.",74
49,Mr CLEARY,Unknown,"It would be remiss of me not to give the House a bit of a resume the thoughts of the great Bronwyn Bishfor op-certainly they do not rival the thoughts rate of the great Chairman Mao. Her thoughts on were reported in the Sunday Sun. Mrs Bishop is got quite an extensive little run in the paper and I have never read more twaddle in my life. Bronwyn Bishop tells us that the big problem with Australia is workers. The trade unions ate the problem. That is why there is unemployment. Unemployment is due to trade the unions. Of course, Kelty is a mongrel. He from should. never have got his finger into this regional economic task force. It is funny, is As it not? Everyone in the House has been spruiking about regional economic development-the National Party is hot to trot on it; it came from the Labor side-but not Bronny Bishop, the next leader of the Liberal Party. She has not got a clue. What has she come up with? She says that the problem with the Labor government is that it is collectivist. Does anyone here actually believe that the Labor Party is collectivist? a That is Bronwyn Bishop's view. Of course, at the finish all she can say is that it jsabout rah-rahing, like the old football coach: whack a bit of liniment on, stir ourselves up, charge through a brick wall and Australia will be led to a rosy recovery. When she gets into the House, those in the coalition will have some very serious problems to attend to. Clean Waterways Program",74
50,Ms DEAHM,Unknown,"In continuation of my earlier remarks, I advise the House that the Hawkesbury-Nepean River system, which runs through my electorate, is in a deplorable state. Every time we pick up a Sydney newspaper we read about the blue-green algae and the other water plants that are growing out of control. The consultation paper which the New South Wales government is now putting up in lieu of its $7 billion 20-year clean waterways program will only put that problem back another year-as I said earlier, that year bringing it up to the next state election. A number of sewage treatment works discharge into that river system. We are told by Mr Webster, the Minister for Planning, that they are all discharging tertiary effluent, clean water that he could drink. I would like to see him drink it. It is not the case. It unsafe river. It is unsafe for recreational purposes. Its tributaries are unsafe for the feeding of stock in a rural area. The government stands condemned for shelving this program which was planned with full consultation with the environment groups and the councils in the area. Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia",75
51,Ms WORTH,Unknown,"I would like to bring to the attention of this House some points of view from the Greek community leaders in my electorate of Adelaide. Following the government's recognition of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, they feel that the government has attempted to silence them and their freedom of speech with the slur that, if they speak out, they will be accused of creating ethnic tensions and violence. There has been no violence in Adelaide or in other parts of South Australia. Their protest march held on 5 March, which attracted 20,000 participants, was orderly and impeccably conducted. Their only supposed transgression was that they would not allow Senator Bolkus to be heard. Their message to me, which I convey to the House, is simply: how do we trust a Prime Minister who says one thing and does another? Pensioners: Country of Origin",75
52,Mr NEVILLE,Unknown,"Recently the Department of Social Security wrote to all foreign-born pensioners seeking information on their country of origin. The letter was seeking information in line with the government's policy of req-iring all pensioners and claimants for an Australi'an pension to claim the pension with their former country of residence where Australia has a social security agreement with that country. While I understand that the department is following government policy, I wish to register my concern at the manner in which it was carried out. Firstly, there was very limited publicity about this measure by the department. A number of constituents who contacted my office found it difficult to understand why their country of origin should affect their Australian pension. Some were so confused",75
53,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! It being is an 3.00 p.m., the time for members' statements has expired. NA Fuel Tax: Increases",75
54,Mr SHARP,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Minister for Finance. Given that the government is increasing fuel taxes in August, following a decision announced in the last budget, will the minister rule out any further fuel tax increases in the coming budget? Further, will the government scrap the proposed increase next August, given that it will ' not affect the current price differential between leaded and unleaded fuels? If not, can he explain why Australians should be slugged yet again at the fuel bowser-a practice this government has turned into an art form?",75
55,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"The Treasurer, when answering questions on these matters yesterday-proposed tax rises; the normal sort of speculation that sometimes has a basis but more often does not in the run-up to a budget-sensibly put himself in a position where he said that he was not going to sit around preparing the budget on the basis of a dialogue across the chamber. Mr Costello-He's going to put it on a whiteboard, is he?",75
56,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"There may be opportunities later in question time to discuss how well those opposite. are doing on their propositions about what taxes they will and will riot accept. Suffice it to say that, as far as we concerned, in preparation of this budget our objective is not to operate on the basis that we increase taxes for the various propositions that the government is considering. As has been said before in relation to other propositions circulating on taxation, the government operates in the framework of a disposition not to go down the road of any extensive revenue raising associated with this budget. Stevedoring Industry",76
57,Mr HOLLIS,Unknown,My question is directed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Has the minister seen reports in the Australian Financial Review which allege that proposed amendments to the stevedoring acts will result in the reintroduction of pool employment? What are the government's intentions in this matter?,76
58,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,"I thank the honourable member for his question, and I am pleased to provide this answer. Opposition members-And you wrote the question.",76
59,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,"-:-You should keep quiet; you might like to hear this answer. This has been the subject of some rather ill-informed comments by the honourable member for Bennelong so he should sit quietly by and listen to the answer. These amendments to the Stevedoring Industry Levy Act do not signal a return to labour pools; they do not signal a move away from enterprise based employment; nor do they grant preference of employment to waterside workers, as has been incorrectly stated by some media reports and by the honourable member for Bennelong. They do not do any of those three things. The amendments will primarily ensure that the collection of the special levy which finances the industry's contribution to the redundancy program is actually paid. It is a program that has seen a 57 per cent reduction in the total waterfront work force and a 60 per cent increase in productivity to date. The House should be aware that, of the $130 million which was marked down as the industry'S contribution, $80 million is still outstanding; that is, $80 million has not been put up by the industry to date. The legislation are is necessary simply to secure the payment of the levy.",76
60,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"Are you going to bring back a regisl:ei? MrBRERETON-The register. which was raised by the honourable member for Bennelong, .is a matter to be decided by the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committeeand only by the Stevedoring Industry Finance Committee, not by me. That body, which has both employer and union representatives, will be making the decision. The reform process to date would not have been anywhere near as dramatic were it not for years of waterfront neglect and general indolence prior to the election of this government. The overwhelming majority of the period of this indolence was when those sitting opposite were the government of this country. The comments of the opposition on this issue can therefore be treated with a great deal of contempt. Mr Sharp-You've been in government for 11 years now.",76
61,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,"Yes, indeed-and the figures speak for themselves. Since we got here there has been a 57 per cent reduction in waterfront disputes and a 67 per cent improvement in productivity-our work, not yours. When it comes to reform, it has all been our efforts. The coalition government's efforts amounted to a big fat zero. In the light of the performance put on by the opposition during the waterfront dispute, I inform the House that today's figures showing the 1993 results for days lost in the workplace show that the 1993 figure was the lowest recorded since 1933-the lowest figure ever. I might say that it was about 1933 when the views of the honourable member for Bennelong generally prevailed in this nation. They do not prevail 60 long years later. Tax Imputation",76
62,Mr DOWNER,Unknown,My question is directed to the Minister for Finance. I ask: is the minister aware that there.is widespread concern in the business community that the government is considering changes to the tax imputation system? Can the minister give the business community some' confidence that no such change is being contemplated by the government in any Circumstances?,77
63,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"Has the opposition told the business community yet whether it' still adheres to a 42c in the dollar tax rate for business? That sits in its policy book-that it intends to have a 42c in the dollar tax on business, on business profits. Has the opposition clarified that with the business community? Does it think the business community would be cheerful about that as a proposition circulating? Or is that something the opposition wishes us to consider during our deliberations on this budget-the implementation of the opposition's policy massively increasing business taxes? Indeed, a $2 billion to. $3 billion dollar tax hike on businesses sits there in Liberal Party policy for us to consider in the course of this budget or at any other time we choose. The Treasurer made very sensible responses yesterday. on the issue of propositions for revenue raising in this budget. Mr Downer-This isn't about· the budget. . Mr BEAZLEY-What? Taxation has got nothing do with the budget? We will let that one pass. We do not approach our budget deliberations with a disposition to see a massive amount. of revenue raising. As honourable, members would be aware, the then Treasurer pointed out last year that he considered the propositions that he had put· in place at that stage as the basis of the revenue raising task of the government. But ofcourse, going,through the process of a budget we do not stand up in parliament or anywhere else in public endlessly ruling in and out various propositions. 1994-95 Budget",77
64,Mr SWAN,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Minister for Finance. What are the implications for the government's budgetary task of improvements in the Australian economy, and are there any other external· factors which will affect the 1994-95 budget outcomes-in particular, the budget deficit?",77
65,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"There are a few, but whether or not we can give an accurate answer to that question depends at least in part on where we might be going in regard to the prospects of various aspects of the budget in the Senate. Over the last 48 hours we have had an absolutely 'keystone cop' performance from the Leader of the Opposition and the opposition Treasury spokesman 'on this matter. A set of quotes from the Leader of the Opposition produced an article headed, 'Hewson threatens to block budget cuts'. That article states: ""Blocking expenditure cuts has always been a possibility. It's just that last time they didn't do any expenditure cuts', he said. We will get on to that proposition. He, then put out a clarifying statement in which he said, 'Each item of expenditure and tax will be judged on its merits'. That is good to know- There is then a press release from' the honourable member for Mayo to clarify the problem. He said: There should be no tax increases. No new taxes should be introduced. That is a consideration of tax propositions on their merits. The opposition spokesman on treasury matters then went on to say: History shows the Labor Party doesn'l often reduce spending in any area. The only rolled gold guarantee we give Australians is that we will oppose any increases in tax. As far as the' Leader of the Opposition is concerned, that is considering each tax proposition on its merits. What the opposition treasury spokesman had to say about cuts was totally erroneous. Firstly, there were cuts in the last budget opposed by the opposition. The very minor and utterly equitable series of propositions which were put forward in the higher education and social security areas were defeated as a result of the position adopted by the opposition in the Senate. This is an outfit which parades itself as being capable of sustaining enormous expenditure cuts and of putting in place any set of taxation promises that it puts forward. The opposition spokesman also said that the ALP government never cuts spending. Let us look at the facts. In the 30 years between 1953-54 and 1983-84; when basically the opposition was in government, there were only three single years in which outlays were reduced in real terms. No government in this period produced two .consecutive years of reductions. Since Labor has come to office, there have been four years of real reductions in outlays. The four years were delivered consecutively from 1986-87 to 1989-90. Mr Thckey-Tell us how much money you took off state governments.",77
66,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"Now, Wilson, no heckling, old son. We owe you a second seat.",78
67,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The minister will ignore interjections.,78
68,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"lowe you mine; the honourable member for Fremantle owes you hers in the enormous efforts you put in during the last few weeks to ensure that we had an excellent result in Fremantle. We treat you gently, Wilson, but at the same time, although one is tough, one understands that we would like to complete our answers in relative silence. Mr Thckey-She doesn't remember. That's her problem.",78
69,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The honourable member for O'Connor will cease interjecting. The minister will address his comments through the chair.,78
70,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"As I said, since Labor came to office, there have been four years of real reductions in .outlays. Those four years were delivered consecutively from 1986 to 1990. When the Liberals were last in office, in 1982-83, outlays increased by 7.4 per cent to 28.7 per cent of GOP. Outlays under us to 23.8 per cent of GOP in 1989-90. It is up to 27.3 per cent now, with the counterrecessionary measures that we put in place. is still 1112 percentage points of GOP below where the opposition left it when we came into office. So do not lecture us on whether we are capable of delivering a budget outcome. Those opposite should provide jobs to the people of this country by assisting the government to provide responsible budget outcomes. Well do I recollect the opposition spokesman on treasury matters standing in this place-the opposition now lectures us on budget deficits-saying that he felt like opposing the various revenue measures put in place last time because it did not really matter if only $2 billion was added to the budget deficit. It was an absurd position to say, 'We do not worry about that; another $2 billion on the budget deficit does not really matter. It is only 1112 per cent or two per cent'-or whatever it was he said--'-'of government outlays in the budget'. Those opposite maintain their absurd position as the opposition treasury spokesman and his leader debate each other through the media, his leader trying every now and then to establish a responsible position and the Treasury spokesman contradicting him. NA",78
71,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,Unknown,"I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon members of a delegation from the Parliament of Thailand led by the Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives. Also present in the gallery are members of a delegation from the Territorial Congress of New Caledonia. On behalf of the House, I extend a very warm welcome to our visitors. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA 1994-95 Budget",78
72,Dr HEWSON,Unknown,"I refer the Minister for Finance to this statement by the Prime Minister on 18 August 1993: Anybody who says we should be cutting our outlays further is an extremist. I say that advisedly-an extremist. fell On the same day, the Prime Minister described people calling for more spending cuts as extremist, malicious or fools. Will the It minister assure the House that the government stands by the Prime Minister's statements last year and that there will be no cuts in spending in this budget?",78
73,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"That is a very interesting line of questioning from the opposition. We are not allowed to have any tax Increases, we are not allowed to have any expenditure cuts, and we have to produce a larger reduction in the budget deficit than is currently proposed in the opposition's deficit reduction strategy. That is the opposition's position. It is like something out of Alice in Wonderland.",78
74,Dr H,Unknown,"wsori- Mr Acting Speaker, I raise a point of order. This was a· question about what the, Prime, Minister, has said; not what we have said. I ask the minister to address his answer to that specific point. Does he stand by what the Prime Minister said?",79
75,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,Unknown,Order! The which minis-er is answering the question.,79
76,Mr BEAZLEY,Unknown,"The Prime Minister was, as usual, sensible; the Leader of tion is not. So an answer about him is much more interesting, particularly as it reveals extent to which he is'absolutely out of control of the presentation of his party's budget position. The, opposition is inviting. us government-not only in this place but also elsewhere-to have no expenditure cuts and to have no taxation increases and it is requirstances, ing us to have a faster reduction in the deficit than has been outlined in the deficit reduction program. - think all that emphasises is that we will g-t no help from those opposite in getting a sensible outcome to the problem fiscal management in this country. Unemployed People: Assistance",79
77,Ms DEAHM,Unknown,Can the Minister for Social Security advise the House of recent measures the government is implementing to help unemployed people?,79
78,Mr BALDWIN,Unknown,"I thank the honourable member for her question. As honourable members would be aware, the government in the process of formulating its white paper which will be a very substantial and comprewhich hensive response to the problem ment, particularly long-term unemployment. However, there are a number of measures which the government has already taken, some of which reflect election commitments and some of which were budget announceployed ments from' last year, which will benefit uriemployedpeople in very significant ways by helping them to improve their living standards and also improving the incentives for them to participate in paid work. The first thing I will refer to is the introduction of an earnings credit 'scheme. ' The effect of this is that unemployed people will be able to earn more money from part-time and casual. work while continuing to receive unemployment payments. They will be able tb get a credit of $90 every fortnight if they are single or $80 for each partner of a couple, 'which will count against their earnings in that fortnight; that is to say unused free area. That can be accumulated up to a total of $500, they can access so that the earnings they make while they are on unemployment payments up to the value of their credit do the Opposinot affect their allowance. Another election commitment that ,the the government is giving effect to from this week is the mature age allowance. This is a,new payment available for people who have been as a out of work for 12 months or more over the age of 60. It reflects the reality of the labour market. Many people under current circumwhile we are still coming out of the recession, find significant difficulty in obtainingwork. It is considered a reasonable measure, in effect, to free those people up from the usual requirements and teSts that apply to of people receiving unemployment payments. I should stress to honourable members that that is not envisaged by the government as a permanent de facto reduction in the pensionable age. We are committed to maintaining the basic pensionable age of 65 and also gradually moving to that pensionable age for ' women over time. However""when we have to face the sorts of labour market circumstances that we do now, it is considered appropriate is to recognise that and, as an ameliorative measure, to have this mature, age allowance has a sunset date. The matter will, be of unemployreviewed at that time. ' The other significant measure is the $3 a week real increase-'-that is to say over and above indexation-in unemployment payments. There will be better access for unempeople to education and training, with allowees able to do CES approved training and education for up to six months without having to transfer to Austudy or Abstudy. A number of improvements will apply to early identification and assessment of clients with labour market difficulties. There will be a move to case management approaches, which is a demonstrably better way to service the long-term unemployed, in particular, and to improve their work prospects. There will be a further review of compliance measures and some significant improvements in that area. So all in all, these measures represent a significant package of steps that the government is taking. Most of these measures will come into effect this week. They will significantly improve the prospects of those people and provide some improvement in their overall living standard. We are taking these measures well in advance of the major proposals that are being considered in the context of the government's white paper on employment. Public Telephone Calls: Assistance to Low Income Families",79
79,Mr RUDDOCK,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security and further relates to matters of government assistance for the unemployed. ACOSS figures show that unemployed people without home phones make an average of 11.2 calls per week. Given that the cost of public calls will rise 10c in September and that the compensatory Phonecard is worth $4, how does the minister expect low income families and the unemployed in particular to be able to continue using public phones once the Phonecard runs out after one week?",80
80,Mr BALDWIN,Unknown,"This would have to be the most hypocritical question that we have heard in this House for some considerable time. The honourable member for Berowra purports to be concerned about the prospects of unemployed people and their chances of gaining work. He is very concerned about this. He might care to explain to the House the rationale for his party's commitment to massively slashing expenditure on labour market programs. Jobstart, which is the most effective labour market program that this government currently has, would have been abolished under the provisions of Fightback. Jobtrain, which provides significant training for long-term unemployed people, would have been slashed. All in all, labour market program assistance for unemployed people would have been drasticaIly cut. The original version of Fightback would have kicked those people off benefits after nine months. Mr Tim Fischer- Mr Acting Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Standing' order 145 states that answers shall be relevant to questions. The minister was clearly asked by the honourable member for Berowra about Phonecard and the decision to raise the cost of public telephone calls. He should now answer the question. Mr Acting sPEAKER-The minister was asked a question about government assistance to the unemployed. The minister will answer the question.",80
81,Mr BALDWIN,Unknown,"The honourable member for Berowra raised the issue of what we were doing for unemployed people and he raised the specific issue of the Telecom charges in that context. I think it is perfectly relevant to make some reference to what the coalition, would do for unemployed people. On the specific matter of the Telecom card, this is the first time that any government has by considered this sort of transitional assistance when there has been an increase in the charges for public phone calls. The last increase in these charges was made in 1986. There has never been any compensation provided for people in these circumstances. When we are looking at this issue we have to bear in mind that the whole array of costs borne by pensioners is ultimately reflected in the regular adjustment of pensions in line with the CPI. There is an argument as to whether the CPI is the appropriate measure of the costs of low income people. There are some items which we could say are overrepresented or underrepresented in the basket of goods consumed by low income people compared with others. But, on balance, the CPI has been assessed and found to be a broadly appropriate measure. So in a sense this transitional measure represents a measure over and above the normal adjustment that would flow through via indexation in any case. There is the broader issue of permanent telephone access and there are some significant barriers to that. My department and I are having some discussions with the communications portfolio to see what steps can be taken to improve access by low income people to telephones generally, not just to public telephones. That is a broader issue. It is an important one and we have it under consider: ation. Again, I come back to the basic point: for the coalition to be raising the issue of what we are doing for unemployed people and professing to be concerned about the situation of unemployed people and low income earners generally is pure hypocrisy of the worse kind. Family Law Mr ,KNOTT-My question is directed to the Attorney-General. In view of it being the International Year of the Family and last week being seniors week, what steps does the government propose to take to ensure that the welfare of children is paramount on the breakdown of marriage? In particular, will the government ensure that family law recognises the important role of grandparents in the love and care of grandchildren?",80
82,Mr LAVARCH,Unknown,"--:-The law as it currently stands allows grandparents to be parties to actions before the Family Court regarding access and custody of children. Obviously, from time to time grandparents avail themselves of their rights. However, the law asit currently stands makes no express reference to the rights of children to have ongoing contact with members of their extended family. That is an issue which the government is .looking at in terms of the broader review of the Family Law Act which is under way at the moment. When the government delivered its response to the parliamentary committee which looked into the Family Law Act and the Family Court, on the issue of access and custody we expressed a view broadly supporting the reforms which have been embodied in the United Kingdom that have done away with the terminology of custody and access. However, given that there was not sufficient material on this Illatter in Australia, I the Family Law Council to specifically look at the issue, which it has now done. In the last couple of days I have been handed its report, which is supportive of Australia going down the same path as now applies in the United Kingdom. As part of that, there will be a much greater emphasis on the processes of mediation as a mechanism to resolve family disputes. Indeed, as part of the report, which will become available to the public shortly, shows, the honourable member will see that when Marriage Guidance Australia, for instance, conducts its mediation in disputes revolving around children it specifically includes in the development of parenting plans a reference to ongoing conduct of children with extended family members and particularly makes reference to grandparents. So I believe that the concerns which the honourable member expressed are legitimate ones. While the law recognises the ability of grandparents to make applications now, it is an area which could be reformed to express a child's right to have continuing contact with extended family members, particularly in terms of the development of parenting plans which is strongly supported by the Family Law Council, and I think it will be looked upon favourably by the government. That will be an important part of this reform package. Australia Post: Payment of Union Officials",81
83,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,I ask the Minister for Industrial Relations whether he is aware that the salaries of a number of people working full time out of the head office of the Communications Workers Union in Sydney are funded in full out of the resources of Australia Post? What is the basis of this extraordinary arrangement? Is it part of the government's ongoing best practice policy? Does the government intend to facilitate a like service for employer organisations or for the other point of view of politics in Australia?,81
84,Mr BRERETON,Unknown,I am unaware of the circumstances that have been referred to by the honourable member for Bennelong. I will ascertain what the position is and advise the asked House. I think we should get that advice before we jump to any conclusions along the lines implied by the honourable member in his question. I will advise the House in due course on the details of this matter. China: Aid Program,81
85,Mr BARRY JONES,Unknown,"I direGt my question to the Minister' for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs. I refer to the current visit to Australia of China's ViceMinister for Science and, Technology, Deng Nan, in pursuit of a deeper understanding of Australia's scientific and technological capability and its relevance to the People 's Republic of China. Can the minister advise the House of what opportunities exist to showcase Australian technological expertise in China through the aid program? Mr Downer-There's no such verb as ·showcase'.",82
86,Mr BILNEY,Unknown,"This question comes particularly well from the honourable member for Lalor who, as I am sure honourable members of the House know,was OIice the minister for science and did more, I think, than· most people, not just within this House, when his appearances at the dispatch box were memorabIe, but also outside this House",82

89,Mr BILNEY,Unknown,"Mr Acting Speaker, I ask for Some protection from this constant interjecting. . Mr Acting SPEAKER.,-Order!, The minister will answer the question.",82
90,Mr BILNEY,Unknown,"Thank you, Mr Acting Speaker. I refer to this l!.dvisedly because Madam Deng, whose acquaintance I made today and who is an extraordinary women, also asked specifically to see the honourable member for Lalor. I believe that they met for some three.:quarters of an hour, in the course of which, I am told, Madam Deng said, that her father, who is of course a leading figure in China, had enjoyed the book that the honourable member for Lalor has written, Sleepers, wake! This has certainly woken the opposition up, and that is nice to see. When I met .with Madam Deng, I talked .about the issue which the honourable member raises: the way in which the development cooperati'on program can advance science and technology and can showcase-a verb that I am quite happy to use-Australia's expertise in that area. . , China, of course, has made spectacular economic progress in recent years, but it stilI remains the case that it has low GNP per capita and very substantial poverty, especially in rural areas and the inland provinces, In the coastal provinces, there are very many opportunities, of the kihd to which the honourable member refers, for Australia to be involved in developing infrastructure, including the provision of basic urban services, power and transport facilities, and, importantly, in ehvironmental protection and training, an area in which this country has very considerable comparative advantages. In the poorer areas inland, Australia can make a valuable contributionto overcome, development constraints in areas such as agriculture, heaIthand community services.' The aid program is an important way iri which we can expand our relationships with China, both at the political level - nd in the trading field. Our development cooperation program with Chihais the third largest we have, after those with Papua New Guinea and Indonesia. We spend around $80m in China, and a'major part of that is the cOlicessional finance facility . of around $48 million-DIFF, as it is known elsewhere. 'Th- program provides an'opportunity for technologically· advanced Australian firms to be' actively involved in China's development process. The experience that these firms have gained through the aid program has played a key role in facilitating future contracts. Indeed; a recent review of our development assistance' programs with China estimated that for every, $100 we spent on ,aid to China the return to Australia was around $300 both in terms of direct procurement and. follow-on.contracts which came ,about as a result of our ,having shown how technologically advanced we are. I will outline some examples of bilateral projects with major science and technology components. The institutional links program undertakes collaborative research projects at a number of Chinese universities. There is a mine waste management project which .includes an element for mine rehabilitation research. The Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research, ACIAR, is currently supporting 18 agricultural research projects with a total value of nearly $10 million in China and is exploring witlJ Madam Deng's agency an extension of activities in this area. I conclude by saying that Australia's aid program does a great deal to showcase Australian technology for export. Australian companies which have this kind of special technological expertise should ,not overlook the aid program as a key vehicle for promoting their long term commercial interests in China through sectors such .as health, educa.,. tion and community services. Home Child-care Allowance",82
91,Mr BRADFORD,Unknown,"My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security. I ask the minister to explain, perhaps SUCcinCtly, why the government's proposed home child-care allowance in reality amounts to a paltry $2,88 extra a week for families who are already in receipt of the dependent spouse rebate which is to be removed by the government? I ask the minister to also explain, again perhaps without raving, why a woman who cares for her own two children receives a maximum of around $30 a week, subject to a means test under the government's new scheme, while, if the same woman went to work, the government, by virtue of the child-care rebate, would a subsidise her $61 week, which is not means tested, to pay someone else to' care for her children? How does the government justify this continued discrimination against parents who make the decision to stay at home to care for their own young children?",83
92,Mr BALDWIN,Unknown,"I do not rave; that is a bit unfair. I make a few polemical points now and then, but that is legitimate. The honourable member for MCPherson said that the increase in the home child-care allowance is over and above the with child rate of DSR. That is not the only relevant consideration. Another facet of it, which is very important, is that some 55,000 low income families whose incomes are not sufficiently great for them to be able to benefit fully from a tax rebate in the form of the dependent spouse rebate will gain a benefit of up to $30 a week as a consequence of the introduction of the home child-care allowance. Some 800,000 or so families· get areal increase. Some 55,000 low income families get a benefit of up to $30 a week because their incomes are so low that they could not benefit fully from the tax rebate-the dependent spouse rebate. Another 120,000 families will benefit from the fact that the home child-care allowance is based on a current income test, rather than an annual test through the tax system. That means. that women, in the main, will. be able to move in and out of the work force and reclaim the benefit within the year,rather than have to wait until the end of the year in order to gain the benefit. So 120,000 or .so families - il1 derive a significant benefit in that way. Another key facet of the scheme is the fact that the payment is being made directly to the carer. That is a very beneficial and significant change. The analogy with child-care is ridiculous. What we are basically saying is that child-care is a work related expense and the' compensation that is being provided through the child-care rebate only covers a fraction of the cost of t]:tat. So it is not analogous in any way, shape or form to the home child-care allowance. On balance, the sorts of measures that the government is implementing represent a, very significant improvement for a very large number of Australian families, particularly those on low incomes caring full-time for children. . Children: Consumer Rights",83
93,Ms CRAWFORD,Unknown,'-My question is directed to the Minister for Consumer Affairs. Can the minister tell us what the government is doing to educate primary school children on their rights and responsibilities as consumers?,83
94,Ms MCHUGH,Unknown,"l certainly thank the honourable member for Forde for her question, which will be of particular interest to those opposite who care so much for things of benefit to children, particularly in. the International Year of the Family. The Bureau of Consumer Affairs discovered through its analysis that the children of Australia spend $3.3 billion each year. They themselves, or by influencing their familieS, are responsible for that enormous amount of expenditure. We decided that it would be very good idea indeed to educate of Australia about spending money. 'This is a unique program. which will go into every primary school in every electorate in Australthat is. It is a unique cooperative exercise between the federal governm-nt and every state and territory government and· the ABC, which has put in over $100,000 to do four television programs. The honourable member for Forde would be particularly pleased about the teachers'handyear's book, which will enable teachers each day take children through the sorts of things saw on television the night before, and teach them to be discerning about their purchases, to understand what advertisers are doing to understand that they are a target group for an enormous advertising. and marketing industry. As I said, this program is part of an initiative.in national curriculum going to every school in Australia. It will, International Year of the Family, be of benefit to those families whose expenditure is influenced by children who, in tum, have been influenced by the advertisers. It is an extremely good program and I think everyone will be pleased to see the children in their electorates benefit from it. Pensioners: Country of Origin",83
95,Mr NEVILLE,Unknown,My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security. I refer the improvement.. minister to a current campaign by his department to have. Australians of ethnic origin claim pensions. from their country ()f origin where social. security agreements exist. Is minister aware that the tone of these letters causing extreme concern to ethnic Australians with limited language skills? Mr Cleeland-Have you found them?,84
96,Mr NEVILLE,Unknown,This is a matter of some importance to ethnic Australians. The honourfederal able member might. well laugh. Mr BaFry Jones-We are al1 ethnic.,84
97,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! The hono-ra6le mfmiber for Hinklerwill try to ignore the interjections and finish his quesa tion, and the honourable member for Lalor the children might assist.",84
98,Mr NEVILLE,Unknown,"'-Is the minister also aware that some ethnic Australians genuinely believe non-compliance with the· department's requests will damage their residency status. Does the minister approve of such insensitive wording; for example, 'If you don't send· it back, we might stop your Australian pension.'?",84
99,Mr BALDWIN,Unknown,"It was a decision in last budget that people who were entitled to to receive pension income from an agreement they country--'-a country with which we have a social security agreerrient---would be required to claim it to receive their Australian pension. and That does produce some savings but I think it is 'an entirely legitimate thing for us to be doing. It will produce,like the deeming provision of a few years ago;. benefits to both the Australian government in revenue terms .and individual pensioners if they are able to claim an income they otherwise would not be particularly in the able to obtain. I do not know whether the honourable member for Hinkler is objecting to the substantive measure. As I understood it, this is not a measure that the coalition opposeq, when these matters were being considered in the parliament. I. think there js some legitimate con<;ern in relation to the tenor of advice. I have asked the department to review the tone of some advices that are being sent out. I think there·. is some significant room for . . Honourable members should bear in mind that in these sorts of cases there is a bit of the tension between trying to achieve clarity and is a lack of ambiguity in the wording of an advice and the fact that people have to understand very clearly what the consequences of various provisions are. These things have. to be made very clear and I suggest that. this is particularly important in relation to people from non-English speaking backgrounds. workers. Having said that, I accept that we need to try to achieve wording, which ,is sensitive and which does not appear threatening. It is always easy to reconcile those two objectives but I think we can make some significant improvement in that area. As I have said, have asked the department to review the wording of the advices that are sent out social security clients with a view to avoiding the sort of complaint that the honourable member for Hinkler has received. Chemicals: TGIC",84
100,Mr FERGUSON,Unknown,"My question is adpotenti-l dressed to the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations. Is the minister aware of the Adminrecommended istrative Appeals Tribunal decision regarding the assessment report for the chemicalTOIC prepared by the, national industrIal chemicals notification and assessment scheme through Worksafe Australia? Whalare the implicathis tions of that decision and will it help to safeguard the health and safety of Australian workers?",85

102,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,Unknown,The minister advise will ignore the interjections and answer the question.' ',85
103,Mr JOHNS,Unknown,"There is now a clear recompational mendation by a Commonwealth a!Jthority on the correct labelling for triglycidycase. lisocyanurate, which means b-tter information and safety for workers who are handling chemical. The background to this was that eiba-Geigy had disputed the director's r(!commendation on the chemical that it be labelled toxic and may cause heritable genetic damage. So it is a very serious chemical. It is a very serious case as the chemical is wfdely used in Australia as a powder coating on metal finishings, such as metal furniture, car parts and electrical appliances. So it is important that we have clarification as to how this particular chemical would be labelled, and may proceed. therefore used, for the safety of Australian In my mind, the decision by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal endorses the integrity not of the Commonwealth's industrial chemicals , notification and assessment scheme. Further to that, the assessment report is the first I comprehensive assessment in the world of the toxicology of, and' exposure to, TOIC.

I am'disappointed that Ciba-Geigy held up the assessment for 10 months. For 10 months it disputed that such a chemical should be'labelled toxic and may cause heritable genetic damage.

109,Mr BALDWIN,Unknown,"No. It was 2 March. My department has a policy of post-payment checking of accounts, including AGeC transactions, to monitor payments for integrity and effectiveness. Under current departmental instructions at the end. of each month a random sample of paid vouchers IS selected for checking. A computer based package is currently being developed which will provide a more efficient checking mechanism. A review of all current AGCC cardholders in my department is being conducted and this will include checking the number of cardholders per area or division, the credit limit of each cardholder and the amount of purchases paid by each cardholder. The department has devolved substantial responsibility for financial management. to division heads and area managers. Exercise of this responsibility is framed by formal secretary's instructions, section 2AB of the Audit Act and section 1 of the Finance Directions. These managers are charged with the responsibility to ensure that training commensurate with the level of purchasingactivity is provided for officers exercising expenditure approval authorisations and using the AGCC. They are also required to certify that this obligation has been fulfilled and that annual reviews of the needs of staff to exercise these authorisations are undertaken.

I have in my posession three pay records commencing on 30 June 1993 and extending to 26 January i994 of three individuals, all of whom are being passed off as far as the financial records of Australia Post are concerned as employees of Australia Post and as performing the normal duties of eniployeesof Australia Post. The people in question are D.J .. MCCartney, J.W. Delohery and S.O. Watts. I seek leave to table these pay sheets. Leave granted.",93
144,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"They are pay sheets which record faithfully and meticulously that these peopleMr O'C-mnorWhere did you get them? . Mr HOWARD-The honourable member for Corio should not mind where I got them. The question is what the Labor government is going to do about the rorting of the funds of the Australian taxpayer. Australian taxpayers are fed up with the pockets of his mates being lined with their dough. That is basically what is happening. The first· person, Mr Watts, is described as working at Parramatta post office. The second person, Mr MCCartney, is described .as working at the SouthPenrith mail delivery centre. The third person, Mr J.W. Delohery, is described as working at the Roseville post office. None of those people work at any of those locations. My information is. that they have been working full time in the union office for almost 12 months. It is not enough that this government will shamefully and openly deliver almost $15 million in direct grants to trade unions around Australia for purposes that bear no relationship to the ordinary and legitimate interests of Australian trade· unions. This mob opposite, through government business undertakings, has gotto fund the political activities of union organisers. .. I will also be tabling for the .benefit House some documents which clearly demonstrate that each of these three people has been engaged in full-time union organising activities over the past 12 months; I have some minutes of an industrial participation meeting that took place on Wednesday, 25 August at Leichhardt. It involved the said Mr Watts, who is described as being present, and the representative of the CWU. The meeting related to the Leichhardt post office's industrial participation committee. Quite· clearly, this man is engaged in the ordinary activities of a union organiser. There is nothing wrong with that provided his salary is paid by the union. I arri sure the New South Wales division of the Liberal Party would love the salary of its state directors to be paid by the federal government. I am sure the executive director of the Australian Council of .Commerce and Industry would love his salary to be paid by the federal government. But no. We are mugs; our salaries are paid out of the contributions of members . That little technicality does not concern the Keating government. It says, 'That is only a minor technical detail. We'll rort the system and fix that. We'll get Australia Post to pay their salaries'. Mr Miles-Fraud!",94
145,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"It is absolute fraud on the Australian taxpayer. Unless there is some explanation for this which is not apparent, this is a straight deceit· and fraud on the Australian taxpayer. It is typical of a government that has been in power for so long that it has lost the capacity to distinguish between right arid wrong. It no longer has the capacity to distinguish between right and wrong. My colleague the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) eloquently said on another occasion that the government cannot distinguish between public duty and private interest. The only thing that matters with. the crowd opposite is that it rorts the system perpetually, day in and day out, for its own political advantage.

The last thing people who have anything to do with the New South Wales Right do is pay for their employees out of their own pocket. If they can get the poor, long-suffering taxpayer to pay their salaries, they do. What has happened on this occasion is just another example of the way in which this government has been prepared to dance to the tune of the trade union movement of Australia. There is no real difference between the partisan poHtical interests of the. Australian trade union· movement, the AustraHan Labor Party and the normal day-today activities of the government of Australia. At every tum this government will do the bidding of the union. I know what has happened on this occasion: the union has gone along to the management of Australia Post and said, 'Look, we are a bit short of funds this year and we need some blokes to make sure the right wing ticket gets re-elected at the union election'. The honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) is grinning over there because, as a former trade union official, he knows dam well that I am right.. He gives him-e1f away.

MrHOWARD,--1 suppose. bikes are provided as well in order for them to go around and gather the vote. This is only the tip of the ieeberg of the sorts of activities that have been going on. This is absolutely the latest example of just how this government dances to the tune of the trade union movement. We have seen two other examples in the last 48 hours. We have seen the disgraceful indication, not disabused by the answer he gave at question time today, from the Minister for Industrial Relations. that the employees' register is coming back for the recruitment of waterfront labour. The employees' register equals preference for existing waterfront employees. So what the government is going t() do is reintroduce preference for existing waterfront employees.. They will be the only people in Australia who will be gl,laranteecl a job for life. As one of my colleagues interjected yesterday, if the government is prepared to do that for the wharf labourers, why is it not prepared to do it for the cab drivers? I think one of the reasons might be that some cab drivers vote Liberal. Mr Costello-Oh, they don't, do they?",95
149,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"I think one or. two of them do. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) tells me that many of them . vote Liberal because of the acquaintance that he has struck up with them over recent months; him into This is the latest example; Another example was the absurd declaration by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mi Crean) that he was going to use the financial power of the Commonwealth to prevent the Victorian and Western Australian governments legislating to outlaw the nefarious practice of compulsory student unionism. Both of those governments wereelected with a mandate to abolish compulsory student unionism. Compulsory student unionism is an affront to the indiyidual liberty of Australian university students. For years it been the policy of the federal parliamentary Liberal Party and also the Liberal parties in many-I regret to say not all""':""states of Australia. I stress that. To their very great credit, the Court and Kennett governments have been prepared to act on this issue. What does the Minister for Employment, Education and Training do? He comes along here and says, 'This is outrageous. This is dreadful. We cannot allow people to. have individual freedom. We cannot allow people to make a choice as to whether they are going to join a union. So we are going to use the financial power of the Commonwealth to intervene and to stop them doing it'. We have the intervention in relation to students and we have the intervention in relation to the waterfront.

The Australian taxpayer wants to know: how many more hundreds of examples of this fraud are dotted around Australia? This is only the tip of the iceberg. You can bet your last dollar, you can bet your last union ticket, that if this is happening in Australia Post it is happening all around Australia and it is happening with any number of unions. It is a scam; it is a fraud on the Australian taxpayer. It is typical of the contemptible attitude that the Labor Party and the Keating government have towards the trust they hold on behalf of the Australian people. It is just another example of the imperial, arrogant indifference that this Prime Minister and his mates display towards the interests of the ordinary, average Australian.

158,Mr JOHNS,Unknown,"Petrie-Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters) (4.18 p.m.)-What a wicked web the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) weaves. He has sought to introduce an allegation-we are as pleased as anyone else to have it checked out-and on the basis of that one alIegation suggested that the Commonwealth government does the bidding only of the trade union movement. That is absolutely incorrect. I have no knowledge whatsoever of Watts, MCCartney and Delohery. Let me make that quite clear. I have no information whatsoever as to the relationship between those employed by Australia Post and those employed by the Communication Workers Union. On the basis of that one allegation, he seeks to broaden the gamut and suggest that we simply do the bidding of the trade union movement. Let me suggest this to him: he talks about the return to the dark days as if somehow we produced them in industrial relations, as if somehow we produc-d the sort of mayhem that was caused in the 1980s in industrial relations. As was mentioned today in question time, one measure of a good deal in industrial relations is the number of strikes or the number of working days lost. Surely that is the measure of good industrial relations. If Commonwealth were to be doing the bidding of the unions in getting down the number of working days lost, I would not care. If we have few industrial disputes, that is good for business, and I thought that is what those people opposite were about. The number of working days lost per thousand employees in 1993 was the lowest recorded since 1933-the lowest reported in 60 years. The number of disputes last year was the lowest since 1942. With that level of objective evidence, there can be no suggestion whatsoever that the relationship between the Commonwealth and the trade union movement is such as to damage the Australian economic fabric. So what is the point that the honourable member makes? I cannot help on that. Beyond the allegation, his arguments fall flat. There is nothing he has to say to us or to the Australian community about industrial relations. Let me give him some other evidence. He mentioned that millions of dollars were spent on the trade union movement for its purposes. He was probably referring to programs like the workplace reform program. In that initiative we spent money with the trade union movement and employers in order to get greater productivity, greater efficiency, improved industrial relations and to make more effective use of people. Let me give some figures to show how the millions of dollars are spent in that program. These are the programs that make enterprises and businesses more effective, efficient and profitable as well as give people better working lives. We do not siphon it off to the trade union movement. Quite openly and publicly, we have indicated the sorts of assistance we will give to the trade unions and the employers. In the workplace reform program, at the national level the grants approved in 1992-93 to employers totalled $645,000. Our friends, the trade union movement, received only $113,000. So it is patent nonsense to suggest, by inference in this case, that we have used Commonwealth money-that is, taxpayers' money-to assist the trade union movement. Beyond the allegations, it is clear from the published evidence that we have given most the of the money in this program to the employers-despite the fact that it takes two to tango. There is no way we can get more productive workplaces in this country and better industrial relations until both parties to the agreement dance to the same tune. In this case, workplace reform program grants, which are our major vehicle for improving industrial relations, gave $600,000 to the employers but just over $100,000 to the unions. The 1993-94 figures indicate a similar balance. For some reason, I have got only state figures. In ViCtoria, $134,000 was spent on the unions and $193,000 on the employers. The point is that we sought constantly to invoke the goodwill of both employers and unions to ensure we had better and more productive workplace relations. The runs on the board for productivity and output and for the low level of dispute. Let me come to that. other furphy that somehow a list now exists on the waterfront to give preference in employment. That is so. I have introduced a bill-that is what is all about-which concerns levying the stevedores in order that they repay the loans they made to make redundancy payments for waterside workers. Over 5,000 waterside workers have left the waterside in the last years. I think that is over 57 per cent of waterfront. Out of that comes a stream of productivity improvements which I will able to read to the House. More importantly, specifically in the bill, the register of waterside workers for the purposes related to levy collection will removed. The list as we know it, which in the furphy. old days was used for preference in employment, will not exist. The list, to the extent that it was used to raise a levy to pay back the amount of money that the stevedores borrowed to pay people out, does not exist. There will be a new list of those employed simply because it is a convention within the International Labor Organisation that some list should be in existence. It will not detercontainers mine preference of employment. Both the Maritime Union of Australia and the stevedortime ing employees know that. I think what you are confusing here-I give you the benefit saying that you are confused; I think you are deliberately misreading the situation",97
159,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,I and think it would facilitate the proceedings addressed your remarks through the chair. I think it will not attract flies and interjections.,98
160,Mr JOHNS,Unknown,"Over a decade ago and more, waterside workers were employed on a tb-day basis and in those days a list was kept. If the only security of employment people had was to have some preference when they as turned up at 5 o'clock in the morning to and be paid that day-some of my brothers and my father have worked under . these conditions-I suppose to have a list of preference was not a bad idea. No-one works on the waterside in that manner now. These people are permanently employed. We have taken are them from an industry basis of employment, as existed in the old days,· to' an enterprise basis of employment, as is true of nearly every other worker. So keep this in mind: we now have permanot nently employed. people and we have far this fewer permanently employed people on the waterside than was once the case. There will also be a list kept of those now employed, but it will not state that those people are to be given preference in employment because they two are employed on a permanent basis. We have the achieved that with the trade union movement. It. always sought a situation of permanent be employment and no-one ever wanted to run under the old system of day labour when it was not a bad idea to have a list for prefer"": ence in employment. So the list raised by the be honourable member for Bennelong was a The sort of productivity that we have been able to get out of the waterfront as a result of these changes will come as good news to the Australian economy. There has been a 57 per cent reduction in the work force while handling similar levels of cargo in the peak period of 1989; Australian grain ports are now amongst the most efficient in the world; handled per person per shift have increased by 127 per cent; ship .turnaround has peen reduced by around 45 per cent; and containers handled per gross crane hour of at container terminals have increased. by 57 per cent. It is estimated that the. recurrent annual savings from reduced work force-ize faster turnaround of container ships are at if you least $300 million. That is· some pay-off for having a good relationship with the trade union movement! That is hardly having the trade unionmovedayment pulling the strings of the Commonwealthgovemment· There are· runs on the board: productivity gains and dollars earned a result of a mature relationship between work the Commonwealth and the trade union movement. So it is a nonsense to suggest that a list. exists on the wharf for the purposes of preferential treatment; it is a nonsense to suggest that the changes we have made on the wharf have not produced some marvellous improvements in productivity; and it is a nonsense to suggest that somehow the very close and' proper relationship between the Commonwealth and the trade union movement is soured across all fronts as a result of one allegation. Let me make it also clear-this is something that those opposite will never ever be able to undo, should' they ever come to power-that in almost every meeting in ev-ry department or under every program throughout the Commonwealth now, there are tripartite agreements or tripartite councils. That is, the trade union movement, employers and the government meet together to nut out agreements in all sorts of areas throughout the length and breadth of the Commonwealth. That is maturity and, what is more, it has become a culture. It is the way we now govern. We should have the major social partners in the Australian economy, employers and employees, sitting down not just to debate an industrial relations matter. We have broadened the gamut. The ACTU helped us to broaden that gamut because it suggested that there is more to life than a simple bargain or a simple wage rate-and there is more to life than that. Workers want more than a particular number of dolll:;\rs in their pay packets at the end of the week, fortnight or month. They want to kno-that there are other ways in which they can be protected, saved or whatever. What about those protections? The honourable member for Bennelong has said, endlessly now for some months, that the new Industrial Relations Reform Act will not only give all protections to employees-and there is nothing wrong with that-but also that somehow it was written at the express behest of the ACTU and every dot, full stop, crossed '1', the lot, was written by it. That is not true. Honourable members will remember very clearly that the trade unions wanted, for instance, under what we call the new enterprise flexibility agreements, a situation where they could veto an agreement which was essentially between non-union workers and an employer. Now that is not the case. Honourable members should read the act. The act says that, in negotiations or in the writing of an agreement between a non-unionised or a predominantly non-unionised workshop and a boss or employer, a relevant union should be notified, but it has no veto. I remember that that was a pretty tough old debate between the Commonwealth government and the trade union movement. But it was our view that the trade union movement should not have a veto over those sorts of agreements-:and the act says that it shall not have a veto over those sorts of agreements. So we are hardly doing the bidding of the trade union movement in that particular instance which relates to a very large section of the new Industrial Relations Reform Act. It does give the opportunity to the trade union movement to go out and seek new work, to do what it has learned best over 70 years or so of operation-and that is to become good advocates for workers before the Industrial Relations Commission or to represent, directly to employers, the needs and wants of the employed work force. The trade union movement is an expert at that, so why should it not buy into this whole new stream of enterprise flexibility agreements so as to allow that expertise to be used? But it is not compulsory. People do not have to call the union in, but if they are bright they will. If they want Some good advocates, they should call up their union. If they are employed under an award and are not in a union, they should get in touch with the Commonwealth or its equivalent, ,the state department of industrial relations"" find out which union covers that award and come in and ask it for assistance. In conclusion, the honourable member for Bennelong has suggested that one allegation he has raised somehow sullies us or proves the point that he puts forward-that we work and operate only at the behest of the trade union movement. I have now suggested that is a nonsense and have done so categorically. (Time expired)",98
161,Mr SHARP,Unknown,"I am very pleased that the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Johns) has decided to take up the allegations that were made by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) earlier today in his address on this matter of public importance. In the process of the assistant minister taking up those allegations .and· investigating them, I hope that he will find out, for the benefit of honourable members of this House and for the people of Australia, and in particular the taxpayers of Australia- how much and for how long these people are being p'aid. This is a very important issue that the opposition raises today because the relationship between the trade union movement of Australia and the Australian Labor Party is such that they are one .and the same; the two bodies are intertwined. We all· know, as the honourable member for Bennelong pointed out in his address,· that there are substantial taxpayers' funds being directed by this government to the trade union movement. While the assistant minister is checking out the points raised by the honourable member for Bennelong, he might also like to try to find out how much of that. $15 million,given to the trade union movement ,by this government over recent times, has trickled back to the Australian Labor Party in the form of donations from those trade unions. I think we would all be interested to find that out. I am sure that it would amount to a lot of moneytaxpayers' money being redirected, to the Labor Party via the trade union movement.",99
162,Mr TUCKEY,Unknown,Plus human resources.,100
163,Mr SHARP,Unknown,"And, of course, as has been pointed out to me, the resources, paid for by the taxpayer and lent to the Labor Party during election time, are considerable. The opposition, by raising this matter today in the parliament, is trying to draw to the attention of the people of Australia this very close and incestuous relationship between the Australian Labor Party and the trade union movement of Australia. This is of great concern to us. If look right throughqut the industrial landscape today, we will see how that incestuous relationship works-not to the benefit of ordinary Australians, not to the benefit of those people who have not got a job, but to the benefit of trade unions and their members. There is nb greater example of that incestuous relationship working for the benefit of a privileged few than that which we have seen on the Australian waterfront over the last few years. Whilst the assistant minister is checkingout his facts, he might also like to take some time to study the history and nature of the Australian waterfront. From what he has been' saying to the House this afternoon, he obviously does not understand it. In particular, he obviously does not understand the consequence of the legislation that he himself has brought before ,this House-legislation which has been highlighted in recent days by both the honourable member for Bennelong and me and which· appals every one of the stevedores in Australia today. They, unlike the assistant minister, understand the conse.,. quences of what this government is trying to do. Over the last few years, we have seen the government authorise the payment of $450 million-half of it taxpayers' money and the other half raised by a levy imposed not on the, stevedores, as the minister was trying to point out, but indeed on theusersbf the waterfront, the exporters and importers-to those 4,000odd wharfies who have taken redundancy packages. That money was paid out to people who were formerly wharfies to get· them to retire. It was paid out on the basis that. the union would agree to anlimber of work practice reforms at the waterfront. The union agreed to those changes and the principal change, of course, was that the industry would go from being an·industry wide based organisation, where basically everybody worked for nobody, with employers having to take people out of a PQol, to being .one that was focused on an enterprise: So Conausf employed'people who worked solely for Conaust, or Austnllian Stevedores employed people who worked solely for Austra1i-n Stevedores., This was a good step forward, a step forward that the stevedores were prepared to take, on the basis we that the union agreed to it and stood by it. This government; of course, is going in the exact' opposite direction of that. But- of course, the union took the $450 million. It negotiated a 23 per cent pay rise for those who continued to work on the waterfront after the reform program had finished, leaving those people who. worked on the. waterfront with take-home pay in excess of $90,000 per annum for a work week that mostof us here in this place would complete before Tuesday afternoon. Those are the deals that were struck: a 23 per cent pay rise and a $450 millien payout to former wharfies to get them to retire, on the basis that the government stuck to its guns and the union stuck to the agreement that it had made with the employers. .What we see now is a complete reversal of that. Under the legislation that the assistant minister introduced into this House, the government is re-establishing a register. It 'is a register not just of perynanent employees, as the assistant minister tried to indicate in his speech. He must understand that it is a register of all people who work on the waterfront, whether they are permar;tent or casual workers. Many people who work on the Australian waterfront ip big ports, .little ports and mediple um-sized ports are casual. workers. The whole purpose behind the re-establishment· of the register is to ensure that the trade unions know precisely who is working at what port, for how long and for whom. This gives them more control. The assistant m.inister said, 'We are.not doing this to try to.givewharfies some form of preference; we are doing it to complete. our obligations under International Labour Organisation convention 137. Article 3, point 2 of ILO convention 137 sta-es': Registered dockworkers shall have priority of engagement for dock work. That is the convention:' that the assistant minister. is introducing into this House as a result of the government's legislation. That is the exact opposite of what' the ""assistant minister said in his speech today and,. indeed, it is the exact opposite of what .the Minister for .Industrial Relations' (Mr Brereton) has been'saying. We are seeing a gradual erosion of the benefits that the employers of wharf labourers achieved out of the, waterfront reform process-aprocess which saw all of that. $450 million go to the wharfies and which saw those who remain get a 23 per cent pay rise. We are seeing the erosion of productivity gains. ' Interestingly enough, during the waterfront reform 'process there was an increase in productivity from a very low base-from 12 containers orTEUs per hour, in some cases, up to 18 TEUs per hour. That isa 50 per cent increase, which we heard the minister tout during his speech earlier today. Let me tell the minister that now that the unions have got the money-the $450 million-and the workers who remain have their 23 per cent pay rise, those productivity levels have dropped back. For example, the Port of Sydney has gone from 19 TElJsper hour to 14 TEUs per hour; the Port of Melbourne has gone from 27 TEUs per hour to 19 TEUs per hour. Is that the sort of-productivity increase we should be proud of? Is that the sort of productivity increase we should expect from a $450mi\.lion pl,lyout-h<llf of which is from th- taxpayers, with the rest being paid by the consumers of Australia? No, it.is not. What we see With, that example and with the examof the legh:;lation that this, minister has introduced into .this House is an attempt. to grab ba.ck all of. the good things' that our waterside workers used to. enjoy before the waterfront reform process. was enacted. If we think that the sports rortsaffair which dealt with the allocation of $30 ""million of taxpayers funds was a scandal, the $450 million which has been paid out to retiring wharfies is the scandal of this century. We have never seen such a greater misuse of taxpayers' 'funds for so little gain. It is this point that the opposition is raising because we are concerned that the taxpayers of Australia, thr<,mgh the incestuously close relationship between the trade unions and the Labor Party, are being ripped off unm-rcilessly. The beneficiaries are not ordinary Australians or Pt'fQple seeking a job; it is those .who are members of unions like the former Waterside Workers Fedenition, now the Maritime Union of Australia. They are the ones who are harming Australia, in cohorts with their partners-the ALP iii government here.",100
164,Mr TANNER,Unknown,"I understand that, the honourable member for Bennelong' (Mr Howard) was a solicitor in a previous life. I sincerely hope that when leaves this place he does not intend to resume practice; if he does I hope that none of prospective clients were watching his perunionism. formance this afternoon. Some extremely flimsy evidence and material has been put before the House today to support accusations about a . particular matter relating to the Communication Workers Union in Sydney. I have an open mind about the matters raised by the honourable member for to Bennelong. Certainly I, like the Assistant Minister for Industrial· Relations (Mr Johns), do not know any of the specifics. I suggest that it is drawing something of a long suggest that, simply because Senator Richardsupposed son has some sort of past connection with this union-for example, his father-that therefore means he is in some way directly, beyond portfolio responsibilities, involved. I also suggest that the honourable will need something more than what he' has stated to the House today to convince me that the work that these people are' engaged in is in fact overwhelmingly or totally work for the union. I am aware of a reverse situation: union official in the same union who is paid by the union is currently working on Australia Post premises, presumably as a result enterprise bargaining. Therefore, on the face of it, what the honourable member puts staff forward will not necessarily be the case. I also suggest to the honourabl.e member, as somebody who has had fairly extensive experience in union election campaigns and missal who has been involved centrally in some of the most bitterly fought union election camfederal paigns in recent history in this country, that to suggest that having someone on the payroll for 18 months prior to a union election employee, campaign is related to those elections drawing something of a long bow. The honaccording ourable member will need to come forward worry about. with some slightly-more substantial evidence than. that I find it quite )aughable that he stumbled two-thirds of the way through his speech. had to refer to the student movement. In order to sustain the proposition we have before the continued willingness of the Keating government to bow to the unreasonable a he demands of the trade union movement-the honourable member. for Bennelong put forhis ward matters relating to voluntary student He referred to an issue on which, to the best of my knowledge, the trade union movement-as distinct from the student union movement-has probably made no submissions whatsoever to the federal government. I suggest to the honourable member that that issue is of relatively low concern and priority the trade union movement generally, even thoughIsuspect it would be supportive of the view that I take. Therefore, if he can find . only an issue of that nature to cite as an bow to example of the trade union movement's hold on the Keating government, he . is in desperate trouble in regard to evidence. As I said, if the honourable member is to his have prospective clients when he takes his failed career out of this place and goes back to his. former occupation, I suggest he will member have to fix up his game. I will refer to a couple of the matters that the opposition has raised in other debates on this issue. In light of changes to the industrial a relations legislation there has been some hysteria with respect to unfair dismissals. Outrageous suggestions have been made by of Mr Catahzariti with respect to companies supposedly being asked to get in first, to sack before being subject to any form of due process about whether or not it has been done fairly. The key issue is fairness. I have been involved in many unfair discases, particularly in the Victorian state jurisdiction; I also had involvement in the jurisdiction. The core issue at all times is: has the employer a legitimate reason-such as poor performance-for dismissing the or has it been completely arbitrary, is unjust and _unfair? If employers operate to those rules, they have nothing to Suggestions have been made about the appointment of Mr lain Ross as the new person in charge of enterprise bargaining. I He have had a fair bit to do with Mr lain Ross. I could say fairly accurately that he is widely usrespected across the trade union movement and by employers. It is not an easy thing for senior trade union official in the ACTU to have pretty well universal respect across the trade union movement. It is almost as hard as a Liberal leader having· complete respect across his or her ownbackbenchers. In the trade union movement, with all the internal battles and competition over members and the like, it is extremely difficult for· somebody to have that respect; Mr lain Ross has that respect. He is a very worthwhile appointment to that position. I find the suggestion that the trade union movement is in some way controlling the federal government a bit laughable. It was not so long ago that I was a trade union official dealing with the federal government and fighting battles with the federal government. We fought battles over deregulation of the airlines and we lost. We fought battles over the sale of Australian Airlines and Qantas and we lost. We fought battles over things like enterprise bargaining and section 118A of the Industrial Relations Act· and demarcation issues, and we lost. There are many instances where the trade union movement and particular unions, such as the one I was involved in, have put positions to the government and lost. In the latest round of changes to the industrial relations legislation, the trade union movement did not want sections 45D and E of the Trade Practices Act; it did not want any common law torts with respect to industrial action. Did it achieve those objectives? No. So the suggestion that the trade union movement is dominating or controlling the agenda of this government is absolutely, completely unfounded. What is really going on is that once again· we have the honourable member for Bennelong strutting his stuff as a potential leadership contender. Here we· have Lazarus lying on the slab with the old valve spluttering away thinking, 'Oh my God, the triple bypass is finally coming-something I thought was not possible is here'. So he is among the bitter and twisted constituency that the Liberal Party has somewhere out there, which thinks that trade unions are the source. of all - vil, whipping up the hysteria again. Then we have 'Dame' Bronwyn and her apprentice the mad monk, in the two seats in Sydney where there are by-election campaigns masquerading as the most royalist people that the British empire has ever seen. She is fantasising about her potential future in this place and things of the past that really are of no relevance to the Australian people. Then we have 'Bertie Wooster in short pants campaigning for the abolition of all taxesand maybe for things like the reintroduction of gaiters and spats-and telling us that he is a progressive conservative. That is somebody who can walk forwards and backwards at the same time. Can honourable members tell me what a progressive conservative is? Then we have Prince Valiant, the workers' friend.",101
165,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Mr Rocher)Order! The honourable member can get back to the subject.,103
166,Mr TANNER,Unknown,"I will get to the point. It is pertinent that I am now referring to somebody who presents himself as a friend of the workers,who would see himself as somebody seeking a blue-collar constituency. But he has one hand patting them on the back and the other harid in their pocket That is what the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) is on about. If the honourable member for . Higgins is suggesting that the· Liberal Party has a potential constituency amongst blue':' collar workers and at the same time saying to those low paid workers, 'We want to remove the protections from you; we want to allow your employer to exploit you to the maximum extent possible; we want to leave you up to the· freedom of the marketplace, the situation where you can bargain on a supposedly equal basis as an individual with your powerful wealthy employer' - then he is deluding himself. As I have said, the honourable member for Bennelong is givirig his leadership pretensions a run. I was disappointed today; he has been in better form on previous instances. He actually raised few issues that have to be debated. He had to throw in the student movement today in order to fill up his 15 minutes. . The other factor behind this is the fact that the Liberal Party and the National Party want to lower wages for the lower paid and for the industrially weak. That is the consequence of their policy; that is what they are on about. They suggest that this will create jobs. Yet the United Kingdom, which has an absolutely deregulated labour market as a result of 15 years of Thatcherism, has had its unemployment rate increase under that regime and its rate is certainly no bett-r than ours. In Victoria, which under Labor had a better employment situation than the rest of the nation, see that since Jeff Kennett has been in office with his new industrial regulation system that move: state is now getting to the stage where it is challenging Tasmania for the position of having the worse unemployment record in the country. All this has occurred since Mr ation Kennett introduced his marvellous legislation, which effectively largely dereguAlbion lates the labour market. If they were about cutting wages, as the Liberal Party and the National Party are, to create jobs and even if that produced the result that they claim, we would still have situation where the people in our community who can least afford to pay would be bearing the cost. They oppose taxation, they want leave the wealthy people not paying their way. They are the parties of the tax avoiders, the rorters. They are the parties who want see those lower down the scale bear the full cost of fixing unemployment. Their constitucertify ency-what is left of it-will get free. I suggest to the House that this matter is nonsense and we should have· no further dealing with it.",103

In December 1985, the then minister for defence announced the closure of the factory following a review of all defence a explosives factories which recommended that capabilities be transferred to the factory in Mulwala, New South Wales. In 1992 the Austo tralian Defence Industries industrial decontaminationdivision was contracted to clean up the site in accordance with the state laws, to which included the appointment of an approved independent environmental auditor to that the land is suitable for developaway scot ment or other purposes. Site decontamination to date has largely involved the excavation and removal of the contaminated soil to registered landfill sites. 175 hectares has been remediated and as suitable for residential development. The progressive decontamination of the remaining area of the property is expected to be completed around 1997-98. A strategy for the release of the site has not yet been finalised. The first step has been the revision of a 1989 cabinet endorsed land use concept plan in light of the changing environmental and market circumstances. While the release and redevelopment of the property are important issues, the proposal to be considered by the PWC will focus on the decontamination of the area of the property, including soils being stockpiled for later treatment. The area under consideration is the most contaminated and together with the remediation of stockpile soils will be the most costly to clean up. Although difficult to estimate accurately, the total cost of the decontamination project in the worse case could be up to $57 million with some $15 million having been spent to 30 June 1993. Clearly, there is still a major amount of work to be done at Albion. I commend the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative.

Ordered that the report be printed.",105
175,Mr BEVIS,Unknown,"by leave-It is my pleasure to table, on behalf of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, the committee's. report entitled Buying our future. This is the first report of.the committee's inquiry into Australian government purchasing policies and the promotion of Australian-made goods and services: I use the term 'first report' advisedly, since there are many important issues which have emerged during the inquiry which the committee has not had the chance to fully explore. These include the systems immigration panel and the important area of GBE purchasing. The committee will also be keen to follow changes in government purchasing now under way and proposed by the committee. There are a number of serious problems with the way Commonwealth purchasing is carried out. These relate to . both the policy and its implementation. A major result of these problems is that the capaciiy ofgovemment. purchasing to. assist in the development of the Australian economy is largely being squandered. The prime objective of Commonwealth purchasing is to achieve value for money. The central operating principle is stated to. be open and effective competition.· Those are the topics of'the first and second Commonwealth procurement guidelines. The subject of the 12th guideline-and I emphasise '12th' - is how to maximise competitive opportunities for Australian and New Zealand suppliers. The ranking of the guidelines would appear to be more than coincidental. The committee received a substantial body of evidence that government buyers still usually interpret value for money as meaning buying the cheapest product. That is hardly surprising. Decentralisation and devolution of purchasing responsibility have resulted in an explosion in the number of people involved in purchasing in government departments. Whilst not all are required to undertake whole of life costing, many who should are poorly trained and ill-equipped to carry out a whole of life cost benefit analysis, let alone ·to evaluate the broader benefits that can flow to the Australian economy from purchasing locally. A number of barriers for local suppliers were raised in evidence. These inClude the wording of tender specifications so that overseas suppliers are naturally favoured, the cost of tendering and the complexity of documentation. In many product or service categories, Australian suppliers are small by comparison with· their overseas competitors. Factors such .ascost or administrative plexity have a disproportionate effect on small firms. The committee has. therefore recomrequire mended a number of measures to help overlevel come the problems suffered by small-or es, medium-sized enterprises in gaining access government .procurement. These include setting aside 10 per cent of government procurement for small to medium sized enterprises and requiring agencies to provide justification where purchases under $10,000 are not made from smallor medium-sized enterprises .. The overwhelming weight of evidence supports the view that maximising opportunities for Australian and New Zealand suppliers is the least understood and least implemented guideline in the purchasing process. This . guideline specifically states that, although the aim is to maximise opportunities for ANZ suppliers, it is not the aim to maximise ANZ content of purchases. The wording encourages a purchasing culture which pays no more than lip-service to maximising economic benefit to . Australia. Personally, I find the sentiments conveyed by this part of the guideline to be not just ill-conceived arid misplaced; as a member of our national parliament I find it offensive. . The committee was surprised to find that little information was available on the investment and employment multipliers associated with increasing local procurement. Calculation of the benefits to the Australian economy from making greater use of Australian suppliers has been seen by government agencies as too difficult or more difficult than calculating the costs. It has therefore not been attempted. The positive contributions of Telecom and various defence projects have clearly demonstrated that government purchasing can play an important role in industry development. The size of the annual procurement budgetsome $8 billion to $12 billion per annumindicates the. potential that exists to benefit the economy through employment generation and import substitution. The available evidence also indicates that most other developed nations extract consider. ahle leverage from government procurement. comThe committee has therefore recommended that the guidelines should be··rewritten to purchasing officers to' maximise the of - ompetitive ANZ content of purchasrather than just maximising opportunities. to That is, we want to do something about outcomes. We want to see more ANZ firms cross the finish line. We do not just want them to satisfied, as they are at present, simply because they have got to the starting blocks. The development of a purchasing culture which automatically looks to justify why ANZ goods and services are not being purchased is crucial to obtaining maximum .benefits for Australia. Other countries have such an attitude. We have recommended that industry development commitments be included in the criteria for assessing tenders. Importantly, have also recommended that commitments of the successful tenderer be included as enforcemore able clauses in the contract. The partnership for development and fixed term agreement programs would be accommodated within a wider approved supplier scheme. This will, ensure that there is substance in the undertakings given. It will also ensure that the promise of industry development, employment generation and gains for the balance of payments are more Iikely.to be achieved. The next major group of problems includes those which flow from the devolution and decentralisation of purchasing responsibility. Basically, it is a question of too many buyers who are too poorly trained and, who are without adequate monitoring and accountability. Decentralisation and devolution have resulted in an explosion in the number of people involved in purchasing in Commonwealth agencies. The number has increased from approximately 3,500 full time and 10,000 part time before the 1989 reforms to an estimated 30,000 to 40,000 full time and part time in 1993. Many are inadequately trained. Given the numbers involved, they are never likely to be adequately trained. The committee encountered prqblems caused by the lack of purchasing statistics when .' attempting to determine the level of local content in government purchasing. Purchasing Australia, within the Department of Administrative Services, informed the committee that no statistics are kept concerning the level of Commonwealth purchases from ANZ suppliers. The absence of that data clearly indicates that there has been no serious attempt to evaluate the extent to which key aspects of that 12th guideline have been implemented. Nothing could better illustrate the low priority given to the objective of maximising opportunities for ANZ suppliers. The lack of data on government purchasing is not a new issue. A number of committees of inquiry into government purchasing have pointed to the lack of data as a major impediment to their investigations of purchasing activity. The committee does not consider that all purchasing should be recentralised within we agencies. Low value purchasing can be done more efficiently by purcha,singofficers at a devolved level. Howeve'r, purchasing above a threshold limit should be conducted by trained purchasing staff in a central purchasing unit within agencies, and we have recommended accordingly. The problems we identified in relation to the purchasing system as a whole were reflected in our investigations of the Australian government credit card system. Our concerns about the credit card system were confirmed by· the efficiency audit released late last year by the Australian National Audit Office. The committee sought detailed information from all departments concerning the Australian government credit cards issued to their officers. Some of the information provided to the committee from departments w-s either inaccurate or lacking in detail. For example, the audit office informed the committee that the information we had received from departments about credit limits on individual cards was not correct. The original intention of the Australian government credit card system was that it should be used primarily for paying minor claims. In practice, most of the expenditure on the card was made up of transactions larger than $1,000. Indeed, some cardholders have limits of $2 million per month. . There are approximately 16,000 credit cards on issue. The audit office estimated that only 35 per cent of these cardholders have received any training on how the cards should be used, yet directions from the Department of Finance strongly encourage the use of the cards. The audit office report found, however, that the card is considerably more, expensive to the Commonwealth than many other possible methods of payment. The. committee has made a number of recommendations concerninga reduction in the number ofcards issued, a reduction in maximum monthly credit limits so that the card will be used only. for small purchases and the need for proper training of credit card users and those. responsible for monitoring their use. The magnitude of the deficiencies identified in the failure of the present system to prevent or remedy them leads the committee to recommend a major institutional change in the administration of purchasing policy. There is a culture within the bureaucracy and a sentiment within current policy which both need major alteration. The creation of a new national procurement board is important in bringing about that change in attitude and policy focus. The current administrative arrangements are not capable of delivering the attitudinal changes, efficiencies and industry development benefits which are desirable. A high level group with public, private sector and union participation needs to be created to advise the government on implementation and operation of changes to the purchasing system. The committee therefore recommends the establishment of a national· procurement board with appropriate membership, responsibilities and resources to address these issues. . Electronic commerce by Commonwealth agencies has potential benefits for both suppliers and buyers. Where it has been introduced, electronic commerce has been estimated to save between five per cent and 10 per cent of outlays. Potential savings to the Commonwealth are therefore in the hundreds of millions of dollars per year. The committee has recommended that the government implement whole of government electronic commerce by December 1997. The committee recommends that the common use contract system should be subsumed within a wider approved supplier list. An approved supplier list would consist ofsuppliers that have undergone some form .of prequalification, the criteria for which would include value for money, quality and, just as importantly, industry commitment. Purchasing from approved suppliers should be mandatory. Under current purchasing policy, buyers are required to purchase through the common use contracts, but it is widely acknowledged that the policy is not being followed. The mandatory requiremeI)t should be incorporated in the finance regulations. At this point I place on record my appreciation""'-l am sure I speak on behalf of all members of the committee-of the hard work of the secretariat during the 10 months of this inquiry. The work of Paul MCMahon, the secretary, Richard Cavanagh, in the secretariat, and others, particularly those Who we were fortunate to have seconded from DITARD and DAS to assist us in the preparation of this report, provid-d invaluable assistance without which we would not have been in a position to table this report - t this time. I thank them for the high quality of their work, their diligence and their consideration for committee members. This report is the result of a considerable amount of investigation and thought. Indeed, many of the chapters could easily have become full reports in their own right. There are major problems in the present purchasing policy and practice.. Decentralisation and devolution of responsibility for purchasing have meant that proper monitoring. and accountability have been neglected. The potential of government purchasing power to benefit the Australian economy has been lost. The committee does not have confidence in the capacity of the presen- administrative structure to address those problems. We have made some 45 n!corpmendations which, if adopted by the government, will help develop a procurement system with. coordinated national goals,· supporting competitive ANZ industry, . implemented effectively and efficiently. I commend the. report to the House and place on record my thanks to fellow members of - he committee. It has been a pleasure and · a privilege to chair the committeeover the 10 months or so of this. inquiry. The support ·from committee members has been strong and the strength of that support is .evidenced in · the high quality of the report before the House. .",105
176,Mr REID,Unknown,"by leave-Buy Australian should be the motto and> No. 1 priority of the purchasing policies of Australian government departments. There is it very real need to change the culture and thinking of government agencies· and they should be setting the leadin Australia. As the deputy chairman of the Standing Committee qn Industry, .Science and Technology, I support the remarks made by the chairman, the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis), on the tabling of the report, Australian government purchasing policies: Buying ourfuture. I congratulate him and the staff of that committee for their dedication to the task. I also thank my own colleagues for the dedication they showed to what has been a very exhaustive inquiry. It is most important that Australian content should be absolutely paramount in Australian government purchasing policies. It is from there, the committee found, that industry in this country could be enhanced; I give an example of just how deep seated the problem is, even in things we take for granted in this House. One of the first tasks when we are elected to this House as new members is to be sworn in. I have with me a very treasured article-the Holy Bible I was-presented with when I was sworn inon8 May 1990. I find, to my disgust, that the bible was· made and printed in the Republic of Korea. There are many fine printers in Australia who could produce a bible of this quality. Maryborough in central Victoria. is the heart of the printing industry and I am sure printers there would be very capable. of producing this. A way of enhancing Australian industry and enhancing Australian production is to open up the purchasing policies of the Australian government departments by giving greater consideration to Australian manufacturers The committee took evidence from Telecom during the inquiry. Telecom has a policy of positive discrimination towards Australian manufacturers. As a result, it has developed some very good initiatives and some very fine products"":""""products which not only fulfilled and satisfied the Australian market but also created and led to exports from this country to overseas markets. This is the type of culture and thinking. that we want· to encourthem age as a result of the tabling of this report. The report is, as the chairman quite correctly said, a first report, as it will be necessary, I believe, to monitor what government departments are doing· in. the future to ensure that they are giving full consideration to Australian manufacturers and the development of Australian product so that the recommendations of this committee are enacted by the government and so that we ensure that Australian government departments continue to consider this on an ongoing basis. It is important to enhance industry development in this country. I mentioned the range of products of Telecom. The evidence we received from Telecom was amongst the most convincing and certainly the most valuable, particularly when it introduced us to its electronic commerce system. That was particularly good. It opensupthe opportunity for the introduction of electronic commerce into the purchasing· arrangements of Australian government departments. The. electronic commerce system, if adopted by government, not only will be beneficial to existing manufacturers but also will leave the door open so that new entrants to that scheme can get in and out of the scheme and present their credentials to government departments. One other element that I would like to touch on-briefly, because I know my colleague the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) would also like to make some comments-:-particularly relates to the purchasing function and the lack of training which was given to· many· of the people in the purchasing areas of a number of government departments and the la<;k of any career development plan for these people. There appeared to be a downgrading of their role and function in this area. . We believe that one of the most important roles that these people can play is to help the government to buy Australian products,but there has been a marked lack of training and career path for them to follow.> I hope that the . government will address that so that there is a clear career path for them and they do receive the appropriate training to enable to consider the whole of life of a product and certainly look at Australian products. The chairman of the committee touched on the credit card issue. There is no doubt that this issue is quite startling. The evidence the initial poor response that we received from the government departments on the issue of and the lack of control over the use of these credit cards were quite frighteningparticularly because, as the chairman mentioned, some of the limits on those credit cards were $800,000 per annum. I think one of them might have even been up to the one million mark. Those credit cards were being issued to people virtually without any accountability at all. That matter was addressed to some extent by the Australian National Audit Office. It was one of the major problems in the inquiry. One of the things that we did uncover in the government's purchasing policies was that they were - ithout constraint, without accountability and without any credibility In fact, as the chairman said, it was more expensive to use that system than it wouid be to use the more conventional ones. One would hope that the electronic commerce system, upon introduction by the government, would eliminate the need for many thousands of those credit cards to even be used. Once again, I compliment my colleagues on the committee and also the staff for their dedication to the task.",108
177,Mr CHARLES,Unknown,"La Trobe)..:....by leave-I support my colleagues in this report; Buying our future. It is my view that this report will indeed send shock waves. through the federal government bureaucracy. It is clear from our investigations-and we make it indelibly clear in this report-that there is a culture within the federal bureaucracy which says, 'Buy overseas is good; buy Australian is bad' - or at least second choice. It is totally unacceptable that funds in the order of magnitude of $10 billion per year are devoted to spending taxpayers' money on goods which are supplied by other countries. We have to develop a culture in this country which says that Australian quality is equal to the best in the world, that our production capacity is as good as anywhere else, and that if we can make it then our government should buy it. I strongly support the major thrust of this report, and I strongly support the major and recommendation of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, which basically is that the Commonwealth should maximise the Australian content of government purchasing. The committeeunfortunately, in my view-addressed a minor issue at the end of the repert under the heading 'Ethical Purchasing'. I had heped, and indeed desired, that the cemmittee's report would be unanimous. Unfertunately I find myself unable to agree with the section of the report entitled 'Ethical Purchasing' ,and so. the report in that regard centains my dissent. In that section, the committee says: As a general rule, it is no.t appropriate to. seek to. impo.se Australian so.cial standards on o.ther natio.ns which have different cultural attitudes and social structures. at all. Unfertunately, it goes en to. say: Ho.wever, it is appropriate to. ensure that Australian producers are no.t disadvantaged by having to. meet higher standards than their co.mpetito.rs. Themo.st clear-cut case where such care is needed is in relatio.n to. enviro.nmental issues. The problem this leads us into is that through this report this committee is insisting that the government officers who are charged with purchasing. responsibility-and remember that there are some 40,000 of them, with 16,000 government credit cards floating around all over the place-are going to make,decisions about whether or not they should buy an article made in China because the wage in China is $1 a day instead ef $10 an hour. Our social policy says that we should adhere to industrial relations regulations in this country, which we then through this policy will attempt to impose on other countries. This is an issue that we did not investigate in depth. It is my view that, unfortunately, the committee is in error in including it in the report. In principle, social policies are appropriate for Australia to apply to. our firms and our companies. But how on earth· can we tell other countries that they must adhere to the same policies or we will not buy from them? In a practical sense it is a bureaucratic impossibility; in an ideological sense it is just straight wrong. We have no right to impose our social policies on other countries through a purchasing policy. %I\t on earth gives us that right? If we exercise it, in effect we negating all of the GATT agreements, GATT says we. can discriminate on ·behalf of own companies and products but not so far as to impose our will on other countries or else to say we will not buy from them. Fortunately, all countries differ in their mix of social policies. That is demonstrably true. proposed: So for us to say that our policies are right and those of country X, Y or Z are wrong, and for us t() take action in a demonstrable sense through purchasing policy, is just plain nonsense. Further, I believe that the recommendation that we made in that respect is flawed. While there is some justification for taking account of paper manufacturing with respect to environmental policies that this government has imposed on the paper manufacturers, first time. particularly with respect to recycling, it seems to me that there is little justification for singling out one policy-that is, the environment-in terms of the recommendation. The report deals in one respect with the credit card issue that I referred to earlier. Today the Minjster for Social Security Baldwin) responded to. a question which I asked him earlier this month with respect what he is doing in his department to control the possibility of fraud and the abuse of government credit cards. He said then that did not know. Today he gave a longwinded response from hisbureaucrats. In effect, minister does not know. How could he? There are 16,000 of those things floating around out there. They are not credit cards like you and I use, Mr Deputy Speaker; they are payment cards. So cardholders can go a brothel and quote their credit card number. The docket could come in for 'goods' and be her requests. automatically paid in 14 days. And there can be no fraud! The government has a lot answer for when it comes to 16,000 plastic carcJs floating around the community. The government needs to answer because it is its continuing· contempt for this parliament for the people of Australia that lets this kind of abuse occur. . . . .. Before I sit down, I must thank the tary to the committee and all of his assistants and helpers. When a few minutes ago the attendant took the papers that were involved are in producing this report, she really needed a wheelbarrow, because the volume of paper our that the committee has produced, read and dissected is absolutely tremendous. All those ipvolved deserve the greatest congratulations for a superb job, Well done. Motion (by Mr Bevis)-by leaveThat the House take note of the report. Debate (on motion by Mr MCLachlan) adjourned. , INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS AMENDMENT BILL 1994 First Reading Bill received from the Senate, and read a Second Reading· MrJOHNS (Petrie-Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters) (5.31 p.m.)-I present the explanatory memo(Mr randum to the bill. I move: That the bill be now read a second time. to The purpose of the bill is to facilitate the appointment of a new president of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The he amendments relate to the proposed appoint.ment as president of Justice Deirdre O'Connor the of the Federal Court of Australia. Justice O'Connor has agreed to be recommended to the. Governor General for that appointment. The judge wishes to continue to hold her office as a Federal Court judge, and has also to requested a fixed term appointment of five years. The government has agreed to both of Accordingly, section 10 of the Industrial to Relations Act 1988 is to be amended to provide that a judge of a court created by the parliament may concurrently hold the office of president. This is supported by new secand tions 15A and amendments to section 21. Those provisions make it clear that the tem.lre and entitlements, including judicial salary, of secrea judge who is appointed and serves as president are not affected by that appointment or service. Any difference between the judinot even have a guaranteed market share. has to go out and fight for votes and support. grinder. The Liberal and National parties do not have a guaranteed market share. The local church does not have a guaranteed market share. The local priest does not have a guaranteed congregation every Sunday or Saturday night or whatever. The person opening up a small business does not have a' guaranteed set customers. The government cannot apply the rules that' apply to the rest of the community to the trade union movement. What is 'wrong with industrial relations Australia is that the law still gives monopoly privileges and power to the trade union nonsenSe movement. That is what the Liberal and party National' parties want to change. Once that goes, I believe that there will be competition in'industrial relations. For the life of me, cannot understand how any government could have the' nerve to allow this to happen. One would need to have the unspeakable gall of the current Prime Minister of Australia to go without any sense of embarrassment. is very fond of saying, 'You Liberals have shame', but he is the last person who can deride other people for not having any shame. He can go down to Hobart and say, 'The which Commonwealth has done everything that could be expected to do on the subject of competition. It is now up to the states to the winds of competition blow through their utilities and the professions. But, for heaven.'s sake, don't ask me to require that of those who gave us political birth', which is trade union movement of Australia. If ever there wen- a monumental example of hypocribusiness. sy and a double standard, that is it. This matter has nothing to dowith whether people belong or do not belong to trade unions; it has everything to do with whether one believes there should be one law for one section of society and one law for another. Until 'this breathtaking example of prime ministerial and Australian Labor Party hypocat risy is removed, there will continue to be view in the Australian community that, when it comes to the hard interests of the trade union movement of this country, this govern the ment is led by the nose. It is a case of the mies of scale. It monkey dancing to the tune of the organ, Mr SLIPPER - Led by th-'union doi-.ar.",110
178,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"My colleague the honour'able member for Fisher correctly interjects that it is led by the union dol1ar.. There are many men and women opposite of great fair of mindedness and quality who I know would bring - to this debate a degree bf such fair mindedness on this'subject:They always, avoid this issue by launching erratic, smearing attacks on us. They say that we are antiin worker and that we want to drive the worker into the ground. They go on with this sort of every time. It is pretty strange for a that has given this country one million unemployed. Perhaps it can explain to us why it is that the unemployment rate in the United I States is four per cent below what it is in Australia. Perhaps it can explain to the one million unemployed why iUs maintaining a system that is producing that kind of result. , What the government is doing with the He Industrial Relations Ameridment Bill, which no will come into operation at the end of this month, is'making the system more rigid. It is , going in precisely the opposite direction in it should be going. It is going down an it anti-competitive path rather than a procompetitive path. It is making it more expenlet sive for small business to employ people in this coqntry. The government must realise that if we are ever to have any hope in this country of reducing the appalling level of longthe term unemployed it must do something to lighten the employment capacity of small The government will not save the unemployed by relying on big business; it will save the unemployed only by providing incentives to small business to employ people. Smal1 business is coming back into its own iii this country. In 20 years, there will be a much greater percentage of people employed by small business in Australia than is the case present. In the 1970s and 1980s, the view a in the corporate world was that big is beautiful, that all one had to do is merge,come together and amalgamate. The bigger it got, better it was and there were al1the econoThat has all begun to change in the 1990s. One reason it has changed is that there has been an explosion in communications. Things like personal computers, mobile telephones and fax machines have given to small business an independence, power, authority and capacity to survive and do well that was undreamt of even five or, certainly, 10 years ago. This process will continue. In 10 or 20 years, more and more people will be employed by small business. That has enormous implications for Australia's industrial relations system. It means that we will need a system that is more accommodating to small business rather than a system that tries to squeeze the small business model into a pattern that is really designed for big business. Australia's industrial relations system built upon the notion that employment Australia overwhelmingly comprises large numbers of blue-collar workers employed one spot by a big company. The criticism I and many others have had of Australia's industrial relations system over the years not that we should not accommodate the BHPs, the Fords, the CSRs and so forth-they are an. important part of the scene-but that we need to have a system which, as well accommodating them, also accommodates the smalland medium-sized firms. This becomes more necessary as time goes by, because the future belongs to the small firm and the small business. The success that is being achieved on export front is increasingly to be found in small niche operators. The government-I . have no quarrel with this-keeps giving us examples of joint ventures that have opened up in China. It keeps talking about the .cess that Australia is having in selling into Asia-Pacific region. I hope that we are. To extent that we are, I unreservedly welcome as does every honourable member on this of the House. What the government then forgets to acpetulance knowledge is that a very large slice of additional export cake is being taken by small business sector. It is that small business sector that wants a different industrial tions system. This is a theme that the House has heard me dwell on in the past and I will keep on dwelling on it because it is a very much tied up with the future of this country. We should have an industrial relations system that recognises that we are essentially two worlds: we have a small number of very large companies that employ lots of people, most of whom belong to trade unions, and the rest are smalland medium-sized firms which employ a lot of people too, just about none of whom belong to trade unions and none of whom want to belong to trade unions.",114
179,Mr SLIPPER,Unknown,Nor should be forced to.,115
180,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"But many of them are being forced to. Yet our industrial relations system suits the first group but not the second. I, and the Liberal and National parties, argue for a system that accommodates both. is still We cannot accommodate both within the in paradigm of monopoly union power. The government cannot say to people who do not in belong to unions and who clearly do not want that to belong to unions, 'You have to negotiate through unions'. That is the brick wall up is against which we keep knocking. It is the point that will not be conceded by the government. It cannot be conceded by the government because of its historic political bondage as to the trade union movement in Australia. Over the last couple of years we have seen the attitude of the government towl,lrds the Industrial Relations Commission wax and wane in a quite remarkable fashion. There was a time when the Industrial Relations the Commission was the thing that stood between the all that was good and holy and the alleged darkness and chaos of the deregulated alternative so far as the government was concerned. That was until April 1991 when the Industrial sucRelations Commission, under the courageous the leadership of the late Barry Maddern-I say the that quite deliberately because he did display it, courage in that particular decision-rejected side what the government had put to it. In a fit of what can only be called great and intense personal hostility, the that Secretary of the ACTU, Mr Kelty, the then the Treasurer and the now Prime Minister turned their guns on the Industrial Relations Comrelamission. For six or nine months or more we were treated to the argument that the people who decided industrial relations in Australia were the accord partners: the Labor governthat ment and the ACTU.I would agree that that and was probably a fair description. They do decide industrial relations policy in this country. Who could forget those immortal words of Jennie George,which should be inscribed across the heart of anybody who argues that there is a skerrick of fair mindedness on this issue in the minds of the LaborParty,last year when she was told of some complaints by the employers about the legislation. She said, 'What those employers have to underessentially stand is that they lost the election and won it'. That is a measure of the kind of attitude and prejudice that the Labor Party and the trade union movement bring to this debate. We went through a period a couple of years ago when the Industrial Relations Commission. sion was very much out in the cold. I always thought that was a strange piece of work the government. If the government were to argue for the defence of the centralised system, it would surely argue that the pinnacle of the centralised system had to be Industrial Relations Commission-the umpire, the keeper of the ring. It seemed that in the soccer parlance the government had kicked home goal by trying to denounce the role of the Industrial Relations Commission. But the Industrial Relations Commission is now enjoying something of a renaissanc-.",115
181,Mr SLIPPER,Unknown,They have stacked it.,116
182,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,"I will come to that in a moment.·The honourable member interjects a very relevant proposition. I am grateful' that my honourable colleague has reminded me of the degree of apparent over identification with one side of the argument, if I could put it that way; others would say bias. Far be it from me to use that expression immediately. We now have something of a renaissance being enists joyed by the Industrial.Relations Commission. Let us see how it works out. For our part, we accept the role of the Industrial Relations Commission in the present industrial relations set up; We have no argument that the law of this country at present-unfortunately but nonetheless undeoff niably-is for an industrial relations falls a long way short of what we want what is in the best interests of Australia's economic future and is certainly an industrial relations system that belongs to a bygone era. It always amuses me that; in the Prime Minister's· frequent tirades against the coalition and me personally, he identifies me with earlier periods in Australian history. When it comes to industrial relations, there ·is nobody more rooted in the discredited past of Australian history than .the Prime Minister of this country. He is a supporter of a system that belongs to pre-World War I days we in Australia rather than to the 1990s. The honourable member for Fisher reminded me to say something about the composition of the cominission. If memory. serves me correctly, there are about 14.or 15 deputy presidents of the Industrial RelationsCommisI may be out by one or two, but it is in that order. If memory also serves me corby rectly; of those 14 or 15 it can roughly be said that two of them come·out of the broad employer stable, two of them come out of . what can be called the government stablethe one of them is Mr Keogh, a former head of the Department of Industrial Relations-and it can fairly be said that the rest of them come a out of the broad trade union stable. After the appointment of Mr lain Ross, no fewer than five. deputy presidents of the Industrial Relations Commission will have come straight out of the ACTU office. I think that does represent an imbalance.' It· does show that the government· regards the. Industrial Relations Commission as· being' something like putty in its hands. In some cases, some might even irreverently suggest that it is a resting place for some tiring industrial warriors. One of the reasons why these great centralin the Labor Party neVer want to see the dismantling of the state industrial relations infrastructure is that they still want their state industrial commissions on which to place . those senior union officials who perhaps are 'becoming a bit of a.problem. They still· want the local option,the local patronage, to buy some of the recalcitrants that might exist system within their own ranks. To have 14 or 15 deputy presidents and to have the sort of imbalance in their backdoes ground that 1 havedescribed'""""""""""and I am that lam broadly right-is outrageous. It just shows that, once again, the government does not really care; it is blatant. One thing that distinguishes the Keating· government is blatant way it plays politics. One would have thought that the government may have made some attempt to give an appearance of imparcomes tiality so far as these bodies are concerned. This government shouts and screams when it comes to matters of gender, race, total equality and lack of discrimination. But, when it comes to industrial relations, the governeternal ment has an absolute blind spot. It is prepared to tolerate blatant discrimination in the place. It is prepared to allow people who do not belong to unions to lose jobs that they would otherwise win on the basis of merit I had brought to my attention only a couple days ago an advertisement that had been published in a paper in the western suburbs Sydney inviting people to enlist in a program for trainers being run by not racehorse trainers but trainers for a program under the Department of Employment, Education and Training. At the bottom of the advertisement soliciting applicants, it said, 'Preference will given to people who are members of such and such a union'. There is not even an attempt to disguise the fact that preference is given people who belong to unions. The government thinks that is all right; that is different. we use the wrong word with some of these cultural fundamentalists who lurk in governattitude ment departments and academic establishstrate ments, we are hounded for being some kind of out of date sexist or whatever. The government of this country and, I regret, the bureaucracies of many governments of this country are now riddled with ment. social engineers or cultural fanatics who are trying to reconstruct society according to their own model. But when it comes to something that really matters, and that is people trying to get a job, it is not a question of meritpeople who belong to a union get a preference. That is going on right now, in March 1994. The Industrial Relations Amendment Bill nothing to prevent that occurring. Memsure bers of the government talk about the ILO and our international obligations yet, when it comes to such a fundamental thing as the right of people to compete for a job based on the merit, where are government members? They are nowhere to be seen. The reason is that the unions heavy them and say, 'Look, when it to the crunch, push to shove, you ,people have to make certain that preference is given to members of a trade union'.. These are very simple concepts. We .can argue and accept that we are going to have differences on other issues. But, when it· comes to these fundamental issues of workpeople's rights, this government-which boasts its anti-discrimination credentials and lectures us day in and day out about how it believes in equality of the sexes and equality of of this·and that-does not believe in equality of employment opportunity in the workplace. of It says that unionists get jobs ahead of non-unionists. I think that is wrong. Most Australians believe it is wrong, particularly when . about 30 per cent of the private sector work force, and no more than that, now belong to trade unions. There are many features of industrial be relations generally that one can be critical about. This particular bill will not be opposed but is an example of the adhockery of the to government. Whilst we do not decline to give the bill a second reading, we deplore the Yet if government's incompetent management of the IR portfolio. We condemn the submissive the government continues to demontowards the ACTU, which is reflected in the changes to the Indu-trial Relations Commission and the disproportionately large number of senior commission persoimel who have been drawn from the trade union moveWe .do not say there should be no people with trade union background, but government members have not even tried to appear to be fair. They are blatantly loading the system in favour of their union mates. There can be no other description. I think that is another example of a government of the trade union movement, for the trade union movement, and a government which does not have too much regard to the long-term interests of the Australian people. I think government members underestimate the degree to which the Australian people are aware of this and the anger that this produces in many sections of the Australian community, not least amongst many people who are traditional Lilborsupporters. Some of the fiercest opponents of monopoly trade union power in this country are, in fact, members of the trade union movement itself and people' who might normally be disposed to support the government's side of politics. I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, House: (1) deplores the Government's incompetent management of the industrial relations portfolio, incompetence which has again forced it to bring in hasty amendments to the Industrial R-lations Act; and (2) condemns the submissive attitude the Government continues to demonstrate toward the ACTU, reflected in: (a) the Industrial Relations Commission's unduly expanded responsibility; and (b) the disproportionately large number of senior Commission personnel who have been drawn from the trade union movement"".

183,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Is the amendment seconded? Mr Charles-I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,118
184,Mr LES SCOTT,Unknown,"I will deal firstly with the amendments to the Industrial Relations Act. I will then speak more generally on industrial relations, seeing the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) has given us the opportunity to respond in such a wide-ranging debate. I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in support of the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill. I think these amendments are appropriate, as has been explained in this place by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) and in the other place by his representative. I preface my remarks by echoing the. sentiments expressed last year by the Minister for Industrial Relations, that Labor's industrial relations policies will always remain true to the principles of fairness that have underpinned a century of conciliation and arbitration. We really have to look at the history of industrial relations in this country and the commitment that Labor governments have had to fair play for the Australian .work force and, of course, to a very .effective trade union movement that has been responsible for looking after the interests of its members over those many years. The comments of the honourable member for Bennelong outline again the great differences between us on this the side of the House and those on the other side of the House when it comes to· industrial relations. It is a pretty fair mark why they are over there and we are over here. The Industrial Relations Amendment Bill 1994 seeks to amend sections 10, 15, 16 and 21 of the Industrial Relations Act 1988 in order to facilitate the appointment of a new president of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission-the AIRC. The amendments allow for the appointment of Justice Deirdre O'Connor to this position. They expressly provide the means whereby a judge of a court created by the parliament can hold the office of President of the AIRC. Inaddition, the legislation allows the appointment to be on a fixed term basis, for a period of five years, as opposed to the current system of tenure lasting until the statutory retirement age of 65. As announced by the Minister for Industrial Relations on 28.February, the government has recommended to the Governor General the appointment of Justice Deirdre O'Connor to the presidency of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Justice O'Connor comes to the position with a wealth of experience and a distinguished record as a judge of the Federal Court and as current President of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. In addition to these positions, she has also chaired the former Australian Broadcasting Tribunal and, most importantly, she is a former commissioner of the New South Wales Law Reform Commission and has practised as a barrister specialising in industrial issues related to workers compensation. Before this, she was a senior lecturer in law at Macquarie University. She is certainly a person with a wide range of experience who I am sure will be a very worthy appointment to the presidency of the commission. , It is good news indeed to see the appointIndustrial ment of a highly qualified woman to such an important position; But it is, most important that we acknowledge that sheIs well qualified in her own right to hold the position, not simply because she is a woman. The appointwill ment of Justice O'Connor will help to address the gender imbalance on the commission whereat present women occupy only four of legislation the 16 presidential positions. With regard the fixed term tenure, it is important to stress that subsection 16(IA), which will allow the the employee. next president of the commission to be appointed for a fixed term, will apply only Justice, O'Connor. The government will retain itspoIicy which states that the members of the commission will normally be appointed until statutory retiring age. Justice O'Connor requested a five-year term as she wishes return to her duties on the Federal Court. has already been stated, this is the first time a fixed term tenure has been provided, government is prepared to make this one-off provision in the light of Justice O'Connor's outstanding abilities. The other amendments will protect Justice O'Connor's present tenure on the Federal Court, as she has expressed the wish to return to the Federal Court. The new section will provide that the appointment of a judge of a court created by the federal parliament will not affect, that judge's tenure of salary and privileges. It also provides that a judge's service as president is to be taken service as a judge. The proposed section ensure that Justice O'Connor's appointment as president will not affect her entitlements. The remuneration of a person who is presipay dent and a judge is dealt with in Clause 6, which will amend section 21 of the act. This amendment provides that the salary payable to such a person as a judge is less than that payable to the president. That person is to paid an allowance equal to the difference and no other remuneration is payable to the person due to his or her being President of the - IRC. The appointment of Justice O'Connor to the presidency of the AIRC is in line with the government's intended goals in the arena of industrial relations; Last year, the Minister for Relations brought down one of the most comprehensive and responsible industrial relations reform bills this nation' has seen. In it, the government aimed to formulate a framework of legislafion and institutions that allow for fair, mutually advantageous bargaining, while protecting the interests of both parties. The central feature of that is its vigilance in protecting those to who have little to bargain. This weaker party in the bargaining process is almost invariably The legislation gives employees the' assurto ance that they will not be worse off as a result of the bargaining process. It gives them the security of knowing that the, conditions they already enjoy will not be traded off without something in return. This will always to be the case while Labor is in power. The As alternative, as demonstrated in Victoria and Western Australia, will never be initiated by but the a Labor government. The system of basic award entitlements is what allows both unionists and non-unionists a high standard of legal protection for their working conditions. To remove the award is to take away the only bit of bargaining power employees have. Such proposals are always 15A being put by those opposite. Those who cannot have access to such protection in federal awards can at least have the protection office or of fair national minimum standards. There has been a considerable amount of as public comment on the nomination of Justice will O'Connor. Some opposition members have claimed that it is some sort of payback to the union movement. The oilly people we have to back are the Australian people who showed their faith in the Labor Party's commitment to social justice at the last election. They completely rejected the opposition's industrial relations policies. Why would they be not? The $3 an hour youth wage, thedismantling of the Industrial Relations Commission and the removal of the awards system are policies that could never have won the approval of the people. Now we are subjected to the spectacle of the opposition casting around for a new leader when it should be casting around for decent policies for a change. With regard to Justice O'Connor's appointment, we have heard accusations of changing legislation to suit the whim of an individual. In the other chamber, Senator Chapman accused the government of all sorts of hideous acts. According to him, the government is rushing this legislation through parliament. Then he said that we were casting around for someone to head the new Industrial Relations Court. In addition to this, statements have been made by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry questioning Justice O'Connor's qualifications and saying that the government should have consulted with employers before making the appointment. In all cases, they have said what a highly regarded institution the Federal Court is. Senator Chapman said that it was unnecessary to create a new court, as the Industrial Relations Division of the Federal Court could handle all industrial relations matters. Under the new legislation, that division's duties be taken over by the new court. Senator Chapman neglected to mention how the appointment of a judge of the Federal Court to the presidency of the AIRC could be construed as a problem. By his own admission, the judges of the Federal Court have the skills, expertise and independence to do that job, yet he saw something wrong with the appointment of a respected Federal Court judge to the AIRC. The Law Council of Australia has made similar statements with regard to the Industrial Relations Court. It said that 'the established, experienced, well-equipped and well-regarded Federal Court' should be given the duties of the new court. Once again, it did not mention how the appointment of a member· of the established, experienced, well-equipped and well-regarded Federal Court could hinder the new court's effectiveness. All of these statements seem to indicate that these objectives doubt Justice O'Connor's independence and competence, yet they all accept that the Federal Court is staffed by competent, independent judiciary who would all be interested in knowing the reasons for the contradiction. 'It is misguided to think that our courts should not have particular areas of expertise. Certainly, where they deal with a variety of problems, they must be impersonal and independent and deal with all people fairly. However, in complex matters like industrial relations,I think it will be very beneficial to have a court dealing specifically in this area. Justice O'Connor will be the first female President of the AIRC. This will prove to be a step forward for women in the arena of industrial relations. As 51 per cent of Australia-s population is female, it is only right that the AIRC be headed by a woman of ability and· skill. If the low rate of female union membership is to be rectified, steps like this need to be taken to encourage women to get involved in the movement. It is high time that a talented and capable woman occupied a position like this, and I believe it is a great move for that reason alone. There has been some comment about the future relationship with the state industrial relations bodies. The act provides for cooperwill ation between the AIRC and state bodies and allows' members of the AIRC to also be appointed to the AIRC. The AIRC also has the power to hear disputes that come under the jurisdiction of state authorities where a state law authorises this. The act also provides that the president can invite heads of state industrial authorities to regular meetings to encourage cooperation between the federal and state bodies. Everyone is jumping the gun by saying that Justice O'Connor's appointment will jeopardise the relations between the bodies. I believe that Justice O'Connor will bring a level of competence and professionalism to the AIRC as well as a fresh approach that will encourage the cooperation of state bodies. The honourable member for Bennelong moved a second reading amendment during his contribution. The amendment seems to fly in the face of all the qualifications that Deirdre O'Connor possesses to hold this position as president of the commission. I find it very difficult to understand why the honourable member for Bennelong would move such an amendment here. He said that the size of the Industrial Relations Commission was top heavy with people of union backgrounds. That is incorrect. The commission has 17 members. I understand that only seven of them have union backgrounds. It is often forgotten by those opposite when it comes to industrial relations in Australia that people who have a strong commitment and a strong involvement in the trade union movement have a very strong commitment to this country, to getting things right and to making sure that industry gets on with the job and protects the work force. It is not just a matter of tearing up all our awards and conditions, which the opposition wants to do, and believing that everything will be rosy in the garden and that industry will be able to on to bigger and better things. It will not and cannot happen that way. I believe the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Bennelong should be, and I am sure it will be, rejected by this House. The amendments before us in the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill 1994 are appropriate. I wish Deirdre O'Connor well in her role as President of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. I believe she will do a good job, and she deserves the support of this place.",118
185,Mr SLIPPER,Unknown,"I get sick and tired of hearing Labor members accuse people on this side of the House of wanting to do away with the safety net, of wanting to tear up all awards and conditions and somehow treat workers as people who do not have any rights. Quite frankly, the administration of the Australian Labor farty in the· area of industrial relations over the last 11 years has condemned a million Australians to unempl()yment and possibly up to two million Australians to being unable to obtain adequate work. I was very disappointed, if I heard it correctly, when the previous speaker, the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), referred to the appointment of Justice Deirdre O'Connor as being one step in the direction of redressing the low rate of female involvement in trade unions. We are saying that the government is a government of the unions, by the unions, for the unions. I am quite happy for government members to come into the chamber and debate the subject of the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill-indeed, it is appropriate for those matters to be debatedbut it is quite surprising to hear the honourable member for Oxley saying that the proposed appointment of Justice Deirdre O'Connor is an important step in redressing the imbalance of women in the trade union movement. He was telling the House that her appointment will encourage women to join the trade union movement. The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) said that the government has brought in a top-heavy commission-a commission stacked with union appointees at deputy go' president level. What the honourable member for Oxley said, if I heard him correctly, was that women will be encouraged to join the trade union movement by the appointment of Justice Deirdre O'Connor to this very important position. Justice O'Connor may well be a woman of great ability. She may well have been appointed on merit, but I think it is quite wrong and demeaning to Justice O'Connor for the honourable member for Oxley to say that her appointment will encourage' women to join the trade union movement. I think even Justice Deirdre O'Connor would be horrified by that approach. The Industrial Relations Amendment Bill is one of the worse bills to have been brought before. this House. It is a disappointing and unnecessary bill, in that it amends a piece of unnecessary legislation brought into the House last year. As the honourable member for Bennelong pointed out, the government is moving in the area of industrial relations in precisely the wrong direction. The government is full of free enterprise for the professions-the lawyers, the doctors, the chartered accountants and so many other areas. We will hear more from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) at the Premiers Conference on the need to open up industry and the professions to competition. We are not opposed to competition, but the government is absolutely hypocritical. It is saying that there should be one rule for the professions, one rule for one section of the community, but a special deal for the trade union movement. The Industrial Relations Court, in the government's eyes, is a special court for special people. The opposition believes that, as much as possible; industrial law should be dealt with in the ordinary courts of the land. I am not saying that the Industrial Relations Court necessarily will be a biased institution. But we must be-indeed, the Australian people will be-very suspicious of the government's motives. The honourable member for Oxley referred in glowing terms to the quality of Federal Court judges. By and large, I· agree that this nation can be proud of the Federal Court of Australia. But the government clearly is not proud of the Federal Court, because it took the secondary boycott provisions away from that court and gave the responsibility forthat part of the law to the new Industrial Relations Court. The federal government has treated the Federal Court with some disrespect,despite the honourable member for Oxley claiming that it is a wonderful institution. In my view and, indeed, in the view of the opp,?sition, Federal Court should have been the court to administer, as it has done so well over so many years, the secondary boycott provisions. The Industrial Relations Amendment Bill, which is before the House, is a special bill for special people. It entrenches the government's principle of special deals for special people. Justice O'Connor is the beneficiary of the amendments which' are before the House. The amendments are being debated simply to enable Justice O'Connor to perform the role of President of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission while continuing as a judge of the Federal Court-a special deal for a special person arid, while one does not want to' criticise Justice O'Connor personally, almost a deal for a mate. This legislation will enable Justice O'Connor to remain as a judge of the Federal Court; It will ensure that her tenure as a judge will not be affected by her presidency. It appoints her for .a fixed term of five years rather than until she is 65 .. If the rules which will apply to future presidents were to apply to Justice O'Connor, that would be 12 years. The legislation also enables Justice O'Connor to receive a presidential allowance on top of her judge's salary. Also, there has been, some criticism-the government really should consider it seriously-that the arbitral and judicial functions are being somewhat confused as a result of the appointment of Justice O'Connor while allowing her to remain a judge of the Federal Court. The honourable member for Oxley said that Justice O-Connor will be the first woman president of this institution. That is uncontested: she wili be the first woman. to hold that position if the Governor General accepts the government's recommendation-and I imaginethat in the circumstances he will. I hope that the appointment of Justice O'Connor has been made on merit. I am not worried that she does not have a great deal of experience in the area of industrial relationsapparently she has done some work in the field of workers compensation-because I believe that industrial relations law really ought to be handled by the ordinary courts. the So I do not have a problem with the fact that she does not come from the industrial relations club. But, if the government has not made this appointment on the basis of merit, I will certainly be very disappointed .. All appointments should be made on the basis of merit. The government is sometimes very keen on equal opportunity and affirmative action. On this side of the parliament,we are very much in favour of the right and the best person being appointed to a position, regardless of whether that person happens to be a man or a woman. I hope that Justice O'Connor has been appointed on merit. I do not know whether she has been. I am certainly not going to oppose her appointment since I do not know whether she is the best person for the job. It would demean the government's own admin.. istration further in this area if Justice O'Connor has been appointed because she' is a woman-a mate of some description. We do have some reason to be suspicious since this special piece of legislation applies only to Justice Deirdre O'Connor.. The government talks a lot about fairness. The' honourable member for Oxley said that the government's approach ,to industrial relations has been' fair. The government is really interested only in being fair to trade unions; it is not interested in being fair to the Australian work force. The honourable member for Bennelong pointed out that only 30 per cent of. private sector employees have chosen to become members ofaunion. The honourable member for Oxley referred in glowing terms to the government's administration of industrial relations .. Mind you, I think that administration has been an unmitigated disaster. But the government is clearly only interested in being fair to that section of the work force which supports it, namely, the trade union movement. The trade unions themselves would be the first to admit that they have a major problem because Australian workers, in ever increasing numbers, are saying that they do not want to be part of the trade union movement. I mentioned earlier that the government is refusing to allow the winds of competition into the areas of industrial relations and industrial law. If the entrenched position of the trade union movement were done away with; the government would clearly be very worried, because the number of workers who are members of the union would continue to fall. That would present the government with a maj0r problem at election time. We all know how much money is pumped into. the government coffers from the trade union movement. The government lied its way to victory in the 13 March election last year. It received very large donations from trade unions. That is why the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) was forced to bring into the parliament last year the Industrial Relations Bill. That is why he is forced to continue to march to the trade union dictates in this area. That is a very great pity; At a time when Australia should be looking at world best practice, we find that the government is moving backwards rather than forwards. We also find that the government is relying on the external affairs treaty powers to give it some authority to legislate in relation to sorelations. called minimum conditions. We on this side of the House are totally opposed to the government's entering into international treaties with a view to acquiring legislative c,ompetence to give it power over matters which domestically under our constitution should be the responsibility of the states. Very many concerns have been uttered by respected bodies, like the Law Council of Australia, about the potential lack of independence of the new Industrial Relations Court. Indeed, honourable members will recall that the Law Council, prior to the establishment of that court, very strongly and forcefully said how much it was opposed to what the government was doing. The government brought in the Industrial Relations Bill last year-it was forced through the parliament-and I understand that on 30 March it will be assented to by His Excellency the Governor General. The government . really should have looked at the amendments in this bill at the time it brought in the original bill. That the government has now had to come in here with what amounts to an amending piece of legislation indicates that its administration in the area of industrial relations is in complete disarray. It is totally disorganised. It is moving in an ad hoc way. It has not even thought through the long-term legislation it wants. Only a couple of months after we had discussed in the parliament a major piece of industrial relations legislation, the minister is back seeking further amendments to facilitate the appointment of Justice Deirdre O'Connor as president of the commission. It really is a worry that special legislation is being brought into encourage an individual to accept this position. The government likes to talk a lot about independence for Australia and about Australia taking its place in the world. But the reality is that, with international treaties the government· is constantly signing, Australia's sovereignty is being eroded. Of course, the treaties which are being entered into on industrial relations will erode the sovereignty of this nation in that area to the extent that there can be appeals to UN committees in the area of industrial I get very worried when I find that local bodies will be subjected to these international committees; It makes a mockery of the government's approach to independence; Entering into these treaties is subverting our national independence and our national sovereignty and is, in effect, making Australian organisations subordinate to international organisations. 'The amendments to the Industrial Relations Act which are included in this bill are designed to benefit Justice Dierdre O'Connor. The ,honourable member for Bennelong has pointed out that the coalition is not opposing those amendments. The honourable member for Bennelong has moved an amendment, which states: whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House: (1) deplores the Government's incompetent management of the industrial relations , folio, incompetence which has again forced it to bring in hasty amendments' to the Industrial Relations Act; and I referred to that matter a moment ago. (2) condemns the submissive attitude the Government continues to demonstrate towards the ACTU, reflected in: (a) the Industrial Relations Commission's unduly expanded responsibility; and (b) the disproportionately large number of , senior Commission personnel who have been drawn from the trade union movement. In looking at the attitude of the government towards the ACTO, most fair-minded Australians would be really concerned. Even those who vote for the Australian Labor Party are opposed to special deals for trade unions. They are opposed to this government giving preference to unionists. The fact that the Industrial Relations Commission will have so many more Labor mates as deputy presidents is a cause for concern on the part of the Australian people. We really deserve a government that is prepared to take a reasoned and moderate approach; We give the government credit for moving in the right direction in some areas of the economy and in some areas of administration of ,law. But when the government has decided, for its own political purposes, to preserve a very undesirable monopoly for the trade union movement, we have a responsibility towards the Australian people to tell the government that we are opposed to what it is doing. At a time When we are trying to'compete in the international marketplace, at a time when our exporters are trying to compete, we find that' this government, 'through' entrenching trade union power, is preventing 'Australia from achieving international best practice. We could forgive the government if it seriously and genuinely thought it was doing the right thing, but it knows that there will be another election in a couple of years time-or perhaps sooner-and it knows that, once again, it will need trade union donations. So the government has simply sold out to the trade union dollar. It has gone along with the concept of portgiving the unions fair value for their electoral support. We are not allowed to say that that is dishonest, but it is certainly unethical. The Australian people will be totally opposed to it. I am really sorry that the government has not taken the opportunity to redress the very bad legislation which was forced through the House last year. The government really ought to move in the right direction, not in the wrong direction. The government has proven itself once again to bea government of the unions, by the unions, for the unions. < The perhaps unintentional admission by the honourable member for Oxley that the appointment of Justice Dierdre O'Connor will encourage women to join the trade union movement is another indication of the way in which this government plays politics. It is quite demeaning to Justice Dierdre O'Connor that the honourable member for Oxley comes in here and says, 'You people have to support this bill as a means of boosting the female membership of trade unions'. We know that, following the boosting of female membership of trade unions, those trade unions will have more funding, and where will that funding end up? It will end up in the coffers of the ALP at the time of the next election. The honourable member for Oxley has told us the real reason for this bill: to bolster trade union membership. The· honourable member for Oxley said that it was to bolster women's membership of trade unions, but the trade unions :will take membership from anywhere; They cannot attract it through their own effectiveness. The government stands condemned.. The honourable member for Oxley haspropably been honest. He .should be commended for that. But we. should not strongly support this piece of legislation. The opposition is not opposing it, but we are supporting the' amend.mentmoved by the honourable member f.oraennelong .. The government ought to take a very close look· at the administration of· industrial tions. We are not trying to treat workers as though they do not have any rights. What we really want is to create a competitive system where people are able to get a job; businesses are .able to invest, the economy will get going, Australia will be able to export,and we will have jobs for Australians; including young Australians. Unfortunately, the.government does not have the capacity to take the right steps in the area of industrial relations. That is a very. great tragedy. The government stands condemned for the legislation which was passed last year. I hope that the government will change its mind. I hope that we turn this area of no competition into true competition so that trade unions are treated in the same way that other bodies in the Australian community are treated.",121
186,Mr VAILE,Unknown,"It is certainly a pleasure to get the opportunity to speak again on the government's disgraceful attempt at reform in the industrial relations area in Australia, which began at the start of last year and continues, with the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill before the House tonight. It is interesting to note that the government speakers on this bill have not turned up-they have withdrawn from the speakers'list-'-sothereisnot a great deal of commitment to what their executive is doing. The government has made a disgraceful attempt· at reform in the area of industrial . relations. Attheend of last year, just prior to Christmas, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) introduced the main bill. The point from which the government started and the point at which it ended up with that bill is just outrageous; The people of Australia know exactly what happened. They know that the ACTU pulled all the levers and told the government what to put in and what .to take out. Now we have a continuation of that. The biIlwe are debating tonight contains a provision which enables a judge·of the Federal Court to concurrently hold the position of President of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission on. a fixed term. This bill stems from the government's decision' to nominate Justice Dierdre O'Connor for appointment as President of the Australian relaIndustrial Relations Commission. for a five year term. There are lots of problems with the appointment of Justice O'Connor and with this amending bill. The obvious criticism that has been run through the media is the alleged connection between Justice O'Connor and the Australian Labor Party-in particular, her links with the Minister for Industrial Relations and the right wing faction in New South Wales. Justice O'Connor's experience in the field of industrial relations has also been criticised. Section 10 of the principal act proviQes that the Governor General may only appoint a person as president if he· or she satisfies certain criteria. One criterion provides that: in the opinion of the Governor General, the person is, because of skills and experience in the field of industrial relations; a suitable person to be appointed as President. I am inno position to criticise Justice O'Connor personally. I have never met her; I have no association whatsoever with her. However, I agree with the argument put forward by Mr Noakes, the Executive Director of the Austral-. Ian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, who argues that it·would have been far better if the person appointed. had the experience as required by the act. The nomination for appointment of Justice O'Connor contained three departures from previous practice; Firstly, she will retain her position as a judge of the Federal Court while she is president of the IRC. Section 15 of the Industrial Relations Act 1988, the principal act, provides that, while a person may hold an appointment under the principal act and at the same time hold an office on a federal tribunal, he or she may not hold an appointment under the principal act and be a member of a court created by the parliament,and that includes the Federal Court. Therefore, this amending legislation is before the parliament. Secoridly, Justice O'Connor's appointment will be for a fixed period of five years. Currently, section 16 of the principal act provides that members of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission hold office until they resign or reach the age of 65. Her appointment will be the first for a fixed term. In a press release dated 28 February 1994 the minister stated: The five-year tenn will apply only to Justice O'Connor. The government's policy remains that members of the Commission should nonnally be appointed up to the statutory retirement age years, but we are prepared to make a one-off provision for Justice O'Connor in light of her outstanding qualities. Future Presidents will be appointed under the usual provisions. The third significant feature of her appointment is that she will be the first woman to head the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. It is an interesting aspect and was alluded to quite a bit through the address by the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott). Only time will tell but one would certainly hope that this is not tokenism, that this is not gender bias. We hope that Justice . O'Connor is being appointed by the government to this position, albeit through the means of this amending legislation to get around the principal act, on her merits and her qualities to dispense the obligations that she will have in this job. This is an important issue because the Minister for Industrial Relations is changing the laws of thifi country to suit this one appointment. It is a very dangerous precedent that this Labor government continues to set by tampering with the laws of this country to suit its own personal agendas. A more important criticism, however, is the precedent this government is setting by mixing judicial and quasi-legislative powers. Whilst I understand the justice in question will not be exercising both powers at the same time, the government is again tampering with the laws of the land by mixing the two together. This was stated by the High Court during the boilermakers case, where it ruled that it is unconstitutional for a body to exercise both powers-and it certainly can be argued that Justice O'Connor is in a position where she is doing just that. Since I entered the House of Representatives just over a year ago, I have been amazed by the way this Labor government has used its majority in this place to change the laws of this land to suit its own imperial agendas. It has treated the institutions of this country, that have endured since federation, with absolute contempt. I think the way this whole industrial relations reform process has taken place has been a disgrace for this country. The word 'reform' is wrong; it is a misuse of the queen's English. It is not reforti1; it is a retrograde step in industrial relations. This of 65 parliament is about to address a document on national competition, yet we have this .disgraceful piece of legislation being put through this parliament that is going to get royal assent later on this month. I cannot believe the favours that the government does for the ACTU-and we know why it does them. My concerns are probably best summarised by that now famous quote by Jennie George, the Vice..:President of the ACTU, who said: What employers have to understand is that we'we' being the ACTUwon the election in March and this bi\lthat is, the Industrial Relations Reform Billis a payback for the commitments thi\t were made by the government in the course of that election campaign. It is a payback for the millions of dollars that the ACTU stoked into the coffers of the Australian Labor Party to win government in 1993. This Labor government has shown absolute contempt for the law and procedures, and has shown implicit contempt for the institution it professes to defend. If anything, with the Industrial Relations ReformAct and the subsequent commission appointments, the Labor government has turned the Industrial Relations Commission into a citadel for the ACTU. As the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) alluded to in his address earlier on during the debate this evening, n.oless than five app.ointments .of vice-presidents .of the Australian Industrial Relati.ons C.ommissi.on are straight .out.of the ACTU. I qu.ote fr.om Hansard a speech made by Senat.or Kemp in the Semite .on Tuesday this week: . . . the presidential members of the commission have been stacked with ACTU operatives: Jan Marsh, Alan Boulton, Ian Watson and Jenny Acton are already presidential members; lain Ross, as has been mentioned, has just been appOinted. All these individuals come directly from the office of 8iIJ Kelty. If it is not so impOrtant whether these people have a union background or an employer's background, why are all these major appointments coming straight out of the ACTU? . That is a questi.on that the pe.ople of Australia must ask. Are weg.oing t.o get biased .or unbiased decisi.ons c.oming .out.of the Australian Industrial Relati.ons C.ommissi.on when we have five .out.of that number .of vicepresidents. c.oming straight from the ACTU? Why? So the Australian Lab.or Party can pay back the ACTU f.or the fav.ours that it has d.one .over the years. Ms Jenny Act.on was gping t.o be .one .of the c.ontestants in a preselecti.onin H.otham, but the payback f.or her stepping .out .of that preselecti.on t.o all.ow the current h.on.ourable. member f.or H.otham (Mr Crean) t.o win it is a seat .on the Australian Industrial Relati.ons C.ommissi.on. The pe.ople .of Australia need t.o kn.ow these things .. They need t.o kn.ow the disgusting way that this g.overnment treats these very imp.ortant instituti.ons in this c.ountryI was recently reading a b.o.ok which tried t.o separate reigning. and ruling, the tWQ .operative wQrds in the PQlitical system .of a devel.opmental state. The b.o.ok argued that devel.opmental states, such as Australia, create a situati.on where p.oliticians reign but the bureaucrats rule. I w.ould add .one m.ore dimensi.on t.o this· in current Australian PQlit-­ cal· hist.ory. It is true t.o argue that, while PQliticians reign, bureaucrats and theACTU rule. This is being b.orne .out and prQven every day that we sit in this place and see the things that the Labor gQvernment is doing-the ACTU in Australia rules. It is sickening t.o think that this gQvernment is merely a puppet f.or the main player in t.oday's p.olitical life-the Australian C.ouncil .of Trade UniQns. I emphasise this absurdity in g.overnment PQlicy by referring tQ the Hilmer repQrt. This repQrt, supp.osedly a rep.ort .on nati.onal c.ompetiti.on p.olicy,. argues f.or the .opening up .of nearly every sectiQn .of industry and business t.o the fQrces .of c.ompetiti.on in a j.oint .appr.oach. H.owever, the QbviQUS cQntrol that the ACTU has .over this g.overnment becQmes QbviQUS when .on. page 24 .of the executive .overview it states: Specific exemptions set out in the Trade Practices Act. The committee sees a continuing role for some specific exemptions in the act itself. The current limited exemptions for labour agreementS, standards; restrictive covenants, export contracts and consumer boycotts should be retained. This gQvernment is telling the rest .of Australia, 'YQU bec.ome much m.ore c.ompetitive. NQ protecti.on, nQ assistance; y.ou win yQur market share with best practices, nQt the labQur market YQU will have all the protectiQn under the sun. YQU will have the protectiQn .of the CQmmQnwealth gQvernment and the uniQn m.ovement'. There is nQ move t.o create c.omplete cQmpetitiQn as far as the lab.our market is cQncerned'. Mr Nehl-That's Lab.or's equity.",125
187,Mr VAILE,Unknown,"Exactly, that is Labor's equity all right·If this g.overnment sees such w.on- . ders and ·benefit in devel.oping a nati.onal cQmpetitiQn PQlicy, let us make it a full and c.omplete natiQnal cQmpetitiQn policy and ensure that n.ot .only c.ontrolled gQvernment business enterprises bec.ome c.ompetitive but alsQ the labQur market becQmes cQmpetitive in the Australian marketplace.

By hamstringing labQur market refQrm the g.overnment is in fact jeQpardising the whQle basis .of anatiQnal c.ompetiti.on PQlicy. This· refQrm will n.ot be w.orth. a crumpet unless this gQvernment is prepared t.o address that imbalance. If we f.orce .one side .of the equatiQn tQ becQme mQre cQmpetitive and .open it up tQ the marketplace, we must force the .other side as well. This is certainly a situation .when bowing to its union mates which may cause a great deal of grief for this government, so it may as well be aware of that now. The Industrial Relations Commission's expanded responsibility, and the disproportionately large number of senior commissi<)n personnel who are drawn from the trade union movement, is typical of this government's lopsided. approach to industrial relations . reform.' Indeed, the whole area of a separate court structure' must be reviewed because the Law Council of Australia has argued that specialist courts are always going to be suspect because the concern is that they will do special deals for special people. We. are seeing these special deals taking place now with the appointment of Justice O'Connor; the introduction of this amendment before the House today; the appointment of Mr Ross, an ex-ACTU member, as head of the enterprise bargaining division of the commission; and the appointment of at least five deputy commissioners. who are all ACTU officials. The government has made this a specialist court. I am quite sure that the government is fully aware of this, but it is using this whole process as a paybackopportunity and a possible future legislative hurdle for genuine workplace reform. It will be interesting to see, over the life of this new Industrial Relations Court, whether the special favours for special people approach by this government continues into the Federal Court. The bill allows for concurrent positions to be held and there will obviously be pressure on appointees to the new labour court to get concurrent positions on the more prestigious Federal Court. In the reverse, the appointment of Justice O'Connor from the Federal Court highlights the strength of the coalition argument that there really is no need for a new labour court. By appointing Federal Court judges to the labour court, there seems to be a great deal of unnecessary overlap in the procedure. I dismiss this amendment as more of the same from this minister who has made a practice throughout his career of doing special favours for special friends. It goes back more than 20 years, and we all know about that. . The new la:bour court will' create a dangerousprecederit in Australian law, not only by confusing the balance of arbitral· and judicial functions but also by creating confusion about section 10 of the principal act which deals with the appointment of the president. I think the one-off fixed term also has strange political implications. I question the legal power being handed over by this government to the authorities or ex-authorities within the ACTU. The last six months of industrial relations has been nothing more than a joke. The Minister for Industrial Relations calls this the most important piece of legislative reform in industrial relations since 1904. That is rubbish. industrial relations ministers have been repeating that claim like broken records over the last few years. For example, Minister Willis described the Industrial Relations Bill 1988 as 'the most substantial revision of Australia's federal industrial.relations system undertaken since the system was established in 1984'. This government is like a broken record in the area of industrial relations. It is bending over backwards to improve its relationship with the ACTU-and nothing else. Its reform package has done nothing but create more hurdles within the workplace and it has done nothing to introduce genuine flexibility into the labour marke.t. . Since the reform package was introduced last October, there has been much comment within the community about this legislation. I want to read some of the comments I have read and collected from the newspapers: It will not assist in delivering the flexibility and productivity which is required if Australian industry is to become and remain internationally competitive. The insistence on allowing unions to be involved in agreements in non-un ionised workplaces will be a serious inhibition on such agreements. The additional prescription of minimum standards through use of external affairs power to override the state jurisdictions where serious reform has been attempted is an unwarranted intrusion into areas of state authority. These are the comments of people out there in the' community. They are comments not from the so-called capitalists, as the members of the government call them, but from working people who are members of unions and who want to see genuine reform. Maybe this government started out with the intention of genuine reform at the beginning of last year, following the election. Maybe it intended to introduce some flexibility into the industrial relations arena, but it certainly did not end up that way, particularly with this amending bi1l that is before us tonight. The amendment that has been moved by the honourable member for Bennelong, which I have seconded, states: whilst not declining to give the BiJI a second reading, the House: (1) deplores the Government's incompetent management of the industrial relations portfolio, incompetence which has again forced it to bring in hasty amendments to the Industrial Relations Act; and (2) condemns the submissive attitude the Government continues to demonstrate toward the ACTU, reflected in: (a) the Industrial Relations Commission's unduly expanded responsibility; and (b) the disproportionately large number of senior Commission personnel who have been drawn from the trade union movement. It is outrageous that we have to put up with this sort of legislation coming before this parliament when Australia is in such a critical situation as far as its balance of payments, foreign debt and unemployment levels are concerned. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) called for a major document on national competition policy and that document has now been put before this parliament and the people of Australia. We are looking at opening up competition, not only to large and small business and to government, but also to government business enterprisesCommonwealth government business enterprises and state government business enterprises. But what is lacking? Who is not going to be opened up to competition in Australia? It is the trade union movement. This government has become absolutely and totally subservient to the ACTU in Australia and it will do as it is told. We guarantee that, when this national competition policy is drafted and we have some legislation flowing from it, there will be no competition for the labour movement in Australia; there will be no competition in the labour market; the ACTU will be in control and this Labor government will remain subservient to the ACTU.",127
188,Mr CHARLES,Unknown,"As we debate the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill, which will amend a bill that we put through this parliament late in December, it is a shame that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) is not in the House to listen to the contributions by, unfortunately, almost no-one from his side of the House and, more importantly, members from our side of the House. It is disappointing that the minister is not here, but it is not unexpected. That is his usual practice. The combination of power between the government and the union bureaucracy has now reached proportions which are no longer sustainable. This is undoubtedly a government in chaos. We just heard on the news that Senator Richardson is now leaving us. He is the second most powerful government figure in the other place. He is leaving the govern;. ment and the parliament. Let us go down the list: Richo has gone; Dawkins has gone; Kerin has gone; Kelly has gone; and Griffiths is out of the ministry, probably forever but certainly in the short term. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has had three changes in his ministry in the last blessed 12 months! What will he do in the next 12 months?",129
189,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,Mr Hollis)Order! .I remind the honourable member that we are not talking about changes in the ministry.,129
190,Mr SINCLAIR,Unknown,But they are interesting.,129
191,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,"They might be interesting, but they have little to do with the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill 1994. I ask the speaker to confine his remarks to the bill and to let others worry about changes in the ministry.",129
192,Mr CHARLES,Unknown,"I thank you for your advice, Mr Deputy Speaker.",129
193,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,Unknown,You will heed it too.,129
194,Mr CHARLES,Unknown,"I am drawing the attention of the House to the fact that the Minister for Industrial Relations, who has not ·bothered to come into this House to debate his bill, may well beon the list of changes due for us too. If that does not spell chaos, what does? It begs the question: where is Laurie? Is he going up, down. sideways or out? Heaven only knows!. This minister is a well-known apparatchik in the New South Wales Labor Right. He has a long and memorable history of operating within the confines of that .Labor Party bureaucracy. We kndw some of the history of the Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister for Transport. His' history here is' one of setting up the potential to destroy the entire industrial relations system as we know it today and as we have known it in the past. It is interesting that, as this government in chaos fails; so. also will the whole bureaucratic structure· surrounding the award system, the Industrial Relations Commission and this new Industrial Relations Court. which is dealt with in this bill. They will all become subject to such immense pressure, such as the. government front-bench is subjected to today. that they will cave in upon themselves. They are doomed to failure; This government is so arrogant that it brought in a reform bill last December which is supposed to reform the system and improve productivity but which instead is absolutely nothing but a payback bill to the ACTU,the mates of those on the other side of the House. I note. that one of my colleagues happens to be. sitting on the wrong side of the House at the moment and I do not tar him· with the same brush. This bill is a payback bill. There is no question about that because during the campaign leading up to the 13 March election the unions very clearly pulled out all stops, to a greater extent than we have known in modern history in Australia, funded the ALP campaign and put people on the ground to make sure that the ALP was returned and that our Prime Minister, now presiding over this chaotic government. was returned to guide the Australian people into chaos. This bill really is unnecessary. In the first place, I fail to understand why the government found it necessary to create a specialist court. to find unfair dismissal. Do we have in Australia so many cases of management in industry sacking people for no good cause that we need to set up an entire court system to deal with the issue? Is this court system destined to become an unfair dismissal finder? Is it in place to make sure there are. unfair dismissals? It does beg the question. Perhaps it might find one or two cases; but will it manufacture them?, That is entirely possible. This bill creates special circumstances for a special court that Australia has not found to be necessary in the past. I personally find no problem with the minister's appointment of Justice Deirdre O'Connor as head of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. I think it is disappointing that special rules have to be made in the Industrial Relations Actin order to allow. her to serve and for a limited period. Notwithstanding her background, one may assume that she is, as a Federal Court judge, impartial and unbiased and that she will fairly adjudicate those matters which properly come before her. I wish her well in her new job; I wish her no harm whatsoever. I hope that her appointment as head now gives us someone from without the industrial relations system itself. to perhaps bring some objectivity into play. We have talked many times in this place about the industrialrelations club. the industrial relations club is an object. I believe. that was defined some number of years ago by Max Newton-dear. departed Max. Max had some very unkind things to say about the industrial relations club because he thought it was incestuous. In fact, perhaps it is. The Industrial Relations Reform Bill not only builds on those bureaucratic procedures which have been in place fora very long time but also enhances them so that, instead"" of making it easier for employers and employees to negotiate and decide on employees' wages and conditions of employment-in fact. on all of their working conditions; how they are going to structure their working lives-we are now making it more difficult. The number of procedures that are required in order to' get certification of an enterprise agreement is absolutely horrific .. One could say positively that this amending bill is an employment generating piece of legislation because certainly we are going to enhance the livelihood of many solicitors and barristers who will appear in front of this jurisdiction. It has now become so legalistic and so difficult to defend one's position in respect of an award, to challenge a current position in respect of an award, to defend one's position in respect of having dismissed an employee; or for employees in facl' to defend their position in terms of their rights in requesting more redress than they have been offered previously by their employer, that legal people will now be required to be involved and that means cost. So I guess we will employ more barristers, solicitors, clerks and secretaries, and probably cleaners to clean the offices. Perhaps we fire up the construction industry again cause more offices will now have to be built for the legal profession in order to be able deal with industrial relations matters, matters which ought to be simply a matter of consent and agreement between one who wishes to employ and one who wishes to be employed. We talk frequently in this place-those on legislation. the government benches do as much as those on this side-about this thing called productivity. Productivity is an important issue. Clearly the government has over the past few years opened upour economy to competition both internally and externa:1ly. It has freed the dollar, it has freed bur financial instituhere. tions from the constraints under which operated and it has helped to break down tariff barriers, which represented a huge protectionist wall around our country. For those things I applaud the government. that it has done positive and good things. We talk today about meetings between the heads of government of the Commonwealth and the seat. states in order to create some more microeconomic reform in order to break down some more of the barriers in order to introduce competition in government owned enterprises, particularly the utilities which affect all of us in an expense sense. All of these things are very positive. But when it comes to industrial relations do· not talk about productivity. We do not talk about gain. We talk about protection. That is what this court is alI about. We are here talking about protection for union mates from this now chaotic government. That protection means that we are spending more money protecting people in unprotectable jobs .and protecting work practices which in fact should have been thrown out with the ark. We spend alI this time trying to protect retrenched positions and the union bureaucrats in their jobs, but we do· not do one single thing about productivity. The Prime Minister on 21 April last gave such a terrific speech at the Institute of Company Directors in Melbourne and offered up so much hope to Australia and Australians that we would in fact finally deregulate our over-regulated industrial relations practices will and that· we would allow. employers and beemployees to decide for themselves how they would work and for what wages and condito tions. In his words, we would over time reduce the complexity of awards and reduce their impact in the community. But that is not what has happened. Those fine sentiments of the Prime Minister on 21 April have not translated into pUblic policy in terms of The Minister for Industrial Relations is simply doing the job that he has been given by his union masters. He is doing absolutely what he was told. This is all to do with a up payback. The ACTU might as well move in We have so many empty spots on the they front bench now, why do we not move the executive of the ACTU into the House of Representatives? These people control the government anyway, do they not? Let us let I agree· them have a go.",129
195,Mr HOWARD,Unknown,l reckon they're going to get rid of Bob Carr and give him Richardson's,131
196,Mr CHARLES,Unknown,"That is entirely possible too. We might as well fill up all these empty seats with Bill KeItys and lain Rosses--'-the lot of them. Richo has gone from the Senate, and enough have gone from the House that we surely could find room for. them. At question time on a Tuesday or a Wednesday, we so much of the front bench is empty because alI the rest of them are having a rostered day off that there is miles of room for them. There are heaps of opportunities here for the ACTU to fill government places. These people have filled the places of the Industrial Relations Commission. Ultimately they will fill the places in the court. They are going to fill the places in the enterprise bargaining division of the Industrial Relations Commission. They' might as well fill the places in this House. I am sure that the ParliamentarySecretaiy to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan), who is at the table, would enjoy having some of union mates join him here. It would make offer things easier; He would not have to spend much time on the telephone. He could get down to the nitty,;gritty right here in Parliadesires ment House. We talk about productivity. cannot Perhaps that will be a productivity improvethrough ment for the government. It is entirely possible.' The enterprise bargaining division or'the Industrial Relations Court should offer industry, unions and individuals the opportunity arrive at fair-struck bargains, arid it should'do something about enhancing real enterprise bargaining in Australia. But it will not, because it starts on the premise, as backed International Labour Organisation conventions which this government has brought into country by the vehicle of the external affairs power of the constitution, that it will use those measures to prop up the whole system. As the minister says, enterprise bargaining above award bargaining. The award is the minimum, so all the employees' conditions stay. there and then they are allowed gain about how much more they get. We cannot have the flexibility that companies need or that individuals want in order to achieve a better outcome. Let us take the case of a woman who, because of economic necessity;' has to join the work force but has young children at home. Her husband works daylight hours. She would like a job that starts late in the afternoon and finishes by midnight. She is probably not fussed whether it is five days a week or three days a week. She might even be happy to work on the weekend, when her husband is home to take care of the children. What are her prospects? She goes to employer X, who· says, . 'I would love to give you a job because I would like to keep this joint open from four or five in the afternoon to midnight. Unfortunately, the award says that I have to pay time and a half for everything after five o'clock' . She says, 'But I don't want time and a half. It is just a regular job that I want'. He .says, 'I don't want to pay you time and a half because I can't afford it-it is uneconomical for me to keep my business open during those hoursso I would like to pay you straight time' .. his Guess what? Surprise, surprise, he cannot her a job; he cannot give her a place. So so we are denying her an employment opportunity. She is an, individual who wants to work, to work, is ready to work, but we give hera job. It is because the union, the award, says so. Why? It is be. cause it is protecting t-e jobs of those who ... are in jobs. That is one of the demonstrable reasons why we have a million unemployed. It is clear that all of these rules and regulato tions and these mechanisms for protection act to our detriment in terms of employment. Last April the Prime Minister had it right in the words that he m-ed, but unfortunately along by came his New South Wales Right mate, the Minister forIndustrial Relations-for as long our as he remains that; heaven only knows, . perhaps he will be Prime Minister next week. At the rate we are going, perhaps Paul will go next week. That would create a big opening, is would it not? Who would fill that? It would not be Richo. Kim Beazley? It would not be Dawkins any more.

In summary, this' bill is not necessary. This bill is simply another indication of the chaos in which this government finds itself, of the great mess that it has made of the whole industrial relations agenda, and of the ultimate failure of the whole system-as this. government itself is demonstrably failing.

198,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order! Earlier today the honourable member for Brisbane (MrBevis) raised a matter of privilege on behalf of the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. The honourable member advised the House that the committee  who had given evidence to the committee claiming to have been denied accesstoa  his involvement with the committee inquiry had been cited as the reason for not denying him acc,:ess and that he had been told that army officers would no longer talk to him because he had appeared before the committee. The honourable member stated that the committee had subsequently written to and received a letter from a Mr Ken Brown, who  denied access to the defence premises, which  I have considered the information provided by the honourable member and the letters from MrPool and Mr Brown which the of over honourable member tabled. The punishment derived or imposition of a penalty on a person on hole"". account of having given evidence to a parliamentary committee is a wel1-established railway category of contempt.

Accordingly, I willing to allow precedence to a motion in respect of the matter.

NA Motion (by Mr Duncan) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Student Scholarships: National Capital",133
199,Mr TUCKEY,Unknown,"As most honourable members know, since 1983 I have brought students from senior high schools within my electorate to the national capital on education scholarships. Tonight in the Speaker's gal1ery I have two such young people, who are the 35th and 36th students to participate in this scholarship. They are Rosalind Wadley, 15 years of age, a year 10 student from Narrogin senior high school, and Regan MCClure, also 15 years of age, a year 10 student from Mount Barker senior high school. They are both in the gal1ery. I take the opportunity to thank Ansett Australia for its assistance in this educational program. As my guests, these students are here to learn first-hand the operations of this parliament and to visit some of the points of interest in Canberra. Part of this arrangement is that my guests prepare a speech for me to deliver to the parliament. I will now proceed to do just that. Rosalind writes: Narrogin-founded in the 1890's has a population 5,000 and is situated two and a half hours drive south-east of Perth. The word ""Narrogin"" is from an Aboriginal word meaning ""water The town of Narrogin has developed from the line that runs through the middle of town. people living in Narrogin in the 18908 were or they worked on the railway. The railway since then partially closed down. It was originally used to transport goods, including primary . produce and passengers to Perth and down to Road transport has taken over this job. Narrogin has three primary schools, a senior high school, an agricultural school and a TAFE. The high school with a population of 900 has the largest am government residential college in Australia. The'schOolhas to cater for a vast and varying type of students and does so admirably with specialist courses in science, aeronautics and cricket. There is a large music department including three concert bands and various other ensembles. The school won his the country week champion school trophy in 1993 and in fact has won this award for IS out of the last 20 years. The youth of the town tum sport into a huge social event and every Tuesday and Friday nights basketball attracts 500 participants. Sporting teams from Narrogin compete against surrounding town teams such as Wagin, Wickepin and Cuballing, some teams travelling over two hundred kilometres to participate. The district has produced a number of state players. Many children also participate in the large music program Narrogin offers. The week long central south eisteddfod culminating in a talent concert is a highlight. The town still retains its old fashioned family and country aspects such as preserving and jam making. The centre of town is made up of beautiful old buildings in the colonial style. Many houses around town are large and of old brick, with bull-nosed verandas. Narrogin was one of the first towns to lead the way with street-scaping, recognising and retaining the beauty in the old buildings. Narrogin as a town possesses a unique community feeling which shows in the enthusiasm in which citizens participate in town events like sport and picnics, festivals and exhibitions. , It is a great town for families and for children to grow up feeling secure and appreciated. It is well worth the effort to drop in one day. I am slire that that comment is directed to you, Mr Acting Speaker. Regan writes: The Plantagenet area in' the south-west of Western Australia serves a wide agricultural area. Previously noted for its apple growing, the emphasis is now on sheep, cattle and winegrowing. MOlint Barker, the centre of the shire of Plantagenet, is an ideal holiday centre with ample shopping and recreation facilities as well as being within easy reach of the Stirling and Porongurup ranges. The Mount Barker senior high school, situated on the northern edge of the Mount Barker, townsite, has an enrolment of approximately 330 students. Along with the normal secondary subjects, agricultural courses are also on offer, as the school is situated on a farm. Sheep and cattle are raised, as well as the cultivatoppressed'. ing of grains, poultry, bees, vegetables, trees and a vineyard. Just recently an aquaculture system has been introduced. All students participatin-g in the courses take an active role in hands-on farm work, such as shearing, harvesting and handling of stock. Surrounded by unspoilt scenic countryside and beautifully kept school gardens and lawns, the Mount Barker senior high school is an idyllic location for the education of students. Standard subjects such as Maths, English, Science and Social Studies are well catered for in appropriate Classrooms. Sporting interests are given ample attention with a wide range of sports being played, the most popular being Aussie rules and cricket. Mount Barker has the reputation of being one of the best football schools in the region. To the east of the high school are some of the biggest and oldest ranges in Western Australia, these being the Stirling and Porongurup ranges. The Stirling ranges provide a challenge for the adventurous in the climbing of Bluff Knoll, the highest peak standing at 1073 metres. There are also many tracks providing easy access to wildlife and flora. The Porongurup ranges allow easy walking tracks which lead to most of the peaks and spectacular views. One of Mount Barker's newest and most successful industries is viticulture. Wineries from all around the Plantagenet shire are gaining recognition statewide, nationally and even overseas. Mount Barker's climate is ideal for the growing of top class Rhine Riesling, along with other varieties.",134
200,Mr ACTING SPEAKER,Unknown,"Icpngratulate the two young students involved for their, contributions. Hardy, Mr Frank",135
201,Mr ROBERT BROWN,Unknown,"Frank Hardy died on Friday, 28 January this year. The public celebration of his life was held on Friday, 4 February in the Collingwood Town Hall. On Tuesday, 8 February, the Sydney Morning Herald pub:Iishedan article by GerardHenderson entitled 'It's time we got frank about Hardy's great, blunder'. "" Henderson made some quite strange assertions fora person of his intelIectual stature. I was not so concerned about his strange assertipns as a1;>out his appalling claim that 'for the most part he '-that is, Hardy'supported the oppressors against ,the He alsp claimed that 'on the big issues of his time Hardy had been essentially wrong'. On 21 February, I wrote a letter to the editor of the Sydney Morning Herald defending Frank. Hardy, who I believe had been seriously maligned by the Henderson article. Although the Sydney Morning Herald allowed Frank Hardy to be maligned when he could not defend himself; it did not allow me to defend him. My letter was not published. I now place on record the letter which the Sydney Morning Herald failed to print. It states: The Editor Sydney Morning Herald GPO Box 3771 SYDNEY 2001 Dear Sir NA I could take issue with much of what Gerard Henderson said about Frank Hardy (SMH.8.2.94). Allow me to respond to one of his claims. Mr Henderson declared ""But for the most part he (Hardy) supported the oppressors against the oppressed. Of that there is no doubt ... "" Indeed there is! It is an outrageous claim! It is manifestly wrong. It is offensive to every ideal Frank Hardy ever held, every objective he 'pursued, every word he wrote, every action he took. Mr Henderson went on to say ""the evidence is contained in his Stalinist tract Journey Into The Future"". In his wiser moments not even Gerard Henderson would claim that one book written in 1952 and repu4iated nearly 30 years ago in 1968 would provide the evidence for such a monstrous assertion. About Journey Into The Future Frank Hardy confided in me 'I would dream that dream again.' Millions of people, besides Hardy, were vulnerable to the claims of the Stalinist propagandists that Soviet Communism represented a transitionary stage to an ideal socialist society. It was part of their philosophy, their belief system, their idealism for a world free of oppression. The carefully staged presentation of Soviet society to visitors helped to confirm their confidence in and commitment to a real new world order. with real democracy, real freedom, real equality, real security. They were the big issues of Hardy's time. In his pursuit of those ideals, he was not wrong. Henderson also said ""Sure Hardy did some kind things."" Juxtaposed against his ""support for oppressors"" claim that is a gratuitous and patronising state::nent. It seriously understates Hardy's bold, imaginative, courageous ,and self sacrificing acts. It diminished Hardy's enormous generosity with his time, energy and resources. Those who came to Collingwood Town Hall to farewell Frank Hardy filled it to overllowing'"" Titers, singers, actors, musicians, artists, punters, union leaders, politicians (including our own national icon Gough Whitlam), Aborigines (including Mick Rangiari and Michael Paddy all the way from the Northern Territory), Eritreans, old comrades and young radicals, housewives and, above all, hundreds of ordinary people who cared; They have passed their judgement on Frank Hardy. It is a more generous one than that of Gerard Henderson. Indeed it is vale Frank Hardy. We will not see the likes of him again. Yours sincerely NA Mr Acting Speaker, Gerard Henderson introduced his article on Frank Hardy with the same words with which I concluded my letter-'vale Frank Hardy'. It disappoints me that Gerard Henderson was not as generous as I have known him to be. It disappoints me more that the Sydney Morning Herald refused to allow me to repudiate such a repugnant claim against Frank Hardy. Peanut Industry",135
202,Mr TRUSS,Unknown,"The Australian peanut industry is one of our nation's great industries. Over recent years, it has suffered from poor seaso!1s and an ageing infrastructure. Chinese imports have done great damage to markets. This year's crop is somewhat better. It has enjoyed better seasons, although disease and pest pressure have created many problems for local farmers. The harvest is about to begin. It promises to be a better harvest than in previous years, although aflatoxin build-up is certain to be a problem. Every so often, there is a breakthrough in farm machinery design that brings a technological advance which provides new hope for an industry. There have been many in the peanut industry over the years. When mechanical pulling replaced the back-breaking hand work and when mechanical harvesting, mobile thrashing, bulk-handling and artificial drying came along, all were significant advances for the industry. Another breakthrough is now available to the industry. A new harvesting machine has been developed in America called the Magnum Fource. It has about treble the capacity of any existing machinery. It can harvest high moisture peanuts, which will have the radical advantage of being able to reduce the risk and quality loss that is associated with weeks of curing peanuts in the field. It will also prevent the build-up of aflatoxin, perhaps the most serious threat to the peanut industry, by enabling the crop to be harvested quickly and then. artificially dried. If Australia is to keep up with the rest of the world, it must have this harvesting technology. A handful of these machines have been imported intp Australia, but they are penalised with a 10 per cent duty. Early in 1993, the industry sought a tariff concession on the import of this peanut machinery. There are a couple of local manufacturers in the Kingaroy area but between them they have sold only one machine over the last two years. That has partly been due to poor economic circumstances. But, when new technology comes along, it is very difficult to persuade farmers that they should invest in yesterday's machine. One of these manufacturers H. Stolzenberg lodged an objection to the tariff concession and so it was refused. On 26 October 1993, the industry lodged a new application with the Department of Industry, Technology· and Commerce for a concessional entry of these machines under item No. 46, new technology. By 20 January this year, the industry had not received a reply to its quite extensive application. So it made inquiries with the department only to be told that it had not even been looked at three months after the application had been lodged and that it would be another two months before any bureaucrat got around to opening the file. That is simply not good enough. I wrote to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Senator Cook) complaining that the industry would have to wait five months before the application would even be considered, let alone have the merits of the particular case looked at. I complained to Senator Cook. I got a reply on 21 February telling me that he regretted it but, unfortunatesociety ly, he could do nothing to expedite the examination of the application. I raised this matter because, with the size our massive Public Service, it is simply not good enough that an industry has to wait five months to have its application even considered. I contrast this with the department's attitude to importing peanuts that are grown in other parts of the world. The department seems to have bent over backwards to allow the import of poor quality peanuts, which have flooded the domestic market and caused serious damage to the reputation of the industry. Some of these peanuts are of such poor quality and are so contaminated that Ian MCFarlane, the President of the QGGA, commented recently that they 'glow in the dark'. These peanuts are allowed in, seemingly without question and without delay. But when the industry wants to import new machinery to bring our industry up to world standard by using technology that is available to the rest of the world, its application is being held up for five months before it is even considered. It is not good enough for Senator Cook to sleep in around the world or here. He must get his department into gear so that it can consider these applications quickly. The peanut industry harvest will start within days. It must have an answer immediately.. (Time expired) Multiculturalism",136
203,Mr TANNER,Unknown,"I wish to raise some concerns this evening with respect to several matters r-garding multiculturalism in this country. The first of these is the welter of media reporting that occurred in the wake of the tragic bombing of the National Crime Authority office in Adelaide recently. We saw a veritable torrent of speculation . about the alleged involvement of the Australian mafia and all sorts of possible speculation about mafia techniques and who might be involved. In this country we seem to have lost sight "" of basic principles of people being innocent until proven guilty. In this instance, in effect, an entire very substantial ethnic group in our is being slurred by association. That slur is essentially based on little more than American gangster movies and a culture of, of to some extent, fantasy that has developed over many years. Now that a person has been arrested for that outrageous crime, I would like to think that the media could restrain itself and deal with the issues based on substance, evidence and, ultimately, the proper workings of the courts and not allow an entire section of our community to be slurred by association. It may be a joke to some but it is extremely serious to people who have to put up wiih the implications that emerge from that. If a person has a certain name, lives in a certain area or is engaged in certain occupations, then people will naturally tend to draw those conclusions if this sort of stuff is fuelled. Secondly, comments have been made by a number of people about the Slav-Macedonian and Greek communities, particularly in Melbourne, and the very unfortunate violent incidents in recent times which, on their face, may be attributable to the issue that is currently in dispute. I refer particularly to comments by people suggesting that those who have perpetrated those crimes' should home. ,Unfortunately, many in our community forget that"" in times past, Anglo-Australians , had similar concerns about their home country : to those of more recent migrants. For exam'pIe, both my graridfathers fought in the First World War. One was an English migrant the other was of Idsh extraction born in Australia. They, like hundreds of thousands other Australians, thought nothing about Australians going to fight in a European 'in defence of what they saw as their homeTherefore, land. Therefore, we should find it totally unsurprising that people now in the country expired) who were either botnoverseas or who have left families in those countries should be very strongly concerned about what is going on in those countries, and what is happening to the people iil their country of origin and in their homeland. ' Some of these statements cause they tend to imply different levels of political violence-that in some way political violence perpetrated by people ethnic background could be connected with (g) disputes overseas is perhaps more sible than what might be described as domesUnfortunately, tic political violence. I, along with I am sure allotherhonourable members of this House, would condemn all political violence absolutely. It is not particuSBS larly appropriate to draw those distinctions , and to say that if such violence is going on , is in some way more reprehensible if it related to some issue going ,on overseas. I state unequivocally that people are come here and they are welcome to debate issues relating to their countries of odgin. They are welcome to peacefully demonstrate about those issues. They are welcome to put their views to government forcefully; They are no more welcome to engage in acts violence related to those issues than are people born in Australia or people who have been in Australia longer. Finally, I express concern about the apparFor ent resurgence of political organisations explicitly focused on preventing go immigration to Australia. r note with some concern that one of my colleagues actually supports stich an organisation in a by-election that is coming up shortly and I wish to dissociate myself from that. I find that very unfortunate. Generally speaking, I attend many functions and of many ethnic communities, often with a . representative of the opposition. Virtually of without exception people of both political parties support multiculturalism and support war the diverse Australia that we have become. I urge the opposition to apply the same approach that I have just applied with respect to somebody on our side. (Time Special Broadcasting Service",137

The television management is in Artarmon in Sydney and radio management is also in it Sydney,so that Melbourne now has very little is opportunity to participate in management decisions. Of the 42 senior positions, four are held by people who live and operate out of welSBS. Melbourne and 38 are held by people who live and operate out of Sydney. The irony is the fact that the non-English speaking background ethnic population is larger in Victoria than in Sydney. That is a fact. Melbourne is being denied the services of people of who know the issues of their own ethnic populations and their participation in management decisions. I note that the annual report of the SBS said: the fourth year in a row, SBS Radio Melbourne was awarded media recognition by the Australia any further Day Committee. That has not happened with SBS Sydney. Why not? I believe it is about the fourth time that Melbourne has won an award. Equity clearly demands that these diverse groups should be adequately represented in decision making processes. Yesterday in question time. I asked the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) a question in essence about SBS management and whether he believed that it was equitable to concentrate all the management in·Sydney. In his answer he said, amongst other things: SBS suffers from the great disadvantage that it was set up during the period of a Liberal government. What a ridiculous statement for a minister to make. Honest to goodness, that is a slap in the face to all those ethnic Australians, regardless of what city or state they live in. It is wrong to say that a political party, regardless of which political party it. was, set up SBS radio and has done badly by the ethnic community because of it. 'What an absolute disgrace', they say. The minister went on to say: I have to apologise to the honourable membermefor the fact that SBS does not have infinite resources that allows it to have offices in every capital city equal to those in Artarmon. He is a pretty sarcastic minister, too, is he not? He went on to say: SBS's obligation is to use the resources that to provide the excellent service it does in a way that uses its funds responsibly- . and note that word 'responsibly' and efficiently. I have to say to the minister that in exercising his responsibility it would be responsible to give Melbourne a fair go. If SBS TV management is going to be in Sydney, fair enough, but how about putting the radio management in Melbourne? That would make a little bit of sense with regard to equity. Increasing centralisation in Sydney means that Sydney's newsroom is staffed full time, with nine journalists, and Melbourne's is only staffed part time, with two journalists. There is a real running battle between staff in Sydney and Melbourne; there are bad feelings and it is not contributing to SBS aims. SBS broadcasters and journalists in Melbourne have strong links with the communities that they represent and those links should be used to the benefit of all the ethnic groups that want to participate in this fine service provided by SBS radio. I call on the minister to straighten this mess out and give us a bit of equity. Mount Druitt Community Legal Information and Support Centre  to talk about an exciting project in my electorate: the establishment of the Mount Druitt Community Legal Information and Support Centre. I am happy to acknowledge that I got the inspiration from visiting Merle Mitchell's operation at the Springvale centre, which has been operating for more than 20 years. Over the last month we have had a committee looking to establish a centre at Mount Druitt. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table of the committee members. Leave granted. The table read as followsNA NA Committee Members Trish Martin-Chairperson; Roger Price MP-Co Convenor; Gervaise Moran; Father Paul Hanna; Coral Mclean; Bridget Readford; Councillor, Jim . Anderson, Mayor; Kathleen Anderson; Richard it has Amery MP; Councillor Tony Aquilina MP; David Roberts-Solicitor; Brenda Chadwick; Rev Wayne Gott; Jackie Deveril; Frank Doolan; Michael Chaaya; Kate Lindsay; Capt. Graeme Craig.  Druitt has the largest police station in New South Wales, manned by 130 officers. The area has quite a number of problemshomelessness, poverty, health related problems. When we deal with some of the problems, justice issues keep on cropping. upparticularly juvenile justice issues. Until we can start sorting that out, we are not going to make headway with some of the other issues. In my electorate we have got the largest metropolitan Koori population. We clearly have the need for the centre. I am really excited about the possibility of having a centre with some paid staff, though mostly manned by volunteers, linking into the legal services that may provide a service gratis; but particularly linking into the great law schools in Sydney and perhaps final year students. The possibilities of this are unlimited. My dilemma is that we have called a public meeting on Saturday. I have written to over 13,000 people because the community needs to be consulted and to approve it. The community has to have its stamp on it,rather than individual committee members. The meeting is to be held in the polyclinic. The polyclinic was built by Gough Whitlam's governmentbecause we could not get a hospital we got a polyclinic. The problem is that to get the polyclinic for this public meeting for consultation with the public, .we were told that we had to sign a contra-t with a public liability clause. Here we have a .state Minister for Health, Ron Phillips, and a state department of health in a public building demanding of unincorporated and incorporated community organisations that in order to use a public building they must sign a public liability clause, presumably for negligence that may arise out of their operation of the centre. We rang the minister's office about two weeks ago and we were redirected to the department. The department consulted its solicitors and said that we must sign. SolicitorS on our committee said we would be fools to sign. So this afternoon I contacted the minister's office again and said, .'This .is absolutely crazy. What do you have public buildings for if not to have the public use them?'; What better purpose could there be than to have a public meeting to set up a Mount Druitt community legal information and support centre and have people there? Mr Fahey recently said that he is going to appoint a minister for red tape. What about Ron Phillips, the Minister for Health, cutting through a bit of red tape in his own flaming department and saying, 'A federally funded building should allow the public to meet there and without these ridiculous clauses'. If he is incapable of cutting through this ridiculous red tape, let him resign. If he will not resign, let the Premier, in the first implementation of his lust and thrust to cut through red tape, cut through Ron Phillips-sack him, replace him, and put in a minister for health who feels some accountability and some responsibility to the public and who is not there as a puppet to dance to the tune of the bureaucrats. I hope the minister will take action tomorrow. If not, am I to cancel the meeting? I cannot write to 13,000 people in two days and say, 'The Minister for Health won't let us use the building. Sorry. Don't tum up because we are not· going to sign a clause that we have been advised not to sign'. What does he expect me to do? What does he expect the commiace members to do? The committee is made up of most of the leading people in our area, and they are very concerned. They include my political friends, community leaders, . ministers of religion-you name them; they are on the committee. All we want to cio is consult with the public. I say that Ron Phillips should allow us to meet or he should resign. (Time expired) Pensioners: Country of Origin",138
205,Mr NEVILLE,Unknown,"I would like to finalise a member's statement which I was not able to do this afternoon. Mr Acting Speaker, you will recall that I was speaking about foreign-born pensioners who were being required by the Department of Social Security to supply information which would allow the department to obtain reciprocal arrangements on pensions from their country of origin. A number of constituents who contacted my office found it hard to understand why their cduntry of origin should affect their Australian pension. Some were so confused and. upset that they thought their residency status might be affected by this measure. It is an appalling thing to think that people in this country believe that their right to stay here depends upon answering a form of the Department of Social Security. Secondly, I was disturbed at the threatening tone of the client information update letter which was recently sent to many pensioners. One sentence in particular stands out. It states: If you don't send it back, we might stop your Australian pension. To me that is totally wrong. That is totally unsatisfactory from any government department and especially one that prides itself on good client relations. I have written to Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) this matter. I trust he has taken steps to ensure that hi- department takes a ,more sensitive line when dealing with its clients the future. MiACTING SPEAKER-Order! It being 8.00 p.m.; the debate is· interrupted.

Mr Lee-The Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development has promade vided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) Yes, to prepare a report on the impediments to private enterprise investment in regional Australia; (a) the Terms of Reference as issued are as follows; Introduction Regional development will be an important factor in Australia's economic future. The Prime Minister has stated in a recent speech to the NSW Labor Party Conference that regional development is matter of high priority for the Government. cessful regional development would involve the stimulation of industry and employment in regional Australia, the maximum' use of our natural and moving from such areas. human resources, the opportunity to see regionallybased small and medium sized businesses proliferto ate, and the restructuring and revitalising of regionfirms al communities. The Government has now formed a Task Force on Regional Development to examine these' key policy issues. To assist in the formation of these Commonwealth policies, this consultancy seeks further information about the· reasons why Co. firms do and do not invest in regional Australia. Regional Development Task Force The Chair of. this Task Force is Mr Bill Kelty, of the ACTU. Its Members are:  on 1 Development Strategy Ms Margaret Bowman, former Hunter Region University Council member Mr Noim Cameron, Secretary, Regional Australia private enterprise Now Movement Mr Lindsay Fox AO, Chairman, Linfox Group Mr Steve Howard, Executive Director,CommiF (c) when .will the tee for Melbourne Ms Margaret Lehmann, Peter Lehmann Wines Mr Stuart Morgan. Chairman, Western Aerospace Mr Graham Ogilvie, Managing Director, Australbeen allocated' Ian Newsprint Mills Ltd  Government Association Mr Neville Stevens, Secretary, Department of perIndustry, Technology and Regional Development. The Task Force will (I) identify key economic and industry developof ment issues from a regional perspective; (2) examine factors affecting private sector investment in regional development; and, (3) examine whether any adjustments should be to Commonwealth policies and programs, or whether imy new programs are required, to enhance the adjustment process and regional development for Australia. The Task Force will be seeking a range of specific information about each region. Proposed Consultancy . The Commonwealth lacks current and detailed information at the tirm-Ievel about private sector investment in regional areas outside the major metropolitan centres. It wishes to provide additional input on this aspect to the Task Force, by obtaining comprehensive information from selected a companies in selected regions of Australia. This Sucinformation would be about the factors which determine private' sector investment in those regions, which could also include reasons for . Specifically, the objective of this consultancy is obtain qualitative and quantitative data from that are located in or have investments in selected economic regions, concerning the factors that inflllence or are likely to influence past, present and future investment patterns within regions. A significant further clement is a dissemination strategy covering the findings and conclusions of the project. Methodology Data would be obtained by survey, interview arid questionnaire from a statistically significant sample of businesses in a number of selected regional areas. These could include the Hunter region of NSW, the non-metropolitan areas in Northern Victoria, and the Gladstone/Rockhampton region in Queensland; these are indicative only and the successful consultant would not be limited to them. . The survey would be directed to businesses either located within the region or with investments there, including those newly established, and to businesses which have re-located or withdrawn investments from the region over the preceding five years. A substantial sample will be required to obtain useful . results across industries and across business sites; the Office of Regional Development does not have access to data that would assist in these selections. Representative firms should be selected from both the manufacturing and services sectors. Selected firms need not necessarily be current exporters, but consideration of their international competitiveness should be a factor in subsequent analysis of their operations. Usage and knowledge of relevant Government programs should be assessed. The survey shOuld be formulated to ensure that accurate data is obtained on business perspectives of key areas of competitive advantage or disadvan-· tage, including the natural, social and economic characteristics of the region itself. The survey results would be supplemented by analysis of relevant economic and social information. The consultant would be expected to liaise with two other current studies which are relevant to the development of the Government's policies. These are the Industry Commission's study on Impediments to Regional Industry Adjustment and the Prime Minister's Committee on Employment Opportunities. The successful consultant should develop recommendations aimed at: (a) identifying the characteristics of successful firms in these regions; (b) identifying factors affecting past, present and future private sector investment in regions; (c) providing policy options for consideration by the Regional Development Task Force; and, (d) widely disseminating findings and conclusions of the project. Timeframe and Reporting Requirements The study is expected to commence in early October 1993 and to be completed by the end of January 1994. Progress reports will be presented as follows: . (a) list of regions, questionnaire and target firms by 11 October; (b) lin interim report by 29 October; (c) draft report by 10 December; (d) final report by 28 January 1994; and, (e) information dissemination through the course of the project to February 1994. Budget The budget for this consultancy is up to $1.25 million, including the dissemination of information during and after completion of the project. Selection Criteria The successful consultant will be chosen by the following criteria: (1) previous experience with conducting a similar project; . (2) sufficient expertise and resources to conduct the project within the budget and timetable; (3) comments from nominated referees; (4) the extent to which the proposed methodology satisfies the Project objective; and, (5) capacity for extensive and high profile information dissemination.

Mr Tickner-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, with advice from the Department of Social Security and the Attorney-General's Department, has provided the following information in response to the honourable member's question: Under the Social Security Act, rights or interests in property held by indigenous people under native title or land rights legislation would not be regarded generally as an asset for the purpose of calculating pensions and other payments. Interests in property created by land rights legislation which are held in trust for the benefit of a particular group, do not confer ownership of property on any particular person. Accordingly, the interest would not be assessed as an asset in calculating payment to an individual member of such a group. Income derived from such land, however, be assessed as income where such income falls within the definition of income contained in the Social Security Act.

The substance of the Agreement and its associated legislation provides for the free movement of goods and the recognition of occupational registration between Australian States and Territories regardless of regulatory variations existing between jurisdictions. The MRA has significantly reduced barriers to trade within Australia and represents a major step forward in the development of a na.tional market. The MRA has also led to benefits to business, in terms of lower costs from not having to comply with the regulatory requirements of up to eight sep;lrate jurisdictions; to consumers, who now have access to a greater choice of goods; and to employees, by facilitating inter-jurisdictional workforce mobility.",149
