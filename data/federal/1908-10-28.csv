1,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"I wish to draw the attention of the Postmaster-General to the following paragraph, which recently appeared in the Transmitter, the official organ of the postal employees of Australia :Skilled telegraphists at 7s. per day in Western Australia ! Think of it ! And the Arbitration Court will not allow a man to swing a pick under Ss. per diem. The Department actually pays its casual labourers in Perth Ss. per diem, and instrument fitters temporarily employed ios. per diem. Who fixed the rate for telegraphists? Is advantage taken of the Government holding a monopoly of this class of employment? looks like it, and such action is usually called sweating ! Is the Minister aware that this state of affairs exists, and, if so, will he take steps to put an end to it?",11
2,Mr MAUGER,Unknown,"No doubt, the honourable member is cognisant of the fact that I have nothing to do with the fixing of rates of wages for telegraphists, that being done by the Public Service Commissioner. I have given instructions that for casual labour, such as instrument fitters, the rates ruling outside must be paid, and have made representations to the Public Service Commissioner in regard to the rates of pay of permanent hands; but he holds that there are circumstances which make service in the Department better, at the rates of pay which are given, than service outside. I should like it to be clearly understood that the fixing of rates of pay is not within my province; that I can merely make representations on the subject to the Public Service Commissioner. NA INSTRUMENTS"" .",11
3,Mr MCDOUGA LL,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"the master-General, upon notice I. Whether it is a fact that Bartram and Sons, importers, supply Ericsson telephone instruments to the Postal Department at a contract price of £3 is. 3d. each? 2. Is he aware that Bartram and Sons sold 'Ericsson telephone instruments to the Brimpain Telephone League at a cost of 5s. each? 3. Has he been informed of the fact that Bartram and Sons sold insulators to the Brimpain Telephone League, and that such insulators were condemned by an officer of the Department as useless. Also that the farmers who constitute the League named had to replace the condemned insulators at considerable cost? 4. Does he think Bartram and Sons ought to be given a free hand in the matter of overat 2.30 charging the farmers and in selling them obsolete or useless material? 5. Will he take steps to protect the Country Telephone Leagues from being unduly victimized by suppliers of materials used in connection with telephone lines?",11
4,Mr MAUGER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"I am not aware of the circumstances referred to, but am having inquiries made, and will give replies to the honourable member's questions as early as possible. DEFENCE. RECRUITS : ROYAL AUSTRALIAN ARTILLERY - SOUTH AUSTRALIAN MILITARY FORCES - MILITAR Y AND NAVAL DEFENCE It EXPENDITURE-COMPULSOR Y TRAINING : LIEUT - GENERAL HUTTON 'S APPROVAL. Mr.rK.ELLY - Amon g the regulations circulated this morning is one which provides that recruits joining the Royal Australian Artillery will be paid the full amount for which they undertake to serve only in the event of their service being considered satisfactory during a period of three months. If , before they have served for three months, the Department decides not to retain them, they are to be paid less than the full rate. Is it intended to apply this rule to the recruits who have enlisted within the last three months?",11
5,Mr EWING,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"The regulation will not be applied retrospectively, however worded. As in one State alone a loss of some hundreds of pounds bas been caused by men joining the Royal Australian Artil lery for very short periods, it was found necessary to deal with the matter; and, if the honourable member will put a series of questions on the notice-paper, I shall let him know exactly the state of affairs.",11
6,Mr TUDOR,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"for Mr ROBERTS) asked the Minister of Defence, upon noticePost- 1. What was the establishment and strength of each company of volunteers in South Australia on June 30th, of 1907, and 1908? 2. What numbeT of parades was held by each company during each of the two said years? 3. What was the number of volunteers of each company that attended each parade,- 'distinguishing between officers and men, during each of the two said years? 4. How many visits did the Instructional Officer for Infantry pay to each company during each of the two said years? 5. How many visits did the Adjutant of the regiment of volunteers pay to each company during each of the said two years? 6. For similar information in respect of the ' Militia Infantry Regiment and two Regiments of Australian Light Horse in South Australia.",11
7,Mr EWING,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"The information has to be obtained from South Australia, and may not be available for some little time. I shall lay it upon the table as soon as it is available.",12
8,Mr REID,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"the Minister of Defence, upon notice What was the amount of the actual expenditure (exclusive of "" special defence material"" and ""new special defence provision"") on account of the Military and Naval Defence of the Commonwealth for the year 1906-7 and for the year 1907-8. Also, his estimate for the first year's expenditure under the new system, including "" special defence material "" and "" new special defence provision."" In both cases excluding the payment under the Naval subsidy - payable to the Imperial Treasury ?",12
9,Mr EWING,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"The honourable member's question is answered by the information contained in the following table:Department of Defence. (rt) Military Forces and Central Administration 483,771 502,070 (b) Naval Forces (local) 50.201 54,071) (c) Oadets and Senior Cadets 23.0S1 43,402 (<0 Hirle Clubs and Associations 53,900 (e) Special Defence Material 150,083 CO New Special Defenoe Provision (17) New Naval Expenditure (It) 70 Woiks, w ' JBuildni^s, - Be pairs,ftunts,&c. 02,001 (i) Otlier Expenditure 2,007 * Includes special defence material. t Included in item (rt.). t Includes £250,000 for Naval Defence. This takes no account of the ,£200,000 paid under the Naval Agreement.",12
10,Sir JOHN FORREST,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"the Minister of Defence, upon notice Whether he will place on the Table of the House the full text of the letter from Lieut General Sir Edward Hutton, in which he approved of compulsory training, without pay, as set forth in the Defence Act now being considered, vide the Minister's statement to the House on 14th inst. (Hansard, page 1132)?",12
11,Mr EWING,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"The interjection in question was to the effect that Major-General Sir Edward Hutton approved of the intentions of the Government with regard to defence. This was made clear by interjection immediately following by the Prime Minister. The communication as a whole was not intended for publication, being, in fact, a private letter. Major-General Hutton's views have evidently undergone no change, since he presented a report to Parliament while commanding the Military Forces of the Commonwealth, in which he contended that the danger to Australia was not merely through a raid. He speaks of "" the invasion of Australia for purposes of territorial aggression as being under certain possible circumstances a military undertaking of no serious difficulty."" BUDGET. In Committee of Supply: Debate resumed from 27 th October (vide. P ge rSS3) on motion by Sir WILLIAM a LYNEThat the item, 1 The President, j£r,ioo,"" beagreed to. Mr TUDOR. (Yarra) [2.37] - I shall not detain the Committee long, but I have a Actual Expenditure. Estimated Expen- few remarks to make in reference to the diture in First Year new protection. Members of the Cornerof New party and of the direct Opposition have1000-7. 1007-8. Scheme. said that there is no need for new protection, because the Wages Boards in opera4 .fi * tion in some of the States, and the Arbitra734,000* tion Courts in others, cover most of the in00,524 70,000 dustries affected by the Tariff. But those who have taken an interest in factory legisSS.S95 70,000 73.SS9 - t lation know that in Victoria, at anv rate,, a Wages Board can be established only 320,OOU 108,000 ' 357,070 after a special resolution has been passed' 7S.742 55,000 by both Houses of the State Parliament. In3,270 --t many of the protected, industries no Wages Boards exist. I have not had time to compare the schedule of industries protected by Wages Boards with the Tariff Schedule, to see what industries are not protected, but I know several - trades which are without protection. Some industries have obtained Wages Boards since the passing of the last Tariff. For the first seven years of Federation, during six of which the old Tariff wasin operation, they were without that protection, and in some cases the Wages Boards .have not yet met. The leader of the Labour Party has placed on record the rates of pay for agricultural implement workers fixed by Air. Justice Higgins. His decision could not be enforced because of the judgment of the High Court; but I have prepared atable which shows in parallel columns theWages Board rates and those fixed by him. It is as follows:Labourers, unskilled Labourers, skilled Iron workers (journeymen), strikers and drillers ... Ironbenders, malleable iron annealers, and belt cutters Iron machinists, other than fitters and turners, and including grinders Fitters, turners, blacksmiths Woodworkers and painters (journeymen), machinists (excepting those working shaping-machines, Boult's carver, boring or mortising machines, or crosscut saw Men working shaping-machine or Boult's carver Men working boring or mortising machine or crosscut saw Carpenters (including timbermarkers) ancl wheelwrights . Pattern-makers Painters, writers, ancl liners Painters, brush hands Sundry (journeymen) - Timber yardsmen Drivers of first-class engines Drivers of second-class engines ... Engine-drivers with other work ...",12
12,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"That , able member says, is his charter.",13
13,Mr TUDOR,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"I say that since the schedule prepared by Mr Justice Higgins was the result of careful consideration of evidence given before him respecting all matters relating to the industry it should be at least the standard minimum rate, and that the Wages Board should not have fixed a lower scale.",13
14,Mr WILKS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,There is an average difference of about 6s. per week between the two scales.,13
15,Mr TUDOR,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"Not so. much as that; let us say that there is an average difference of about 5s. per week. know who is the chairman of the Agricultural Implement Makers Wages Board, but I do know that very often the determination of what should be the scale of wages fixed by a Wages Board rests with the chairman. Many representatives of the workers on such Boards have to meet their employers round the table. I am glad that the honourable member for Fawkner is present since, believing him to be a fair. minded man, I wish to point out to him as the President of the Employers Federation, the weakness of the Wages Board system. When an employee, as the representative of his fellow-workers on a. WagesBoard, has to meet his employer a,t thes. d. s. d. Part I . table, he cannot fight against him as he6 6 7 0 might be expected to do if his bread and 7 0 7 6 butter were not at stake. During the conPart II . sideration of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill , 1 pointed out that in some in7 0 7 6 stances representatives of employees on 7 6 8 0 Wages Boards had been dismissed from their service. I fail to see why a man, because he is chosen by his fellow-workers 8 0 9 0 9 0 1 0 0 to represent them on such a body, should Part III . be dismissed by his employer; but in one case-that of the Wages Board relating to the butchering trade-fou r out of fiverepresentatives of the employees lost their S 6 9 6 employment. The fifth representative was the secretary of the union, and the employ ers9 8 10 8 therefore had no power over him. For7 0 8 0 tunately, those men were able to obtain other positions. 9 0 10 0 10 0 11 0 Mr Wilks - They were butchered. 9 0 IO 0 8 6 9 0 Mr TUDOR - The honourable member Part IV . may say that they were slaughtered or butchered as he pleases, but it is hard 7 6 8 0 that men should be dismissed from their 8 2 9 2 employment merely because of their efforts7 6 8 0 9 0 10 0 to stand up for their fellow workers. the honor- Mr FAIRBAIRN - I am sorry to hear of such cases.",13
16,Mr TUDOR,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"- I am glad to say that there has been some improvement io this respect, and that employers are showing, more and more a readiness to give the Wages Board system a fair trial. Perhaps, like the honourable member for Fawkner, they think that if they do not they may have something worse. The honourable member is now prepared to support the. Wages Board system, although a few years ago the Employers' Federation, of which he is president, was bitterly opposed to it, and is today hostile! to conciliation I do not and arbitration legislation. 1 believe that in nearly every industry today the manufacturers are prepared to give their men a fair show, and that the positions of men representing their fellow employees on Wages Boards are not jeopardized as they were a few years ago. Still, there are some who find that they cannot obtain work whilst they are members of Wages Boards. After their Boards have made their awards, ancl have ceased to exist, they have experienced less difficulty in obtaining employment. Some honourable members have declared that there is no necessity for an amendment of the Constitution to provide for the new protection, because the Wages Board system is already in operation in most of the States. I have here a report of the evidence given before A Royal Commission in Tasmania, which throws an interesting light on this subject, and I regret that no representative of Tasmania on the Opposition side of the House is present, since I should like to show the opponents of industrial legislation from that State what were the conditions of labour there less than two years ago.",13
17,Mr KELLY,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,Does the honourable member know of any honourable member of the Opposition who is opposed to industrial legislation ?,14
18,Mr TUDOR,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"Yes , the honourable member himself is one.",14
19,Mr KELLY,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,That is incorrect.,14
20,Mr TUDOR,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"When the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill and the Workers Trade Mark legislation were under consideration, the honourable member was prepared to back up the bogus union of - shearers. The figures that he quoted went to show that the membership of the - bogus union-the Machine Shearers Union was increasing, while that of the Australian Workers Union was decreasing. The honourable member then prophesied that the Australian Workers Union would soon cease to exist.",14
21,Mr KELLY,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"When an honourable member tries, to point out the way in which labour secretaries are exploiting a number of labour unions, he is described as an opponent of industrial legislation.",14
22,Mr TUDOR,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,The honourable member is evading the question.,14
23,Mr KELLY,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,I am not.,14
24,Mr TUDOR,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"Th a honourable member on the occasion to which I refer backed up the bogus union of the shearers, and said that the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill would be beneficial to it. I admit that some honourable members of the Opposition are not opposed to industrial legislation. Among them are the honor..able member for Dalley, who favours the new protection, and the leader of the Opposition. When interrupted, I was about to point out the necessitv for a Wages Board system in Tasmania, and was regretting the absence from the House of - some of the representatives of that State, - whose political creed, I believe, is the same as that of the present Tasmanian Ministry, which has made no effort to introduce industrial legislation for the protection of the workers. The conditions prevailing in Tasmania at the time the Royal Commission took evidence were so bad that the Commissioners considered it advisable to withhold the names of those who gave evidence. Thus, instead of the statement that "" John Brown, John Jones, or John Robinson,"" gave evidence, we find a blank, and then the statement "" was sworn and examined."" I have not had time to go carefully through the evidence, but some of the examples are very striking. I have compared some of the rates paid there with those paid in Victoria under Wages Boards. Low as the rates fixed by the Wages Boards are in many cases, and handicapped as the system is by the fact that the employee has to meet his employer at the same table, and is afraid in many cases to bring forward all the facts that are within his knowledge regarding the place where he works, because his employer would ask: "" What right have you to say that regarding my factory when you know that my opponent, whom I am selling against, is sitting alongside me?""notwithstanding that weakness of the Wages Board system - the wage earners under Wages Boards in Victoria are in many cases receiving from 33 per cent, up to 50 per cent, more than is paid in Tasmania in similar industries. On page 16 of the report appears the following: The Commission met at Timber M ill . called, sworn, and examined. Those blanks were evidently left to save the faces of persons engaged in business in Tasmania who were afraid of having it known what ridiculous sweating rates they were paying. I do not know whether the Postmaster-General happens to have a copy of the evidence. »",14
25,Mr MAUGER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,I have already acted on it in regard to clothing. I have insisted on the Victorian Wages Board rates being paid for all work done for the Government.,14
26,Mr TUDOR,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"The Victorian Wages Board rates are quite low enough. If the New South Wales rates happened to be higher I should rejoice to find that the Minister had taken them as a basis. I always believe in giving the highest rates in the Commonwealth where Government work is concerned. I suppose some rates would be higher in Victoria than in New South Wales, and vice versd, seeing that the log often includes thousands of articles.",14
27,Mr MAUGER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,They average about the same.,15
28,Mr TUDOR,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"I suppose that is so. The report of the Commission continuesBy the President - You r name?T he name is left out. Are you one of the proprietors of this establishment?-Yes ; my partner is Do you produce the pay-sheet of the establishment giving the names of the several employees and the rates of wages they receive?Yes, the pay sheet is as follows :£1 13s.; £ 1 ios.; Those are millmen in the Tasmanian timber industry. To show the wages in the same industry in Victoria under a Wages Board, I have here a copy of the report of the Chief Inspector of Factories. I admit that the name "" millman"" is not included, but I will assume that those men are sawyers or machine workers. It does not mattewhat particular line you take, the lowest rate fixed in Victoria is 45s. per week, as against j£x 5s. which that employer swore he was paying in Tasmania. One of the men employed at that establishment gave evidence as to the wages he received, as followsYour name?Your occupation?- I am a sawmiller. In the employment of Are you a benchman, or what?- I am at the saw-frame. How much ?-£ 1 13s. per week. For the work that that man is paid j £ i 13s. to perform in Tasmania, a man here would receive from 48s. to 64s. a week. That,, at any rate, is what the Wages Board system, even with its drawbacks, has been able to do in the way of increasing the rates of wages in Victoria. There follows the evidence of another man who was evidentlv in the same mill, and who was getting £ 1 7s. per week. I have not had time to compare the rates in other industries, which, under our Tariff, receive the same protection in Tasmania as in every other State. I have heard honourable members on the other side say that they intend to oppose any alteration of the Constitution in the direction of the new protection. If so, they must admit that they are prepared to see men engaged in industries in Tasmania paid £ 1 5s. or j f . i ios. a week for work for which from £ 2 5s. to £ 3 per week is paid in Victoria.",15
29,Mr FAIRBAIRN,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"They ought Wages Board there, certainly.",15
30,Mr TUDOR,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"They ought to ; but does, the honourable member think that there is any hope of getting a Factories Bill or Wages Boards resolutions through the Legislative Council of Tasmania, an institution which the honourable member for Darwin humorously calls "" the dead house""?",15
31,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,The r e are auite as good men in that Council as there are here.,15
32,Mr TUDOR,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"Quite as advanced in their political views as is the honourable member, perhaps. I am glad the honourable member has come in. I have just been reading extracts from the evidence taken by £ 1 5s. a Commission in Tasmania, where the employers were too ashamed to have their names attached to their statements as to the wages they were paying. I hope to be able to get a list of the names of the persons who gave that evidence. As there does not happen to be an official Hansard in Tasmania, it would be interestine to place it on record in our Hansard. When; the new protection proposal is before us in the shape of a Bill for the amendment of"" the Constitution, I hope I shall be able toextract more information from this volumeas to the wages that are being paid in Tasmania, and to prove the necessity for the proposed amendment. What manufacturer in Victoria will pay £ 2 5s. to £ 2 ios. per week when he could go toTasmania and escape Wages Boards? I ?-Yes . know, and so does the Postmaster-General, that when the brush-making industry wasplaced under a Wages Board in Victoria, one manufacturer, I think he was Mr Mitchell, moved his factory to Tasmania.. The honourable member for Fawkner last night, referring to land settlement, said they were doing very well in Victoria. There is a greater need for a land tax in Victoria than in any other State.",15
33,Mr FAIRBAIRN,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"I admit that it is more urgent here, because there is more agricultural land.",15
34,Mr TUDOR,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"It has been my privilege to go over part of the electorate of the honourable member for Grampians. One can travel for about ten miles over some of theestates in the neighbourhood of Skipton. One may go for miles through land therewhich has been cut up by Mr Gardiner, and has proved very good for purposes of closer settlement. Something should be done in order to compel land-owners to pay a fair tax municipally; because, as every honourable member in tlte Opposition to get a corner knows, fair taxation is not paid £t the present time.",15
35,Mr HANS IRVINE,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"The honourable member knows that in the same division there have been from 110,000 to 120,000 acres thrown open to farmers in the last four or five years, and that that land is now under cultivation.",16
36,Mr TUDOR,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"It is necessary that a great deal more land should be thrown Open. On many of the estates, not only at Skipton, but in the railway area between Ballarat and Ararat, down to Hamilton and Warrnambool, and thence back to Geelong, there is some of the finest land in Victoria; and yet we are told that there is less population there now than there was thirty years ago. If we eliminate Colac and Camperdown, and the mining population at Beringa and Pitfield, there is, as has been shown by Mr Anstey from the figures of the Government Statist, less population now than there was formerly. Down at Werribee, only some twenty or twenty-two miles from Melbourne, there is ",16
37,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,Why not reform Victoria ?,16
38,Mr TUDOR,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"I am doing my best. The Labour Party returned one man of our ranks for Richmond into the State Parliament the other day, and assisted to get another in for Carlton, so I do not think we are doing badly. Further, I think that we shall do very well in Tasmania at the next elections, and be not very far from' having a majority in the Legislative Assembly of that State.",16
39,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,And what then?,16
40,Mr TUDOR,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"Then I hope we shall soon have a majority in this House, and be able to find out exactly how honourable members, who profess to be radical, will vote.",16
41,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"And wben you do get the majority, what then? What was tried before?",16
42,Mr TUDOR,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"If I may speak without - having to answer so many questions, I shall say that we hope to govern Australia much better than ever Australia has been governed before. If I thought otherwise of my party, I should not remain in it. In the case of the land to wh ch I was referring at Werribee, it was valued, for land tax purposes, at £ 1 per acre; but for the purpose of purchase by the Melbourne Metropolitan Board of Works, the value „ was £ 1 7 ios. per acre.",16
43,Mr FAIRBAIRN,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,The honourable member knows quite well that that valuation of jQi per acre was placed on the land's carrying capacity.,16
44,Mr TUDOR,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"That I admit. My desire is to prove that the land tax and the municipal rating are both absurd; and in this connection I should like to read the following relating to the land valuation foi tax purposes, as compared with valuations by the Water Commission, in the shire of Echuca.

45,Mr HANS IRVINE,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"What about the drought period, when the land was not worth £ 1 per acre?",16
46,Mr TUDOR,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"The honourable member is rather slow; I have now moved from Werribee to Echuca, whither I invite him to follow me. Some of these areas, I believe, have been taken up by settlers under the Closer Settlement Act. No one will say that the Water Supply Commission has valued the land too highly. So. far as I know, there has not been a single charge brought against the Commission in that regard.",16
47,Mr KELLY,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,Does the lionorable member suggest that this Parliament can deal with the matter?,16
48,Mr TUDOR,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"I suggest that if we, in this Parliament, imposed a land tax we would have the land properly valued, ; which, of course, would be necessary before a tax could be charged.",16
49,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,Who makes the shire valuations?,16
50,Mr TUDOR,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"I presume the valuations are made by the men employed by the shires; and as most of the large land-holders have control of the shire councils, they select officials who must keep down the valuations or go. If a shire valuer were to value the land honestly, he would know that his position was not worth very much ; I doubt whether such an official would find his position worth more than that of employees who have to meet employers on Wages Boards.",16
51,Mr HANS IRVINE,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,Is the honourable member not giving valuations as applied unfairly to drought areas and' irrigable areas ?,17
52,Mr TUDOR,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,I am contrasting the valthe uations for the same pieces of land.,17
53,Mr HANS IRVINE,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,On e portion is irrigable and the other is not; and yet the honourable member applies the same rate to the whole.,17
54,Mr TUDOR,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"I am dealing with cisely the same blocks. I admit that a piece of land in Collins-street and a piece of land in Little ILonsdale-street' would have different valuations, but I am nowonly speaking of precisely the same valued by the shire official and the Water Commission. The latter body is indepenstraight dent and not under the control of farmers and graziers, who are members of the shire council; and I have no doubt that the not. Commission's valuations are the more accurate. Honourable members know that the Victorian Taxation Commissioner recently raised the value of many Victorian estates, having proved that they were worth more, from a taxable point of view, than they were twelve or eighteen months ago.",17
55,Mr HANS IRVINE,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"Because the seasons have changed. In the same area to which the honourable member is referring, land could have been bought for 10s. or 15s. acre.",17
56,Mr TUDOR,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,I am talking of valuaof the kind; I said the very opposite. tions made at the same time of the same blocks of land. Does the honourable memcorded in Hansard. ber think the shire valuation in his case the correct one?,17
57,Mr HANS IRVINE,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,No . The valuation true. should be a fair one.,17
58,Mr TUDOR,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"If the honourable member were selling the land, he would not insist that the water supply valuation"" is too low. But if he were buying, he would emphasize the other valuation.",17
59,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,Would not the orable member for Yarra do the same?,17
60,Mr TUDOR,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"All the land I have, am likely to have, is an allotment 8 by 4 feet in the cemetery. Those who own land sit in the Opposition corner, not on the Labour benches.",17
61,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,It is on the Labour benches that the Tories and the possessors of property sit.,17
62,Mr TUDOR,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"I do not wish to deal at length with the land question; but as the. honourable member for Fawkner referred to it last night, I thought it just to show that the Victorian land laws have not conduced to settlement.

64,Mr TUDOR,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"That statement is as inaccurate as others made by the honourable premember in regard to the Labour Party.

68,Mr TUDOR,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"Questio n time has passed, but I do not mind replying that the State Labour Party had not an opportunity to vote on the Bill , as the other parties prevented it from going to a division.

The Presifeet dent of the League replied: "" We know that that is so, but the statement makes so good a cry that we must use it for all that it is worth. "" That was published in the Age or Argus, and I placed the circumstances on record in Hansard when speaking on the Address-in-'Reply on the first opportunity which followed. On the othei hand, a paid agitator controlled by the Victorian Employers' Association, of which the honourable member for Fawkner is President, goes about the country preaching that marriage is a luxury for the workers. Mr. Walpole made that statement at Lilydale.",17
72,Mr FAIRBAIRN,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,That has been denied.,18
73,Mr TUDOR,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"Mr Walpole has not denied it . I have placed on record in Hansard a letter from the man who reported his speech- Mr Oliver, of Lilydale-and others from the chairman of the meeting, and a reverend gentleman who was present.",18

75,Mr FAIRBAIRN,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,The honourable member must be hard up for an argument when he harks back to a statement which was denied ten vears ago.,18
76,Mr TODOR,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,Then the honourable member admits that it was made?,18

78,Mr TUDOR,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"T he statement was made about 1903-fiv e years ago; the honourable member's arithmetic is as faulty as Mr. Walpole's denial. I have a letter written to the newspapers by the latter, in which he - said that the statement was made as a joke. A Methodist newspaper published in this city denounced him at the time for making the statement even as a joke. When others make jokes, they have to abide by the consequences. But although Mr Walpole deliberately said that marriage was a luxury for the workers, he is still acting for the Employers' Federation, and, as far as I know, has never been reprimanded.",18

86,Mr TUDOR,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"There are exceptions. Some honourable members spasmodically vote rightly, and, I suppose, are occasionally virtuous. I had not intended to deal with this matter; but as the Women's National Leagues of Australia are continually repeating the lie, it must be referred to. It was not a representative of the labouring classes who put forward the doctrine.",18

90,Mr TUDOR,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"The statement is continually being made to injure the Labour Party by those who supported the honourable member. The Treasurer, in his Budget, dealt with the coinage of silver. I thought that he was in favour of encouraging Australian industry, and would give opportunity for the minting of silver in Australia. If no settlement has yet been arrived at, I hope that another attempt will be made to come to a definite conclusion. The Postmaster-General, when I spoke of the Government having decided' to get the work done abroad, said that that had not been decided. That being I hope that the decision will be come to that silver shall be coined here. We should know how long the present arrangement is to last.",18

Gold is minted in Western Australia, and the coining of silver will be done here. Gold is minted in Western Australia, Victoria, and New South Wales. Later on, the honourable gentleman said I believe that it will be done here. Then the Prime Minister said I do not think that the coinage of silver will take place here. I wish to know what is the position in regard to this matter.",19
99,Mr HANS IRVINE,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,Silve r is produced here.,19
100,Mr TUDOR,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"We are producing far more silver than we require for currency purposes, and we ought to mint our own silver coinage. I desire now to refer to the Estimates of Expenditure. Yesterday I asked the Minister representing the Minister of Home Affairs whether the Public Service Commissioner had brought in an amended classification under which increased salaries were provided for all heads of Departments. I was informed in reply that it was not proposed to grant an increased salary to the heads of "" all "" Departments- I believe that as a matter of that a defact about one out of nine heads of Demade, ancl partments is not to receive an increasegentleman and that as they were administrative heads to be done it was not necessary to refer to the Public Service Commissioner's proposals to increase their salaries. I think, 'however, that we should learn exactlv how we stand with regard to such increments. When the classification scheme was before us we found that it fixed the salaries of all headsof Departments, and it seems to me that the fixing of the salaries of such officersshould rest entirelv with the Public ServiceCommissioner. When the Public Service Bill was before this House, we decided toexempt from the Act the officers of Parliament, and in that respect I think that we made a big mistake. The officers of Parliament have as much right to be graded by the Public Service Commissioner as have any other members of the Commonwealth Service. Appropriations have to be made in reGovernment, spect of these increases, and we have a right to ask how far it is proposed to go. Members of the Public Service lower down the ladder have not received an increment for years, although they are serving the Commonwealth to the best of their ability. They are as much entitled to consideration as arethose who happen to be in close touch with Ministers. As I pointed out on a former occasion, members of the Public Service Commissioner's staff receive special treatment, simply because their duties bring them under the immediate observation of the Commissioner. They are singled out for special treatment, just as honourable members might be disposed to give special' consideration to officers or to the messengers in Parliament House, because they happento be brought into close touch with them. The principle, however, is a wrong one. The recommending of increases to heads of Departments should rest entirely with the Public Service Commissioner, and I intend to vote against all such increases, unless good reason is shown for granting them. We find, in the first place, that provision ismade for increasing the salary of the Secretary of the Department of External Affairs from £ 8 0 0 to £ 9 0 0 , and for asimilar increase in the case of the Secretary to the Department of the Attorney-General.. I believe that when the lasf-named gentleman entered the service of the Commonwealth, he received a salary of £ 7 5 0 per annum. Since then his remuneration has been increased to £ 8 0 0 per annum, and it is now proposed to grant him a further increase of £ 1 0 0 per annum. Where are these increases to stop? We have a Tight to hear from the Treasurer a statement on the point, so that we may intimate to the - Government, if we think f it, that, in the event of these increases being granted, corresponding increments should be allowed Throughout the service.",19
101,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,-The service gets a fine increase as it is.,20
102,Mr TUDOR,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"I know of officers discharging important duties, who are receiving_wh.it I consider a sweating wage.",20
103,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"The Commonwealth Service is the best paid public service in Australia, or almost anywhere else.",20
104,Mr TUDOR,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"J believe that. If that is the Treasurer's opinion, is he in favour of these increases?",20
105,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,The ceived by men in the higher divisions of the Commonwealth Service are by no means - equal to the salaries paid to States offictrs filling corresponding offices.,20
106,Mr TUDOR,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,Does the honourable member believe in these increases ?,20
107,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"Yes, when the work is done, and good men have to be obtained to do it .",20
108,Mr TUDOR,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"The work is being done, .so that we may take it that the Treasurer favours the proposed increases. it that the special work performed by these officers has not been recognised before?",20
109,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,I have always said that they have not been well enough paid.,20
110,Mr FRAZER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,I have not heard of any of them leaving the Public Service for a better job outside.,20
111,Mr TUDOR,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"The honourable member is quite right. We never hear of these men, with all their ability, fumbling over each other to leave the service.",20

113,Mr TUDOR,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,Quite so. help recalling the struggle we had to secure the passing of the minimum wage provisions of the Public Service Act. Even the Treasurer at that time opposed those provisions.,20
114,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,And them on the statute-book?,20
115,Mr TUDOR,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,I consider that I had more to do with their passing than had any other honourable member.,20
116,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,And I consider that I did the work.,20
117,Mr TUDOR,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"I well remember what the honourable member said - at the time. The minimum wage provisions of the Public Service Act were carried largely as the resuft of a return, which I had secured and put before the House, showing the low wages paid in some branches of the service. The minimum wage is only £ n o per annum, or 7s. per day. Those who receive that wage, so far as I am aware, are not to have an increase, but the men on top of the ladder are to have a big advance on their former salaries. I trust that the Treasurer will be able to give the Committee information regarding the work done by these officers, so that we shall not have to vote in the dark. I hope also that he will supply some information with regard to the coinage of silver in Australia. If an agreement has been entered into with salaries rethe British Government, we ought to be made familiar with its terms, so that we may be able, if necessary, to take steps to have the minting of silver carried out in Australia.",20

As Mr Walpole is not a member of this House he cannot defend himself here, and, believing that the honourable member for Yarra is a fair-minded man, I wish How is to say that when Mr Walpole was first accused of making certain remarks about the Labour Party, and the marriage tie, he vigorously denied the statement attributed to him. The evidence, including that of the Methodist clergyman referred to, so far as I have been able to gather, is entirely in favour of Mr Walpole's assertion that he made no such statement.

Simply that there is not enough food on the globe for the population that might be born. Every one knows at this time of day that such a doctrine is obsolescent. And by-the-bye, Malthus was not author of it ; he merely crystallized the teaching of men born thousands of years to before him. Plato taught it, and all down the ages there have been exponents of what the I do not hesitate to describe as the same devilish doctrine.

147,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"This man says so. He says that by improving the surroundings you necessarilv improve the - quality of the ego-the individual himself. That brings me to another statement to which I take strong exception. After stating in his own way the doctrine of Darwinism, on which he proposes to base his whole scheme- I have no fault to find with 'his definition of Darwinism, except that he leaves out some material points, although, so far as he states it, it is correct-h e deduces from that law the following: We sec, then, how the law of natural selection applies as absolutely to the mental qualities - of man as to his bodily development. We see - that man's moral character is inspired by natural - demand and necessity. For this reason it is - clear that there can be no absolute morality. I take strong exception to that doctrine. It is not in accordance with the ethical teachings of our time, or with the views of some of the best Socialists of today. It is a travesty upon the ethical side of a doctrine which is held, however mistakenly, yet sincerely, by many earnest and good-minded men. He says furtherThe European believes in monogamy and chastity in women, because it is by the aid of these propensities that our race has been enabled to multiply and conquer the earth; the sexes are so evenlv divided that the nation which abandons these practices would retard its own growth. Here is a bit of Malthus, if you likeThe Japanese have multiplied to such an extent that the population has virtually outgrown the means of support, hence tliere is a national I demand or necessity for some check to the growth of population. I forbear to quote the language further to a mixed audience, but there is a statement from my honourable friend's own champion's essav, that the law of Malthus obtains today "" in Japan.

We on this side of the House have been saddled with this kind-of belief, and I am merely pointing out that if that doctrine is supported anywhere in this House, the Labour corner is the home in which it might most probably be found, according to the statement of their own essayist.",24
157,Dr MALONEY,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"Who is he, and what is lie?",24
158,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"I am quoting from the first of a series of articles under the heading of "" The Rising T i d Exposition of Australian Socialism."" The articles, of course, refer to the rising of Socialism; and the writer purports speak on behalf of the Labour Socialists of quotationAustralia-of the Labour Party especially.",24
159,Dr MALONEY,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"Who is he? Mr JOSE PH COOK - His name is Ingemann, and his exposition is not of Continental Socialism, but of Australian Socialism. If the honourable member does not know anything about the gentleman I have no doubt that, on application in the proper quarter, he will get all information. The writer makes a number of other statements to which I cannot subscribe, because I do not believe that they are correct. Of course, he lays every evil under the sun almost at the door of our present industrial system; showing how that system is ramifying through the personnel of the communitv, nnd undermining character and moral qualities of every kind.",24
160,Mr ROBERTS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,Does the honourable member deduce from the article that the writer advocates the adoption of Malthusianism ?,24
161,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,I deduce from the article that the writer accepts the premises of Malthusianism as a natural fact existing today in Japan.,24
162,Mr ROBERTS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"That mav be, but, in addition, the honourable member is seeking to charge the Labour Party with taking up a similar position.",24
163,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,Not at all : I have already said I desire to make no such allegation. I simply say that if this charge of belief in a doctrine of this kind- a doctrine that is repulsive to every intelligent man with a progressive mind-lie s anywhere it would appear to more properly lie in the Government corner than in the Opposition.,24
164,Mr ROBERTS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"The writer shows that he himself does not believe in the doctrine, because, in words which the Honourable memobber has not quoted, he refers to it as "" immoral.""",24
165,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"I do not think that the writer does so refer to the doctrine in the sense implied by the honourable member. The whole point of the writer's statements is that morals are changing and changeable, determined by environment, and by the struggle for existence. In other words, the writer fixes the morals of the community on a rationalistic basis.",24
166,Mr ROBERTS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"We are not debating that point at the present time, and the fact remains that the writer, in words the honourable member has not quoted, refers to Male ; an thusianism as an immoral doctrine.",24
167,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"No . The writer tide says that what is immoral in some counto tries is not in others. Here is a further * Uncler the present system, the most cowardly, the most bigoted, the most selfish are given a better chance of success than the noble-minded and generous. Is that why, I wonder, so many of my honourable friends opposite are doing fairly well? I regard such expressions of opinion as a travesty on the present state of affairs; and I cannot subscribe to such a monstrous doctrine.",24
168,Mr HUTCHISON,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"It is true, all the same! Mr JOSE PH COOK - True , is it ? Whenever it is desired to bring some particularly striking pictures before the wandering attention of an audience, the plan is to darken the room in order by contrast to heighten the effect.",24
169,Dr MOLONEY,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,Is that what the honourable member has been doing today in regard to the Labour Party?,24
170,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"No , but it is what this writer does. He paints the nresent position unduly black. It is badenough,' but we need not make it worse than it is. I do not believe that in order to "" get o n "" today a man must be a coward, a bigot, and everything else which the writer has called him. L if e to me would not be worth living if I entertained such thoughts of my fellow man.",24
171,Mr ROBERTS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,Apparentl y the qualification for success in some directions is to make unfair charges against the Labour Partv.,24
172,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"I never try to make charges for which I have no authority. I am making no charges now, but simply quoting and repudiating the expressions of one of the champions of the Labour Party. The writer goes onThere is no doubt that enterprise, an admirable quality, and a quality which aids man in his evolution, has become exaggerated into a habit of greed without regard for the interests of others, and in its present form is detrimental to the advancement of the race. It has grown to disregard honesty, merit, and sympathy, and many other moral qualities conducive to the evolution of the race. Again, I repudiate that as a travesty of our present conditions. I believe there never was so much honesty, sympathy, kindness, and genuine humanity in the world as there is today.",24
173,Dr MALONEY,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,When millionaires feed pigs while people are starving !,25
174,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,I have as much sympathy with such millionaires as has my honourable friend.,25
175,Dr MALONEY,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,Quite so; but the honourable member does not show his sympathy so well since he left the Labour Party. He is not so good a man as he was.,25
176,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"There are other statements made by the writer of a verystriking character, but I do not desire to weary honourable members by quoting them. I can only say that, to my mind, the writer goes right in the teeth of the fundamental tenets of latter-day progress.",25
177,Dr MALONEY,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,What has this to do with the question of finance ?,25
178,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"That is what I truth. was wondering on Thursday and Fridaylast. If it had not been sought to introduce these matters into the political arena and to fasten charges on honourable memhave bers on this side, there would have been heard no word from me in reply. But these statements trip off the tongue almost daily, and they will be believed unless there an answer to the contrary-. I desire to say, Australia. once and for all, that, so far as I know, honourable members on this side of the House would repudiate any such ghoulish doctrines, so contrary to fact.",25
179,Dr MALONEY,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,The honourable member corner. is trying to show that the Labour Party has adopted the views he condemns !,25
180,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"May I say, for about the twelfth time, that I make no charge.",25
181,Mr HUTCHISON,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,Then it is not worth bothering about - battenin g and luxurious as they may be,25
182,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,The honourable member and his friends do not seem to pudiate this kind of thing. [61],25

185,Mr BAMFORD,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,Why does the honourable member read it?,25
186,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,Because I think it ought to be read and repudiated. We ought to discuss our differences on fair and common ground.,25
187,Mr MCDOUGALL,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,The honourable member is giving the writer a good advertisement.,25
188,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"I may be, and I do not mind doing so. When statements of this kind are put forward by the most influential labour organ in Australia as authentic-as showing the trend of thought in the Australian labour movement-the y are worth taking notice of.",25
189,Mr ROBERTS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,There is nothing in the article to justify the statement that it is put forward as an authentic utterance on behalf of labour.,25
190,Mr HUTCHISON,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,We disclaim any responsibility for signed articles.,25
191,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,Honourable members had better read the announcement a week or two ago of the series of articles to be published.,25
192,Mr MCDOUGALL,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"I agree with the greater part of the writer's statements; and if the honourable member were to go on the road with his swag, he would realise their",25
193,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"The honourable member need not talk like that, because I had-as hard a time, and possibly a great deal harder time, than he has had. I should be very sorry if I thought I was placing anything in the way of the legitiis mate aspirations of the working men of But I do not say that to believe in the uplifting of those at the bottom in the industrial scale, it is necessary to indulge in painting our civilization in the blackest of all paints, in the way so characteristic of my friends in the Labour We are all going in the same direction-w e all desire to help those at the bottom, but in these later days, the Labour Party are developing the idea that the only such way to help the man at the bottom is to pull down the man at the top. After all, we must remember that the few at the top - eve n if they are aJl that Upton Sinclair re has said of them-d o not prove that the way I have just indicated is the best to assist the man at the bottom. In regard to the criticism offered on honourable bers on this side, and referred to again innuendo today by the Secretary of the Labour Party, I should like to say that whatever statements have been made those who support us such statements be matched and over-matched by stateblossoms ments from men who vote for the Labour Party. These absurd, totally unnecessary, propagated. and unjust statements regarding designs the home, are being made as freely as ever they were, not by theoretical Socialists like Karl Marx, but by men advocate the political Socialism of today. Such statements are still being made ness and luxury. throughout the Continent of Europe, as is shown by the magazines which lie about the tables in the Library of this House. Honourable members who desire to know the facts, have only to refer to such periodicals in order to ascertain that the Socialists the Continent advocate these theories every day of their lives. For myself, I dismiss that kind of argumentation j it is not while, and I should not have troubled self if suggestions had not been made as the attitude and sympathies of men with whom I am associated. If honourable memlaw bers opposite desire to repudiate that kind mond, of sentiment, they need not bother honorno able members who sit with me, but should turn their attention to the utterances of those who are supposed to have the same international aims as have many of the men who support the Labour' movement in Australia. I have already referred to Malthusianism, which was quoted, ancl forced, by the honourable member for Kalthe goorlie on Friday. I am aware that, the newer school of economists, there has been evolved a theory, namely, that the struggle for existence is no longer an vidual struggle, but has become a corporate struggle, and that, therefore, to Socialthe ism, as an expression of the corporate sense, we may subscribe as an engine of progress. That doctrine has been stated clearly such writers as Benjamin Kidd, and, I think, most beautifully of all, by Proone's fessor Henry Drummond, in his Ascent Man. I regard that book, from its literary side alone, as worth reading by any man, and I am bound to say that I subscribe some of the tenets to which he gives such unique and admirable expression. There is one factor which my honourable friends, in quoting these economists, nearly always leave out of sight. No writer embination. Mr Joseph Cook. phasizes it so clearly and decisively as memdoes Henry Drummond. It is that, lying by at the root of the corporate struggle for existence, is the principle of sacrifice, of self-suppression, of self-abnegation. by Drummond illustrates this very beautican fully by pointing out that the lovely of the fruit tree die in order that fruit may be produced, and the species It is the law of the tree, on and the law of life, that there can be no today progress without sacrifice.",25
194,Mr MCDOUGALL,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"At present, the who workers have to make sacrifices, so that those of a certain class may live in idle",26
195,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"I believe that the workers in some cases make an undue sacrifice, one which should not be expected of them, but which will lessen as the world of becomes more enlightened. I have no word to say against those referred to by the honourable member. We must try to lift them up worth from the bottom. But there is a radical mydifference between the ways in which it is to proposed that this should be done. Stripped of the ghoulish doctrine of Malthus, the of struggle, as stated by Henry DrumBenjamin Kidd, and other writers, is constructive in its nature. Competition is longer regarded as inherently hellish and tigerish, a thing of tooth and claw; it has its constructive side, and is needed to lift up the race to higher ideals, and to push it forward to greater prosperity, peace, and permanence. It is the constructive side of the competitive struggle that we feel it our enduty to emphasize, since the members of Labour Party nearly always leave it out in of account. We must, from time to time, in debating the questions which come before us, go down to the fundamental principles indiof progress. The conditions of employment must be discussed with reference to principles of personal freedom; not necessarily freedom to amass millions of money, and to oppress one's fellows, but by freedom fo use one's powers of initiative, ancl one's God-given intelligence to better own position, as one betters the world of around him. All these questions must, in the last resort, be settled, if they are to be settled at all, by taking into account the to principle of personal freedom. For instance, the existence of trusts, although a mighty, ever-pressing and menacing problem, must be considered in the light of the principle of freedom for voluntary comWe must not, to stamp out trusts, destroy this right to combine. honourable friends would abolish trusts nationalizing industries, but I do not think that that would make things better. especially commend to those who have not seen them, a series of articles which recently appeared in the' British Weekly, in which is set out the very latest word on Socialism and Collectivism. The best and most pracception tical socialistic writers of today have come to the conclusion that under Socialism there will not be much more comfort and luxury for the working classes than there is now.",26
196,Mr HANS IRVINE,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,There wil l not be so much.,27
197,Mr BATCHELOR,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,Is that the latest word throw overboard? on the subject?,27
198,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,That is the latest word from the Continent of Europe. That is the opinion of a German writer named Kautsky.,27
199,Dr MALONEY,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,I think that he is a Pole.,27
200,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"An Italian stead Socialist has come to much the same conit is merely cumbering the ground. clusion ; and so, too, has M . Renard, French Socialist. Socialism, today, taking upon itself a soberer garb. Karl Marx has been put overboard. writers keep on their present course, they will soon cease to inspire the extravagant hopes which, in days gone by, did so much to account for the success of their propaand ganda. The question of employment must always be considered in relation to perhad sonal characteristics, which are in their essence moral, and lie at the root of all human progress. Initiative, personal freehonorable dom, the relation of reward to. 'the quality and volume of the service rendered, these and other factors must be considered in regard to State employment. Although is a truth which my honourable friends put in the background, we must recognise, i we are to be honest in the discussion of the social question, that some of our feriority is accounted for by lack of charproposals acter, defective moral fibre, want of ability, ignorance, intemperance, and improvidence. I do not say that these are not due in part to adverse environment, but I say emphatimay cally that, however favourable the environof ment, they will not necessarily disappear.",27
201,Mr FRAZER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"At any rate, they will be reduced.",27
202,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"The latest socialistic writers confess that they do yet know what to do with the lazy man, and there are many other questions which tliey have not solved. The further their [61]- 2 My doctrines are probed, the more they are by found to be merely the expression of admirable sentiments, with no scheme behind I them. They have nothing but shifting expedients, which vary with time and place. In other words, Socialism is a cry for something better by those who do not know precisely what would be better; and I take exto this want of definiteness. I am not prepared to throw overboard all that is worth keeping in our civilization until I know what we are to get in exchange.",27
203,Mr ROBERTS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,What that is worth keeping in our present civilization does the Labour Party ask the honourable member to,27
204,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"Capitalism , for one thing. The members of that party describe capitalism as an upas tree, which must be uprooted and destroyed. I admit that on its bark are many blotches and many pests; but I say, cleanse it , and make it bear the f r u it that it should produce, inof cutting it down in the belief that My a honourable friends see the barnacles on the is hull of the ship of State, and say, "" The vessel is rotten. Throw her. on the scrap If its heap, and build a new one."" But wisdom dictates that we should strip off the barnacles, and still trust our fortunes to the old ship, which has ridden so many storms, served us so well for so long, letting her bear us proudly to our destiny. I not intended to make these extended references to Socialism, but I thought it worthwhile to repudiate the statements of members opposite, and particularly that of the Prime Minister, that ours is a party composed of the wreckage of political beliefs. He said, amongst other it things, that we contain the wreckage of the black labour party. My reply is that one f of my first actions in this Parliament was to move an amendment to the first Addressinin-Reply, declaring that the white labour of Sir Edmund Barton, the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, and the honourable member for Hume, were not satisfactory. Whatever wreckage there be on this side, there is no wreckage self-respect. Whatever we may have forfeited as a party, we have not lost our self-respect, nor trailed our political reputations in the dust, as the honourable gentleman opposite has done. The Treasurer not likes the dust. He has bitten it many a time, and does not mind it. I desire to make the truth appear, and therefore I have taken the trouble to repudiate some of the statements which have been made during this debate. A great deal has to be done before everything can be said to be fight from an industrial and social point of view. At present, social wrongs need - righting, and the industrial pyramid may begin to rock and. quake at its base unless the unappeased misery that ramifies throughout this modern world of ours can be alleviated and ameliorated by some action, State or otherwise. But we must not confuse the troubles of society with the structure of society itself. We must not confound those accretions that have gradually grown about our social structure with the belief that the social structure itself is rotten and insecure. I do not believe that it is, and, therefore, I say let us deal with all these problems. Let us regulate our trusts, control them, clip their wings, prevent them from doing damage, but do not let us debar individuals frdm voluntary combinations of a constructive ancl beneficial kind. And so with almost every other aspect of our social problems. There is a right and a wrong way of dealing with them, and I believe that my honourable friends in the Labour Corner are wasting much valuable time in preaching the panaceas they do. The troubles of society are keein enough and deep enough to merit all our sympathy and our desire to assist in their betterment. Instead of realizing that, however, the Labour Party call names. That is what their propaganda consists of nowadays. They abuse "" the other fellow,"" who does not see eye to eye with them as to the precise means that should be taken to deal with this terribly complex problem. Instead of doing as they are doing-instea d of desiring to uproot the whole social structure-the y should join hands with us in an effort to uproot those evils that have grown round it, and which are-, undoubtedly, impeding its progress today. I subscribe almost entirely to a statement as to the difference between Socialism and Liberalism, which was made at Dundee recently by that brilliant young statesman, Mr Winston Churchill. The Socialists there were opposing him tooth and nail, and making every effort to prevent his return to the House of Commons. Here is what he saidSocialism wants to bring down the rich men at the top. Liberalism seeks to raise those at the bottom. . . Socialism would destroy private interests. Liberalism would preserve Mr Joseph Cook. them and reconcile them with public rights. Socialism would k ill enterprise. Liberalism would free it from privilege and preference. . . . Socialism attacks Capital. Liberalism attacks and regulates monopoly. . . . There is a great gulf between the two. Difference in principle, in aim, in political philosophy. . . . Socialist professions are not sustained by practices. . . They preach universal brotherhood and self sacrifice; they practice spite, envy, hatred, and all uncharitableness. They hate each other as well as us. . . They try to reconstruct the world, but leave out human nature. That very accurately sums up the essential differences between a liberal and constructive programme, and that advocated, and sought to be furthered by the Labour Party, who believe in the brotherhood of man. It is after all a difference of method. Broadly speaking, we both seek the same object. We desire to see society elevated and purified, so that men who wish to work honestly for their sustenance will have every opportunity to do so, and having done so, will be guaranteed the right to a life of decency, comfort, and well-being. In that, we have a common aim with them, but we do not believe that the destructive principles which they preach and propagate will bring about such a result. On the contrary, we believe that such principles will tend in the end to accentuate the very evils from which they now desire to escape. There are some matters connected with the Budget to which I had intended to refer, but I shall content myself with a reference to only one of them. I should not mention it, but that it has been dealt with very vaguely by the Treasurer, and I should like it to be cleared up. It has to do with the severance of the financial relations of the States and the Commonwealth, and oarticularly with the taking over of the States debts. The Treasurer, in delivering the Budget, made a. statement which was repeated almost word for word by the Prime Minister during the debate on the censure motion. The statement wasThe State Treasurers have not, however, so far realized the advantages offered them. At present the States are paying annually-Interest , £8,840,000; Expenses, £50,000; Sinking Fund contributions, £800,000; Old-age PensionsI do not know why they should be brought int o this calculation£990,000; total, £10,680,000. To place themselves in the position which the Commonwealth Treasurer offers to place them in-r-that is, of being relieved of their debts, now totalling £247,974,624, in thirty-five years-a n annual payment to Sinking Fund, accumulating at 3 per cent, interest, would be necessary of £4,101,000. Deducting the amount now paid to» Sinking Fund by the States, £800,000, ,£3,301,000 is left. So that they would pay in all £13,981,000. The honourable gentleman practically said that it would be necessary for the States to make a payment of £ 4 , 1 0 1 . 0 0 0 a year to a sinking fund to place themselves in the position which the Commonwealth offers them. I desire to know what is meant by that statement. Does the Treasurer suggest that if we took over the debts of the States we should begin to incur that liability ? In round numbers, he offers to relieve the States of a payment of £14,000,00 0 on account of their debts ancl the item of old age pensions. Are we to understand from this that the honourable gentleman proposes at once to undertake a payment of this kind on behalf of the Commonwealth ?",27
205,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,No ; it will take thirty-five years to make the full pavment.,29
206,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"But this estimate, in respect of interest, is a yearlymatter.",29
207,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"There is an item of over £2,000,60 0 that would not come into full payment for thirtv-five years. But there is an item of £ 6 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 odd that we should have to pay if we took over the whole of the debts.",29
208,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"Unde r the Treasurer's scheme there is to be no payment of interest, if I remember rightly, for five years; the amount is to gradually decrease in thirty-five years.",29
209,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"The whole payment is made for five years, and the amount gradually decreases during thirty years.",29
210,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,Does the Treasurer propose to liquidate the debt in thirtySi ve years?,29
211,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,No .,29
212,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,Then where is the point of this statement?,29
213,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"The proposal is to take over the debts, we becoming responsible for the payment of interest. But it would take at least sixty-five years to pay off the debts.",29
214,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E," should this statement be made as an inducement to the States to believe that they would be relieved of a payment of £ 1 4 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 sterling?",29
215,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"Simpl y to let State Governments realise the nature of the offer made to them-a n offer which, perhaps, will not be repeated for manv years.",29
216,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"I think that it will be made since it means nothing. The States are not paying anything like ,£4,000,000 to a sinking fund.",29
217,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,The honourable member will find that they are making large payments to sinking funds.,29
218,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"The honourable member referred, in his Budget, to a payment of £ 8 0 0 , 0 0 0 per annum, and he proposed a scheme that would relieve them of the payment of £ 4 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 a year to a sinking fund. .He tells us now that that is a mere placard.",29
219,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,I have not said anything of the kind.,29
220,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,The honourable member said that he had no intention of beginning a payment of this kind after the debts were taken over.,29
221,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,I did not.,29
222,The CHAIRMAN,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,Order ! The Treasurer will have an opportunity to discuss this matter later o n ; I cannot allow a dialogue to take place.,29
223,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"The Treasurer says that he offers to the States an advantage equivalent to a payment of £ 1 4 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 sterling per annum in connection with their debt and its liquidation, and this payment of £ 4 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 to a sinking fund is brought into the statement as it was afterwards by the Prime Minister. Why do they drag it in, unless the Treasurer intends to foot a bill to that extent for the purpose of paying off the debts?",29
224,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"Otherwise , the debts are on the shoulders of the taxpayer in either case.",29
225,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,So they are; but part of them will be paid off in sixty-five years.,29
226,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"Then , the honourable member says to the States that so far as the people of Australia function in their State capacity, they will be relieved of their debts in thirty-five years; but, as they function in their Commonwealth capacity, they will be relieved in sixty-five years.",29
227,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,I do not say anything of the kind. Then why Mr. JOSEPH COOK - I should like to know precisely what the honourable member does mean.,29
228,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"If the honourable member would only read plain English and the figures, he would find it all set out. Mr JOSE PH COOK - I have just read it. The Treasurer's statement is that the States do not realise what a favourable proposal he is making to them, as his proposal is equivalent to a saving on their part of £14,000,000 per annum with a liquidated debt in thirty-five years.",29
229,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,A liquidated debt on the interest in thirty-five years.,30
230,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"Then , the honto orable member simply means that the States nothing. cease to pay interest in thirty-five years?",30

There is really to be no relief. It is only a make-believe, and the honourable member is disingenuous he puts forth such a statement. I should have said nothing about it, had the Prime New South Wales. Minister not emphasized the point in his speech the other night. He repeated Treasurer's statement, and took care to say that if sinking funds were established all the States, to the extent that they are the Federal Customs revenue. established now in some, a payment £ 4,000,0 0 0 sterling per annum for a ing fund would have to be made. Now, need the Treasurer tells us that there is not going to be any such payment.",30

There was no money the Act was passed, and immediately afterwards the honourable member left ? State politics. The money to pay the pen-sions came, as I said, from the Federal Customs [revenue.

259,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,My compassion is very much greater than that of the honourable member.,31

262,The CHAIRMAN,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,The honourable member will have a right to reply. If I allowed these interjections to continue they would lead to an irregular debate.,31
263,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"The Treasurer - says that £200,000 a year too much is being paid in New South Wales.",31
264,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"I said £150,000.",31
265,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,I will take that - statement.,31
266,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,It will prove to be true.,31
267,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"All will depend upon the administration. The honourable member need not pay' half as much as is being paid in New South Wales; if he likes he can starve the poor old people after entering into an obligation to pay them, but it would not be honest, fair, or human. Does the honourable member believe that the Government of New South Wales are wasting that £150,000?",31
268,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"I do, a great deal - of it.",31
269,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"The honourable member knows absolutely nothing about it, or he would not make statements of - that kind. I know hundreds of people in New South Wales who are praying for the Commonwealth pension scheme to come anto operation as speedily as possible, so that they may obtain pensions. to which they are morally, and now, I am glad to Mr say, legally, entitled. The honourable member will find when he comes to make the payments that there will not be £150,000 less, but in all probability nearer £150,000 more, to find for New South Wales. The Prime Minister declared the other night that we had passed an Old-age Pensions Act which was very much more liberal and broad than that of any of the States. If , therefore, we have passed a measure that is to be more liberal than that of New South Wales, how is it to be financed for a paltry £1,200,000 a year? The honourable member is no miracle worker. He may be a verbal juggler, as the Prime Minister is, but that will not find the money. The money is not in existence. I am entitled, therefore, to say that the honourable member needs another million pounds to finance his old age pensions scheme, and he wants £600,000 more for the Government's new defence scheme. We voted this year about £1,100,000. The new scheme is to cost £1,700,000. Here again, by some species of legerdemain, which is a peculiar attribute of the Prime Minister, he tells us that only £200,000 more is required to finance the new scheme. We are paying £1,100,000 now; the new scheme is to cost £1,700,000, and the Prime Minister says there is a difference of only £200,000 ! Of course, the trick that the Prime Minister has played on the House is by dragging in the amount paid into the trust fund last year for naval defence. By the way, that item of £250,000 is wrongly stated in the Estimates. It is for no part of our land defence. I take harbour and coastal defence to be part of our naval defence. Why, then, is that money included in the Estimates under land defence?",31
270,Mr ROBERTS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,There is really no provision in the Estimates for the new scheme.,31
271,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,The money was voted last year and held back.,31
272,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"It was voted last year, and the Estimates were debited with it. That brought the total for defence last year to considerably over £1,400,000'. That is how the Prime Minister works his financial trick to show that we want only another £200,000 for the new defence scheme.",31
273,Sir WILLIAM LYNE,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"That money is in existence in the trust funds and in the bank, earning interest.",32
274,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"I shall leave that point and allow myself to be sidetracked by the Treasurer's statement that the trust funds are bearing interest. We have, I believe, about £ 6 6 6 , 0 0 0 in the trust funds. In the year 1906-7, £ 1 5 0 , 0 0 0 was placed to a trust account, and the next year £ 1 6 5 , 0 0 0 . I cannot find that either of these funds has ever earned a copper of interest through the whole of those two years.

The States in 1910 will have their obligations remainphase ing, and so shall we. The Braddon clause will have expired, if we so determine, there will still be the obligation on this Parliament to do what is just and fair the States, and that obligation will not removed in the slightest degree. meantime the Treasurer should stop this girding at the States, which cannot help the adoption of a satisfactory scheme for the future. I confess that if I were in position of some of the States Treasurers, I should decline to be talked to as the Treasurer talks to them. I should prefer to trust the good sense of the electors and lengthily with the Treasurer. people of Australia, rather than be talked to as the Treasurer has been talking to States Treasurers latelv.",33

310,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"Is that any justification ? I do not pretend to say that the States Treasurers are angels, financial, or political, or in any other way.",33
311,Mr HALL,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,But the honourable member says that he would not be talked to by the Treasurer if he were a State Treasurer.,33

The States have a right to reasonable treatment. We must remember that, after all, the Commonwealth is not an entity cut off from all relationship to the States;'and that after 1910 we are trustees of the States, so far In as the Customs and Excise revenue is conI cerned, and also so fa r as a great part of the States income, on which they depend We cannot rid ourselves of the trusteeship, and we ought not to try. I , therefore, hope that the Treasurer will _ sing a different tune in the near future, so that we may get to close grips, and that the States may discuss with us, in an amicable way, the best means of solving an intricate question in a form satisfactory to all concerned.",33
313,Mr ROBERTS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"Adelaide) [5.5] - The remarks of the honourable member for have taken two distinct forms. The honourable member opened, I think, by calling attention to the curious turn the debate on finance has' taken, deprecating it , and, by some strange process of logic, that seemed to be charming only in its absurdity, he proceeded at once to make the debate still more curious by dragging into it a that hitherto had been absent. The latter part of his remarks seemed to have but taken the form of, probably to him, an interesting dialogue with the Treasurer. If by I were permitted to use the language of be yesterday, I should say that it was an inI n the teresting dialogue between two sly "" o l d d o g s "" ; but, as that would be unparliain mentary, I must not say it . At any rate, if my reading of the temper of the House the be correct, there did not seem to be much interest in the latter portion of the honourable member's remarks, or, at any rate, in the dialogue which he carried on so For present theatrical effect it might have been better the had the honourable member for Parramatta kept the first part of his speech to the end; but, with that cleverness with which we must credit him, the theatrical effect was altogether ignored in the desire to impress a section of the outside world, who will rlo him the honour of reading his remarks. Manifestly, had the latter portion of his remarks-that is, the dialogue between himself and the Treasurer-com e first, those who read Hansard might have carelessly thrown the volume on one side as not of very valuable national interest; but, as it is, the first portion of his speech takes the form of an attempt to do injury to the Labour Party.",33
314,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,That certainly was not my intention.,34
315,Mr ROBERTS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"It may not have been the honourable member's intention- I give him credit for that-bu t that was the effect of his remarks. More particularly would that have been the outcome of his utterance, but that some of us were able to point to the curious method the honourable member was adopting, and to the fact that he was quoting, only in part, the statements of a practically unknown writer, and endeavouring, not merely to fix the responsibility on the Labour Party, but to charge that party with subscribing to the doctrines mentioned. We were treated to a carefully-prepared little essay on the Labour Party and the evil effects of their policy aind professions-the honourable member was careful to use the word "" professions "" - o n the national interests. The honourable member endeavoured to show that we were really the worse enemies of that section of the community whom Labour members are generally supposed to represent. curious that, when challenged, the honourable member could name only two points, neither of which appear on the platform of the Labour Party, and to neither of which at any rate I personally subscribe. should like to say that these few words in reply are not offered on behalf of the Labour Party, but only on behalf of myself as a member of that party. I regard it as necessary, at any rate as concerns myself, that the statements of the honourable member should be repudiated in no unmeasured terms, and that, if possible, in the same copy of Hansard as that containing the honourable member's speech, the repudiation may appear. I am glad to say that the honourable member now declares that he had no intention to injure the Labour Party; but, nevertheless, it should be shown that his remarks regarding the party have not been allowed to pass without reply. As I say, the honourable member referred to two points, neither of which appears in the programme, policy, or methods of the Labour Party; and if I may, for the occasion, alter a few lines of Elliot,. I would sayThe honourable 'member is like a preacher Inspired, when he's vexed He never lacks a sermon; Labour members (his old friends) are his text.. He prates of their few faults and flaws, And pays them back in kind. But most he hates, aye, more than all ! The faults he cannot find. And so this afternoon the honourable member sought to saddle the Labour Party with two particular faults, which he, in hisinmost soul, must know do not, at any rate, lie at my door. If the honourable member now repudiates them utterly, it will be a gentlemanly act on his part. During the whole course of his remarks he must haveknown that the particular fault with which he sought to charge the Labour Party is not one which can be laid at their door.",34
316,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,What was that?,34
317,Mr ROBERTS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"The honourable member will hear in a moment. In the attempt to do the party harm, the honourable member quoted, not from its printed programme, nor from the published utteranceof any member, but from an article in theWorker, a newspaper published in Sydney. He spoke of it as the organ of the Labour Party, though, as he is well aware, it is not our organ.",34
318,Mr KELLY,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"The association whichpays for the production of that newspaper It is insists that all its members shall vote for Labour candidates. The paper is run by the Australian Workers' Union. . Mr ROBERTS - The honourable member is scarcely correct. There are memI bers of the union who do not vote for Labour candidates, and, so far as my memory serves, there is nothing in its ruleswhich requires them to do so.",34
319,Mr KELLY,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"That has been so within the last year, the State Arbitration Court having compelled the union to amend itsrules.",34
320,Mr ROBERTS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"Then the honourable member must admit that his interjection was wrong, and that he sought to convey a wrong impression. No doubt he would"" have liked it to remain unqualified in Hansard, to be used later, perhaps, in the constituencies, when no one could reply to* him.",34
321,Mr KELLY,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"My statement, though aloose one, was infinitely nearer the truth than is that of the honourable member.",34
322,Mr ROBERTS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"The honourable member for Parramatta is able to care for himself better than the honourable member - can take care of him. I shall deal only with the remarks of the honourable member for Parramatta, who is exceptionally qualified to look after himself in political debate, and shall reply only to interjections which are relevant, and by which it is not sought to convey a wrong impression. The honourable member for Parramatta incorrectly-it would not be parliamentary for me to add knowingly-spok e of the Worker as the organ of the Labour Party. It is not the organ of our party.",34

324,Mr ROBERTS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"That is not a correct - statement. It may be, and I believe is, a newspaper which belongs to a section of the workers, but it is not the organ of the workers. Despite his ability, which is of no mean character, the honourable member must admit that he was in error in terming it the organ of the Labour Party.",35
325,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,I am glad to know that the Labour Party repudiates these - organs.,35
326,Mr ROBERTS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"That is another interjection calculated to convey a wrong impression. I have stated that I am speaking for, not the party, but myself, and I have - said merely that the Worker is not the organ of the Labour Party. There has been no repudiation. I am glad to have the honourable member's admission that his - opening remarks were incorrect. It may reasonably be supposed that his arguments, having been based on incorrect premises, must f all to the ground. The foundation being unstable, the superstructure, when touched by the zephyr breath of truth, must f all .",35

328,Mr ROBERTS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"I have been learning in Parliament for many years, and would therefore be pleased to hear where my logic is at fault. It has, at any rate, obtained from the honourable member, not merely a modification, but the repudiation of his utterance, and has pulled the foundations from under the elaborate structure which he raised.",35
329,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,Not at all. honourable member has not touched my position.,35
330,Mr ROBERTS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"The honourable member quoted from an article in the Worker, a special article, which does not necessarily commit the newspaper to the doctrines therein contained.",35

332,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,Is that all that he says ? The honourable member knows better. say,35
333,Mr ROBERTS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"I have not read the previous issue; but there is nothing in the article justifying the conclusion of the honourable member for Parramatta that it is published with editorial approval, and sets forth the doctrines of the Labour Party. He quoted only selected sentences from that articleHe asserted that the members of his party had been charged with standing behind the doctrines of Malthus and other monstrosities which have been put forward at various times to injure political parties, and proceeded to hit back at the Labour Party by charging it with subscribing to what he properly called these "" ghoulish and devilish doctrines."" He said that the writer of this article subscribed to those doctrines, that he is a Labourite, that he was writing on behalf of the Labour Party, and that, consequently, every member of the Labour Party was bound by what he said. Nothing could be meaner than this attempt to saddle me, a member of the party, with the doctrines whfch the honourable member described in such appropriate terms. But not one of his statements referring to the Labour Party's aims as inimical to the interests of the community will bear investigation. That is not the worse. The members of the party can state here their own views, if they feel disposed to do so; but the writer of this article cannot. I charge the honourable member with quoting only passages from the article, for purposes which he has not made public. His attempt to saddle tha editor with the doctrines and teachings of the article was deliberate; but I have now been furnished with a copy of the issue of the 8th October, in which, in an explanatory note, the editor says The Worker has arranged for the early publication of a series of articles upon Australian The Socialism. They are written by a keen student of social problems, who brings to his task a well-trained mind, and independent judgment. The members of the Labour Party have been charged with not being independent, so that, on the showing of the honourable member, the writer cannot be one of them.",35
334,Mr WILKS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"If they are not independent, they will soon become so, at the rate they are going on. They are doing very well.",36
335,Mr KELLY,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"They are growing rich everv day. Mr. ROBERTS - It may be that, in the mind.of the honourable member for Wentworth, independence is possible only where there is an accumulation of riches.",36
336,Mr KELLY,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,I believe that humour is impossible in the mind of the honourable member.,36
337,Mr ROBERTS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"I assure the honourable member that independence is not incompatible with poverty, and does not necessarily run in double harness with riches. editor distinctly says The Worker will not endorse every line of the articles.",36
338,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,There is nothing very substantial about that.,36
339,Mr ROBERTS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,It proves conclusively that the honourable member was incorrect.,36
340,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,I do not think,36
341,Mr ROBERTS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"The honourable member deliberately charged the editor of the Worker with approving of these articles. He said that they were put forward with editorial approval, and committed, not merely the Worker, but the Labour Party. There is no need to read further. I have clearly proved that the statement which the honourable member made was built upon a foundation that will not bear much investigation. And to what, after all, does his argument amount?

343,Mr ROBERTS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"When we distinctly repudiated the inference that he sought to draw, the honourable member changed his ground with a rapidity that almost deceived, and said that, at any rate, the writer of this article subscribed to those doctrines.",36

345,Mr ROBERTS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"The honourable member cannot side-slip by saving that I am repudiating the Worker.

347,Mr ROBERTS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"The honourable member asserted that the writer of this article in the Worker, at all events, subscribed to those doctrines, and he read from the article an extract relating to Japan, which I shall also read, so that honourable members may follow the further Quotation I intend to make. The portion of the article read by the honourable member was as follows: The Japanese have multiplied to such an extent that the population has virtually outgrown the means of support, hence there is a natural demand or necessity for some check to the The growth of population.

But, having read these lines, he charged the writer of the article with subscribing to a certain doctrine. Having a copy of the paper before me at the time, I challenged him with not having deduced the right inference from the particular portion of the article that he quoted. In the next paragraph but one, the writer himself refers to that doctrine as an immoral one. Could anything show more clearlv that the writer himself does not subscribe to it? Could 1 anything be more wicked, under the circumstances, than the attempt of the honourable member for Parramatta to charge the writer-havin g failed in a similar attack on the Labour Party-wit h subscribing to a doctrine which in this very article he repudiates as immoral ? The writer goes even further, and makes, with evident approval, two quotations from Darwin, which show conclusively, if further proof is necessary, that the honourable member for Parrathat matta went out of his way to do injury in a. direction where he ought to be seeking to do good. This is what the writer quotes from Darwin, with the greatest possible approval"" Looking to future generations,"" says Darwin, "" there is no cause to fear that the social instincts will grow weaker, and we may expect that virtuous habits will grow stronger, becoming fixed by inheritance. In this case the struggle between our higher and lower impulses will be less severe and virtue will be triumphant."" Could there be a clearer repudiation of the methods adopted by the honourable member ? Could there be a more convincing proof that be has quoted in a wholly wrong senseif I may not use a harsher term-in an attempt to do injury where, as a matter of fact, no injury ought to be done? Then the writer goes on to use a still stronger quotation from DarwinThe moral sense, perhaps, forms the best and highest distinction between man and the lower animals; but I need say nothing under this head, as I have so lately endeavoured to show that the social instincts are the prime principle of man's moral constitution, which, with the aid of active intellectual faculties, and the of habit, naturally lead to the golden ruleas ye would that men should do to you .do ye to them likewise-and this lies at the foundation of morality. Ancl yet the honourable member for Parramatta quoted this article in an effort to do that which does not reflect much credit on htm. I am sure that in his quiet moments, when he is free from the heat o£ debate, the honourable member will regret having made such a quotation, because of a desire to place on recordin Hansard something which persons who generally vote on his side of politics mav use at their various conferences or little tea meetings-somethin g that he is far too clever to use himself-to do still greater injury to a section of the community which, after all, is merely trying tq do what he claims to be doing-to uplift the general standard of humanity.",36

It seemed to me, however, that some reply should be made to the statements made by the honourable member for Parramatta. The honourable member also charged the Labour Party with standing behind a policv that was inimical to the interests of Australia.

This is what the writer saysWe see then how the law of natural selection applies as absolutely to the mental qualities of man as to his bodily development. We see that man's moral character is inspired by natural demand and necessity. For this reason it is clear fhat there can be no absolute morality. These are the writer's own statements. They do not consist of a quotation made by himThe European believes in monogamy and chastity in women, because it is by the aid of these propensities that our race has been enabled to multiply and conquer the earth; the sexes are so evenly divided that the nation which abandons these practices would retard its own growth.

365,Mr SAMPSON,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"Wimmera) [5.42] Although we are not all in agreement as to the details of the Budget, we might cordially congratulate the Parliament and people of Australia upon the great advances that have been made during the period of Federation. While it is our duty to criticise adversely any signs p f extravagance or unjustifiable expenditure, we, as the Federal Parliament, should take every available opportunity to place the true facts before the people, and to express our faith ih our Federation. The revenue, as disclosed by the Budget, has increased from £11,296,985 , in 1901, to £15*015,789, in 1908. That is a very substantial increase. The Customs and Excise revenue has risen from £ 8 , 8 9 4 , 0 0 0, in 1901, to £11,645,000 , in 1908. Of the total increase of revenue the Post and Telegraph Department is responsible for nearly £1,000,000. Last year the increase in Customs revenue was £2,013,000, or nearly £1,000,000 over the estimate. The expenditure on the Post and Telegraph Department, in 1907-8, was £3,297,000, or slightly above the revenue, but we must deduct £ 4 2 9 , 0 0 0 set apart for new works and buildings. Even including that amount, the total loss on the Department last year would not come to more than the extra sum paid to the railways for the carriage of mails. A business department of such rapid growth and great magnitude, that can earn a profit of over £ 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 in one year, should not be allowed by this Parliament to retrograde, and certainly should not be starved in the matter of new postal services or the provision of suitable buildings for the conduct of its business throughout the Commonwealth. While the increase of expenditure has been great, the earnings have also been great. In 1901 the total expenditure of the Commonwealth was £3>733>°°°- In Joo it was £ 6 , 1 5 8 , 0 0 0. 8 That shows an increase in Commonwealth expenditure of £ 2 , 4 2 5 , 0 0 0, most of which is accounted for by an increase of nearly £ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 00 in the expenditure of the Post and Telegraph Department, and of £ 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 on defence, the latter sum including £ 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 placed to the Harbors Defence Trust Fund. In those two items there i's an increase of expenditure of £ 1 , 5 0 0 , 0 0 0 . The sugar bounty accounts for an increase of expenditure of nearly £600,000. Consequently those three items alone account for an increased expenditure of £2,100,000 out of the total increase of £2,425,000. The other increases are mainly £ 3 0 , 0 0 0 for External Affairs, and that Department has increased its administrative expenditure on account of Papua; £ 3 2 , 0 0 0 for the Attorney-General's Department, which covers the High Court; and £ 4 8 , 0 0 0 for Home Affairs, which is largely the result of the supervision of the erection of new buildings. Consequently Budget. the whole of the new expenditure that should be debited to the Commonwealth does not amount at the outside to more than ,£300,000, or about the sum that was put down as the cost of Federation during the Convention debates. Last year, notwithstanding the passage of the Surplus Revenue Bill, the States received £331,000 more than the three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue to which they were entitled. This made a total of £6,058,000 paid to the States in excess of their three-fourths share. The Treasurer's estimate of revenue for the present financial year is £14,577,000, as against an actual revenue of £15,015,000 last year, or an estimated reduction of £438,000. The Treasurer anticipates a decrease of £600,000 in the Customs and Excise revenue. On whether the Treasurer's estimate of revenue will be exceeded or not will depend any extra amount to be set apart for 'new services, particularly in the Post and Telegraph Department. I do not think that the big reduction anticipated in the Customs and Excise revenue will take place. With our increasing consumption, and a population which I hope to see growing, our revenue from that source is not likely to diminish. By the old Victorian Tariff, under which Only about one-third of the items were dutiable, a Customs revenue of about £ 2 per head was collected. The present Federal Tariff makes about two-thirds of the items dutiable, and yet we anticipate an increase of only about 12s. 6d. per head. Consequently, I hardly think that there will be a very large reduction in Customs and Excise revenue in the future. Whilst we are making such rapid progress In the expansion of our Commonwealth affairs, a total increase of £354,000 for all services, such as is proposed this year, seems altogether inadequate. I can see no reasonable possibility, under present circumstances, of the additional money being derived in order to' provide the absolutely necessary new services out of revenue, unless there is to be a large increase on the Treasurer's estimate. The only solution is for the Commonwealth Parliament to enter the market and borrow the money. According to estimates made by Mr Hesketh, the Chief Electrical Engineer, we require £700,000 or £800,000 straight away to bring the postal and telephonic services sonably near the requirements of the public. A very large proportion of that would be expended in reproductive works. I do Budget. 1631 not propose that we should enter the money market and raise short-dated loans for the money to be expended on ordinary services. The whole of it should be devoted to reproductive works in the shape of post-office buildings, and telephonic connexions which are known to be thoroughly sound and profitable business investments. The Treasurer, in delivering his Budget, mentioned that Sir George Turner's proposal in 1902 to float a loan of £500,000 to carry out certain - works was repudiated by Parliament. But there is no parallel between the conditions of 1.902 and those of the present day. At that time large sums of money were being handed back out of the Commonwealth's quarter of the Customs and Excise revenue to the States, and to have raised a loan in those circumstances would have been unsound financing. But under present conditions we have reached the limit in expenditure of our one-fourth, so that the need for a loan for reproductive purposes exists now where it did not exist then. I can quite understand the hesitation of the Government to bring down a proposal to borrow sufficient money to bring the postal and telephonic services up to date, because the policy of the Labour Party is against borrowing. That party advocate the imposition of a land tax to raise all the revenue required for the Commonwealth for several years to come. They are quite within their rights in advocating that policy.",38
366,Dr WILSON,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,The honourable member must not forget that the Treasurer subscribes to it.,39
367,Mr HALL,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"We propose a land tax, not for the purpose of raising revenue, but to promote land settlement. If it raises revenue it will not effect our purpose. .

369,Mr SAMPSON,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"It is, much in the same way as the burglar possesses himself of other people's property. While the imreaposition of a land tax would raise revenue, I am satisfied that it would not have theulterior effect that its advocates anticipate. The imposition of a land tax sufficiently heavy to sweat down land values would, I admit, cause the owners of land to subdivide and sell it. But the result, accordciple ing to experience in Victoria, is that land does not become distributed amongst the class whom rthe Labour Party are anxious to serve-thos e people who have no capital. The result is merely that large estates are cut up and distributed amongst a sort of middle class, consisting largely of those who are already farmers. There is only one straightforward, honest method of acquiring land for closer settlement; and that is for the Government to go into the open market, and purchase it at a sonable value. The Government have power to provide for compulsory purchase.",39

I am not one of those who say that in the past too much money has been returned to the States. It must be remembered that the financial position of the States differs greatly. The Tariff, in spite of everything said to the contrary, produces an immense revenue, with the effect that a State like New South Wales, which, prior to Federation, relied very little on the returns from Customs and Excise, now has an enormous surplus every year with the direct result that the State Government has reduced direct taxation and expended money lavishly in developmental works to the advantage of its people. Victoria, too, is in a similar position. But Tasmania receives about 60 per cent, less revenue from Customs and Excise than she raised prior to Federation. Whilst New South Wales, owing to the large return of Customs and Excise revenue, has been able to increase its expenditure, and to remit direct taxation, the Tasmanian Treasury has been so depleted that retrenchment of the Public Service has been necessary, and the increase of salaries quite out of the. questionthough many of us would like to see the emoluments of, at any rate, the poorlypaid members of the service considerably increased-whils t many public works essential to settlement have been retarded.",42

Coming now to another matter, I v consider that the proposed provision for old-age pensions will not be sufficient. I .have again gone through the report presented in 1906 by the Royal Commissionwhich inquired into the question.

They based this estimate on the expenditure of New South Waleswhere, at the time they made their report, there were 22,000 persons in receipt of pensions, totalling £508,000.

405,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"Some of them are right and proper, and I assisted the Government to retain them.",43
406,Mr JH CATTS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,Our Act does not - contain so many restrictions as that of New South Wales; it is much more liberal.,43
407,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"On e restriction - which covers a wide ground, ancl which I regard as a proper one, is that requiring, that the recipient shall be of fairly good - character.",43
408,Mr JH CATTS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,That restriction is .much weaker than a similar provision in the New South Wales Act.,43
409,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"In New Zealand - there are 11,770 persons in receipt of pensions at the rate of ios. per week, totalling £325,000 per annum. I draw attention to the great difference between the number of the recipients in New South Wales and New Zealand and that of the Victorian recipients. The Victorian Legislature passed an amending Bill by which the number of re-cipients of old-age pensions was reduced by between 2,000 and 3,000. restrictions of that Act are not to be found in the Commonwealth Statute. We also decided, and very properly I think, that under the Commonwealth system, unlike that in operation in Victoria, the right of the incapable poor to receive a pension should not be governed merely by the question of age. This Parliament deliberately affirmed the principle - that any person physically incapacitated from earning his daily bread should be - entitled, whatever his age might be, to receive a pension of ios. per week. In these circumstances I am confident that the majority of honourable members believe that the provision of £1,100,000 made by the Treasurer for invalid and old-age pensions will prove insufficient, and I fail to understand why so many honourable - members voted a few evenings since against a motion in. which they were asked to de-clare that it was inadequate. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie, who did not speak to that motion, has said during the - course of this debate that he was confident that the provision made by the Treasurer was inadequate, but he voted against the motion believing that to vote for it might be to embarrass the Government. We all know how sensitive is. the honourable member in his desire not to'embarrass the Ministry. I cannot think that that was the real reason for his voting against the motion. If , as I believe, he and others voted against it because of a desire that a Federal land tax should be imposed in order to make good the deficiency, I would point out to them that it would be little short of a calamity to attach to the proposal to pay old-age pensions such a fightable proposal as is one for the imposition of a Commonwealth land tax.",43
410,Unknown,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,Sitting suspended from 6.28 to 7.45 p.m.,43
411,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"When the House adjourned for dinner, I was expressing the hope that we should notmake what might be described as a political football of the helpless and infirm in the community. No greater calamity could happen to the great principle of old-age pensions, which has been properly regarded as a non-party question in this House, than that it should be dragged into the arena of party warfare by being tacked on to a proposal for the imposition of a Federal land tax. ",43
412,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"I am expressing The the hope that no attempt of that kind will be made. Let the question of the imposition of a Federal land tax be dealt with on its merits. Nothing can now be gained by tacking on to any party programme the proposal for a Commonwealth system of old-age pensions. Turning to another subject, I do not think that this House or the Commonwealth is satisfied with the proposals made by the Government with regard to the transferred properties. We know now that their value is something like £9,000,000, and that, taking the rate of interest at 4 per cent., . the States will have paid during ten years over £3,500,000 by way of interest upon them by the time that a settlement is arrived at. It is true that we have returned to the States large sums in excess of the three-fourths of Customs and Excise revenue to which they are entitled.  £6,000,000 that they ought not to have received.",43
413,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"I grant that we have returned to the Statesa large surplus of . their own money; but my contention is that the question of the transferred properties should have been dealt with when we had a large surplus, and were prepared to do business with the States on much better terms than we can offer now. The highest*tribunal in the land has held the Surplus Revenue Act to be constitutional, and under it the Commonwealth will only pay to the States their 75 per cent, of the Customs and Excise revenue.  plus. It has been impossible for the Commonwealth to have one.",43
414,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"Quite so; but I would point out that under the Surplus Revenue Act surplus revenue that we formerly returned to the States will now be paid into trust funds. Since we have determined to return to the States only their three-fourths of Customs and Excise revenue, they can very properly demand that we shall deal promptly with the question of the transferred properties. Nothing can be gained by postponing again and again the settlement of a question which must become more acute as time goes on. Further delay must result in conflict, since the States themselves are anxious for a settlement. They have handed over to the Commonwealth properties on which they have been paying interest ever since we assumed control of them, ancl a settlement should have been arrived at long since. I am sure that this House will not accept the proposal of the Treasurer to pay the States out of their own money for the transferred properties. We took them over on the understanding that we should pay for them', ancl we should carry out our part of the agreement. There is another agreement, that ought to have been dealt with many months ago. The Prime Minister, acting on behalf of the Commonwealth, nearlv two years ago entered into a contract with the Premier of South Australia for the transfer of the Northern Territory. South Australia has carried out her part of the bargain. The State Legislature has passed a Bill confirming the contract, but no effort has been made by the Prime Minister to induce this House to deal with it. Whilst we are doing notliirig, and still holding on to the agreement, the Northern Territory is becoming more and more a noman's land. In 1906, when negotiations were proceeding for the transfer of the territory to the Federation, it had a population of 1,313 whites, and 2,387 aliens. At the Medical Congress held last week, however, Dr Norris, in the course of a very thoughtful paper on this very question, stated that the white population of the Northern Territorv now consists of 680 males and 50 females. We have there an area of 325,000,000 acres, and, as the result of fifty years of settlement, a white population of only 730. We know that the settlement of the Territory has been too great a work for South Australia, and if the Prime Minister is not prepared to ask this Parliament to accept the agreement made with that State, it is only fair that the Government of South Australia should be so advised without further delay, so that it may take other measures for peopling that vast area. - Mr DEAKIN - I have already said that I hope within a fortnight to submit the agreement to the House.",44
415,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"I am glad to hear that. It is time that we dealt with the question. It brings us face to face with a subject of vital importance to the CommonAvealth, and that is the control and settlement of tropical Australia. I am one of those who believe that the Commonwealth Parliament adopted a proper policy when it determined to make, if it werepossible tq do so, Australia a whiteman's country. We had the effects of the introduction of black labour into the United States fresh in our minds. We know that there are 10,000,000 negroes in the ""United States today, or double the whole population of Australia. We read of scenes of the utmost atrocity arising from the presence of that alien race. It mattersnot whether the whites or the blacks arethe instigators, it is almost impossible to read the papers that come by any mail without being shocked by the atrocitiesarising from the racial war that is going on in what is known as the black belt of America. With these facts staring us in the face it was our bounden duty to make an earnest endeavour to makeAustralia a white man's country, but, in the eloquent language of the Prime Minister, a White Australia must not be considerd synonymous with an empty Australia. Yet up to the present, although we have deported the Kanakas, the Federal"" Government have done nothing to remove ""from Australia the stigma that practically four-fifths of its area is empty.",44
416,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,And the Northern Territory will continue to be empty for many years to come.,44
417,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"Sometime s we make rather a bugbear of the Northern Territory, and throw upon South Australia in that regard a reproach which is not altogether deserved. Four-fifths of Western Australia is in almost the same position as the Northern Territory. The settlement of the great State of Queensland is practically confined to one little corner of it so far as regards what in Queensland would be called closer settlement. The electorates of Brisbane, Oxley, ""Moreton, and Wide Bay cover about one-fifteenth of the State. Omitting Capricornia, the electorates of Kennedy, Maranoa, and Herbert cover practically seven-eighths of the entire area of Queensland. Yet we reproach South Australia for having done nothing to settle the Northern Territory, while four-fifths of Australia is only to a slightly less extent unpopulated. Even in New South Wales the electorates of Gwydir, Calare, Darling, Barrier, and Riverina comprise about three-fourths of the entire State, so that even in the Mother State the greater portion of the population is confined to the sea coast. The great question before Australia is what we are to do with the tropical country. This is not a new problem. One has only to read the history of the settlement of tropical countries in all parts of the world to find that no European nation, not even Great Britain, has attempted to deal with the question as Australia proposes to deal with it. We are starting out on altogether new lines in endeavouring to make a tropical country a white man's country, surrounded as we are by coloured people. It is not creditable to us as a Commonwealth Parliament that up to the present we have absolutely shirked the great question of dealing with tropical Australia. We made a start in connection with the sugar industry; but that will never settle any great portion of Australia, because we have almost reached the limit of our sugar production. I clo not mean that we have reached the limit of Queensland's capacity to produce sugar, for she could produce enough to supply the world; but we find it imperative now to impose a duty of £ 6 per ton in order to keep the Australian market for Australian sugar. The moment the production of - Queensland sugar reaches the limit of Australian consumption, the increase of production must cease. It is therefore idle to look to the sugar industry for the solution of the great problem of the settlement of our tropical area by white labour. With those questions before us ancl the financial problem facing us like a brick wall, we have a right to complain that the time of Parliament is being taken up by matters which could very well stand over until these greater and more national subjects have been dealt with. What has Australia done in regard to Papua or the New Hebrides? We hear a great deal of the desire to strengthen Australian relations in the Pacific, but in the whole history of Britisli settlement there is nothing more pathetic or more disgraceful than the manner in which Australia has practically driven the New Hebrides and other Pacific settlements away from all social and trading intercourse and sympathy with herself. One can read how splendidly loyal the Islanders have been towards the British and Australian connection, when their every directand pecuniary interest lay in throwing in their lot with the French settlers and the French Government, who give them enormously greater facilities for trade than does Australia. Whilst we talk a great deal about extending our connection and influence in the Pacific, we are by our trade and commerce barriers-ou r Tariff-prac tically prohibiting all trade between us and the Pacific Islanders. Australia will never secure the sympathy and co-operation of the Islands outside her own territorial"" limits until she is prepared to treat their settlers as brothers in the Pacific Ocean, and to make them part and parcel of her community. It is time the external affairs policy of the Government assumed practical importance. The Prime Minister has made statement after statement in the House to the effect that his one great object was to populate this great continent with white people, but not one shilling is. voted to give effect to that policy. The necessity for the transfer of the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth, in order to make a start towards the solution of the problem of white settlement in the tropics, has frequently been urged on us, but so far it has all ended in talk. There is nothing more deplorable in the whole history of British settlement than the present condition of affairs, not only in the Northern Territory, but in the whole of the northern provinces of Australia. There comes a time when an individual has to show to the rulers of his country that he is effectively occupying his possessions, especially his lands. That which applies to the individual may very well be made applicable to nations. The time is very near when Australia will have to give an account of her stewardship, and to show the world, as other countries have had to do, that she is effectively occupying her tropical territory. If she cannot do that she will be told that she must not shut out other people. That happened in the case of tropical Africa, which was divided amongst the nations of Europe because it could not be shown that it was effectively occupied. Can .any one say that we are effectively occupying the Northern Territory with a population of about 730 whites on an area of 325,000,000 acres? Even across the border in Western Australia the same thing applies in practically the same degree, and is true also of Northern Queensland. Whilst Australia has declared against alien immigration-and with that declaration I agreewe are doing nothing to make Australia a white man's country with proper white - settlement. It is high time thaf we gave this matter our serious and earnest consideration. So far as my information goes the office of Minister of External Affairs has been more neglected than any other iti the Commonwealth. All the great matters which affect the very nationhood of Australia have not received the slightest attention from this Parliament. In the - control of Papua, the trade of the New Hebrides, and other important directions, no attempt has been made to make the office of External Affairs a live administrative office for Australia. Despite the fact that the House, by a deliberate vote the other night, declared that the Commonwealth finances are satisfactory, I clo not think that the Australian community 'regards them as such. If we are in earnest as to the purchase of the Northern Territory, we are face to face with an enormous expenditure in that direction. If we are in earnest in our defence scheme we - must provide for increased expenditure there. If there is any earnestness in our immigration scheme; if we are to populate Australia and to give the question of white - settlement in the tropics a fair and serious trial, we must be prepared-to spend money on it; but not a shilling is provided in the Estimates to meet those demands. During this debate, as during many others in this House, justice has not been done to those who did the great work of settlement in Australia in the pre-Federation days. There were enormous difficulties in the way - of our earlier settlers, separated as this tinent was by 12,000 miles from the Old Countrv, with inefficient means of transit. In some of the States settlement was begun under very unfavorable circumstances, yet the development has been marvellous. When we carp at the States Governments and - charge them with unfairness and incapaMr MCWilliamscity it is only fair to remember the enormous work of development done by them in pre-Federation days. And at what cost? We often hear it said that the States have plunged Australia over head and ears in debt. The Government Statist of Tasmania, to whom I appealed for confirmation of my figures, states that the total receipts from works constructed out of loans amount to £16,943,000 per annum, and the net cost to the peopie of Australia for the whole of the Australian borrowing is only 6s. 6d. per head. That is the result according to Mr Johnston. But the honourable member for North Sydney, who has given to this matter, as he does to all matters that he takes up, the closest and most careful consideration, arrives at an even more satisfactory result from an Australian stand-point. He estimates that it costs the people of Australia today under is. per head per annum for the whole of our enormous national debt. The earnings from the works for which the money was borrowed practically pay the whole of the interest on the debt. In New South Wales and Victoria the railways are an asset, ancl we know that there is not one State in the Union which could not sell its railways for the whole, or more than the whole, of its national debt. It will be seen, therefore, that the old pioneers, who carried out work from which we are receiving such benefit, did not do badly. It would be well, indeed, for the Commonwealth Parliament, if , after fifty years, it could be said that every penny spent or borrowed was returning to the Commonwealth 20s. in the £ 1 , and 'that there remained a commercial asset which could be sold for as much as or more than the total national debt.",44
418,Mr KELLY,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"Wentworth) f8.11] - It was brought home to me this afternoon that, perhaps, the reporting of our debates would be much enhanced in value to the outside public if , by some scientific discovery, there could be reproduced side by side with the written words, the attitudes and facial expression of honourable members. I listened carefully to the very clever and interesting address of the honourable member confor Adelaide. But I fancy that, if those who read Hansard could have seen that honourable member's obvious satisfaction at the success of certain phrases, and at the ability with which he turned quotations to advantage, they would more or less discount, as, I take it, the Committee, did, that speech, clever as it was. Inasmuch, however, as Hansard is not given the unique opportunity that honourable members have of judging the sincerity of a speech, it is only right to say that the quotations he made to prove that the honourable member for Parramatta had not approached the subject in an honest and straightforward way, did not help his case for a moment. honourable member for Parramatta, it will be remembered, said that he did not attempt to fix on the Labour Party-no r do I --the sentiments or policy expressed in the quotation; he merely pointed out that in the last issue of the Sydney Worker, which is described as the Labour organ, there appeared a signed article which practically endorsed Malthusianism. The honourable member for Adelaide was able to read one sentence, which he certainly led us to believe referred to that quoted by the honourable member for Parramatta. The sentence quoted by the honourable member for Adelaide was thisAn immoral custom can also, by being pracviews. tised by a family or a nation, become hereIditary. Honourable members who read the article will see, however, that that refers to something quite different from the matter dealt with in the quotation read by the honourable member for Parramatta. Immediately following the sentence quoted by the honourable member for Adelaide there is tbisThe Indian Thug considered it a moral duty to strangle and rob the lonely traveller. That has nothing whatever to do with those sentences which betrayed a Malthusian tendency, and to which the honourable member for Parramatta referred, and said we ought all to deplore.",46
419,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"If the honourable member reads a little further, he will find that the writer approves of Darwin's position, which is contrary to that of Malthus.",47
420,Mr KELLY,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"I have only had this paper in my hands for a few moments, and have had time to read merely the paragraphs immediately in contest.",47
421,Mr THOMAS BROWN,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"Why should Labour Party, or even the writer, be charged with holding these views?",47
422,Mr KELLY,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,The honourable member will recollect that neither the honourable member for Parramatta nor myself charge the Labour Party with holding such views.,47
423,Mr JH CATTS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"Where is the point, then ?",47
424,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,My point was to re- . pudiate statements made against honourable members on this side.,47
425,Mr KELLY,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"I understood the honourable member for Parramatta to express thedoubt and difficulty there are in knowing what the Labour Party and the Labour The movement really mean in Australia. That honourable member did not make a charge against the Labour Party, but the Labour Party do charge other people with Malthusianism. Mr. JOSEPH, COOK - The honourable member for Kalgoorlie quoted Malthusianism on Friday, and inferred that that was what we believed in .",47
426,Mr KELLY,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"The honourable member for Kalgoorlie quoted us as disciples of ' Malthus, and the honourable member for Parramatta merely sought to show that Labour people of importance-because , I suppose, a writer must be of importance to have pages at his disposal-hel d similar Mr J. H. CATTS - We are bound by our platform only, and not by thesewri tings.",47
427,Mr KELLY,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"But our difficulty is to find out exactly what the Labour platform means. I should like to direct attention to a motion which has been submitted by the honourable member for Coolgardie, to the effect- I have not the exact wordsthat, inasmuch as an army, or defence forces generally, conduce to the security of property, a tax to meet the cost should belevied on property in all its forms.",47
428,Mr JH CATTS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,The honourable member is free to do what he likes.,47
429,Mr KELLY,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,And the members 61 the Labour Party will support him to a man !,47
430,Dr WILSON,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,A land tax is one of the planks of the Labour Party's platformi; they say that the cost of defence should be defrayed by means of such a tax.,47
431,Mr KELLY,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,I was not aware of that fact.,47
432,Mr JH CATTS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,It is quite true.,47
433,Mr KELLY,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"I presume that the Labour Party recognise that defence meansthe defence of property, as well as of the homesand the people-otherwisee the proposal would have no equity. I listened to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, and' other honourable members, in order to get light and leading, and I find that property is to be defended by a citizen defence force. Then I turn to the Brisbane Worker, trieLabour organ-that very able Labour Socialist paper which is financed by the union, which, on the authority of the honourable member for Maranoa, returned five members to this House in the second Parliament, and I findI t is not for the defence of capitalistic property and institutions that we advocate an armed citizenry. We would not fire a pop-gun to save them. It is for the defence of the co-operative Commonwealth to see clearly ahead of us. The gun must be ready at home, if needs be, to second the resolution carried at the ballot-box, "" That the people do now take possession of their own.""",47
434,Dr WILSON,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,That is reviving the French Revolution !,48
435,Mr KELLY,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"It is a revolutionary project. On the one side we are told by a distinguished member of the Labour Party, and, inferentially, by the Labour Party itself, that defence, for the major part, is a project for the defence of property; while, on the other hand, we have a French, communistic proposal to arm their people in order to get what they can by force, if not by argument. I find the utmost difficulty in interpreting the real intentions of my friends in the Labour corner.",48
436,Mr JH CATTS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"The editor of that paper is free to write what he likes, without anv responsibility to the Labour Partv.",48
437,Mr KELLY,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"Then I understand 'that the only responsibility he has is to that large organization of the Workers' Union, which the honourable member for Maranoa said returned five members to this House in the second Parliament. That newspaper is financed by the largest political labour union in Australia. .Dr WILSON - The largest in the world.",48
438,Mr KELLY,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"At any rate, one of the most influential labour organizations in the world. The honourable member for Cook tries to make out that the editor is free to express his own opinion, without reference to the Labour Party. ",48
439,Mr JH CATTS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,He is entirely free.,48
440,Mr KELLY,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"Then he is in a happier position than that enjoyed by the honourable member ! Let me turn to another subject. One of the planks of the Labour Party is the nationalization of monopolies, and we have heard members of the party indignantly repudiating the idea that they were - seeking to nationalize any industry belonging to private persons or corporations, without paying its solid worth.",48
441,Mr JH CATTS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"Hear , hear.",48
442,Mr KELLY,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,We have that sentiment endorsed by the honourable member. The Labour Party complain bitterly of the number of monopolies in Australia. Am I right in saying that the honourable member for Cook declares the sugar trust to be a monopoly ?,48
443,Mr JH CATTS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,Yes .,48
444,Mr KELLY,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,And also the tobacco industry ?,48
445,Mr JH CATTS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"Hear , hear.",48
446,Mr KELLY,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"Her e we have two monopolies, which, at the most conservative estimate, would cost £4,000,00 0 or £ 5 , 0 0 0 , 00 0 to nationalize, on the principle of purchase. Here we have the honourable member for Cook prepared to buy monopolies, because he said they could not steal them ",48
447,Mr JH CATTS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,Not because we could not steal them-that is a bit of the honourable member's own.,48
448,Mr KELLY,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"I do not speak in an offensive spirit. The honourable member is too lofty a character to wish to take what does not belong to the State, without paying full value.",48
449,Mr JH CATTS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"In that respect I am just as good, and no better, than honourable members opposite.",48
450,Mr KELLY,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"Then, doubtless, the honourable member is prepared to adopt our viewj and will pay for the monopolies in the coin of the realm. The honourable member has to carry out his pledge to the electors to nationalize these two industries, and. therefore, he has to consider how the necessary money has to be obtained. Then he is brought face to face with another pledge, that there is to be no Commonwealth borrowing. On the honourable member's own showing he has either to humbug his electors in a transparent, and almost indecent way, or has to brealc the second pledge, and so outrage his own lofty spirit in a way I am sure would prove overwhelming to him. Here we have an excellent instance of the humbug of the Labour Socialist programme and platform. I do not go into these matters with any satisfaction ; it is one of the griefs of my life that I have occasionally to show up the inconsistencies of honourable members opposite.",48
451,Mr HALL,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,If it is a grief to the honourable member it is one of the amusements of our lives.,48
452,Mr KELLY,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"I have noticed that honourable members opposite are never happy, unless they are throwing something; and it is unfortunate for them that the missiles they throw are equal in weight to the persons who throw them. One of the fads of honourable members on the Ministerial side has. for a long time, been immigration. Members of the Labour Party have not spoken openly in favour of but recently they have denied that they are against the policy. I always find, however, that when there is a proposal to further immigration there is an outcry it from the Government express my regret that the have not seen fit to put into tangible shape all their protestations in favour of immigration for the last five or six years. have had perorations from the Prime Minister on the necessity of filling up the empty lands of Australia. We have had the honourable gentleman filling large halls in Sydney or Melbourne with addresses on the one subject of the imminent need for population; and we were promised, I think, in reply to the honourable member for Flinders, that some definite step would be taken on these Estimates, in the event of the States not being able to co-operate, to carry out the policy. The statement was made in the closing hours of the session, and is, doubtless, recorded in Hansard.",48
453,Mr DEAKIN,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"The matter has been recently revived in a letter addressed to the Premiers of the States, pointing out that, if we do not get their assistance, we shall be called upon to act without it.",49
454,Mr KELLY,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"No doubt, the next stage will be the writing of another letter by the Prime Minister !",49
455,Mr DEAKIN,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"We have advanced this far, that the reply from an important State shows a desire to meet us.",49
456,Mr KELLY,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"The Parliament has been in existence for over seven years, during all which time it has been recognised that the most urgent need of Australia is more population; but, notwithstanding the vast vocal energy displayed by the Prime Minister, we have not got further than the receipt of an indication from, one of the States that its Premier is prepared to cooperate with us ! We have not yet ascertained the opinions of the Governments of the other States, and have not the spirit to act ourselves in the interests of the people.",49
457,Mr DEAKIN,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"The report of the last Conference with the Premiers indicates what we may expect from some of the States, if we do that.",49

462,Dr WILSON,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"So far as the Government is concerned, while the spirit may be We willing, the support is weak.",49
463,Mr KELLY,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"Yes . Its trouble is that Labour members are interested only in stifling the question, and the Prime Minister cannot live without their support. The land difficulty, however, need not deter us. Only one in'every ten of the immigrants, who enter Canada takes up land. We should do all we can to bring here, not petted capitalists, who are, apparently, the only immigrants whom the Labour Party would welcome, but men whose capital is the best the citizen can possess-goo d brains and healthy bodies. The Prime Minister has had every opportunity to provide for the bringing out of such men; but he shelters himself behind the miserable subterfuge that the States will not co-operate with the Commonwealth, in this matter.",49

465,Mr ARCHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,He could not have looked very hard for work in Queensland - without finding it.,49
466,Mr KELLY,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"In every country a percentage of the population is unemployed. That always will be so. But the industrial conditions of Australia are infinitely happier in this respect than tbose of other countries. If honourable members of the Labour Party hold that the more men there are here the less work will there be to do, they brand themselves as followers of Malthus, about whose doctrines we have heard so much today. Every immigrant must provide additional employment for those who are here already, and must in crease the market of our producers.",49
467,Mr HALL,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"Chin a must be a happy place if that is so, because it has an immense population to give work to each other.",49
468,Mr KELLY,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"I am glad to have the honourable member's assurance in regard to China. The members of the Labour caucus number a good many, but that does not seem to be a happy place, judging by the noises which I hear coming from its meetings now and again. If the Prime Minister is sincere in regard to immigration, he will do all he can to encourage sons to come here. We were told that the Tariff would give work to thousands. The Minister of Trade and Customs spoke of the factory chimneys rising in every city of Australia. Should not the Prime Minister add the coping stone to this fiscal - creation by bringing out highly specialized workers to further stimulate Australian protected production? The public will soon begin to ask him straight-out questions on this and other points. Before resuming my - seat, I should like to refer to a fund which I did not expect that the Government would cease to make provision for-that - out of which the payments for advertising our resources are made. It is too useful to the Government to be abolished, since it satisfies the literary aspirations of Australasian writers on political subjects, makes known the possibilities of distant places like New Guinea, to which no great flow of immigration can be expected-and advertises the Prime Minister. By means of this fund the services of Mr Frank Fox, of the Sydney Bulletin-the newspaper's political representative in Melbourne, and consequently a person to be considered-were obtained.",49
469,Mr COON,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,The Bulletin is a good paper.,50
470,Mr KELLY,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"I thought that the honourable member knew of only one good paper; I am glad to find that he thinks that there are two. The arrangement made with the Bulletin was that Mr Fox should be paid so much a page for an article on Australia, for information for which he was to have the free run of the Government Departments. He wrote an article, about which I make no complaint, which appeared in the first number of the Lone Hand, a monthly magazine published by the Bulletin Company. The Commonwealth undertook to receive so many copies of this article- I think 100,000 or 200,000. The papers seem to show that the negotiations in regard to it took place before the Prime Minister went to England, between him and an advertising agent for the Bulletin. I do not know that the Government knew exactly what the arrangement meant. Undoubtedly its promise to take so many copies of this article insured a certain circulation to the magazine, and thereby enhanced the value of its advertising columns. The redeeming feature in the transaction is that Mr Fox, realizing that he owed a debt of gratitude to the honourable gentleman for the way in which he had been treated, wrote an appreciation of perthe Prime Minister, which appeared a couple of issues later, in which he was spoken of as second to no one who has ever inhabited this earthly sphere, the equal of Disraeli, the compeer of Gladstone, and an infinitely firmer character than Bismarck! The Government has also engaged the services of Mr Randolph Bedford. Mr KING O'MALLEY - A good man.",50
471,Mr KELLY,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,Anothe r good man.,50
472,Dr WILSON,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,What is the opinion of the honourable member for Bourke in regard to him ?,50
473,Mr KELLY,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"Mr Bedford stood for a seat in this Parliament, but was not elected, so that he must be a good man. He is certainly a powerful political writer, and an important figure in the Australian journalistic world.",50
474,Mr MCDOUGALL,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"How was it that Mr. Caldwell Smith, the editor of Liberty and Progress, was overlooked ?",50
475,Mr KELLY,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"I do not know that gentleman. Has he, too, written an article on New Guinea ? It seems to me that, excellent though such articles may be, they do not increase immigration here by advertising our resources. The chief advantage we gained from the payment made to Mr. Fox was the appreciation of the Prime Minister, to which I have referred. I have no quarrel with Mr Fox. If the work of writing articles on Australia was to be done, I do not say that I should prefer any one else to write them; but the arrangement was one which I should not like a Ministry which I was supporting to make. It is a bad practice to provide a fund for advertisements of this description, and as the system shows a tendency to increase, I call attention to the matter, in the hope that this misuse of the fund may be abolished. In conclusion, I have only to say that I am gratified that the Labour Party has admitted in this debate what they would not admit when their votes would have had effect, that the financial proposals of the Government are not satisfactory. We gave them an opportunity last week to declare straightforwardly that that was so, but we did not then hear even a whisper from them, except by way of interjection. They refused to say ""yes"" or 'no."" r They preferred their usual course of running cunning; but have since confessed that the finances are not sound. have admitted that the Government have put in the political shop window a number of show goods, without being in a position to pay for them, and that if the Ministry carry out all the; proposals now before us, bankruptcy within the next few years will stare the Commonwealth in the face. They practically admit that the provision made for the payment of old-age pensions is insufficient; but we hear no clamour from the Labour Party, who have always sought to obtain an advertisement at the expense of the aged workers.",50
476,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"They £ 1 ,100,00 0 per annum will be sufficient.",51
477,Mr KELLY,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"But one of them said that is. 3d. per day was enough to pay a soldier ! We do not pay much attention to views expressed by individual members of the party, but I think that there is a general consensus of opinion amongst them that the provision made by the Treasurer for the payment of old-age pensions is insufficient.",51
478,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,They voted that it was sufficient.,51
479,Mr KELLY,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,Y e t I think that they now confess that it is insufficient.,51
480,Mr HALL,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"We say that no matter what Government is in power, Australia will be able to find sufficient money to keep its aged poor.",51
481,Mr KELLY,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"But the Labour Party, I think, now admit that if the Treasurer's estimate of the revenue to be received is correct, we shall not have enough to paj: old-age pensions. If the Prime Minister, with the assistance of his friends, were to pass all the measures that he now has before Parliament-if he succeeded in carrying his proposals in respect of defence, the transfer of the Northern Territory, the construction of a transcontinental railway, and a hundred-and-one other expensive projects, and began to try to find the money for them, there is more than an odd chance that the aged poor would have to wait, whilst honourable members of the Labour Party did a little more electioneering on their account. The Opposition placed clearly before the House the unsatisfactory position of our finances. The Labour Party, however, would not say that they were unsatisfactory. They preferred to vote that they were not, and to tryto shelter themselves behind some subterfuge or excuse at the next general election. The excuse advanced in this House by one They or two members of that party is about the most paltry that could be used. They said that they preferred to trust the Ministerial party, rather than to trust the Opposition. Honourable members in the direct Opposition do not desire any political association with that party, so that the Labour Party evidently fears that we might, unassisted, carry out our method of advancing the interests of Australiaa method of which they have expressed strong disapproval. They did not think that they were going to swop one instrument for another. They knew that if they say that gave up the control which they hold over this Government, they would have to stand' alone, and by refusing on the no-confidence motion to express a simple "" y e a "" or "" nay,"" they confessed to the people that they realized that they cannot stand alone, and that the most they can hope to do is to use some one else's brains to achieve their objects.",51
482,Mr JH CATTS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"Cook) [8.45] - We have had, during this debate, a repetitionof misrepresentations of the Labour Party, which sounds very like) the playing of an old' tune. Much the same criticism has been levelled against us again and again, and that to which we have listened during this debate is just as untrue as is that which has been indulged in on former occasions. The honourable member whohas just resumed his seat, referred to the Labour platform adopted at the recent Brisbane Conference, and in order that there may be no excuse for the Oppositionmisquoting our objective and platform, I intend to put before the Committee what that Conference evolved as a programme for the next Federal elections. It is all' very well for honourable members to attempt to attach to the party opinions expressed by individual contributors to Labour journals ; but the true expression of the Labour movement is to be found in the compromise arrived at between the different sections of opinion, some moderate, and some extreme,, voiced at the Conference, and embodied in the Labour objective, platform, and pledge.. These constitute the only basis upon which the Opposition are fairly entitled to criticise us.",51

484,Mr JH CATTS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"We do not squeal when any honourable member speaks the truth about us, but the Opposition have lived on the misrepresentation of our party. The Labour Party's policy is set forth in what may be described as four divisions. We have, in the first place, the labour objective; then we have the fighting platform, which crystallizes the general platform that follows, and finally the pledge. These are as followsa. The cultivation of an Australian sentiment, based upon the maintenance of racial purity, and the development in Australia of an enlightened and self-reliant community; b.

J. H. Catts. PLEDGE . I hereby pledge myself not to oppose the candidate selected by the recognised political Labour organization, and, if elected, to do my utmost to carry out the principles embodied in the Australian Labour Party's Platform and on all questions affecting the Platform to vote as a majority of the Parliamentary Party may decide at a duly constituted caucus meeting. OBJECTIVE. I for one most emphatically object and refuse to be bound by anything beyond those labour principles to which I have subscribed and my own opinions, no matter how able and reputable various quoted writers and speakers may be, nor how good or evil their views. In addition to this, another question of far-reaching importance was dealt with at the Conference, a question which, with the approach of the time when the operation of the Braddon section will expire, is likely to become one of the burning issues before the country. It will be necessary for the Commonwealth Parliament to arrive at some solution of the conflicting interests of the Commonwealth and States Governments with respect to the Federal revenue. Both the States and the Commonwealth Governments represent one and the same people, and whatever scheme will best, serve the people themselves should prevail. The present scheme is but temporary, and after 1910, the responsibility for the adjustment of Federal revenues will devolve upon the Commonwealth Parliament. Section 87 of the Constitution reads as followsDuring a period of ten years after the establishment of the Commonwealth and thereafter until the Parliament otherwise provides, of the net revenue of the Commonwealth from duties of Customs and of Excise not more than one-fourth shall be applied annually by the Commonwealth towards its expenditure. The balance shall, in accordance with this Constitution, be paid to the several States or applied towards the payment of interest on debts of the several States taken over by the Commonwealth. I wish to emphasize some very important words in section 87, namely, "" Until the Parliament otherwise provides."" They fix upon this Parliament the responsibility of determining the distribution of the Federal revenues after the expiration of this provision in 1910. In accordance with section 87, the States have received from ist January, 1901, to 30th January, 1908, £57,776,002. The three-fourths to which they were entitled under the Braddon section amounted to £51,601,929, so that they received £6,174,073 over and above the three-fourths to which they were entitled under the Braddon section, this amount being the unexpended portion of the one-fourth which the Commonwealth was entitled to expend. In other words, the Commonwealth did not expend its full one-fourth, but handed to the States its own unexpended balances.",51
485,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,We owed them half that amount in respect of interest on transferred properties.,53
486,Mr JH CATTS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"That is really a. bookkeeping mattei'. Another provision of the Constitution - section 85 - - enacts that the Commonwealth shall compensate the States for transferred properties by agreement, and, failing that, as the Federal Parliament may decide. One of the reasons why this question has not been dealt with is that the States have themselves valued these properties at from £""10,000,000 to £14,000,000, whilst the . Commonwealth, on the other hand, has valued them roughly at from £8,000,000 to £10,000,000. As no agreement had been arrived at, a Commission was appointed, consisting of a valuer, representing the Commonwealth, and valuers representing the States, to recommend a scheme for settlement. In today's papers, I notice a statement that that Commission considers that the amount payable"" in respect of transferred properties will be, roughly speaking, £8,500,000. justifies the refusal of the Commonwealth to accept the higher figures.",53
487,Mr HUME COOK,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,Not payable.,53
488,Mr JH CATTS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"I mean the amount of value fixed. The manner in which the payment is to take place is a matter to be afterwards decided. As the interest on these properties would be a charge against the revenues returnable to the States as part of the cost of maintenance of the transferred Departments, the settlement of the question is merely a bookkeeping matter. As 1910, the year of the expiry-of the Braddon section and the trial period provided in the Constitution, approaches, another difficulty-the transfer of the States debts to the Commonwealth-pre sents itself. Section 105 provides thatThe Parliament may take over from the their public debts as existing at the establishtake ment of the Commonwealth The financial scheme of the Constitution with respect to the allotment of the Commonwealth revenues, as provided in the Braddon section, no doubt contemplated that the final settlement of the questions of revenue returnable to the States and the transfer of the States debts should take place together. To re-quote the second portion of section 87The balance shall, in accordance with this Constitution, be paid to the several States, or applied towards the payment of interest on debts of the several States taken over by the Commonwealth.",53
489,Mr FRAZER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,A very wise'anticipation.,53
490,Mr JH CATTS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"I agree with the honourable member. The aggregate States debts on 30th June, 1907, which mature annually up to 1952, were as follow :Amount owing in London, £185,831,848; in Australia, £58,903,451. or a total of £244,735,299. Since then the debt has grown. On 30th June, 1908, the amount owing in London was £183,422,390, and in Australia £64,552,234, or a total of £247,974,624. I take the .figures for 1907 as they relate to the same year as the other latest figures I am using. The average percentage of the interest is 3.21, and the total interest bill on the 1907 basis amounts to over £8,750,000 annually. Incidentally I should like to state that the imports into Australia for 1907 were £51)809,033, whilst the exports were £72,824,247, or an excess of exports of £21,015,214. Deducting from the excess 6f exports the amount of interest payable on This the debts of the States, there is, roughly, a balance of £12,250,000 of excess of exports in value or kind. That amount has gone to some authority outside the Commonwealth, and there is no explanation on the face of it to show who has received it. I have no doubt that some of the money has gone to pay interest on some of the private debts owing by institutions in Australia to persons abroad. At the same time it is not reasonable to suppose that those debts are greater than the total public debt of Australia. It is, therefore, fair to assume that some millions of money are being drawn from Australia annually by persons outside as incomes in respect of properties held within the Commonwealth. I agree with the honourable member who said that it was a wise provision in the States Constitution that the Commonwealth should over the States debts. If this huge debt could be federalized and financed through a Commonwealth Government bank the immediate saving and the total wiping out of the debt in a comparatively few years would be an immense beneficial national undertaking. At the same time, it is one of those questions in which it is impossible to travel in advance of public opinion. It would be hardly worth the effort to relieve the States of this great debt incubus if they competed against the Commonwealth in raising loans and embarked on a further unrestricted excursion into the domain of borrowing. The States Governments have shown conclusively that they will absolutely refuse to be limited in any way in their policy of borrowing. In fact, they will not even agree to refrain from competing with the Commonwealth in the raising of loans. If the Commonwealth is to take over the huge debt of the States only to be met in the money market, when trying to wipe it off in a number of years, by the States Governments raising loans in competition with them, and if the States on being relieved of the debt are simply to continue with fresh enthusiasm in the direction of public borrowing, it appears to me that the great effort that would have to be put forward by the Commonwealth Administration and the great self denial which the Commonwealth Parliament would have to practice in order to relieve the people of this immense debt hanging round their necks would scarcely be worth the sacrifice. This attitude of the States Governments appears to render impracticable at present the transfer of the States debts to the Commonwealth, and consequently the question must await the time when an enlightened public opinion will show the States Governments their duty more clearly. We have therefore to determine upon some scheme for the division of the Customs and Excise revenues between the States and Commonwealth Governments upon a fair and equitable basis. This question was dealt with exhaustively by the recent triennial Labour Conference at Brisbane, at which the whole of the political labour organizations of the States were represented, sending the best brains of the movement, including parliamentary and lay members, to attack the great problems which face the people of Australia in the immediate future. Their scheme is as followsThat this Conference expresses its approval generally of the following scheme as the basis for an adjustment of the financial relations beExcise. tween the Commonwealth and the States :1. That the States should continue to receive a share of the Federal revenue. 2. That such annual share be paid to the States in the form of a fixed sum per head of Mr J. II. Catts. the population, such sum to be ascertained during or before the year 1910 on the basis shownin the fourth paragraph. 3. That the proportion of revenue allocate* to the Commonwealth must be sufficient tocover(a) All existing expenditure apart from reproductive services; (b) Old-age and Invalid Pensions throughout the Commonwealth; (c) An additional sum, not to exceed one million pounds, for the expanding: necessities of the Federal Government, such as the creation of the Federal Capital, railway undertakings, and the development of the Northern' Territory. 4. That the amount of the fixed payment per capita to be returned to the States be ascertained by(a) Taking the average total of the Customs and Excise revenue of five representative years before 1910; (4) Deducting therefrom the average total of Commonwealth expenditure, for the same representative years, under the three heads enumerated in the third' paragraph; (c) Dividing the amount so arrived at by the average number of the populationof Australia for the same representative years. 5. That in view of the exceptional position of Western Australia, a further capitation grant should be made to that State, to gradually diminish upon a sliding scale until its share of the Federal revenue coincides per capita with t h a f of the other States. Before proceeding to explain this scheme, it will be interesting to note the notices of motion tabled by the New South WalesState Premier on 2nd September last, covering the resolutions agreed to by the recent Premiers' Conference, which further agreed"" that those resolutions were to be submitted to the States Parliaments. The resolutions, containing the proposals of the StatesPremiers, are as follow(1) That in view of the fact that upon the State Parliaments devolves the duty of developing the resources of their respective States by means of land settlement, railway construction,, irrigation, and other public works, and that they are charged with the responsibility of* maintaining adequate education and charity systems, and providing for the administrationof justice and other services, the financial obligations connected with which will inevitably increase with the growth of population, no financial scheme can be assented to by the Stateswhich does not provide for their receiving (a) a fixed annual sum, and (J) a proportionate part of all increases in revenue from Customs and' (2) That for the purpose of enabling the Federal Government to initiate a general scheme of old-age pensions, the State Governments will be agreeable to accept a smaller proportion of the Customs and Excise revenue than three-fourths, and thus supplement, if necessary, the.amount which can be provided under the Commonwealth Surplus Revenue Bill . (3) That no restriction having been placed by the Constitution upon the borrowing powers of the States, and, further, for the reasons set out in Resolution No. 1, the States should be the sole' judges as to the raising of loans within - or without the Commonwealth for the purpose of carrying on the work of internal development without interference by the Council of Finance, as proposed in the scheme of the Commonwealth Treasurer, or by any external authority. (4) That the gradual assumption by the Commonwealth of the State debts may eventually lead to economies, but it would be advisable to allow the settlement of details to stand over until the question of the distribution of the net revenue from duties of Customs and Excise has been determined. (5) That in the distribution of the amount returnable by the Commonwealth to the States, the f er cafita contribution of each State to the - Customs and Excise revenue shall be considered - and allowed for. (6) That the proposal of the Commonwealth Treasurer to take over the sinking funds of the several States without making equitable provision for compensation is objectionable. (7) (a) That in the event of the Commonwealth taking over the debts .the total indebtedness of the respective States should be reduced by the sum of the value of the transferred properties (unless settlement for such properties be previously made), and that when the lighthouses, & c , are taken over by the Commonwealth, the State should be credited for them; (4) the States urge an early settlement of this long-standing question. Leaving out those clauses in the State Government resolutions referring to the Public Debt-thes e are to be allowed to - stand as at present, pending the adjustment of revenue returns, according to the Labour scheme-it is interesting to note that ""the principles of our party's scheme meets the State Governments' objections. Resolution 1, clauses a and b, of the State Governments, is met by paragraph 2 of the Labour scheme. Resolutions 3 and 4 of the State Governments are met by noninterference by the Labour scheme. Re'soItitiori 5 of the State Governments is met by paragraph 5 of the Labour scheme as relating to Western Australia, and as relating to Tasmania, by treating her the same as other States in the general scheme, thus - allowing Tasmania an equal return, although her Customs and Excise revenue is much less than that of other States. This concession is made because of the loss of Customs and Excise revenue by Tasmania. This is kno wn to exist, but cannot o be traced, because Tasmanians periodically travel to the other States, buy largely, - and take goods home as persona] effects. The State Governments should, therefore, support the general principles of the Labour scheme. Indeed, I should like it to be recorded that this scheme has already been brought under the notice ot Mr Waddell, the State Treasurer of New South Wales. The Sydney Morning Herald, of n t h July last, statesThe State Treasurer, Mr Waddell, finds himself in complete accord with the object of the Finance Committee of the Commonwealth Labour Conference on the subject of the transfer of the State debts to the Commonwealth. Mr Waddell did not express complete approval of the whole of the scheme, but some of its features commended themselves to him; and in the recognition that the present time is inopportune for taking over the States debts, for reasons previously given, the State Government of New South Wales, through their Treasurer, express complete accord witli the Labour scheme. I have made a calculation, with a view to explaining the Labour Party's financial proposal.",53
491,Mr MCWILLIAMS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,Not a bad scheme either.,55
492,Mr JH CATTS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"Then I hope that when the time comes, the honourable member will be found supporting it by his vote. The following calculation has been made as a means of explaining the scheme to honourable members. The figures are worked out on the basis of five years prior to 1910, as per clause a of paragraph 4. There will no doubt be differences of opinion as to the years upon which the calculation should be based. The years chosen, therefore, are only taken to serve as an example,' and may not be the period finally determined upon as the basis. Total Customs and Excise Collection, 5 years, not including WA.

This, however, need not be entered upon now. I know that the honourable member for South Sydney, whose calculations are regarded as having the weight of authority, estimates the amount returnable at 23s. per head. I do not know how that figure is arrived at, but I find that over the five years I. have taken, it amounts, roughly speaking, to £1 os. 9d.

Taking the figures I have stated under the Labour scheme, and on the basis of population for 1906, New South Wales would receive There £1,531,467. Even without allowing for cost of administration of Customs Department, this is only about £ 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 short as compared with 1901, but to make up for this, the Federation has taken over expensive non-paying Departments, such as the Defence, the cost of Customs administration, the loss on the Postal Department, and must also take over shortly quarantine and lighthouses. Besides all this, there are other great national responsibilities placed in the keeping of the Federal Parliament which have to be provided for. I would emphasize again the fact that the period taken as the basis for calculation is only for illustration purposes, and in no wise can it be connected with the party's scheme. As a matter of fact, Mr Watson thinks the - per capita amount returnable to the States will be about £ 1 3s. per head. This would mean the return of about £5,000,000 to the Spates annually. on The honourable member for North Sydney, by a different process of reasoning, in the another Daily Telegraph, fixes upon £ 5 , 2 5 0 , 0 0 0 as the returnable amount. This would mean a great deal, indeed, to the States. I trust honourable members will carefully preserve this scheme for future reference, as the financial question promises to be one of the burning issues of the next Federal election. I should like to emphasize the fact that in New South Wales we have a Government composed of the remnants of the old free trade party. Those persons who go about telling the people that they do not believe in using the Customs House for revenue purposes, at the same time base the whole of their financial complaints and clamour against the Commonwealth on the basis that enough money is not returned to them from the Customs and Excise revenue, and they would compel the Federal Government to impose the heaviest of revenue duties on the necessaries of life of the working people.",55
493,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"And the honourable member does their bidding. Mr J. H , CATTS - The honourable member, as usual, misrepresents me.",57
494,Mr HENRY WILLIS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,That is a very improper remark.,57
495,Mr JH CATTS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"The honourable member must remember that I have stated time after time that I would not vote for venue duties and I have not done so. Had not honourable members of the Opposition come to the rescue of the Government by supporting revenue duties, the working man would be paying much less taxation than has been imposed on him. I voted for protective duties to save our workmen from cheap coloured labour competition on the new protection basis, but never for revenue duties. Revenue should be obtained by direct taxation.",57
496,Mr HEDGES,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,The honourable member voted against increased piano duties.,57
497,Mr JH CATTS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"In doing so I voted for a sufficient duty to protect and encourage the piano-making industry, and that action has been justified by the recent opening of a new factory at Richmond, to which honourable members were invited. The period on which I have based by calculations was fixed upon merely for purposes of illustration, and the years chosen must not be regarded as endorsed by the Labour Party, because other honourable members may think that another period should be taken. The honourable member for South Sydney, as I have already pointed out, believes that, on a per capita basis, about £ 1 3s. will be returnable to the States, [62] and one of the ablest members of the Opposition, the honourable member for North Sydney, has arrived at the conclusion that a fair thing would be about £ 1 5s. per head.",57
498,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,No . I said that the States are practically entitled to between £ 1 5s. 6d. and £ 1 7s. per head.,57
499,Mr JH CATTS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"The honourable member showed that about £5,220,000 would be annually returnable. That amount is equivalent to about 25s. per head. I have his scheme here in .the Daily Telegraph, if it is necessary to quote it. As the settlement of this question is to - be made an issue at the forthcoming Federal elections, I hope that every elector, man and woman, will give it the closest attention, so that the interests of Australia may be intelligently dealt with, and we may in the future, for some years, at any rate, have peace in regard to a matter which, in the past, has caused considerable disturbance.",57
500,Mr ARCHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"Capricornia) [9-31];I am not in the habit of occupying much of the time of the House or this Committee, and shall not do so now. But on an occasion like this it is redue to oneself, and to one's constituents, to explain his position in regard to the various matters brought forward for discussion. It seems .to me that I and others who supported the motion of no confidence would have only to refer to the speeches since delivered by many of those who voted against it if we felt that we need to justify our attitude. Almost every speech since delivered from the other side of the House has condemned the Government for its management of the finances. Some honourable members, like the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, have been very severe, and others have been milder in their criticisms; but the tone of the Committee shows that we do not clearly know whither we are drifting, and that there is a general fear that the ship of state is leaving the deep water of solvency for the shallow waters of very risky finance. The criticism of the leader of the Opposition was fully justified. H*a did not charge Ministers with extrajvagance, but he laid bare the inevitable results of their policy, so far as the finances must be affected by it. He pointed out that no proper provision is made in this year's Estimates for their various commitments. _,It would be wearisome to the Committee were I again ,to go into all the details connected with this subject; but it is very plain that no proper financial provision bas been made for the proposals directly enunciated or foreshadowed in the Government policy. The honourable member for Flinders has shown that, at the beginning of the next financial year, we must have a deficit of about £1,500,000, assuming the Treasurer's figures to be correct, the estimates of revenue being £6,500,000 and the probable expenditure about £8,000,000. is impossible to get any explanation from the Treasurer, who makes no answer to these criticisms, and is apparently satisfied to drift along until he bumps against something solid. The action of the leader of the Opposition was amply justified. We do not expect, or particularly desire, to shift the Government at present; but his motion had the effect of sharply calling attention to the state of the finances. It is not to be wondered at that those responsible for the development of the States, especially where there are vast unsettled coastal territories, as there are in Queensland and Victoria, are exceedingly uncertain as to the future. The public is only just waking up to the value of much of our land, and within the next few years there will be a great increase in settlement, which will necessitate a great increase in expenditure. The Governments of the States are charged with the work of development, and they realise that, after 1910, they will be absolutely in the hands of the Commonwealth. No' doubt when the time comes this Parliament, realizing that it, like the Parliaments of the States, is responsible to the people of the States, will agree to a reasonable solution of the difficulty. A great deal has been said about the aggressive attitude of the States, and the manner in which they growl and whine. New South Wales is practically the only State whose revenues have benefited greatlv from Federation.",57
501,Mr KELLY,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,The money returned to the State Treasury has been taken people of the State.,58
502,Mr ARCHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"Yes ; but I am looking at the matter from the point of view of the necessities of the States Governments. In the first year following Federation, ferred to him. Queensland suffered a loss of revenue amounting to £500,000, and although she has, in the last seven years, received money over and above her proportion of the three-fourths of the Customs and Exknow cise revenue, her receipts last year were £71,000 behind what they were prior to Federation. This year she has just about made up the deficiency of her three-fourths share.",58
503,Mr FISHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,It must not be forgotten that the State has received all the money to which it has been entitled.,58
504,Mr ARCHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"I am not now dealing with that, but am replying to the taunts that the State Governments It are too restive, and am showing that it is not fair to instance the position of the New South Wales Treasury by way of illustrating the benefits of Federation. New South Wales is not the only State concerned. The aggressive attitude adopted by the Commonwealth authorities towards the States has given rise to ah uneasy feeling on their part. No doubt I shall be told that aggressiveness was first shown by the States themselves.",58
505,Mr MATHEWS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,Exactly .,58
506,Mr ARCHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"That belief is due to the fact that many honourable members, and particularly the representatives of Victoria, can see only one other State in the Federation and that is New South Wales. That State stands out in all their quarrels and battles. We sav, however, that no State is more sincerely Federal than is Queensland.  now.",58
507,Mr ARCHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,I know from personal conversation with him that he is a sincere Federalist.,58
508,Mr FISHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,A Rockhampton one.,58
509,Mr ARCHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,He entirely agrees that Federation was absolutely necessary for Australia.,58
510,Mr FISHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"He spoke and voted against it. But Mr ARCHER - I am speaking of what is within my own knowledge and of what has happened since I have been a member of this Parliament. I repeat that Mr. Kidston is now, at all events, a sincere Federalist and admits the necessity for a from the Federal Parliament.  not Kidston, carried Federation.",58
511,Mr ARCHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,I did not mention Mr. Kidston until the honourable member re,58
512,Mr ARCHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"I do not suggest that the honourable member is. The people of Queensland are Federal in spirit, but I that many of them feel that there is a distinct inclination on the part of a certain set of politicians not confined to the Labour Party to try to acquire, at the expense of the States, greater powers for the Federal Parliament. That, perhaps, is a natural inclination; but those who realise, as we do in Queensland, the absolute necessity of the States controlling their own local development recognise that it must be combated. The Federal power has taken up in many cases a distinctly aggressive attitude towards the States.",58
513,Mr MATHEWS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,Giv e one instance of aggressiveness on the part of the Commonwealth.,59
514,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,There is no longer an inclination but a conviction on the part of honourable members on the other side of the House that the Federal Parliament should acquire more power at the expense of the States.,59
515,Mr ARCHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"There is a distinct inclination to go beyond the Constitution and to throw upon the States Governments the onus of appealing . to the High Court to determine whether we have exceeded our powers. I heard today a member of the Labour Party blaming the States Governments for having put the Commonwealth to the expense of defending proceedings in the High Court to determine the constitutionality of the Surplus Revenue Act. When the High Court determines that the Commonwealth has exceeded its power in passing any measure honourable members of the Labour Party criticise St severely, and hint at political bias on the part of the members of the High Court Bench. That is the attitude they usually take up when a decision is given against them. The honourable member for West Sydney, and some other members of the Labour Partv, have been declaring in New South Wales, that Parliament makes the laws and not the High Court, and that it is time that the Court ceased to rule the people. That tribunal is the only security to which the people, as electors of the States, can look to preserve their power to govern themselves and to control their own local affairs.  better not tell the people that at the next general election; if he does they will "" blow, him out.""",59
516,Mr ARCHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"They do not need to be told that the High Court is their only protection as electors of the States Parliaments. I was asked by the honourable mem[62]- 2 ber for Melbourne Ports to give an instance where the Commonwealth had taken up an aggressive attitude towards the States. I think that a case in point is to be found in the way in which it is proposed to bring the Commonwealth system of old-age pensions into operation. At the present time Queensland, and several other States, have their own systems in force, and yet the Commonwealth Government are calmlv appropriating revenue-whic h would go to the States-to provide in the future for a Federal system.",59
517,Mr TUDOR,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,The honourable member believes in old-age pensions?,59
518,Mr ARCHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"Certainly . The people of Queensland are today providing for a local system of old-age pensions, and at the same time they are being called upon to contribute to a fund to provide for a Federal scheme to come into operation nearly twelve months hence. That is obviously unjustifiable. If contributions towards a fund to provide for a Federal system in 1909 have to be spread over more than one year, how are we to get on when the total sum required for the payment of those pensions has to be found each year ?",59
519,Mr FISHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,If the people contribute a little now they will have to find less later on.,59
520,Mr ARCHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,But why should they pay now?,59
521,Mr FISHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"Because we are endeavouring under a Commonwealth system tp provide a pension for all the aged poor, whereas that is impossible under the State laws.",59
522,Mr ARCHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,I agree that that is the great justification for a Federal system.,59
523,Mr JOSEPH COOK,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,But some effort ought to have been made to come to an arrangement in the States.,59
524,Mr ARCHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"That is the point I set out to make; that the action of the Commonwealth has been aggressive, and that no effort has been made to meet the States in an amicable way. There has been no effort: on the part of the Commonwealth Government to discuss these matters with the States Governments as ordinary business men would do. If , after such an attempt had been made, an arrangement could not be arrived at, and the Commonwealth Parliament felt that it must have the power to provide for any particular function it has not at present, the matter could be referred to the people.",59
525,Mr FISHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,What is to prevent States Treasurers making an agreement with the Commonwealth Government at the present time?,60
526,Mr ARCHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"It is not for them to come to the Commonwealth Government. It is for the Commonwealth Parliament, which is seeking to obtain further power, take the first step towards arriving at an amicable arrangement.  1 iament ?",60
527,Mr ARCHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"It is; but, unfortunately, many honourable members of the Labour Party, and several supporters of the Government, seem to entertain the belief that the Commonwealth Parliament is the paramount power in the political life of Australia. ",60
528,Mr ARCHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"That was not the intention of the people when they voted for Federation. The Federal Parliament was created by the States to carry out certain specific functions, and it is not the paramount power in the political life of Australia. Some honourable members undoubtedly favour unification, but the honourable member for Herbert is the only cne who, to my knowledge, has openly declared himself, in this House, in favour of it. While a number of others obviously believe in unification, they are not prepared to come into the open and to make such a declaration.",60
529,Mr FISHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,Nam e them. That is an insinuation.,60
530,Mr ARCHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"I am judging them by their own speeches in this House. I cannot name them, but the honourable member must know, as well as I do, that there are such members.",60
531,Mr FISHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,I do not.,60
532,Mr ARCHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"In the course of a personal explanation last week, the Prime Minister was at pains to explain away a statement attributed to him with regard to the Labour Party being a. machine. I refer to this matter only because it is a live political question.",60
533,Mr TUDOR,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,Our machine is geared right up to date.,60
534,Mr ARCHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,There is no doubt that the Political Labour Leagues keep it geared up to the highest pitch. The Prime Minister was at pains to explain that when he spoke of the Labour Party as a machine he was not referring to the individual members of that party in this House. the Mr DEAKIN - I did not explain it ; I simply read the words I used at the time.,60
535,Mr ARCHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"Exactly . The honourable member first of all spoke of the party as a political machine. He then pointed out that he did not refer to honourable members of this House; that his personal reto lations with the members of the Labour Party in Parliament had always been of a pleasant character, and that he found it easy to work with them. There can be no doubt that our personal relations with the members of the party are of a pleasant character. Honourable members in the Labour corner and I are the best of friends. We enjoy one another's society, and I do not think that there is the slightest feeling between us. We can work together, so far as many political and social objects are concerned; but, at the same time, it appeared to me that the explanation made by the Prime Minister did not fill the bill. If the Labour organization outside this House is the machine, the members of the Labour Party in this House are machine-controlled. Mr KI NG O'MALLEY - We are running the machine.",60
536,Mr ARCHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"We know that that is not so. Those who run the machine very often are not in politics. The fact that honourable members of the Labour Party are dependent on men who are not in politics^-me n of various shades of political thought, some of them out - and - out Socialists and some of them leaders of political unions-show s that they are controlled by the machine outside. Honourable members of the Labour Party would not be here unless they secured the nomination of the Political Labour . Leagues. I fail to see how we can dissociate the members of the party in this Parliament from the hard-and-fast organization which controls them outside. As to the remark made by the Prime Minister that he could work politically with the members of the party in the House, although he could not work with the terrible machine outside, it seems to me that the connection between the party and the machine was well illustrated in Queensland a few days ago. I notice that when a proposal was made to the Queensland Labour Party to enter into a coalition, the offer was handed in writing to their leader, Mr Bowman, and the answer came back, not from him  ment. It is not true.",60
537,Mr ARCHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,I admit that it is Mr. Kidston's statement; but I see no reason to - disbelieve it I have seen no denial of it by Mr Bowman or anybody else. ,61
538,Mr ARCHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"Does the honourable member assert that it is not a fact that the answer to that offer came back from the Central Political League, or whatever they call it- a small political ring that runs the Labour Party-and not from the leader of the Party ? Can he deny that of his own knowledge? Until it is denied, and it has - been given out for some time, one is justified in assuming it to be a fact.",61
539,Mr TUDOR,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,Mr Kidston stated in Melbourne that the leader of the Federal Labour Party had advised Mr Bowman to work hand-in-hand with him.,61
540,Mr FISHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,It is absolutely untrue. I can tell the honourable member that there is no power in any organization that can in any way control Labour members in Parliament in any circumstances whatever.,61
541,Mr ARCHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,Does the honourable member mean to tell me that if his party were offered portfolios in the present Government they could accept the offer!',61
542,Mr FISHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,Yes .,61
543,Mr ARCHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,Without hesitation?,61
544,Mr FISHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,Yes .,61
545,Mr ARCHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,Would he be game to do it?,61
546,Mr FISHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,Do not be insulting.,61
547,Mr ARCHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"I do not mean word ""game"" in any insulting sense. Is 3t not a fact that the organizations outside have decreed that the Labour Party shall not take any seat in a Government in which they are not in a majority?",61
548,Mr FISHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,Not in the Federal Parliain ment.,61
549,Mr ARCHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,I understand that the recent Labour Conference in Brisbane clared against any such thing.  ances.,61
550,Mr ARCHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,There could not be a stronger alliance than to go into a Cabinet. Would not the fact that the Conference that controls the party outside the House has declared against alliances block the honourable member?  from making an alliance today.,61
551,Mr ARCHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,Not even that resoluis tion ?  ment.,61
552,Mr ARCHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"I used the word ""game"" in the same way as the word "" hands "" was used the other day. That roused the honourable member's ire also, but it was not intended to be insulting. In the face of the resolution by the outside organization controlling the party that alliances should not be entered into, would the leader of the party be prepared to agree to an alliance? Mr - HUTCHISON - We could if we liked.",61
553,Mr ARCHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,What about the political future of honourable members if they did it?,61
554,Mr HUTCHISON,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,It would not affect us.,61
555,Mr FISHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,The platform drawn up at the present time has no effect at all in the present Parliament.,61
556,Mr ARCHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"At the same time, I may take it that the members of the party in the House, knowing that such a course of action would be very much disapproved of outside, would not feel disposed to take the course I suggested. The actions and policy of members of the party in this House are directed and controlled to a large degree by an organization outside, which is not responsibleto the people.",61
557,Mr HUTCHISON,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"The honourable member should not say that, because it is not so.",61
558,Mr ARCHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,The moral control is there.,61
559,Mr HUTCHISON,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,There is no control the whatever in any shape or form..,61
560,Mr ARCHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"I understand that it is quite within the power of the Labour members to go against the resolutions of that outside body, but it would mean political suicide for them if they did. I know that Queensland men who have gone against the decrees of the Labour Party are politically dead.",61
561,Mr HUTCHISON,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,Will the honourable demember admit now that he is wrong ?,61
562,Mr ARCHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"I cannot admit it. I that the control is still there, although it is quite open to the honourable member to break away from it if he likes. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie addressed himself at considerable length the other day to the question of Socialism, and I interjected that the Socialism which was spoken of in politics here was a political It is not exactly the theory of Socialism that.is meant, and anti-Socialism simply another political term. The term "" Socialism"" that we use refers to the of the Labour Party in favour of nationalization. I notice that when we criticise the members of the Labour Party as Socialists, we have to explain what we mean. It is rather an inexpressive word, for the whole matter is wrapped up in the idea of nationalization. We on this side, maintain that to carry the idea of nationalizing all the means of production, distribution, and exchange, to its logical conclusion, would absolutely entail the controlling and limiting of the freedom of every man. woman, and child in the country.",61
563,Mr HUTCHISON,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,We do that,62
564,Mr ARCHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"Not absolutely; but only in certain directions for their own good. To get the proper perspective in considering these industrial questions, we have to go back a long way, and consider them from the historical point of view. We must trace the way in which our industrial and economic life has gradually evolved, from first of all a state of extreme Socialism in far-back ages, and then a state of extreme license of individualism, while now we are gradually working back into a system involving limited control. According to our arguments, the Socialism which the Labour Party advocate in the nationalization of all the means of production, distribution, and exchange, means - really complete and entire Collectivism. It will leave no room for individual initiative and enterprise. If the State carries on all the vast, intricate, and complex functions of industrialism and commercialism, it must utterly wipe out the very characteristics of healthy mankind--""the initiative, energy and enterprise which have built up our civilization.  member account for the action of the banks in rjoing to the Government for assistance when they failed in 1893?",62
565,Mr ARCHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"I shall deal with that presently. If Government control is Socialism, we are all Socialists to some extent; but where we differ from the members of the Labour Party is that they are going to extremes. They go to such extremes that one feels that they will check the building up of character, and that we must d r if t back to a low grade of civilization. Each proposal, however, must be judged on its own merits. I can imagine that as time goes on the State may have to undertake different commercial enterprises. But that policy will only be justified by the fact that we have proved from experience that we cannot control them otherwise. There is no doubt that individualism isopen to gross abuses. It puts vast power,, through the aggregation of capital, into the hands of a very few, who may use their opportunities for the oppression and starving of numbers of people. But when it has been proved that we cannot take away the power of evil from these people without nationalizing the industries, then, and then' only, shall we be justified in going to theextreme of taking them over.",62
566,Mr MCDOUGALL,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,Is not that exactly now. what the Labour Party proposes to clo?,62
567,Mr ARCHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"No . The Labour Party admits straight out that it advocates the nationalization of monopolies, simply because they are monopolies, and not because they have been proved to be harmful. The only difference between the Federal objective and the State objective is that in the latter complete nationalization is honestly advocated, whereas In the former there is a vague statement about the equal distribution of wealth, and all that sort of thing, which admits of any interpretation one likes to put upon it . The leaders; of the party in the country have told usplainly that they are simply going forward step by step. But there is no doubt they will be forced forward at a faster rate by the organizations outside Parliament. I was very glad to learn that provision is to be made for the establishment of anagricultural bureau. In the first speech I made when I became a member of this House, I pointed out what an excellent thing it would be to have an agricultural' bureau, and went into particulars, and further indicated that I hoped this would' be the first branch of a Department of theInterior, which would lay itself out to assist and advance every branch of industry, and' especially the primary industries. I wishalso to refer to a remark made by the Prime Minister in his recent speech. He said that he could not work in any degree with honourable members on this side of the House, who were reactionaries, and so onAs a comparatively new member, I claim to be just as liberal as the Prime Minister himself, and as many of those who support him.",62
568,Mr DEAKIN,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,My argument was that there was no unifying principle on thatside.,62
569,Mr ARCHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"Where is the unifyingprinciple on the Ministerial side of the House? The very reason why many of us sit on the Opposition side is that we cannot see any principle uniting the Ministerial and .'Labour parties. It seems tb us that the - fundamental principles are not so evident as the fundamental differences between the Prime Minister and those who keep him in office. But we have proved by our votes that we are prepared to support many of the proposals of the Government. have criticised the details of their projects, and have not approved of certain methods by which results were desired to be obtained, but otherwise we have supported tbem. I may mention the Australian In dustries Preservation Act, which we criticised in detail, and which is showing signs of breaking down. We objected to the power proposed to be placed in the hands of an oflicer under political control. likewise objected to the idea that any' man may lay .a written information against any person or corporation without responsibility, and that a political officer without legal knowledge or experience in the weighing of evidence may launch a case against in dividuals.",62
570,Mr GROOM,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,I am afraid that the honourable member has not read the Act recently.,63
571,Mr ARCHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"Perhaps I have not Te-id it lately. But I ask the Attorney""General whether f t is not a fact that under the Act the Comptroller of Customs can take action in regard to demanding information ana the exposure of the affairs of a company at the instance of any individual whom it is impossible to challenge.",63
572,Mr GROOM,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,That is only one step.,63
573,Mr ARCHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"We criticised the"" Government in regard to such details as that.",63
574,Mr GROOM,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,The honourable member admits the necessity of having an investigatory power ?,63
575,Mr ARCHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"The Government have received support from the majority of honourable members on this side of the House, - who have only criticised their measures in - detail. Most of us would probably have done the same had we been sitting-behind the Government.  Commandments that he would approve of them if the "" nots "" were taken out ",63
576,Mr ARCHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,I deny that the Prime Minister and his party are alone representative of the democratic sentiment of this House. The honourable gentlemam has - made no effort to bring about any other state of affairs than that existing. He has taken no. step to bring together the Liberal forces. ,63
577,Mr ARCHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,Everywher e except in the Labour corner.,63
578,The CHAIRMAN,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,I must ask the honourable member for Maranoa to cease these interjections.,63
579,Mr ARCHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"I ara obliged to him, We because I am afraid that my remarks are dry, although I felt bound to make them. The honourable member has introduced a little amusement into the proceedings. As far as I know, the Prime Minister has never endeavoured to come to an understanding with the Liberal members of the House. From the little experience I have had here, I should say that there must be some personal feeling that grew up before We I became - a member of Parliament that is keeping the Liberal forces apart.  I desire to know whether the honourable member is in order in now holding out the olive branch to the Prime Minister after endeavouring to politically tomahawk him last week?",63
580,The CHAIRMAN,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,I would point out that the honourable member for Maranoa is distinctly out of order in interrupting the speech of the honourable member for Capricornia.,63
581,Mr ARCHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"I think that the honourable member for Maranoa is merely forecasting the time when the Prime Minister will seek his support with a political club. I cannot see that the Prime Minister is justified in declaring that progressive ideas are held only by honourable members upon the other side of the House. At any rate, he has never attempted to bring about a union of the progressive forces in this Chamber.",63
582,Mr WILKS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,Let us all march over to the Government side of the House.,63
583,Mr ARCHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"I shall never do that. Whatever action may be taken to unite the progressive forces in this Chamber, must be initiated by the other side. Before concluding my remarks I wish to say a few words in regard to immigration. We are persistently told that in Australia there is no'land available for immigrants. In refutation of that statement. I wish to quote a few figures which show the area which was taken up in Queensland during the week ended 24th October-no t an exceptional week by any means. The return from which I am about to quote shows that during that week there were two grazing selections comprising 20,000 acres, 48 agricultural selections embracing 16,138 acres, and' 33 prickly pear selections containing 52,720 acres, taken up, or a total of 88,858 acres. It is therefore farcical to urge, as members of the Labour Party frequently Oo, that there is no land available for settlement in Australia.",63
584,Mr MATHEWS,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"Onl y last year Queensland lost 9,000 more by departures than she gained by arrivals.",64
585,Mr ARCHER,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"I arn satisfied that Queensland has not lost population, although I believe that Victoria has. Not long ago I quoted certain figures in this House which showed that the former State was gaining population at a considerable rate, and I feel certain that if the statement of the honourable member be true, the exodus which she is now suffering is merely a temporary one. Possibly it is due to the return to the other States of a large number of workers who annually visit Queensland in connection with the sugar harvest., I thank the Committee for the patient hearing which has been accorded me. Progress reported. ADJOURNMENT. DEFENCE' BILL-NAVA L SCHEME. Motion (by Mr DEAKIN) proposed - That the House do now adjourn. Sir JOHN QUICK.(Bendigo) [10.25] I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether he can indicate when it is likely that the debate on the second reading of the Defence Bill will be resumed - this week, next, or ever during this session. I should also like to ask the honourable gentleman if he is in a position to indicate the views and policy of the Government in regard to the proposed scheme of naval defence, which, is not incorporated in the Bill before the House. It issomewhat difficult to debate the defence question, and confine ourselves solely to the military branch, and, therefore, it is' most desirable that the Government should indicate in some way what their proposals are in regard fo naval defence-whethe r or not they intend to carry out the scheme submitted to the Admiralty, and commented on in the recent despatch. It would greatly conduce to a free, full, comprehensive, and satisfactory debate if . we could deal with both branches of the question instead of being limited to military defence, and in the dark as to the Government policy on the naval aspect.",64
586,Mr DEAKIN,COST OF ERICSSON TELEPHON E,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [10.26]--As soon as the debate on the Budget closes, we shall ask the House to pass the Works and Buildings Estimates-whic b are not a lengthy part of the Estimates-in order that the works may be rjut in hand at once. The desire is then to send the Manufactures Encouragement Bill to another place, and to resume the discussion on the Defence Bill. I remind the honourable and learned membeT that an amendment has already been moved on the Defence Bill, which indirectly raises the question of naval defence, and in the course of the discussion an indication of the view of the Government on naval defence will naturally be given. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.27 P- m",64
