The fact electorates of both government members and Australians will not receive an income tax cut. I estimate that almost 90 per cent of income of an income tax cut, and I think that is comparable out of the capital cities, you find that that day, when the opposition leader asked questions clear that, in many seats held by The Nationals, income tax cuts increases. It is a sad day when large in total but so narrow in It is a too-clever-by-half budget. This was he and the Prime Minister see as a certain purely to win the next election. They are narrowly perceived by the government and their pollsters ever, what it has done to the electorate of Burke of PAYE income earners will be left with nothing cuts.

What we are aware of is that benefit have an average debt of over $800-I one-third of recipients will in fact not only also will still be in debt after that first amount vide some relief but the view of the Labor Party good policy. This is a two-part bribe by the government: Minister, on your way to the ballot box. That the Prime Minister and the Treasurer: to try tion. We recall vividly how much fiscal and prior to the 2001 election, when the Prime selves out of trouble. We see again this spike eral election. What will occur in the event is that they will find ways to claw back and rise to speak on that Appropriation This budget handed down on 12 May this year The budget will expend $52 billion, but some of nothing. The budget targets income earners on over, but it provides no income tax cut is that in my electorate-and I am sure in most opposition members-well over the majority of earners in my electorate will not be in receipt to most electorates. In fact, once you get proportion grows. As we heard in question time toof the government in relation to this, it is the proportion of Australians not in receipt of a Treasurer can hand down a budget that is so its application to beneficiaries. an attempt by the Treasurer to niche target what demographic in marginal seats. This was designed targeted income tax cuts for those who are to be swinging voters in marginal seats. Howis to ensure that, as I said, almost 90 per cent in their pocket in relation to income tax the family tax benefit. I welcome the fact that tax benefit for families with children. It is certo those who are struggling to make ends in their daily lives. But the fact is that not all receive the second instalment. We hear the $600 to be paid before 30 June this year. But we who have complained about the system which the Commonwealth because of the way in which up to one-third of recipients of the family tax think it is closer to $900. So in other words, not receive the second instalment to be paid but is taken from their debt. It certainly will proand of other commentators is that this is not a pick up your $600 cheque, signed by the Prime is the intention.

While the Treasurer likes to boast about the to fewer than 10 per cent of income earners. we see that many will not be in receipt of the the huge largesse that has been expended by ets of the majority of Australians. Indeed, under the Prime Minister's description that ther and mother and probably a dog and a picket be in receipt of any income tax cut or other I know many occupational groups and many will not receive a cent. They do not have children, that is more important in relation to this country. But they will not be in receipt of any carers and child-care workers will not be in budget. The Treasurer has been too tricky about Prime Minister have gone into a room-it asked, ‘How do we target a group that will get community has seen this for what it really is: ernment. We should not be too surprised. When I was should not be a surprise because, in philosophical is no point feigning surprise when you see that of the income scale. Of course, the Liberal Party Party to look after those at the higher income come ends. So I am not particularly surprised; effort to look after the majority of Australians. It is also in accordance with Liberal government schools greater increases in real pendent schools. This has been a trend now for the old school tie applies to everyone, I suppose, Minister applied the old school tie he might one of the very few people on the front-bench does not seem to return and visit there often, if at all. The fact is that this government has been government schools like King's College, Geelong lic schools in my electorate and very needy creases.

The Catholic school system is one of centralised, given the way in which the system commentators-that this is the highterms of proportion of GDP, the Commonwealth, means, has in fact imposed a greater tax burden history. That is not going to change if there is income tax cuts, we see that they are confined Indeed, when it comes to the family tax benefit second instalment.

The fact is that we are aware that except for the Prime Minister.

They have fantastic teachers and of meeting many of them-that is, both teachers dents. What those students want is the same and the surrounding suburbs in western Melbourne kids in the leafier suburbs of Melbourne They want the same opportunity and they are not the inequity in funding. Again, I am not surprised-it is in keeping cent times, to look after the better off at the disappointing to see a government in this day equitably in our future. One of the best ways provide them with opportunities. That has not uity, no sense of egalitarianism and no fair Minister in relation to this budget. The other concern I have is that, whilst followed Labor and decided to have some form women who have children and to provide some we do not accept that the up-front payment is for those mothers. We believe that it is an inferior by the Leader of the Opposition and others. There are some grave concerns. Looking at the there has been not only a failure by the government to really target those things that are most needed. the area of dental care that has been put posed to the opposition's proposal. The fact gram to look after those in need-not when their that it is an emergency situation. What we lion-plus proposal that will cater for people People who have already pitched in-people decades-should be the recipients of a decent people in particular in my electorate who cannot clearly infected.

But it is and age failing to realise that we need to invest to do that is to invest in our young people and been shown. There has been no vision, no eqgo being exhibited by the Treasurer or the Prime I think that is a major concern. it is good in some senses that the government has of maternity payment, as it likes to call it, to relief so that they can care for their children, the most sensible approach to providing relief approach to the one that has been outlined other side of the ledger, it is fair to say that in the broader package but also a failure For example, look at the lousy proposal in forward by the Commonwealth government as opis that we now need a comprehensive dental proteeth and gums are so badly in need of care need and what Labor is proposing is a $300 milin need, particularly the elderly in our community. who have contributed to this country for many dental care scheme. It is tragic to see elderly get care for their teeth and gums that are not being addressed by the government. It will be on health. More money is being spent on spent on dental care. Over $100 million will be make Goebbels blush. Instead, that money indeed on targeting the problems of declining has been on the record wanting to destroy NA Medicare. He clearly knows that it is so popular so he wants it to wither on the vine. He wants him. By comparison it is an inferior policy about dividing up the system into two classes: It is an inferior system for those who cannot afford it. Again, like the dental care proposal, the look after infants. We know it is a lot of money is even a question mark over how many infant ease. But I could not fathom the minister for 20, 10 or 35. The fact is that one death is those deaths, we should be expending in that shadow minister for health have rightly targeted more tragic deaths. In relation to health and education the problem listens to the pollsters about demographics and it does not listen to the people. The difference to a town hall is quite obvious: we know that Latham is speaking; there is no-one stopping open-door policy when it comes to speaking Australia. We do not see that with the Prime Minister. By comparison, we see a Prime Minister occasion in Melbourne recently-I think woman whose name happened to be Latham tionship whatsoever with the Leader of the she was a Liberal Party voter, from what I she might cause a commotion. That is the difference erates and the way the Leader of the Opposition behaviour is that, as we are listening to the ister and Treasurer are focusing on pollsters. the Opposition and the Prime Minister, The last thing I wanted to touch on-I have times, because there was a tax bill that went Treasurer himself.
