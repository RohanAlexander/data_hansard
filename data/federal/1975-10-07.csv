(3) That a plan for such a Fund was submitted to the gentleman I Treasury in October, 1974. (4) That no sound reasons for the establishment of an Australian Government Insurance Office (other than the desire to provide non-commercial disaster insurance and Australian Government competition with private enterprise) have been given by the Government. (5) That there is already intense competition between the exisung 45 life assurance offices and between over 260 general insurance companies now operating in Australia and PETITIONS that further competition from a Government Office would lodged for only be harmful at this time.

Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House will request the Government to take no further measures which will make home ownership unattractive to those who have a home and unachievable for those who have not.

Television: Pornographic Material To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully show: Income Tax That we are greatly concerned about the deterioration in quaUty of television programming in Australia and that the use of unseemly language, taking the name of the Lord in vain, and the undue emphasis given to sex, violence and crime is offensive to us. That our primary concern is for the dignity of mankind and is which we feel is being lowered by such unrestrained exposure to family groups of material that is in bad taste. That we commend the recent censoring of a television personality in Melbourne. That we encourage the use of informative and entertaining material which will maintain our language at a standard of decency and we oppose any easing of present restrictions.

Post Offices To the honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfuUy showeth: (1) That the proposal to downgrade the Post Office at Warkton, New South Wales represents a slight on the Warkton community, and (2) That the downgrading of the Post Office at Warkton, New South Wales would possibly lead to reduction in services offered and would probably lead to a deterioration of the service standard. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House request the Postal Commission not to downgrade the Warkton Post Office, New South Wales. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Hunt. Petition received. Pensions and Telephone Concessions for To the Honourable the Speaker of the House ofRepresentatives and Members of the House Uament assembled the Petition Australia respectfully showeth: That the decisions of the Australian Government: (a) To depart from its 1972 election promise that pensions would be related to average weekly earnings and never be allowed to fall below 25 per cent thereof, and (b) To increase postage costs and the costs of instaUauon and annual rental of telephones, will seriously add to the economic burdens now borne by those citizens who are wholly or mainly dependent on thenindeed pensions. Your petitioners are impelled by these facts to call upon the Australian Government as a matter the above mentioned decisions (a) and (b), determine: 1. That pensions be related to average earnings as promised by the Prime Minister in his 1972 poUcy speech, and 2. That no charge be made for installation or rental telephones ofthose pensioners entitled to a PMS card. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Kerin. Petition received. To the Honourable the Speaker and House of Representatives assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfuUy showeth: 1. That Australia is not well-endowed with natural forest areas only amounting to 4.5 per cent of the total land area. 2. That very Uttle of this forested area is reserved in national parks, most of the remainder being directly (as State forests etc.) or indirectly (as Crown lands, over which forestry exercises timber extraction rights) under forestry control. 3. That most of this remainder is Uable to be totally destroyed by woodchip projects, due to soU erosion, nutrient loss, fire damage to young saplings in artificial forest regeneration projects. 4. That many forms of arboreal wildlife are thus threatened with extinction. 5. That grossly inadequate consideration has been given to the process of recycling packaged paper. 6. That it is not in the long-term interest of the Australian people that these forests are converted into material for short-term use of excessive packaging. 7. That it is a severe abuse of democratic rights to subsidise forestry practice with public money without adequate consultation of public interest. We, your petitioners, therefore humbly pray that you will: 1. Immediately cancel all current woodchip export licences. 2. Immediately provide more funds into research for the recycling of used packaged material. 3. Ensure that any future appUcations for woodchip leases be preceded by an environmental enquiry, to be conducted by a panel of environmentalists and pubUc-spirited conservation bodies independent of the Australian Forestry CounPensioners cU or any State Forestry Commission. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, of Representatives in Parby Mr Kerin. of the undersigned citizens of Petition received. Metric System basic To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House ofRepresentatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australian respectfully showeth: That the plan to obliterate the traditional weights and measures of this country is causing and will cause widespread inconvenience, confusion, expense and distress. That there is no certainty that any significant benefits or any benefits at all will foUow the use of the new weights and measures. That the traditional weights and measures are eminently of urgency to review satisfactory. and to Your petitioners therefore pray: That the Metric Conversion Act berepealed,and that the Government take urgent steps to cause the traditional and familiar units to be restored to those areas where the greatest inconvenience and distress are occurring, that is to say, in on the meteorology, inroaddistances, in spon, m the buUding and allied trades, in the printing trade, and in retail trade. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Macphee. Petition received. Woodchip Industry The Prime Minister To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of cenain citizens of Ausualiarespectfullyshoweth: 1. That your petitioners are suffering from unemployment or other distressing circumstances. 2. That your petitioners have reason to believe that their current sufferings are not due to any fault of their own, but arise from the disastrous policies pursued by the present Commonwealth Government. 3. That your petitioners believe that there can be no rehef from the sufferings which afflict them in common with so many other Australian citizens until the present Government is replaced by another whose poUcies will be different and directed to the advantage of the Australian people. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that your Honourable House will withdraw its confidence from the present Prime Mmister, in order that there may be a speedy election and that the people of Australia may be given their proper opponunity to pass judgment on the Government reponsible for the present level of unemployment and other national losses. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Wentworth. Petition received.",16
5,Mr WENTWORTH,DEATH OF THE HONOURABLE CYRIL,"In accordance with the provisions of Standing Order 131,I move: That the petition just read by the Clerk, which comes from certain citizens of Australia and which prays that will withdraw its confidence in the present Prime Minister",18
6,Mr SPEAKER,DEATH OF THE HONOURABLE CYRIL,Order! The honourable gentleman is out of order in moving that motion unless he indicates to the House that he intends to take some action.,19
7,Mr WENTWORTH,DEATH OF THE HONOURABLE CYRIL,"I shall do so, Sir. I move: That the petition just read out by the Clerk which comes from certain citizens of Australia and which prays that the House will withdraw its confidence in the present Prime Minister in order that there may be a speedy election and that the people of Australia may be given their proper opponunity to pass judgment on the Government responsible for the present level of unemployment and other national losses should be printed. In conformity with that standing order. I now inform the House that it is my intention to move: That in view of the fact that the Government has violated the pledges of full employment, stable prices and low interest rates on which it was elected; and in view of the fact that the policy of the Government has inflicted severe unemployment and other losses on view of the fact that there can be no relief from these unhappy conditions while the present Government remains in office, this House is of the opinion that resignation honourable course left to the Prime Minister.",19
8,Mr SPEAKER,DEATH OF THE HONOURABLE CYRIL,Is the motion seconded?,19
9,Mr WENTWORTH,DEATH OF THE HONOURABLE CYRIL,Yes.,19
10,Mr SPEAKER,DEATH OF THE HONOURABLE CYRIL,The honourable gentleman cannot second his own motion. The honourable gentleman will resume his seat. I ask: Is the motion seconded? Mr Nixon- I second the motion. Question resolved in the negative. NA,19
11,Mr WHITLAM,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS," I inform the House that this morning His Excellency the Governor General appointed the Honourable Frederick Michael Daly, M.P., hold the office of Minister for Administrative Services and to administer the Department of Administrative Services following his resignation as Minister for Services and Property and change in the name of the former Department Services and Property. This action follows an amendment to the ministrative Arrangements Order to which the Governor General agreed this morning. The with main effect of the change was to transfer sponsibihty for property and survey matters sufficient from the former Minister for Services and Propomic, erty to the Minister for Urban and Regional Development. I also inform the House that the Special Ministhe House ter of State (Senator Douglas MCClelland) left Australia last Friday to lead the Australian delegation to the South Pacific Conference which is being held in Nauru. He is expected to return tomorrow. In his absence the Minister for Manufacturing Industry (Mr Lionel Bowen) will act as Special Minister of State. NA NA NA",19
12,Mr GORTON,COMMISSION,"Will the Minister for Education acquaint the House with the thinking of the Government in the recent decision to move the Schools Commission to Albury-Wodonga? Does he realise that many members of that Commission have bought houses in Canberra, having sold their previous houses, and are subject to considerable loss? Does he further understand the people of Australia; and in that many members of the Commission have working husbands or wives and that they will is the only either have to live in Canberra while their spouses live in Albury-Wodonga or give up their jobs?",19
13,Mr BEAZLEY,COMMISSION,"First of all, I should like to make a comment on the anangements and then on a deputation which waited on me on this matter. In his announcement on 8 September concerning the relocation of the Schools Commission, together with other bodies, in Albury Wodonga the Prime Minister stated that a minimum of 12 months notice will be given to staff when the compulsory transfer of positions is involved. I should like to emphasise that positions and not necessarily people are involved. In the of the Schools Commission positions in the organisation will be compulsorily transferred from Canberra to Albury-Wodonga at a time to to be determined, probably towards the end of 1976. In relation to the staff occupying those positions a number of matters apply. Firstly, each staff member will be formally advised of the date a of transfer of his or her position to Alburyof Wodonga. This advice will be given at least 12 months prior to the date of the transfer of the Adposition. The members of the staff will have 6 months to decide whether they intend to transfer the posiuon. This period is intended to enreable members of the staff and their families time to assess the personal, social, econeducational and other implications of the transfer. The maximum assistance practicable will be provided to members of the staff by way of information on the conditions to apply with respect to a wide range of matters such as available housing and associated finance and rental provisions, settling in and settling out allowances, provisions for special leave and visits to Albury-Wodonga, available educational and cultural facilities and so on. Consultative machinery involving representatives of the authorities being transferred, staff sociations, the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation and the Public Service Board has already been established to consider the matters already mentioned. At the end of this 6 months members of the staff not wishing to move to Albury-Wodonga will be transferred to the unattached Ust. They will retain their salary classifications and will continue to perform the duties of their present substantive positions until the appointment of a replacement or the transfer of the position. During the second 6-month period members of the staff have the opportunity to secure another position. Assistance which might be given to members of the staff seeking alternative employment in their present location is being studied and special consideration may be necessary in cases such as employees who elect not to move because of closeness to retiring age. I would say to the right honourable gentleman that those who waited on me indicated that it was certain that two-thirds of the officers be transferring because they find the problems leaving their houses, leaving their associations, wife leaving her employment and so on too great. A new matter has arisen which cern me about this. Many of them, of course, are having children educated at the Australian National University and it was envisaged that the university of Albury-Wodonga would be Minister being developed. In the slowing of the rate educational development associated with the Budget the Albury-Wodonga university is not proceeding immediately and this has created a good many people a problem which I think needs re-examination. A second factor is Hawker and Phillip secondary colleges will be opening next year. They are an advanced form of secondary education that many of these emhas ployees desire their children to enter and there no equivalent in Albury-Wodonga, so some the things that were once in phase and ordination have ceased to be so. I have had discussion with the deputation which came to me and I do want a re-examination made of these matters. I am not in a position to give an immediate reply. NA",19
14,Mr WHAN,BANKRUPTCIES,I address my question to the Attorney-General. How many bankruptcies were reported by the Registry of Bankruptcies during thefinancialyear just completed? How does this figure compare with previous years? What were the main causes of bankruptcy during 1974-75?,20
15,Mr ENDERBY,BANKRUPTCIES,"I thank the honourable member for the question. The number of as- bankruptcies during 1974-75 was 2052 and that can be taken from the Second Schedule of the Attorney-General's annual report to Parliament on the operation of the Bankruptcy Act 1974-75. This is a low figure and is in keeping with the record of this Government. The lowest figure recorded over the past 7 years was 1619 for last year, 1973-74, and that figure comes from the Attorney-General's annual report for 1973-74, again the Second Schedule. These figures should be compared with the 2657 bankruptcies for the last full year of office of the Liberal-Country Party Government. Thatfigurecomes from the Attorney-General's annual report of 1971-72, again the Second Schedule. Thisfigureis over 600 more than that reported for the 1974-75 financial year. The lower level of bankruptcies under the Labor Government is well exemplified by the fact that the number of cases for June 1975-182-and July 1975-169-was lower than the average monthly figure over the past 7 years which was 184. The main causes given and will not assessed of bankruptcy were, and they of remain-in a descending order-lac k of business a ability, lack of working capital and general economic conditions. I emphasise that they were in does conthe order that I have given. NA",20
16,Mr STREET,UNEMPLOYMENT STATISTICS,My question is directed to the representing the Minister for Labor and of Immigration. Has the Department ofLabor and Immigration lifted its estimate of the number of unemployed next year from 400 000 to 450 000? for Does this estimate assume that the indexation guidelines of the Conciliation and Arbitration that the Commission have been complied with?,20
17,Mr RIORDAN,UNEMPLOYMENT STATISTICS,"No such change in estimate been given. I understand that the Departis ment of Labor and Immigration has estimated of that the actual unemploymentfigures-not the in coseasonally adjusted figures-in Januaryclose February of next year to be of the order of see 400 000. The Department's estimate is not subject to variation on the basis of the figures released over this last weekend. For example, the figures at the end of September showed that on a seasonally adjusted basis the number of unemployed rose by. 1 of i per cent, that is, from 5 per cent seasonally adjusted to 5.1 per cent seasonally adjusted. The actual number of persons registered as unemployed in fact declined by 2135. There are some otherfigurestoo which might interest the honourable gentleman. For example, there are now 6000 less people employed on Regional Employment Development schemes of one kind or another since the end of August. But the number of those persons who have registered as unemployed is only 1700. So we can see that two-thirds of those who have been displaced from RED schemes have not registered as unemployed. The otherfigurewhich might be of interest to the House is that the level of overtime as disclosed by the survey conducted by the Department continues to rise. Honourable members will recall that it was 1.6 hours in June, 1.7 hours in July, and an average of 1.8 hours in August last. So, there is some indication that the labour market is marginally strengthening rather than weakening. Hence, the assertion that there would be 500 000 unemployed, and now apparently a figure of 450 000 out of work, in the January-February period seems to be poorly based.",20
18,Mr THORBURN,UNEMPLOYMENT STATISTICS,"In view of the Treasurer's sition's comments in the Budget concerning the Mathews report, has he been able to give further consideration to the proposals in that report? Would he consider it appropriate for his Departit. ment to assist in a consideration of the Mathews report?",21
19,Mr HAYDEN,UNEMPLOYMENT STATISTICS,"It is correct that in my Budget Speech I did say that there would be further sideration of the Mathews report. My words relation to the report in respect of inflation taxation were: These are important recommendations with complex ramifications and there is a need for farther study of them beforefinaldecisions are made. I went on to indicate some of the problems associated with the report which must be addresMinister sed in detail before we would find ourselves as a Government in a position to make a firm deso, cision. I said: After careful consideration we have decided that it at this time possible to act on cause of its enormous revenue cost but also because of the complexity and difficulty involved in giving effect to the Committee's proposal to defer tax for individualfirmson the basis of each individualfirm'schanging stock values. Very serious practical problems would also be created for industry and the Taxauon Office in implementing the Committee's suggestion that deferred tax would be coUected when stock values fall or when businesses change hands. These are matters to which the Government is currently addressing its attention. I noted in one newspaper report that apparently one of the journalists is well informed on the subject. I found it rather curious, however, to observe the comment attributed to the Opposition's economic spokesman, for the time being at least-the Deputy Leader of the Opposition-that it was improper of me to use the Taxation Office in any way at all to provide briefing papers for members of the Government so that a properly informed decision could be made in respect of those important topics. It is unfortunate that the comment appeared in the newspaper. I was rather surprised when I saw it, although I will not indicate whether the nature of my surprise was pleasure or displeasure. I noted that on the same date there also appeared in the newspapers a document which the Opposition had been waving under the noses of journalists concerning the costing of the Opposition's so-called Budget. I presume the Opposition decided that it was time for it to be released. But honourable members opposite did not bother to read it before they released it. If they had done so they would have discovered, as the journalist indicated in his article, that the TAXATION document was a clear criticism of the Oppoproposals. He pointed out that they had under costed what they put forward by about $500m. It is quite proper for the Government to use the resources of the departments which back I suggest that the detail and the caution with which the Government is approaching what is a key proposal in economic management reflect a responsibihty appropriate in this sort of case. In the meantime I ask Opposition members to adcondress themselves to some of the complexities to in which we are now addressing ourselves and and which have apparently appeared in the Press, and to give us their views on how to handle them. NA NA",21
20,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,STAFF,"Has the Prime recently ordered that all members of ministerial staffs be subject to a security check? If what has prompted him to do this and why, if it is correct, has it taken him nearly 3 years in is not government before he came to to that kind of dethis recommendation partly becision?",21
21,Mr WHITLAM,STAFF,"As honourable members will be well aware, a few months ago it came to both my notice that ministerial staff had acted in a way in which no Minister should act. I thought then that I should take the action which the honourable gendeman has mentioned. NA",21
22,Mr SHERRY,KEMERTON PTY LTD,"I address my question to the Minister for Manufacturing Industry. I preface by saying that the Minister will be aware of the announcement by Kemerton Pty Ltd that it intends to cease production of calcium the Electrona plant which is in my electorate. I ask: What initiatives have been taken by this Government in the last 2Yi years to assist company? Is it a fact that Kemerton is a corporpubhc. ate body, owned 51 per cent by Consolidated Gold Fields of Australia and 49 per cent by Australian Industry Development Corporation? Finally, will the results of the feasibility study into the production of ferro silicon be made a public document?",22
23,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,KEMERTON PTY LTD,"It is true Australian Government has taken a number of initiatives to assist not only the company concerned but also its predecessor, Australian Calcium Carbide. Through the good offices of honourable member Australian Calcium Caraid bide sought assistance from the Government far back as 1973. That assistance was readily given. There was a guarantee that there would be no penalty for what was then deemed to liability in respect of bush fire compensation. At that time it was said clearly that if the Governman ment could see its way clear to provide this of assistance this new venture in the production of ferro silicon would certainly appear to viable. I now note that following that assurance took place in 1975. It is with some regret that we now find that the company is unable to continue the viability study of the production of ferro silicon because I think that some 150 employees involved. The Government's main concern is guarantee the employment of the people at that site. It is disappointing to learn that the company has been obliged to take this action. Whether it necessary for the company to make cision on the action or whether it should be looked at in the context of responsibility for employees is a matter which the Government might look at again. I understand that corresponI dence has been entered into with this GovernGovernment, ment and the Tasmanian Government. In 1974, following a report by the Industries Assistance Commission, the Australian Government took good another initiative as to the tariff protection calcium carbide and increased the protection from 25 per cent as recommended to 30 per plus $17.22 a tonne. That was given on the basis that the production of calcium carbide would continue until September 1976. In defiance of that arrangement this apparently precipitate action now has been taken and it is said that the company will not continue that production. it There would be no point in the Government trying to encourage these initiatives unless there were a guarantee that there would be employcarbide at ment for the personnel involved. Finally, I am not at ail clear why the report, which apparently is a report from overseas conthe sultants to the company, should not be made. I would hope it would be made pubhc because everybody is entided to be informed of the the contents of the report. The Government has taken a number of initiatives to assist this company and its main concern, I repeat, is the benefit of the employees. If there is some viable prospect in that report I would be anxious that the that the Government explore it. NA",22
24,Mr LLOYD,HEARING AIDS,"I ask the Minister for Health the when the Government's promised free hearing scheme will be introduced. If it is to be this as financial year, has Budget appropriation been made and if so for how much? What administrative or legislative procedures will be required bebe a fore the scheme can be implemented?",22
25,Dr EVERINGHAM,HEARING AIDS,The honourable gentlewill be aware of widespread demands from form the Opposition and elsewhere in the community for a curb on the rate of increase of social services be and welfare services provided by this Government. When we are in afinancialposition to proa sale vide this service it will be announced. NA,22
26,Mr KERIN,MEDIBANK,"Is the Prime Minister satisfied are with the capacity of the New South Wales to Government to give effect to its obligations under the hospital side of Medibank? Has the Prime Minister seen a report that doctors in New is South Wales have withdrawn their services from its own deoutpatients' clinics? Mr Whitlam My doubts on this score the would arise from the reaction by many doctors in outpatient clinics in New South Wales hospitals. would accept that the New South Wales albeit belatedly-it was the last of the State governments in Australia to do soaccepted the hospital Medibank arrangement in faith. It is a matter of regret that so many on doctors in outpatients' departments in New South Wales hospitals have defied the undertakcent ings of the New South Wales Government and the arrangements which it made with the Austrahan Government. There is no doubt that if any persons working in other essential occupations or industries were to act with similar irresponsibility there would be outcries in all newspapers and on the other side of this Parliament. In this case doctors have not acted with proper decency or dignity. I am not saying that all doctors have done that but quite obviously a great number of doctors have not acted with decency or dignity in serving the public who go to outpatient clinics. The people who go to outpatient clinics are most likely to be people who up to now could not have received hospital treatment or, indeed, medical treatment of any other character except in outpatient clinics. It is shameful that doctors should be seeking to impose on taxpayers in this way now that they in fact would be paid on a sessional basis for continuing to treat patients as hospital outpatients. NA",22
27,Mr SINCLAIR,SECURITY CHECKS FOR MINISTERIAL,"My question, addressed to the Prime Minister, is supplementary to that asked by the Leader of the Opposition. What was the action by ministerial staff to which he referred in his reply? Has that action adversely affected Australia's standing abroad or our security? Will the new security check ensure that the same improprieties do not occur again or is it a fact that the new security check in no way relates to past domestic, iinancial or business dealings?",23
28,Mr WHITLAM,SECURITY CHECKS FOR MINISTERIAL,The circumstances were given to the House on 9 July last. No harm was done. No harm can now be done. NA,23
29,Mr DAWKINS,OPPOSITION TAXATION PROPOSALS,Did the Treasurer see a statement in the West Australian newspaper this morning indicating that the Austrahan Government should vacate a part of the income tax field equivalent to the value of the Austrahan Government's reimbursements to the States? What would be the implications for overall national economic management if this suggestion were adopted?,23
30,Mr HAYDEN,OPPOSITION TAXATION PROPOSALS,"This is further clear evidence of the imprecision of the presentation of this proposal from the Opposition. It obviously has not worked out the details of what it is putting forward to the community, and yet its proposal has key influence on the way in which the economy of this country would be managed. For instance, a Liberal Party of Australia Press release, on an official letterhead released yesterday by Senator Carrick, the Opposition spokesman on intergovernmental relations and federalism, stated: The Commonwealth would vacate a part of the income the tax field equivalent to the value of Commonwealth reimbursement to the States. This year net pay-as-you-earn income tax collections will be of the order of $8.7 billion. Total payments to the States this year, including the Loan Council arrangements, will be about $8.4 billion. Allowing for the fact that there can be wide variations in the amount of money which can be raised in the loan program in the course of a year-les s than 11 per cent of the amount which was approved by the Loan Council was in fact raised on the loan market-ther e is a clear indication that there would be practically no function left for the Australian Government in terms offinancingits own revenue needs from pay-as-you-earn income tax. Then of course there are the other anomalies in this scheme. Presumably people in Canberra would not have to pay a surtax to which people STAFF in every State in Australia would be subjected. Federal politicians, no matter where they live in Australia and in spite of their comparatively high incomes, would pay no State surtax, I presume, back in their home States although the man next door with perhaps more dependants to support on a much lower income would have to pay that surtax. This scheme has not been thought through. It is a phoney proposition. The Opposition has to come clean. It has to give the details as to how the scheme would work. How does it expect to meet the discrimination which would clearly arise between States as a result of some States imposing higher surtaxes on taxpayers than applies in other States? The poorer States in a relative sense would certainly be in this position. A very serious undermining of economic management would arise once the central government completely surrendered the sort of efficientfiscalmanagement which has stood the test and gained the support of a large succession of governments, especially Liberal-Country Party governments. This is a returnOpposition members-Oh !",23
31,Mr HAYDEN,OPPOSITION TAXATION PROPOSALS,"Members of the Opposition encourage me to continue because I know it is hurting when they make that noise. This is a return to the discredited pre-war days of everyone being double taxed, of 2 taxes, of some people in one State, in spite of being on the same income as people in other States, paying more tax. Why should there be that discrimination between States? We ask the Opposition to come clean and give us the details. What is the basic amount it would give the States? What is the formula for providing it? It cannot say it will be a fixed proportion of basic personal income tax collections because there is not a fixed rate of growth in collections of basic personal income tax. How would the Opposition provide equalisation grants and if it is to provide them why does it propose there should be a surtax? The 2 things seem to be contradictory. This scheme would lead to endless confusion and unnecessary complexity. It would lead to great difficulty in economic management and most of all it would lead to great dissatisfaction in the community when people realise that under this proposal they would pay a lot more tax.

32,Mr SINCLAIR,SECURITY CHECKS FOR MINISTERIAL,"I ask a further supplementary question of the Prime Minister following the 2 questions, the one asked by the Leader of the Opposition and the one asked by me. Does the security check of ministerial staff on which both previous questions have been asked relate to the pastfinancialpropriety of the members of that staff?",24
33,Mr WHITLAM,SECURITY CHECKS FOR MINISTERIAL,"It would clearly apply only to persons who are on ministerial staffs.

Will he take action to see that the use of animals for this purpose is kept to the miniPrime mum compatible with avoiding the use of human beings in testing programs? Will he draw up code of requirements with a view to seeing that suffering is kept to a minimum?,24
35,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,EXPERIMENTS ON ANIMALS,"The question examine raised by the honourable member for Casey is under check? one which he has taken up with me by correspondence so it did not catch me altogether by surprise, although I was nearly asleep when started his question. I have raised this with Hugh Ennor, the Permanent Head of my security Department, who is a distinguished scientist in his own right and one who, I understand, has conducted experiments on animals has assured me that every precaution is taken to ensure that there is no unnecessary suffering. In most cases where experimentation is likely to result in death the animal is, of course, to use the common phrase, put to sleep before the experiment takes place. But it is inevitable that there are some experiments in which amputation or surgery is conducted while the animal is under anaesthetic. Naturally when the animal recovers and the results of the experimentation are studied the animal does suffer a great deal of pain which is unavoidable. The only alternative is for us to conduct these kinds of experiments on human beings. The very purpose of the experiments on the animals in most cases is to assist medical science in dealing with the ailments and complaints of human beings. As much as we STAFF regret that these experiments on animals are necessary, they are unavoidable if science is to discover or seek to discover ways of easing the sufferings of human beings. I can assure the honourable member that my Department is not unmindful of the concern which animal lovers have for these experiments. We are doing, and will continue to do, all that is within our power to ensure that experiments are carried out in a proper, humane and sensible also manner. If the honourable gentleman or any other member of the House has any examples of where this has not been the case I would be glad if he would bring such cases to my attention. I on can assure honourable members that my will act with alacrity in the matter to that steps are taken to ensure that the experiments are carried out in accordance with the normal procedures that are recognised all over the world as being essential to prevent unnecessfor SECURITY CHECKS FOR MINISTERIAL NA",24
36,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,STAFF,"I again ask the Minister a question. If l may say so, we are not concerned with past members of ministerial a staffs, only with present members. Does the security check to which he has referred relate to the pastfinancialpropriety of present members of ministerial staff? Does the security check the financial propriety of the persons",24
37,Mr WHITLAM,STAFF,"I , too, am concerned only he with present members of ministerial staff. The Sir check will be one which commends itself to the authorities. If they believe that past financial transactions would bear upon the security of a Minister's staff, presumably they would himself. He carry out that check. NA NA",24
38,Mr MULDER,HOSPITALS,"My question is directed to the Minister for Health. The Minister will recall recent serious allegauons made in this House about health services in the Australian Capital Territory. Is it a fact that expenditure on the Canberra and Woden Valley hospitals wili decline this financial year, that only 29 residential medical officers have been employed although an establishment of 38 has been approved, and that some specialists with doubtful medical qualifications have been accepted?",25
39,Dr EVERINGHAM,HOSPITALS,"The Opposition still peddles inaccurate information in the House on health matters. This propensity to confuse the facts with fanciful claims is quite consistent with its subservience to the feud-fomenting faction which prevents doctors talking to colleagues in the ACT unless the other colleagues toe the Australian Medical Association line on employment conditions. The Opposition spokesmen would do better to check the accuracy of the material they use in this House. The amount allocated in the Budget for Canberra and Woden Valley hospitals is 28 per cent higher than the expenditure in 1974-75. There are about 70 resident medical officers in the 2 hospitals, not 29. The hospitals are meeting the needs of patients with the staff available. Indeed, the resident staff give a free emergency service to the patients of private doctors, who are so bitter in opposition to other aried appointments. The assertion that salaried specialists with 'doubtful medical qualifications' have been accepted is baseless and scurrilous. In the unprofessional Australian Capital Territory atmosphere a few medical practitioners are apparently so uncertain about their own standards and their ability to compete that they have to create grounds to slander salaried specialists. The honourable member for Murray will have to beware he does not become their little Sir Echo. Only one specialist is registered under the 12 months provisional procedure because that specialist's basic degree was taken in a university not recognised for automatic registration purposes in the ACT. However, what the honourable member for Murray did not say is that this specialist has post-graduate qualifications, including fellowship of the British and Australian Royal Colleges in the relevant specialty. He did not say that the same specialist worked for 7 years as a staff specialist in Hobart. So much for the claim that specialists have been accepted from medical schools that have not been recognised by any Austrahan medical registration board, to quote the phrase of the honourable member for Murray. I may add that the profession itself substantially provides the membership of the Board which approved the provisional registration. NA",25
40,Mr HUNT,HANDICAPPED PERSONS,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. Does the Government regard mentally and physically handicapped people as being high in the priority of needs? Does the Government regard voluntary organisations and sheltered workshop associations as being important in caring for handicapped people? If so, when will the Government expedite payments for salary subsidies which in some cases have been owing for some months? When will the Government establish its own expenditure priorities to ensure that capital subsidies are available for hostel and other accommodation for handicapped people?",25
41,Mr HAYDEN,HANDICAPPED PERSONS,"Of course we give these matters high priority-highe r priority than any previous government ever gave any of the matters in thefieldof welfare. For instance, in the last Budget we introduced a wide-ranging program of initiatives to benefit the handicapped in the community. We extended the aged persons homes legislation to cover handicapped people too. We made provision so that holiday accommodation could be provided for handicapped people. We sal- provided a range of subsidies for professional and semi-professional people working in centres providing services for the handicapped. We extended benefits to cover activity centres as well as the existingly covered sheltered workshops. We improved the rate of benefit from a $2 for $1 subsidy to a $4 for $ 1 subsidy. In its way this has brought some problems for us. It is now so much easier than it ever was before for community agencies to seek assistance from the Government. Before, with the strict and mean $2 for $ 1 subsidy arrangement, there was an effective financial rationing system. We have to develop some more effective queuing system so that the more needy sources of application are assisted earlier. These things have suddenly come forward and the number of applications for assistance under this wide-ranging program of benefits in capital and recurrent services for not only the handicapped but also generally in welfare has led to a great upsurge in demand for assistance from the Australian Government. This is not big government; this is the role of goverament responsibly providing a facilitating support for the community. Without this sort of facilitating role the people in the community could not achieve the sorts of objectives they have set themselves. Without our interest in the field of welfare and in the field of need of the handicapped, the psychiatrically disabled or ill dominating our decision making the Minister for Health would not have undertaken a most extensive program of community psychiatric health centres. None of this has been undenaken before. There are numerous other instances of these sorts of initiatives for which the Government has been responsible. This is what the Opposition calls big government. When members of the Opposition say they want less government so that there will be more freedom they really mean that they want to cut back on these sorts of initiatives, cut back on education and cut back on urban improvement so that there will be freedom of the wealthy-thos e who have had a happy and wealthy inheritance-to hang on to what they have and to mimimise their liability to support the rest of the community. That is very good for a minority, but it is not too good for the great majority of people whose only freedom without the support of an adequate functioning government role is never to succeed or to succeed in a very even sort of way, to have few satisfactions in life and to achieve very little compared with what they would like to achieve. It is only this sort of role of government that will improve the quality of life. The other matters concerning payment rest with another department. I suggest that that part of the question be directed to the relevant Minister. NA",25

43,Mr WHITLAM,INDIAN OCEAN,"The Government's attitude is that it would be undesirable for the 2 super Library. powers to have any mutual escalation of their armaments in the Indian Ocean. The Indian Ocean hitherto has been the most free of all the world's oceans from such military rivalry between the super powers.

Ordered that the report be printed.",27

56,Mr WHAN,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,"Mr Speaker, the report tabled on behalf of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory is the fourth this year involving variations to the plan of layout of the City of Canberra, and brings to sixty-four the number of variations approved by the Committee this year. Six items are involved in the present series. Three items are of a machinery nature and I do not propose to comment upon them. The remaining 3 items are, however, worthy of mention to the House. Item 2 in the series provides access roads First Stage of the National Athletics Stadium, which is to be the venue of the 1977 Pacific Conference Games. The stadium will provide athletic facilites of international standard. A soccer or hockey field will also be provided within the athletics track. As well as the major stadium, a warm-up track will be built. A stand which will hold 6000 spectators will be provided. The stand will be augmented by other covered and temporary stands which will give the stadium a spectator capacity of20 000. Item 5 provides for the deletion of portion of the gazetted reservation for Gowrie Drive, a proposed by-pass road in the suburb of Deakin. The proposal also provides for the provision of a cul-de-sac access road to the recently approved Deakin Telecommunications Centre adjacent to the originally gazetted reservation for Gowrie Drive. An objection to this proposal was lodged by a number of residents of Deakin who feel they could be adversely affected if the proposed variation indicated an intention that the National Capital Development Commission no longer intended pursuing the development of Gowrie Drive as a by-pass road. The NCDC assured the Committee that it had not taken such a decision and the present variation in no way prejudiced any decision which may be taken in the long term concerning Gowrie Drive. The final item, Item 6, involves development of the Belconnen Retail Mall which is being undertaken by the Canberra Commercial Development Authority. The variation identifies the site for stage one of the development and requires the closure of Totterdell Street in the Belconnen town centre to allow the development to proceed. The Committee was informed that the Canberra Commercial Development Authority is planning to open part of the development by October 1976. Currently the question of parking facilities at the Mall is the subject of negotiations between the NCDC and the Canberra Commercial Development Authority. The Committee was assured that the deletion of Totterdell Street was in no way dependent upon future decisions in respect of parking facilities, and accordingly the Committee has recommended the implementation of this variation, together with the five accompanying proposals. I commend the report to the House. NA Discussion of Matter of Public Importance",27
57,Mr SPEAKER,ROYAL COMMISSION ON PETROLEUM,"I have received a letter from the Leader of the National Country Party of to the Australia (Mr Anthony) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The failure of the Government to take account of doubts expressed by the Secretary and the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions about the findings of the Royal Commission on Petroleum in relation to the contract between Allied Peuochemicals Pty Ltd and ACTU-Solo Enterprises Pty Ltd for the supply of crude oU. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion torisein their places. (More than the number of members required by the Standing Orders having risen in their places)",27
58,Mr ANTHONY,ROYAL COMMISSION ON PETROLEUM,"The Opposition raises as a matter of public importance the statements by Mr Harold Souter, Secretary of the Australian Council Trade Unions, and Mr Hawke, President of the ACTU, which call into question thefindingsof the Royal Commission on Petroleum in relation to the contract by Allied Petrochemicals Pty to supply crude oil to ACTU-Solo Enterprises Pty Ltd. The Government has fully accepted the findings of the royal commission. The royal mission found that the directors of ACTU-Solo Pty Ltd and the company APC and one of its dinot rectors deliberately deceived the Government misrepresenting the price being paid for the oil involved. Mr Souter, however, disputes the findings of the royal commission. He has stated publicly that he has been 'maligned' by the report which is a 'whitewash', and which him a 'scapegoat' while 'letting the Government off the hook'. Mr Souter says that the report is ' not only unfair but it is also incorrect', that not analysed the facts of the case, and has not presented the facts in relation to the evidence. Hawke has supported Mr Souter's claims and he has described the report as unfair. These are serious charges, yet the Government has hastily accepted the findings of the royal commission without bothering to investigate the claims made by Mr Souter and supported by Opposition is not satisfied that the Government has considered the report and findings of the royal commission sufficiently. The public statements made by Mr Souter and Mr Hawke lead us to believe that the Government may have been too hasty in accepting the report of the royal commission. We also believe that there were omissions during the hearing before the royal commission-and consequently in the report Solo itself-whic h lead us to call for further examintract ation of this matter. Thefirstquestion which arises is why the Minfrom ister for Minerals and Energy (Mr Connor) was not called to give evidence before the royal mission. The royal commission's findings that the Minister was deceived is based on 'natural inferences' drawn from a report of a telephone conversation between the Minister and Mr Souter, from departmental files, and from the terms of the Minister's letter dated 26 June 1975 . approving the ACTU deal. The Government's of the sale approach before the commission was to argue that Mr Souter and the Minister had never cussed the actual deal. It is clear that Mr Liddell, counsel for the Government, was misled by the Government in its brief. Unfortunately for the Government's case, the Minister made certain statements in this House on 2 September which contradicted this. Surely the question whether Mr Souter had discussed the ACTU deal with the of Minister was vital to the question whether the Minister may have had any previous knowledge of the two contracts. Mr Liddell relied heavily on Mr Souter's statements to argue that since Mr Ltd Souter had never discussed the ACTU deal with the Minister, Mr Souter's statements regarding the Minister's attitude to the deal were all based comon events and discussions surrounding the IOC and AGL contracts. The Royal Commission did call officers of the Department of Minerals by and Energy to give evidence before it. This was despite the fact that amongst the documents tendered in evidence before the Commission there is clear evidence that the departmental officers suspected that there might be a supplementary makes agreement between ACTU-Solo and APC. The Minister admitted in the House that he had seen these documents. I ask for leave to incorporate in it has Hansard an extract from the telex from Mr Gartland to the First Assistant Secretary, EconMr comic and General Division, Department of Minerals and Energy, dated 24 June 1975 and an very extract from a departmental memorandum to the Minister from D.

The Department raised the possibility that APC and ACTUmight have a secret deal and a separate conand it is surely no coincidence that the Department made specific reference to bulk storage facilities which were in fact the pretext on which the second contract was concluded. Apart its omission in calling witnesses, the Royal Commission in its report fails to examine the comclaims by Mr Souter that he was acting in a way which he believed would be acceptable to the Minister. Mr Souter made statements several times under oath to this effect. At page 4276 of the transcript of evidence, Mr Souter said: . . my clear understanding of the concepi and the basis of the crude was that the commercial sale was distinctly not a matter for Government approval. dis Mr Shannon, counsel for the ACTU, even went so far as to suggest that Mr Souter obtained from the Minister the idea of two contracts. I ask for leave to incorporate in Hansard 2 extracts from the transcript of proceedings of the Royal Commission on Petroleum. The extracts, from pages 4496 and 4497 of that transcript, are from the final address by Mr Shannon to the Commission.",28

64,Mr SPEAKER,ROYAL COMMISSION ON PETROLEUM,Leave is not granted.,29
65,Mr ANTHONY,ROYAL COMMISSION ON PETROLEUM,"Mr Souter also stated under oath, in response to a question from Mr W. Fisher, QC, counsel assisting the Royal Commission, as to whether he had misled a Minister of the Crown: I strongly object and deny that any Minister of the has been misled by the ACTU. By insisting that the Government was not deceived, Mr Souter is in effect saying that it knew about the two contracts all along. In its report, the Royal Commission fails to mention Mr Souter's statements and the report contains no exaniination of the possibility that Mr Souter may have been speaking the truth in relation to his understanding of the Minister's attitude. It is unfortunate that this matter, which is so central to the Royal Commission'sfinding,was not pursued in that report. It is also unfortunate that the proposed contract between IOC and AGL was not pursued more fully in the Royal Commission report. This is the same oil which was eventually sold to ACTU-Solo. This agreement was in the form of two contracts and was almost identical to the APC-ACTU-Solo agreement. AGL forwarded copies of both contracts to the Minister for Minerals and Energy for his approval. In his reply to AGL dated 20 May 1974, this is what the Minister stated. I ask for leave to have incorporated in Hansard a copy of the letter from the Minister for Minerals and Energy to the Secretary of the Australian Gaslight Co. Ltd-that is, the Minister's reply.",29
66,Mr SPEAKER,ROYAL COMMISSION ON PETROLEUM,Order! I suggest that the right honourable gentleman might ask for leave to incorporate this document and the earlier documents at the conclusion of his speech. We are going through an exercise of frustration at the moment.,29
67,Mr ANTHONY,ROYAL COMMISSION ON PETROLEUM,"It is clear from this letter that the Minister gave tacit approval to the arrangement entered into between IOC and AGL. However, the Royal Commission did not pursue the question of whether the Minister should have recognised that the ACTU-Solo deal was in the same form. Mr Speaker, the central question which the Royal Commission dealt with was whether the Minister was deceived. The Commission's finding that the Minister was deceived, which has been accepted by the Government, did not take into account several important matters relating to the question of whether the Minister was deceived. Thefirstconcerns the AGL contracts. The Royal Commission did not consider whether the Minister should have questioned whether the ACTU-Solo deal was in the same form as the AGL deal. A second aspect was the departmental advice given to the Minister. The Royal Commission did not pursue the question of whether, in the light of this advice, the Minister exercised sufficient diligence in considering the recommendations of his Department. He should have been put on notice by reading the departmental telex that a second Crown contract relating to bulk facilities might exist, particularly as he had seen the AGL contracts. Finally, it was common knowledge within the industry that APC wanted $5 a barrel for this oil. It had been offered to all the major oil companies at this price, and all had quite correctly refused it. The Minister has also stated in the House that he knew oil was being peddled around. Many people in the industry knew about the twocontract agreement for getting around the official price. Surely the Royal Commission should have pursued the question whether the Minister was aware of these facts, especially when his departmental advisers pointed out to him that, on the face of the single contract submitted for approval, it seemed that APC was not making any profit out of the sale. It is also unfortunate that the Royal Commission did not attempt to investigate the origins of this two-contract agreement. The Royal Commission did not attempt to find out where the idea came from aud whose idea it was. I have heard reports that there have been statements by parties involved in these deals to the effect that the Minister himself may have suggested this arrangement as a method of circumventing the official pricing policy. None of these issues, however, was pursued. Another important aspect of this matter, about which the Opposition is concerned, is the fact that, by circumventing the official pricing policy, huge windfall profits were made by several parties. APC made over $lm. ACTU-Solo gamed over $1.7m in not having to import crude oil at $9 per barrel. When such large amounts of money are involved one naturally questions whether some other parties might have been deriving benefits. There are too many irregularities in this whole business for the gravest suspicions not to be raised concerning the integrity of the Government and Ministers of the Government who were involved in this matter. Furthermore, one questions whether Mr Hawke, the President of the Australian Labor Party and the sponsor of the ACTU policy of becoming involved in retailing, was himself involved. Mr Speaker, the Opposition raises these matters because there are many unanswered questions in this whole business. Why has the Government been so hasty to accept the Royal Commission's report? Why has it prevented debate on the report in this House? Why has Mr Souter been made the scapegoat, to quote his own words, in this affair? Mr Souter has had a long career as a senior trade union official. He is respected throughout the community. Why should a man, approaching the end ofhis career, do anything dishonest? Is he an innocent party to a shady and crooked deal in which others were involved? If so, who are these people? These are matters of the gravest importance. Doubts surround the motives of a Minister of the Crown in approving this deal. We know that large sums of money were involved. A respected and honourable man claims that the Royal Commission report is a whitewash and that he has been made a scapegoat; and the Government has been let off the hook. The Opposition believes that the Government must answer some of these questions. The matter is on the minds of the Austrahan people. If the Government is to be seen to have any integrity these questions with which I have challenged it must be answered. If the Government cannot answer them there must be further investigation into this whole matter.",29

There is no 'windfall' I do not regard this commercial transaction as a matter for my consideration. However, I observe that the proposed price is in excess of that operating in respect of indigenous crude. Yours sincerely NA Mr N. E.

71,Mr KEATING,REXCONNOR,"This is another attempt by the Opposition to make cowardly and contemptible insinuations against the Government as it did during the loans affair deThe bate. It called for a royal commission. Government requested this royal commission, which the Leader of the National of Australia (Mr Anthony) has described as a whitewash. He proposed that the Government were investigate the royal commission. How bereft of common sense is this man and how bereft Opposition for supporting him? He said that Government has acted too hastily. From the moment that Mobil Oil Australia Ltd called question the ACTU-Solo Enterprises Pty Ltd deal during the proceedings of mission on the next sitting day of Mr Liddell, the Government's counsel, requested a special report on the matter. Throughout the administration indigenous crude oil policy, in the days of the former Government and in the days of this in That Government from 1972, the Government and that price? the Minister for Minerals and Energy (Mr Connor) have upheld consistently the basic thrust of the pohcy. To use the Minister's own words, so long as crude oil is sold within Party Australia at the proper price, it benefits all tralians. That is the basis of the policy and been adhered torigorously.The Leader of the the National Country Party has today tabled arguoption. ment placed before the royal commission, not evidence. The royal commission'sfindingsexonthe erate the Government and the Minister. Now the Opposition wants to go beyond that and has called for a special inquiry into the royal mission itself. Let us look at Mr Souter's dence, which is not hearsay. Mr Liddell tioned Mr Souter and pointed out that an option was entered into between ACTU-Solo, IOC and Allied Petrochemicals Pty Ltd on 16 May 1975.",30
72,Mr STALEY,REXCONNOR,It was Solo then.,31
73,Mr KEATING,REXCONNOR,"It was not Solo then; ACTU-Solo. On 17 June-on e month later-Mr Souter wrote to the Minister. At no time did the Minister see any second agreement. The operatAGL ive document was the $100 option of 16 May. Mrprove Liddell questioned Mr Souter as follows: I suggest that in the course of that discussion youMeaning Mr Souterstated that the price payable for the crude was the ment approved price or words to that effect. Mr Souter replied: What I stated was that there was discussion the prospect of purchase of APC crude, and the Minister's response was, and I agreed, that it would be at the GovernHowever, ment approved price for the crude. Mr Liddell asked: Minister specifically raised the question and you say The you agreed that would be the price? Mr Souter said: 'Yes.' He said 'Yes' under oath. Country Party Then Mr Liddell asked: From what you told us on Tuesday you were well aware, you not, at that stage that the Minister would not have approved any sale of this crude other than at the is the Government-approved pricethe Mr STALEY - That was never in dispute. into Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Dr Jenkins)Order! The honourable member for Chisholm the royal comwill contain himself. the commission Mr KEATING-He went on: Was that your belief? Mr Souter answered under oath: 'The sale of of the the crude, yes.' He was asked: was your belief at thetimeof the discussion and you the course of this discussion stated this was to be a sale at Mr Souter replied under oath: 'That is right.' What is the point of the Leader of the Country now tabling argument in this political disAuscussion? These are the facts under oath from the it has royal commission. There is the documentation, details of the agreement and the details of the Yet the Leader of the Country Party tries to suggest that the Government has whitewashed whole issue. There has been no inconsistency in the administration of the indiginous crude oil policy in respect of the Australian Gas Light comCompany, IOC, APC, Caltex or ACTU-Solo. eviThe only single difference was that ACTU-Solo quesdeceived the Australian Government. Apart from that there has been no inconsistency. The Leader of the Country Party rises in this House regularly like a lackey for AGL, which he has been for 2Vi years ever since the pipeline dispute started, and tries to put its case here suggesting that the Government was responsible for the it was increase in gas prices in Sydney. Let us recount the AGL deal. On 13 May 1974 wrote to the Minister asking him to apa contract for the sale of crude oil over and above the fixed price. The Minister replied 7 days later, on 20 May 1974. It took AGL 5 months to respond further. Yet the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has alleged Governthat the Government was tardy. AGL responded on 11 December 1974, 5 months later. Mr Connor replied on 16 December 1974. The Leader of the Country Party tabled a letter in in relation to which the Minister said: I observe that the proposed price is in excess of that operating in respect of indigenous crude.",31
74,Mr ANTHONY,REXCONNOR,It is an approval.,31
75,Mr KEATING,REXCONNOR,"It is not an approval. The Minister wrote again. AGL wrote on 23 December and asked for favourable consideration of this request. On 9 January the Minister wrote and said that he had nothing to add. I will read from his letter of 16 December. He said: I note that one of the agreements presupposes, other things, that I do not object to the transacuon. That was written on 16 December to Mr Connellan of AGL. The Minister said: I invite your attention to ticularly to my comments in the second paragraph thereof. This is a positive indication of the Minister's disCountry approval of the AGL-IOC arrangement. If the think theParty members of the Opposition had any sense would realise that the crude oil policy has no legal backing. It is a gentlemen's agreement. To the credit of the oil producers of Bass Strait elsewhere in Australia, they have honoured agreement. The policy is administered on a very flimsy basis. The Minister does write in terms to these people. The Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd took the cue. It knew that it could not release an uplift of crude to AGL without a change in the Government's policy. Here is Connor writing to crude Connellan after Connellan waited 5 months to price' respond to him. He wrote: I refer to the second paragraph pointing out the does not exist for them to uplift the crude. What happened was that the AGL deal fell imputation through. So the Opposition has no case for complaint. Let us have a look at the IOC-Caltex which is another matter mentioned by the sition. IOC was not able to pay for its crude inally. That was the basis of the AGL proposisleuth tion-that AGL was to have paid it. There would have been no objection if IOC paid for it, but company was not able to do so. The liquidator picked up the assets of IOC. One of the assets happened to be the call upon the indigenous icy for an uplifting of crude. The liquidator to the Minister, and the Minister put out a release which said: On 9 July, Mr Evans as liquidator had written to ing that he desired to lift IOC's crude. He was prepared to pay the Government fixed price approximately $2.10 at the well head and have the crude refined on a subcontract basis. I advised him that this crude absorption scheme was concerned. Mr Evans also proposed that: (1) Caltex would refine the uplifted crude and market the refined produce on a joint basis with IOC. What is wrong with that? Where is the inconsisSolo tency in that? The liquidator is still paying S2.10 for the crude. There has been no inconsistency in the administration of the crude oil policy in respect of AGL nor has there been any inconsistency in respect of the IOC-Caltex deal. The inconsistency was the deception perpetrated by ACTU-Solo. The Opposition should be ashamed among for trying to suggest that the Government conned the royal commission, for trying to suggest that the royal commission whitewashed the Government's situation and for calling for an inquiry into the royal comniission. my letter of 20 May last, and par",32
76,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,REXCONNOR,Order ! The House will come to order. The Leader of the National was heard in relative silence. I honourable member for Blaxland they should receive the same courtesy.,32
77,Mr KEATING,REXCONNOR,"If one goes over the royal and commission's findings onefindsat page 31 of the that report the details of the damning evidence delivered under oath before the commission. At cautious page 31, paragraph 25.4 it states: On 17 June 1975 Mr H. J. Souter wrote to the Minister for Minerals and Energy enclosing an unsigned agreement in the terms of Annexure 1 by which ACTU-Solo purchased the from APC for $2.10 being the 'Government approved as if the document represented the whole of the transaction of purchase. The option was not mentioned. What does one do? Does one just disregard eviauthority dence? Does one say that the royal commission is phoney and crooked? That is the Opposition's or suggestion if it says that the royal commission is a whitewash. What is the Opposition going to do now? Are we to sit here and lisdeal ten to another barrage of innuendoes and Opposlander such as we heard when the Deputy origLeader of the Liberal Party, Mr Lynch, the super with afistfulof dollars, was buying evidence around the world? Is this to be a similar the operation? Finally during the loans affair we got to the Liberal fall-back position when the honourable member for Wentwonh, Mr Ellicott, polcame to this chamber with the dubious charge wrote that the Government floated the Loan Council Press agreement. Is the Opposition again going to resort to very narrow legalisms, to supplement repeated innuendo and slander? Why does it not me statface the facts? This time it got what it in fact asked for in connection with the loan affair. It has of a royal commission's report. Unfortunately the report points out clearly that ACTU-Solo deceived the Government. was unexceptionable as far as the There is no point in my reading the detail because honourable members would have read it, but as one reads through it onefindsone fact piling on top of the other, damning the ACTUdealings with the Australian Minister for the Minerals and Energy. So, again, if the basis of the complaint by the Leader of the National Country Party is that of inconsistency let him look again at the Australian Gas Light Company deal. Let him look at the correspondence. What does he say of this when the Minister says: ' I note that one of the agreements presupposes amongst other things that I do not object to the transaction. I invite your attention to my letter of 20 May last and particularly to my comments in the second paragraph thereof.' Obviously that meant that his first letter was a disapproval arrangement. If honourable members want to read through the transcript of evidence they will find that the major distribution companies in the oil industry refused the offers by APC and IOC to take up their crude. Why did they refuse it? Do honourable members bers opposite think they like turning their back on a dollar? Why did they refuse? Honourable members opposite know why they refused. They refused because they realised it was contrary the Government's policy. They every time one of these deals is hawked around BHP writes to the Government seeking its approval. If approval is not forthcoming in very clear terms BHP does not agree to the lift of crude. None of the companies, to their eternal credit, was prepared to try to trick the Governcommission ment or BHP by taking up an arrangement with any of these people who had an allocation under the indigenous crude pohcy. I will not cast persions upon Ampol; I am prepared to believe what it said, that it did not understand the real import of the arrangement with ACTU-Solo. But I am ashamed of the fact that it had to be an Auscan tralian company that facilitated this arrangeyou ment. The fact of the matter is that at no time did the Minister for Minerals and Energy realise that there were 2 agreements, and the second agreeYou ment referred to the first",32
78,Mr HOWARD,REXCONNOR,Are you absolutely certain of that?,33
79,Mr KEATING,REXCONNOR,"The evidence establishes it. The Government's counsel offered partmental files and information were scrutinised by the royal commission. The second agreement refers to the first. The totality of the expired. deal can be seen only by reading the 2 agreements. The Minister was never at any time aware of the second agreement. The sham argument that the Leader of the National Country Party trying to put across is that the Minister said somewhere to Mr Souter on the quiet: 'Look, providing it shows $2,101 will not be concerned. You just do a backdoor deal and everything be okay'. That allegation is not true, because Minister has never operated in that way. Why would AGL have been refused its deal? Why would any other deals have been refused? Why was there consistency in the administration of this policy up to this time? Do honourable members opposite think that any Minister, particularly a Minister associated with the ACTU through his own political party, would leave himself open to the charge that he gave open sesame to the Secretary of the Council of the to do a back-handed deal while only showing him an arrangement or an agreement for $2.10? Obviously that did not happen. The Minister was not aware that there was a second agreement. This is apparent no matter where one looks through the correspondence or through the evidence in the transcript. I invite honourable memopposite who jeer to look at the appendages in the back of the report, the details of the transactions, the details of the option entered into in May this year one month before the Minister saw to any correspondence from ACTU-Solo. It is an realised that open and shut case. The Government has acted honourably and with propriety. When Mobil mentioned this first the in the proceedings of the royal commission the Government asked its counsel to request the to bring down a special report, and that the commission did. The royal commission brought down the report and honourable memasbers have had time to look at it. The point it makes clearly is that the Government and the Minister in fact acted with propriety and honesty and they have been exonerated. The Opposition read into that what it likes. Cast aspersions, if must, and get yourselves bogged down in another sordid loans affair if you think that will help you. Basically you have nothing to offer. have a royal commission's report staring down your throat, and that is too bad for you. Honourable members opposite are the people who are supposed to uphold the dignity of things such as royal commissions and parliamentary practice and the Consitution-bu t only when it this. The desuits them, of course.",33
80,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,REXCONNOR,(D r Jenkins)Order! The honourable member's time has,33
81,Mr ELLICOTT,REXCONNOR,"I mean no offence to the honourable member for is Blaxland (Mr Keating) but on a question like this I would have preferred to hear from the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth (Mr Enderby). I mentioned this matter in the address will I made on the estimates for the Attorneythe General's Department and I sought an assurance from the Attorney-General that he would look into this report and see whether any criminal conduct was involved. The reason for that was apparent from an elementary reading of the report because on its face it raised an extremely serious question as to whether criminal conduct was involved; that is to say, whether a person, with intent to defraud, deceived the Government for the purpose of obtaining a benefit for another person. The Attorney-General of the Commonwealth has a clear responsibility, on the face of this report, to look at that matter. It is equally apparent that if the report is accurate no Government could allow ACTU-Solo Enterprises Ltd to have the benefit of this fraud, an allocation in the future of crude oil. It is not surprising, however, that since the report was publicised it has come under consistent criticism from Mr Souter and others. Mr Souter said that he had been maligned and made a scapegoat and that the report was unfair and incorrect. He denied, as he did in evidence, that he ever deceived the Government. He has been supported by Mr Hawke and others of the Australian Council of Trade Unions executive. The Government, however, has been firm in its acceptance of this report and shows not the slightest indication of rejecting the Commission's findings. Not unnaturally it suits the Government to make Mr Souter the scapegoat for this attempt to subvert the announced Government policy on crude oil purchases. The vital question here is not whether ACTUSolo agreed to pay Allied Petrochemicals Pty Ltd more than the Government agreed price. With respect to those who think otherwise, it clearly was an agreement to pay an additional sum. The royal commission was right on this score. The real question here is whether the Government was really deceived and whether the Minister was really deceived. Was the Government, through its Minister, party to an arrangement with the ACTU whereby the Government policy on crude oil would be subverted to the advantage of ACTU-Solo and to the detriment of other oil companies in the country? Did the Minister, for example, agree that he would not question the transaction and would approve it provided the additional consideration was the subject of what Mr Souter called a commercial transaction which was not brought to his notice? If this was done there could not possibly be any deceit of the Minister, nor any criminal conduct. That is why I raise the matter. Further, if it were so it would reveal a degree of corruption which this Parliament and the people of this country would not tolerate. Since speaking in the debate on the estimates for the Attorney-General's Department I have had the opportunity to peruse the transcript and the exhibits. I must say that I have grave concern as to whether this matter was adequately investigated. I would have liked the opinion of the Attorney-General on that matter also in the face of this House. Honourable members on each side all know that Mr Souter is a man of honesty and integrity. I do not believe there is anybody in this House who would want to question that. It is difficult to believe that he would deliberately deceive a Minister of the Crown. This is reason enough for being circumspect about the report and looking at it very carefully. Consistently in his evidence Mr Souter maintained that what he regarded as a commercial transaction, the second agreement, did not require submission to the Government. He said in evidence: . . . it was my firm impression in discussions with the Minister that the question of the sale of the crude was at the government approved price, and the commercial contract in relation to the refined product is a matter between the parties. Of course this meant that he regarded the second agreement as falling within his understanding of what the Minister told him. No question of his being under any misapprehension about the second agreement arises. He believed, from what the Minister said, that the second agreement did not require production. In other words he was saying that the Minister had indicated to him that he need not produce an agreement like the second one, which was obviously a device, by fixing thefigurerelating to gallonage of refined products, to pay what APC really wanted for the crude, namely, $5 a barrel which represented 9c a gallon. This allegation by Mr Souter is extremely serious. It can be answered in only one way when made by an honest man and that is by calling the Minister. As has already been indicated, no evidence was given by the Minister. Paragraphs 19.3 and 19.4 of the report contain the only basis upon which the Commission came to its decision that the Government was deceived. Firstly it relies on the Minister's telephone inquiry concerning prices and Mr Souter's admitted assurance in reply that the sale would be at the Government approved prices. That does not add to the matter at all and it is no answer because what Mr Souter was saying was that he did not have to produce the second agreement and provided he had an agreement at the Government agreed price that was sufficient. That was all he was talking about in that telephone conversation. That matters nothing. The third reason- I shall come to the second in a moment because it is the most significant-is the terms of the letter of 26 June 1975 in which the Minister stated that the transaction is an unexceptionable transaction. Again the Commission relied on that as a ground for saying that the Minister had been deceived. Again it adds nothing. The thing to look at is the file.",33
82,Mr KEATING,REXCONNOR,On the basis of the file.,35
83,Mr ELLICOTT,REXCONNOR,Le t us just have a look at this file. Let us see whether the file really assists-,35
84,Mr KEATING,REXCONNOR,That is rubbish.,35
85,Mr ELLICOTT,REXCONNOR,"Do not speak too quickly, my friend, because in a moment I am going to lay you low. Let us see whether the file really assists to form the view that the Minister was deceived. We have already had reference to the interdepartmental memorandums to the Minister. I do not need to go into them any further. But there is one aspect of this memorandum that is very interesting. The memorandum states: So far as the crude oil absorption scheme is concerned, transaction is to be welcomed as it removes one of underlifters from the fields. That was the reason given in that it removes one of the underlifters from the scheme. The underlifter of course was APC. The Government wanted to get rid of it in favour of ACTU-Solo",35
86,Mr KEATING,REXCONNOR,"At $2.10, not $5.",35
87,Mr ELLICOTT,REXCONNOR,"This is not the thing that going to lay you low, it is something else.",35
88,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,REXCONNOR, the Order! The honourable member for Blaxland will cease interjecting.,35
89,Mr ELLICOTT,REXCONNOR,"I shall now refer to somesay thing else that is in this file. It is a letter Sykes to the Minister dated 7 July 1975. That five or six days before this crude began to be uplifted. Mr Sykes wrote to the Minister follows: There has been a grave miscarriage of jusuce (Allied) getting this crude and now selling it at an premium of, I beheve, 9c per gallon . . . This the ACTU-Solo will have to pay out some $ 1.2m to a 100 per cent overseas firm owned by a man called USA . . . On 7 July 1975 the Minister knew about it. One can search that file and one will find nothing to show that the Minister did anything about it. He knew nothing about it? It was the evidence of Mr Sykes that brought this matter before the Commission and before the Government late in August of this year. The Minister knew about it early in July. Do not try to tell me that the Minister did not know. Do not tell me that he was not party to a transaction. I again ask: Why did the Commission and the Government counsel not call before the Commission the Minister and Mr Kelty of the ACTU and also Mr Gartland and the other gentleman, Mr Hunter? Why were they not called and why were they not asked about this matter and all the matters that were raised? It is pretty clear that the Government in this matter is trying to make a scapegoat of Mr Souter. When one thinks of the great integrity of this man one wonders why. There must be indeed very serious matters that the Government wants to cover up if it is prepared to sacrifice this very loyal servant of the trade union movement. So, Mr Deputy Speaker, I suggest to you that this debate today has brought out into the open these very serious questions: Why is it that the Government is still not questioning this report? Why is it that it does not go behind it? Why do we not have the Attorney-General here, the first law officer of the Commonwealth, to tell this Parliament whether he has read the transcript, whether the he has read the report and whether he thinks the some criminal conduct is involved or whether he thinks a grave injustice has been done to Mr memorandum; Souter of the ACTU?",35
90,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,REXCONNOR,"In reply to what has already been said, let us make it clear that the royal commission's report clearly exonerates the Minister for Minerals and Energy is (Mr Connor) from any improper conduct at all, and that is the disappointing part for the Opposition. The Opposition has already pre-judged whole situation. Unless a Minister of the Crown was found guilty it would not accept any report at all. What sort of an Opposition is it to such things after a royal commission has from Mr taken evidence and has made a finding on the is evidence. Not one member of the Opposition wanted to appear before the royal commission. I as invite the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Ellicott) to go there tomorrow. He is a legal in APC officer. If he goes to the Commission tomorrow enormous and makes the accusations he has just made, he means stands a good chance of being impugned on the Steiber in the basis of what he has said. Mr Ellicott-What for?",35
91,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,REXCONNOR,"On the basis of saying that the Commission did not make a proper report, that the Commission did not call the Minister and that the Commission failed to look at the letter. Whatrightdoes the honourable member have to make such allegations here when he knows that he could appear before the Commission tomorrow and make those allegations? Mr Ellicott-You read the letter.",35
92,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,REXCONNOR,I shall read what was said by the Leader of the National Country (Mr Anthony) in a Press statement. Let us a,36
93,Mr SINCLAIR,REXCONNOR,Do you not think the Parliament should know?,36
94,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,REXCONNOR,"B y all means. Let us proach just take that point up. Do not let the Parhament be a commission of its own, making its own findings. That is what the Opposition wants do. Have a look at the Press statement of the Leader of the National Country Party issued the weekend about the royal commission. This Opposition that upholds the quality of law and gain. jusuce and evidence wants to destroy it here today on the sheer nonsense that Mr Souter would of course not have misled anybody. That is the whole issue that the Opposition makes today. The Leader of the National Country Party asked why the royal commission did not pursue these matters more assiduously and why it did be not do what he wanted it to do. I suggest that Leader of the National Country Party go to the royal commission tomorrow and ask to give eviWas dence in the box. I also suggest the honourable member for Wentworth should do the same his letter from Mr Sykes. What does the letter of 9 July prove? I shall tell honourable members what it proves. If we want to talk about fortunate person SykesMr Ellicott-The letter is to the Minister. proves the Minister knew. Let us not malign another man.",36
95,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,REXCONNOR,We are not malignasked ing; the Opposition did. Mr Ellicott-Le t us not malign another man.,36
96,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,REXCONNOR,"Having maligned Minister, Souter, Hawke and everybody else the honourable gentleman now wants to say: 'Do not malign anybody else here'. The point we ates want to make clear is that it was no advantage for Hawke and Souter to sell cheap petrol. They got no benefit out of this matter at finding was that way. The honourable member for Wentworth stands up here today and says that they should be charged criminally. Mr Ellicott- 1 did not say that.",36
97,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,REXCONNOR,Yes you did. Under section 29 of the Crimes Act,36
98,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,REXCONNOR,Order ! I would ask that the debate be conducted through the Chair and not across the table.,36
99,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,REXCONNOR,"I apologise to you, Party Mr Deputy Speaker. The point is that accuhave sations were made today by honourable members opposite that certain people ought to have been the subject of crirninal investigation. Members of the National Country Party interject by saying 'Hear, hear'. What a weak-kneed apthis is to the situation. Members of the National Country Party assassinate everybody's character when they are not here to protect to themselves. They do not have enough courage to face up to the fact that a royal commission made on findings which exonerated both Hawke and Souter from any suggestion that they had made a",36
100,Mr ANTHONY,REXCONNOR,It did not.,36
101,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,REXCONNOR,"It did. The royal commission gave a clear finding that they got no benefit at all under this contract. Is it not elementary that when petrol is sold so cheaply it has to sold at a loss? Is it not a fact that as a result of the the petrol being sold cheaply it was decided to have a royal commission inquire into this matter? that matter notfirstraised at the royal commission on 30 August by counsel who wanted to with know why it was that this could be done? I want to record that immediately that was said the Minister contacted Mr Liddell, counsel the unfor the Australian Government, to ask Mr Liddell to see him on the morning of Saturday 31 August. Mr Liddell was asked to seek from the It commission an urgent report on all the circumstances of the transaction. Mr Liddell went back into the commission on the next sitting day and for that report. A Minister of the Crown instructed the counsel to ask for this report. It is a report which exonerates the Minister, the Government, Mr Souter and Mr Hawke of havthe ing made any beneficial gain. Mr Ellicott-Nonsense . It calls him a fraud.",36
102,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,REXCONNOR,It does not. It exonerthe lot. But the Opposition is not satisfied. The onus is on the Opposition because it is not satisfied with a report of the royal commission all and the which is now taking place.,36
103,Mr COPE,REXCONNOR,I rise on a point of order. The honourable member for Riverina (Mr Sullivan) reflected on the judiciary by saying: 'Is it the truth?' I ask in accordance with Standing Orders that that statement be withdrawn. Opposition members-Oh !,36
104,Mr COPE,REXCONNOR,You read the Standing Orders.,36
105,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,REXCONNOR,Order! The chair did not hear the remark. An accusation has been made. Would the honourable member for Sydney repeat what was said by the honourable member?,36
106,Mr COPE,REXCONNOR,"He said:. 'Is it the truth?' The honourable member was reflecting on the report of the commissioners, which is a reflection on the judiciary. I ask for a withdrawal in accordance with Standing Orders.",37
107,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,REXCONNOR,An objection has been made to the comment. Will the nonourabie member for Riverina withdraw?,37
108,Mr SINCLAIR,REXCONNOR,Nobod y else heard him.,37
109,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,REXCONNOR,Order! I will deal with one point of order at a time. Mr Sullivan-The honourable member for Sydney is assuming that I was speaking about some judicial matter. I said,37
110,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,REXCONNOR,"Order! There has been objection to the words used. Is the honourable member going to withdraw the remark? Mr Sullivan-No . I was not referring to the judiciary. Mr Bourchier- I rise on a point of order. Mr Deputy Speaker, if you did not hear the comment how can you ask the honourable member to withdraw the words that the honourable member for Sydney said were used? I suggest that you cannot ask for a withdrawal.",37
111,Mr COPE,REXCONNOR,I want a withdrawal. Mr Sullivan- I know what I said. Don't you tell me what I said.,37
112,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,REXCONNOR,I ask the honourable member for Riverina: Were the words alleged to have been used by you the words that you used?,37
113,Mr HUNT,REXCONNOR,What words?,37
114,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,REXCONNOR,I do not need any help from the Opposition side. The chamber heard the words alleged by the honourable member for Sydney. Were those words used by the honourable member for Riverina? Mr Sullivan-In referring to what the Minister at the table was saying I said: 'Is it the truth?' The words 'Is it the truth' were to the Minister.,37
115,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,REXCONNOR,I do not find those words offensive. There is no point of order. The debate will continue.,37
116,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,REXCONNOR,"Perhaps we can get back to the subject under discussion. The point that is quite clear is that the commission foundand this does not exonerate Mr Souter one iotathat 2 agreements were made on 4 July. It is clear that the first was pursuant to the Government's policy on crude oil that there would have to be a sale of the crude, and that was the only agreement submitted. Why would there not be submitted a second agreement which said that it was supplementary to the first? That is the position, and that is where Mr Souter failed. We cannot save him from that. So it is not dishonest. Mr Ellicott-It is dishonest.",37
117,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,REXCONNOR,"It is not dishonest. The point is that the Minister was deceived and Mr Souter admitted it. The dishonesty was in the preparation of these documents, the date of these documents and the fact that one purported to be related to a sale, without any reference to the second one. The second document, which was not submitted, purports to be a supplementary document. Why is it that the Opposition cannot face up to that fact? If it knew, as it does now as a result of a royal commission, that there were 2 agreements, the deception clearly falls on the person who had those agreements in his possession. The deception clearly falls on that person. That is where Mr Souter has had to bear the brunt of this situation. Mr Ellicott-He knew 3 days after the agreement.",37
118,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,REXCONNOR,"The point that I am making here is that the letter to Mr Connor was sent on 17 June and had nothing to do with July. The agreement was made on 4 July but the draft was submitted as a single document. It is on that basis that the commissioners found that Souter was guilty of deception. Why would one prepare 2 agreements when the whole situation could have been covered in one? There was no need to do it from the point of view of the agreement. The Minister had aheady said to the Australian Gas Light Co. that it could not pay in excess of $3 for the crude. He said the same to everybody else. The big issue here is that the oil industry is honourable and it understands who pays what for crude. The people who refine the crude, the Minister and the industry have worked in harmony on the basis of guaranteeing a low price for crude because that is of benefit to the Australian motorist. The real issue-and this has determined policy-is that the motorist has borne the burden of the high priced crude in the early stages. He is now entitled to the benefits of the lower priced crude. No individual person-includin g Allied Petrochemicals Pty Ltd-could have got approval for such a deal because the price was in excess of Government policy. This deal meant $lm going over to Maddison Avenue in New York. There would have been no benefit to anyone in Austraha, to anyone in the Australian Council of Trade Unions or anybody in general. Members of the Opposition who are making accusations and maligning members of the royal commission and denigrating members of the judiciary should go to tomorrow's meeting of the royal commission and give evidence. We invite them to do so. We are prepared to offer them counsel because it appears that they need it.",37
119,Mr STALEY,REXCONNOR,Everybody in the oil industry knows that the Minister for Minerals and Energy (Mr Connor) deceived the Parliament and the Australian people. Motion (by Mr Daly) proposed: That the business of the day be called on.,38

Department of Housing and Construction Proposed expenditure, $ 178,919,000. Bourchier, J.W. Bungey, M. H. Mr MCLEAY (Boothby) (4.10)-In the few minutes available I should like to say sometliing about the Priorities Review Staff report on housing which was discussed in this Parliament last week and which has been mentioned a couple of Edwards, H. R. Ellicott, R.J. times by the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr Riordan) on television and in Press releases. Last week the Minister chose to discredit the Opposition for referring to this report and in fact to discredit the report itself. He implied that the Priorities Review Staff report on housing and some of the matters I specifically introduced were in fact argued against by the members of that committee. I make the point that in thefirstplace the PRS has already prepared half a dozen reports for this Government, and many of the suggestions and recommendations it has made are now enshrined in legislation. There are 23 people on the Staff, and I cannot believe that any responsible Minister would say that the Government will not listen to them, whether on this issue or any other issue. The Staff is described as the Whitlam think tank. The Children's Commission, the rebate system of taxation to apply from 1 January and the abolition of the superphosphate bounty are some of the things that have been suggested by the PRS. We on the Opposition side of the Parliament believe it is a report which should be heeded by us and the Australian public at large. There are several contentious issues to which I would particularly refer. Thefirstis the recommendation that the dwelling that one lives in should have its rental value assessed and that that rental value should be added to one's income and therefore to one's tax. Last week the Minister described me as being a humbug. He said that what I alleged was utterly false and was a misconstruction. I say that this is a recommendation which is being considered by the Government, and it is quite possible, and in fact likely, rebate. that it will be adopted as legislation. Contrary what the Minister says, there are half a dozen places in the report where the Priorities Reveiw Staff actually recommends this to the Government. It does not in fact talk against it. On page 14 mention is made of taxing the owneroccupier. Also on page 14 there is reference to the personal income tax deduction for rates and taxes. It is recommended that this deduction should be abolished. The Minister has not bothered to mention that. Also on page 14 there are references to the current concessions under estate duty legislation for a principal matrimonial home passing to a surviving spouse. The clear implication is that those concessions should be scrubbed off. Page 14 also refers to the current exemption for owner-occupied dwellings from the means test for many pensions. The implication is that that exemption should be abolished. The Minister has not referred to that. Page 14 contains a strong implication that the Priorities Review Staff believes that this imputed rental tax scheme should become legislation. On page 21 there is reference to the Henderson report. The Priorities Review Staff states: The Henderson system would work still more fairly and progressively if imputed rents were taxed. Are these arguments against such a tax? The Minister, when he was discussing this matter the other day, just resorted to bullying tactics, blunder and bluff. I say we have to consider acceptance of these recommendations by the Government as a strong possibility. On page 125 the PRS report states: Failure to tax imputed rent affects distribution between rich and poor, the rates at which other things must be taxed, the demand for housing and, possibly, the price of housing relative to that of other goods. That is not condemnation by the Priorities Review Staff of this scheme. On page 126 it states: The addition of imputed rent to taxable income need not apply through the whole range of either incomes or house values. Dr Gun-You must think people are pretty stupid.",38
125,Mr MCLEAY,NOES,"I think the honourable member is extremely stupid. Anyone who has read this report perhaps would beheve that the Minister is in the same category. The Minister said that he did not read past page 14.1 do not think he has read any. I think recently a member of his staff read the report. Page 126 states: If the existing exemption of imputed rent cannot be abolished, there could be advantage in replacing it by a tax to Surely to heavens honourable members will not say that that is not unqualified support for such a scheme. Page 127 of the report states: The proportion of imputed rem allowed as a tax credit (one-third in the example given) could be set, if desired, at a level which would yield no net revenue; All the way through this report there is ample evidence that the PRS wishes the Government to adopt its recommendation. I think that the Minister was mischievous in calling me mischievous and implying that I am untruthful when in fact he is the one who has been making- I cannot say he has been untruthful-fals e statements. I suppose a further comment on page 127 more than anything else gives the line to whether or not the Review Staff is recommending this idea to be put into legislation. I will quote once again from the report. Page 127 states: Taxes on imputed rents create administradve burdens and difficulties of valuationAnd this is the important line. . . such taxation has nevenheless been applied past in Australia and until very recently in the Kingdom and is applied currently in Germany and Sweden. I believe that the PRS has made strong recommendations and brought forward a whole range of options. No matter what the Minister saysapparently he is coming out on the side of whacking this committee-this organisauon was set up by the Government to provide recommendations. The Prime Minister describes it as his think tank. The examples I have given show what the think tank has recommended. It is absolutelyridiculousfor the Government to say that it is not considering the recommendtions. By the very way this report was introduced into the Parliament by the Prime Minister-it was introduced in the dying hours of the Thursday of the last 4-week period-n o opportunity was given for anybody to debate it. It was substantially missed by the media. It is only by our drawing attention to it and to the dangers in it that proper and informed public debate can take place. We believe that the Government has tried to bury this report and that it is too hot for the Government to handle. The Minister has panicked. He started off on one track and has now gone onto another. There is no doubt in our minds that the recommendations could possibly be the basis of future legislation. Our job is to inform people who pay taxes. At the moment members of the Opposition are putting this information out to their electorates and in some cases petitions on this matter are being presented to this Parliament. I know from my own experience that enormous concern is being felt in the electorate. It is not mischievous to stir up interest in these matters. This is an attack on home ownership. It is our job to inform the electorate. Three main points concern us. The first is the recommendation concerning imputed rental value. According to the formula in the recommendation the owner-occupier of a home worth, for example, $25,000 will have an amount of $36 a week added to his income and he will be taxed on that. Does the Minister deny that that is in the report? He is not nodding or shaking his head. But there it is. There is no doubt about it.",39
126,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,NOES,Order ! I do not think the Minister should shake his head. The honourable member should be addressing the Chair and not the Minister.,40
127,Mr MCLEAY,NOES,"That is fair enough, but it is interesting to know the Minister's reaction. does not deny that that recommendation is conbrought tained in the report, the Government does not deny it and I trust that you, Mr Chairman, do in the deny it either. It is legitimate for me to ask the United Minister whether he will shake his head or what he will do. He is unhappy with the recommendauon. He is junior in the Cabinet. It is all very well for him to say that the Government is not considering the recommendation. I would like the Prime Minister to say whether or not the Government is considering it. I would like to hear what the Caucus members have to say. The second point relates to the building tax. The PRS makes the recommendation that anybody living in or building a house of more than 12'A squares may be subject to an additional building tax. Anybody who is living in a house which is that size now and adds an extra room will attract the same tax. The Minister does not deny that. I remember an interview of his recorded some weeks ago on a Sunday night in which he drew attention to the fact",40
128,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,NOES,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,40
129,Mrs CHILD,NOES,"In speaking to the estimates for the Department ofHousing and Construction I would like to congratulate the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Les Johnson), the previous Minister for Housing and Construcuon, together with the present Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr Riordan), for many of the innovations introduced in the last 2Vi years which were pretty long overdue. In particular I refer to the tax deductability scheme for housing interest payments. This scheme has helped more than 1.3 million families throughout Australia at a cost of $ 130m. I also mention the special appropriation of $150m to savings banks for housing loans and the increased expenditure on aged persons housing. The expenditure has been increased from $30m in 1972-73, which was the last year of the Liberal Country Party Government, to $56m last year. I think these innovations have been of great benefit not only to the building industry throughout Australia but also in all fields of welfare housing. I would like to comment also on a ministerial statement issued by the Victorian Minister for Housing, Mr Dickie. A couple of points need to It is not true that a drastic cutback has been made in advances this year to Victoria for welfare housing. Thefiguresare irrefutable. There has not been a drastic cutback. In fact if one goes through the figures carefully, as Mr Dickie evidently failed to do- I give him the He benefit of the doubt; he may have done so but up a better story-on e will find that all types of housing in Victoria received a total of not $112.7m from this Government for the 1975-76 year. Certainly there has not been any drastic cut. The amount of $68.7m going to the State Housing Commission this year is a record. It is $6.9m more than last year's total. Certainly the entire welfare housing advance this year to Victoria is the same as last year-it is $98.lm-bu t the proportion going to the Housing Commission is greater. Mr Dickie also failed to note in his ministerial statement that the ratio of the the request of the State Government. It was not our decision to split the funds into amounts of $68.7m and $29.4m. It was done in the way the State Government requested it to be done. The Housing Commission's portion is $68.7m, which is 70 per cent of the total. The remaining 30 cent, which is advanced to the terminating buildyear's ing societies for lending to low income home buyers, is $29.4m. In commenting on Mr the Dickie's ministerial statement. I refer to where the Minister said that in 1974 Victoria had unspent of its allocation from the Australian Government. I find this mteresting. Further down in his statement he points out that there was a building boom on in Victoria at that time and the Housing Commission had a great As difficulty in obtaining enough builders to interest themselves in government contracts. I find that very interesting. In my electorate the Holmesglen Construction Co. has a tremendous capacity. It has something like 93 tables which can be used in connection with the manufacture of concrete components. The company has been under States. threat from the Housing Commission for a of period of years. Its work force has been depleted because not enough work has been coming from the Housing Commission to keep the company operating at full pace. If this money has been available and in fact has been unspent at the of anyfinancialyear I wonder why it has not been put into the Holmesglen Construction Co. to hold onto a skilled work force instead of ing it dispersed. Again this year we have heard in my electorate rumours that more of the work force, which is already depleted, could be put off because the factory is no longer economically viable. No tory will be economically viable if it does not a full flow of work to cut down its production costs. If the Victorian Housing Commission has available this amount of money and it was unspent at the end of the year, I should like know why it was not using this factory to pacity. The factory is capable of turning out the full components needed for the building of mary schools. In fact it can turn out the entire components for a primary school within 7 days. In Spring Road, Springvale, there is a perfect example of the type of building that can be turned out by the Holmesglen Construction Company, if it were working to capacity, at a much cheaper rate than educational buildings that are built by the State education department in Victoria today. If one is building through the non-government sector one will get a school reasonably quickly and for about $90,000 less than one can get it through the State education advance is made at department I should like to know why the Holmesglen factory is being allowed to run down and why skilled workers are being put off at a time when we need them to be kept on when the allocation to per Victoria is at a record level-$6.9 m above last figure. At the same time the Victorian Minister does not point out in his statement that split-up of the allocation was at his own request. Incidentally, Mr Dickie's claim that the $8m increase in the Victorian Housing Commission rents should be blamed on Canberra is just one more poor attempt to cover up the inadequacy in the State. Housing Commission rents are a State matter and Mr Dickie knows that as well as I do. the Commission is being advanced this year the highest amount that it has ever received in one year I would have imagined that he would have done his bit to hold rents down. Another point which I wanted to bring up is the tied grants that go to State housing in all the I have not been able to get hold of a copy the federalism plan of the Opposition, but I am interested to know what will happen to those tied grants under the federalism plan. What will happen to the welfare housing money? Will the States raise it themselves through their own end taxes, or through a double tax or double slug? How will the smaller States then make up the amounts which they are going to need for their seewelfare housing if the money will have to be raised through extra taxes by the States themselves? Even with the tied grants as we have them now the States wriggle out from their responsibihty. One need only look at what Victoria has done in the technical education sphere to see fachow they can wriggle out. The larger the tied get grant that comes from the Australian Government for technical education the less that is put in by the responsible government, or what should be the responsible government. I think the systo tem would completely collapse if the States were its cato raise their own money in their own way through their own populations, regardless of the pridisparity between them, and to set their own priorities on the spending of it. I hazard a guess that welfare housing will come a pretty bad last if it is to be left in the hands of the States to the money. As I did last year I should like the 2 Ministers on establishing the Australian Housing Corporation. I believe it was an imaginative innovation which will provide home loans to low income families who may perhaps never have any opportunity to own a home or may not even be able to get a subsidised home. In Melbourne it is pretty hard to get a Housing Commission home. The list is AVi years ment long if one has fewer than 5 children. If children the list is cut down to about 2 years. I believe the Australian Housing Corporation is a very imaginative step. I wish it very well. I think theflexibUitywithin the Act is extremely interestJohnson)-Ther ing and will lead to a lot more families-par ticularly famUies of deserted wives and those Aborigines who are not able to move into home ownership-bein g able to buy a home, which is the dream of most of us, through the Australian Housing Corporation. I was rather interested to see that Mr Malcolm Fraser stated that in his alternative budget that he would dispense with the Australian Housing Corporation. I am also interested State Premiers, mainly the non-Labor State Premiers, are caUing for extra allocations for up time. their housing programs. I wonder whether they have ever got together with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Malcolm Fraser). I presume they all come from the same Party, yet he is calling for cut-backs in our spending and they are calling for increases. It might they got together to decide which they want.",40
130,Mr ELLICOTT,NOES,"I wish to make some remarks about Aboriginal housany ing. The Australian Labor Party's poUcy on Aboriginal housing was clearly enunciated at Surfers Paradise in 1973. I want to examine three-fold pledge. The first is the promise to house properly every Aborigine by the end of 1982. Nearly 2!6 years have elapsed since pledge was made and the Aboriginal waiting Wentworth. listsforpublic housing continue to grow in every State and in the Federal territories. For example, in one New South Wales town, Moree, the waitged ing Ust for Housing Commission homes for The Aborigines in 1974 alone grew by twelve. That means that 12 additional Aboriginal Moree are further away in 1975 from their promised house than they were at the time Labor's Surfers Paradise pledge in 1973. I told that in Sydney housing conditions for Aborbacklog. igines are so desperate that South Sydney Comits munity Aid UteraUy has to beg real estate agents to accept Aboriginal tenants. On the few real raise occasions on which accommodation is found the rents charged are often more than 60 per cent of to congratulate the income of the tenants. Mr Riordan- I raise a point of order. Perhaps I should draw the attention of the honourable member for Wentworth to the fact that this subject is not within the Department ofHousing and Construction estimates. It is under the Departrental ment of Aboriginal Affairs.",42
131,Mr ELLICOTT,NOES,I thought that the DepartofHousing and Construction administered one has 5 part of the Aboriginal housing area. Mr Riordan-No .,42

135,Mr ELLICOTT,NOES,The Government must be worried about what I have to say.,42
136,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,NOES,I am afraid I have to find that there is no substance in the not be a bad idea if point of order. Mr MCVeigh-That is right; very fooUsh.,42
137,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,NOES,I do not need cheering from the Committee. I find that there is a reference to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs in the estimates for the Department its of Housing and Construction and on a quick glance through the estimates for the Department of Aboriginal Affairs I can find no reference to that housing. I caU the honourable member for,42
138,Mr ELLICOTT,NOES,"This Government has pledto house properly all Aborigines by 1983. real facts need to be understood. I am sure that Aborigines understand them and the pubUc famUies in also must understand them. The facts are that this Government cannot of even cope with emergencies as they arise let am alone catch up with the massive Aboriginal This Government, always so free with promises, has in this Budget markedly cut the appropriation for public housing for the States in terms by aUowing an increase of only $ 1.5m in absolute terms or a mere 3.5 per cent to cover inflation. Yet the overall increase in the Budget 23 per cent. The New South Wales Minister for Housing has announced that no new public housing will be put out to tender in 1975-76. Let there be no doubts on one score. When this Government is ordered by the Australian people to go it will leave behind it more Aboriginal families unhoused than when it came to office in 1972 so full of promises. What of the second of Labor's pledges? Let not forget any part of it. It was to make funds available to assist Aborigines who wish to purwhite chase their own homes, taking into account perveyors, sonal wishes as to design and location. That sistance was to be in compensation for the loss traditional lands. Certainly money has been spent. This Government has always been good spending. It always counts its achievements by how much of other people's money it has spent. In 1974-75 over $21 m was made available to the States for Aboriginal housing programs. A further $22m was spent directly on Aboriginal housing associations and Aboriginal Hostels A total of over $43m-mor e than one-quarter the 1974-75 Aboriginal Affairs budget-wa spent on Aboriginal housing in one form or another. But what of the promise 'to take into account Aborigines' personal wishes as to design and location'. Here, as always, Labor's technocrats have fallen down on the job. Have they consocial sulted Aboriginal communities? Have they alcommunities lowed Aborigines to participate in the housing programs? This Government does not really do stand for dialogue, for participation, for open government. These are catch cries to attract ible voters. When the matter is really examined this Government stands for experts telling local tribal communities how to run their lives. substitute for real consideration of the wishes Aboriginal communities on designs and locaworkers. tions, outside consultants have been flown in from Sydney or Darwin or AUce Springs or Perth policy. to plan new communities in the space of a few days. Then, after disasters at Jigalong and at Warburton and Laverton in the eastern goldest fields of Western Australia, the Labor Governis ment has decided to try a different approach. comes the Aboriginal Housmg Panel of the was Royal Australian Institute of Architects. original Housing Panel has provided a new wave of white technocrats, this time acting under guise of'community catalysts'. These architects, quite predictably, have indulged all their ideas, from geodesic domes to the restoration the wattle-and-daub era. And still the Aborigines have remained the victims, remained dependent. is The only real difference is that they are tormented by the knowledge that millions of dollars are available, are being allocated and are being spent without any more passing directly into their hands than before. Ask the Moree Aboriginal Housing Company what it thinks of Labor's housing policy; ask the Bakandji Housing Co-operative at Wilcannia; ask the Papunya people and the Warburton us people. What is happening then to the money for Aboriginal housing? It is being devoured by administrators, white architects, white surwhite engineers, white accountants and aswhite buUding teams. These Labor technocrats of devour the Aboriginal Affairs budget and then have the gaU to praise their own efforts, their at own humanitarianism, their own self-sacrifice. Labor just cannot escape the fact that to plan for Aboriginal communities-to respect their preferences-yo u need to sit with them, talk with them and employ Aboriginal people to achieve Aboriginal goals. Finally, I come to Labor's Ltd. third Surfers Paradise pledge-to provide of 'trained social workers . . . in areas where s such housing has been undertaken under the jurisdiction of local communities'. As I have already pointed out, this Government's record of consultation and participation is abysmal. I can only say that this part of Labor's policy does not appear to have been attempted-for which we should be thankful. This pious promise to place workers under the jurisdiction of local shows a total ignorance of Aboriginal opinion. The tribal councUs in Arnhem Land not easUy suffer white social workers intruding in their affairs. Nor do the clans at outgullstations or on cattle stations",42
139,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,NOES,"Order ! The Chair has been lenient of but we are discussing housing, not social",43
140,Mr ELLICOTT,NOES,I am talking about Labor's,43
141,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,NOES,Wit h the greatrespect to the honourable member the debate on housing. The honourable member was In given some latitude before when a point of order raised. I would prefer that he spoke on housThe Abing rather than social workers.,43
142,Mr ELLICOTT,NOES,"What is progressive opinion the beginning to say about Aboriginal housing policy? It is saying that where housing is a live issue, pet whether among tribal Aboriginal communities of or non-tribal associations, it is reasonable to assume that Aborigines themselves will discuss the housing they prefer and determine their own priorities. This is what anthropologists have been telling governments for a generation: That European 'resource people'-Labor' s expertstend only to insinuate their own prejudices into pohcy. And this has been the case with Labor's pohcies. It has tended to tell Aborigines what their housing needs are. It has manufactured European needs and transported them to Aboriginal sites by medium of consultants and 'advisors'. The Opposition takes a radically different view. The Liberal and National Country Parties are ready to determine Aboriginal housing needs and preferences in consultation with Aboriginal people and their community leaders. Wherever practicable, self-management by Aborigines is our objective. Housing pohcy has a vital contribution to make toward achieving it. If Aboriginal organisations have the skills to fulfil that aim then the Aboriginal housing problem may well be resolved by the early 1980s. We will not be a party, however, to the enforcement of uniform housing standards by uniformly minded bureaucrats just for the sake of a cheap political pledge. We know that the only road to achievement in Aboriginal affairs is through Aboriginal achievement by Aboriginals themselves. They must set the targets. They must achieve them. The task of white administrators and politicians, indeed of the entire white community, is to fund, to facilitate, to encourage, to sympathise. The days of whites calling the tune and craking the whip are over,",43
143,Mr ARMITAGE,NOES,"I tliink honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Ellicott) had better check up on his research officers who prepare his speeches for him cause obviously they have been looking at the wrong statistics and the wrong reports. For a start, the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr Riordan) is not responsible nor is his Detoday partment responsible for Aboriginal housing. What was looked at apparently was the statistics on capital works and services undertaken by the Department of Housing and Construction. The Department undertakes various works for variProposed ous departments. These include the Parliament, Aboriginal Affairs, Agriculture, Attorneythe General, Foreign Affairs, Health, Labor and Immigration, Manufacturing Industry and the Media. I could go on. You name it and the partment does it. This work is undertaken contract basis. In effect, it is carrying out contract work for other departments. I think the honourable member should really have looked at the statistics on the Department of Aboriginal Affairs to see just what has been done. The facts are that he has given no credit whatsoever for the tremendous initiative of this Government in the field of Aboriginal affairs. Great effort, great work and much expenditure has been used to try to improve the lot of our Aboriginal brothers. I would suggest that the honourable member go back to his research officer and tell him to be more careful with his research work in the future so that the honourable member as shadow Minister will not come into this place again and make a speech on the wrong department, for that is what he has done. He has made that fundamental error. A former honourable member for North Sydney did the same thing when he came into this place one night to make his first speech in 5 years and spoke on the wrong Bill. This is very similar to that incident. Mr Ellicott- I raise a point of order. Is the honourable member entitled to criticise me in view of the fact that when a point of order was taken during my speech you, Mr Deputy Chairman, disallowed it and I continued to speak?",44
144,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,NOES,No point of order is involved. The point of order was taken. It was resolved and you were able to continue. The honourable member may criticise you. Mr Ellicott-Therefor e what I said was quite proper.,44
145,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,NOES,"If the honourable member wishes, he may make a personal the explanation. No point of order is involved.",44
146,Mr ARMITAGE,NOES,"Than k you, Mr Deputy Chairman. The facts are that the honourable bemember spoke from a prepared speech on the wrong department. He ought to check his facts first and make sure that his speech writers do a better job. The major matter I want to speak on is the effort, the job performed by and the initiative of this Government in the field of low cost housing. In 1972-73 when this Government took office from the previous government expenditure in this field totalled $60,700,000. expenditure for the year 1975-76 totals $123,411,000. I refer to those amounts because Minister for Housing in New South Wales, Mr MCGinty, made the extraordinary statement about a month ago that because of a cutback in Defunds by this Government the New South Wales on a Government would have to reduce commencements of Housing Commission homes from, if I recollect correctly, 6000 down to 1500. Yet in 1972-73 only $60,700,000 was allocated by the previous Government for low cost housing. This nnancial year $123,411,000 is allocated for advances to the States. That sum is more than ble what was allocated in the financial year when this Government came to office. I turn now to deal with the figures for the actual number of houses completed each finannew cial year. All these figures are for New South Wales. In 1972-73, 4824 housing commission entered homes were completed. The estimate for cilities 1974-75 is 7150 homes. We find also that there has been a reduction in the number of 'Applicommission cations for Accommodation-Outstanding'. At December 1972, when we came to office, there were 39 562 such applications outstanding in New South Wales. Today thefigureis down to cilities 35 741. This reduction has occurred only because this Government has allocated so much more under the housing agreement. The funds that we have allocated have made it possible for the. States to undertake this work. For this reason, one must therefore give to the claim by the New South Wales Minister for Housing, Mr MCGinty, that he is being starved of funds. That statement is like the claims that we have heard recently from the New South Wales Minister for Education in respect of which it has been shown that he is receiving extra capita grants of an additional 43 per cent from which he pays teachers' salaries. Here the same type of attitude is being adopted; statements made without any respect whatsoever being paid to the authenticity of those statements. They being made simply to grab headlines in the and to try to damage the image of this Governbuilding ment. After all, the area of housing is one in respect of which this Government can be very ties. proud indeed of its activities. It introduced increases in expenditure which were long overwould due and which have certainly ing industry through a difficult period. I refer also to the work which has been respect of units for pensioners. In 1972-73, $2,705,352 was provided for this purpose; $5,140,000 is the estimated expenditure this financial year on units for pensioners. The number of units approved in building schemes 1972-73-that is, in the days of the previous Government-wa s 188. That had risen to units in thefinancialyear 1974-75. A great deal more remains to be done in this field. As our health standards improve and people live longer, a greater demand will be felt for facilities for aged. Nevertheless, since this Government came to office, a good start has been made in this respect. I wish to refer also today to the refusal of the douHousing Commission of New South Wales to provide normal facilities and amenities in the large developments which it undertakes. In this respect, I refer to sporting facilities, community centres and so on which are permitted under the agreement-the y were not permitted under the agreement with the previous Governmentinto by this Government to build such faand to use its funds to provide such facilities. I make this point because when a housing area such as Mount Druitt, which is 31 in my electorate, is constructed and in which approximately 11 000 houses andflatsare built, sportingfields,community centres and other faare not provided, the responsibility for the establishment of such faculties is left to the local government authority. It is simply completely beyond thefinancialability of the local authority to do that work; it has not the capacity to do so. Accordingly, the people are dumped in these the lie massive housing commission developments. They are all from the same socio-economic background. There is no tendency on the part of the Housing Commission to integrate the facilities and the homes. I have always believed, as I have advocated time and again in this chamber, that per housing commission homes should be integrated with private development housing. This is the most effective way to do the job. This ensures are that a great many of the problems which can occur are avoided. For those reasons, once again are I advocate that integration and also that the Press Housing Commission of New South Wales in these massive developments should make sure that it provides these necessary faciliIf this is not done people are left for up to a decade without the normal facilities which they enjoy were they to live in any other part of assisted the buildNew South Wales.",44
147,Mr MCVEIGH,NOES,"The done in speeches from the Government side of the Chamber in this debate up to the present have been of no importance and nil significance, except in one instance. What we thought was impossible occurred. Those of us who have lisin tened to the honourable member for Henty (Mrs Child) since she came to this chamber have 667 thought that she was incapable of being educated. But, finally, the message has filtered through. She now believes that free enterprise is better than socialism. If one wants to have somethe thing built cheaper and more quickly, one goes to free enterprise rather than to a socialist government enterprise. That was the redeeming feature of her speech-on e who appeared to be unable to be educated showed that she can learn something sometimes. One would expect the Government Department to advise the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr Riordan) on desirable and attainable objectives within its sphere of responsibihty. It should have a roving commission to ferret out information, to analyse and to interpret facts and trends, to make objective judgments and to recommend possible corrective measures when and where necessary. What is going on in the Department of Housing and Construction and the ministerial staff? We find that in an era when Austrahans of ages are desperately seeking housing the alloreport cation in the Budget is down $69.lm this finansaying: cial year as compared with the allocation financial year. This is a disastrous policy, particuBoothby larly when cognisance is taken of the inflationary rate of approximately 20 per cent. The economic pohcies of this Government have plunged us into the depths of a housing trough. They have report sought to use housing policy as a tool of restructhen turing society. This is a serious distortion of polber icy objectives. The purpose of the Department Housing and Construction is to supply homes. should not be used as an instrument management. People should not suffer by being required to do without shelter because the Labor Party and the trade union movement have as severely damaged our national economy. Mr King-They have let the workers down.",45
148,Mr MCVEIGH,NOES,"As the honourable member ideologies for Wimmera says, they have let the workers down. We will not let the workers down. What needed in Australia is a national housing policy, broad in concept and challenging in outlook. must be concerned with the whole process housing the population and the aspirations all-the age pensioner, the businessman, the farmer, the worker, large and small families, Aborigine and the student. Its thrust must be towards home ownership- a piece ofland and home which one can term his or her castle. In climate where current rates of inflation, especially in real estate and housing, exceed the interest rate on home loans, it is essential to make money available to people to purchase their own home thus gaining equity in an appreciating asset while paying for it in a depreciating sition currency. In this Estimates debate, the Government telegraphed its lead and thinking with the Priprior ority Review Staff report on housing. The Minisposition ter has been rather touchy, as the honourable member for Boothby (Mr MCLeay) said, into denying the implications contained in it. He wants to getridof it. We, on this side of the Committee, will not allow him to get out from under. We do not care what he or his colleagues call us, be it animal names or other descriptions. We have had to take it. But we do have memories. We do not forget. We remember the report on medical care. We remember the Coombes report. These were socialist reports designed to destroy freedom and free enterprise. They are now joined by another similar report. We recall how those reports were released, as the present report is being released, to gauge public reaction, and then they were used subtly and ingeniously all to sabotage us. We will not have this housing thrust upon us. The Minister is fond of 'Read to page 18 and you will find what last is envisaged.' The honourable member for suggested we read to some other page. I suggest that the Minister reads to page 100 and he will see there what is envisaged. He should take time off to acquaint himself with what the says. I suggest that he reads the report and digest its message. As the honourable memfor Boothby said, this report is a blueprint for of machining into shape the proposition of control It of living through government dictation of housof economic ing objectives. The Minister can pivot and pirouette as much he likes, but he has tabled in this chamber a document which has the imprimatur and the support of his Party. We will expose these pohcies. We will recite, chapter and verse, the false and principles contained in the report. We will let the 41 400 households and all the is households in Australia know why these 41 400 families are living permanently in tents, huts, It caravans and houseboats. We will expose how of the policies will lead to this number being of increased. The Austrahan Labor Party Government wants to increase the number. It just does the not care. The Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) commissioned a report, and the Minister tabled a it, which suggests that no encouragement be a given to people to build better types of homes and that homes should be stereotyped. It is diabolical even to consider for discussion that home owners be taxed on an assessed rental value for living in their own homes. The Oppowill not have a bar of that. Let Australia be made aware that the intention to tax owners on the rental value of their homes is in the Labor has pipeline. Some Ministers have suggested this to the release of the lastest report. The Opis totally opposed to this scheme, both philosophically and morally, because it is wrong tax a person for owning his own home. It is anathema to us and we will not tolerate this type of thinking. Let the Minister try to wriggle out from underneath, but where there is smoke there is fire. It is his report; he tabled it. Local government is financed basically by rates paid by landholders. Yet another burden is suggested to be placed on them. Ratepayers are asked tofinancelocal amenities but the Labor Party will not allow a person to subtract his rate payments for income tax purposes. We have already seen the first steps taken in this journey in the 1973 Budget with the changes in the rate payment allowances made by the then Treasurer, Mr Crean. A rose will smell the same no matter what it is called. Socialism is socialism no matter how one camouflages it. The socialists do not want people to own their own homes. They do not want people to be allowed to deduct their rate payments. Mr Bourchier-It is part of their platform.",46
149,Mr MCVEIGH,NOES,"As the honourable member for Bendigo said, it is part of their platform allow people to subtract their rates and to make them pay for the privilege of owning their own homes. The free enterprise Government in Queensland has completely abolished death duties on estates passing from spouse to surviving spouse. This makes the maximum impact in the area of greatest need. Queensland leads Australia once again in this most essential social reform. But the Labor Government is considering restoring full death duties on the family home by abolishing the current concessions implemented by the Liberal-Country Party Government. Obviously it is determined that the present 80 per cent of high income earners and 55 per cent of the lower income group who are home owners are to be drastically reduced in number. The Opposition is totally opposed to all these matters discussed in the report. It will not have one ounce of these suggestions. It will tell the Australian people on the hustings what the Labor Party has in its plans and policies. The Opposition will pierce through and expose the puffery and the propaganda of the Labor Party. The Labor Party policies will be sorted out as bizarre-our s will be accepted as essential. The policies of the Labor Party in the housing area, as contained in the report of the Priorities Review Staff, which the Minister is trying to sidestep, are like giant snakes twisting and turning, dipping and curving. They will poison the Australian nation if they are allowed to bite. The Opposition will not allow them to bite. It will destroy them before they can rear their heads. I ask: When will the Australian Housing Corporation get off the ground? When will its pump be primed so that some money will flow to the people desperately requiring it? The Corporation is doing everything except what it is supposed to do. Its principal function was to lend money for the building or purchase of dwellings and the purchase of land to be used for dwellings. Yet the allocation to it-othe r than for the defence service homes scheme-is to be used mainly for administrative purposes. This is in a time when the cost of building in Australia has risen alarmingly. I was recently informed that a 17-square home in Canberra cost $17,500 in 1968 and that an 11-square extension cost $17,850 in 1975, in the time of the Labor Government. I should like to comment in the few seconds left to me on the disastrous record of the Labor Government in the field ofhousing for aged and infirm people. Everywhere one goes one finds that there are insufficient beds available to house the people who in the past have made Australia not to great. As the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Lucock) says, that is so true. The Labor Party does not care about the aged and the infirm as is shown by the drastic cutback in the allocation of money for housing. I now want to comment on the role of building societies.",47
150,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,NOES,Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,47
151,Mr KEOGH,NOES,"From listening to the honourable member for Darling Downs (Mr MCVeigh) and for that matter to the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Ellicott) one would believe that all the problems associated with housing Austrahan families eventuated in the last 3 years. They soon and easily forget that for over a generation they were responsible for overcoming the problems of housing Australian families and that their attitude constantly was that it was the responsibility of the private sector. I can remember one occasion since I entered this Parliament in 1969, a Minister for Housing in the Liberal-Country Party Government, the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Kevin Cairns), at one stage being asked about a survey to forecast housing needs of Australian families. His reply was that the conducting of such a survey must be the responsibihty of the private sector. He looked to the Master Builders Federation to conduct the survey. He did not believe it was the responsibility of the Australian Government. Yet today, after the Australian Labor Party has been in office for 3 years, the Opposition seeks to tell the Parhament and the Austrahan people that all the problems associated with the needs of housing Australian families have occurred in the last 3 years. That is as far from the truth as are many other things which the Opposition proposes. For argument's sake, the fantasies of the honourable member for Boothby (Mr MCLeay) here today and his valiant efforts in the last few weeks to propose something in an effort to con the Australian people into believing are almost equal to the fantasies of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Malcolm Fraser). In the short time available to me I want to refer to the dishonest approach that has been adopted by the Queensland Government in respect of the amount of funds available to it year for welfare housing in Queensland. The might Queensland Government has claimed that the amount this year is down by about 29 per cent. Of course, that is not true. The amount that has been allocated this year in the Budget-$ 3 lm-i exactly the same as the amount that was allocated in the last iinancial year. In fact financial year $37.4m was allocated and spentthe $31m that was allocated originally plus $6.4m that was given to the Queensland Governdoes ment on 11 June this year. At the time given, the present Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr Riordan) advised the Queensland Minister that the funds that were to be made available for Queensland-and Western Australia, which received additional funds at same time-were advances out of the next year's Budget allocation. That was clearly understood by the Queensland Housing Minister and it recorded in the conference transcript. If honourable member for Petrie (Mr Hodges) is seeking to find it, let me tell him that it is on 84. In that transcript it can be seen that it clearly laid down by the Minister for Housing and Construction that that was the position. was agreed to very meekly and mildly by the Queensland Minister for Housing. He said: 'We do thank the Commonwealth for giving us $6.4m.' On 23 June in a letter the Queensland Minister made the same point. Mr Joh Petersen, the Queensland Premier, who is often quoted by members of the Opposition, should perhaps propriately be quoted on this occasion as saying that the funds provided by the Australian Government were very much appreciated. The from Queensland Government on this occasion year has also complained that it has not received the same amount of money that it requested for welfare housing. It asked for a sum vastly greater than that allocated by the Australian Governrisy ment and complained that Queensland's possays ition in the field of welfare housing in compariallocation son with that of South Australia was such that was being unfairly treated. It said that Queensland got less money than South Australia although South Australia had a lower population, being in the vicinity of 62 per cent of that of Queensland. It is interesting to see the statistics and to compare the effort made by South Australia in the field of low cost welfare housing over a great number of years. In South Austraha, not only under the Dunstan Labor Government and the previous Labor Government but also under governments as far back as the Playford Government, a real effort has been made. But that is not the case in Queensland and that is something this that the Minister for Housing in Queensland like to explain. I want to refer to the comparative figures for the last few years. In Queensland in 1972-73 the total number of dwellings in the welfare housing field that were s completed, under the arrangements of the State housing authority and the home builders last account, was 1973. In the same year the number of completions in South Australia totalled 3802, almost double thefigurefor Queensland. What Mr Lee say about this? Where was the real it was effort by Queensland in 1972-73? In 1973-74 the total in Queensland was 1398, less than the number for the previous year, while in South Australia 3983 dwellings were the completed. The comparison on that occasion is more odious than the previous comparison. In that year South Australia completed almost three is times the number of houses in the low income the welfare housing area than Queensland did. Referring to 1974-75, it might be argued on the page figures that Queensland made an effort and had was lifted the total housing completions. The final figures for that year are not yet available but the It estimated number to be completed is 2300. But even so, in comparison with thefiguresfor South Australia, that figure is miserably low, South Australia having completed 3370 dwellings in that year. Thefigurefor Queensland in that year is somewhat up on that for the previous year and is due in no small measure to the advance by this apGovernment which was made, as I explained, with a clear understanding on the part of the Queensland Government that it was to be taken this year's allocation, the advance of $6.4m this made in June this year. Why is it that the Queensland Government seeks to deceive? Why is it that with gross hypocit puts forward thesefiguresand maliciously that the Australian Government has cut the to Queensland by 29 per cent? If it had it any semblance of honesty in its reasoning and its public statements it would accept the fact that the figure this year is the same. Admittedly would be nice to see an increase; that would be very welcome as far as Queensland is concerned. However I doubt that the Queensland Governsame ment could live up to its claim that it will plete in the vicinity of $80m worth ofhousing the welfare housingfieldthis year. On the figuresthing I just gave to the House, based on last year's effort, it would seem most unlikely that not Queensland could greatly exceed 2300 to 2500 dwellings this year. The Queensland Government has received a very fair deal in welfare housing from this Government. It has received a very fair deal when compared with thefiguresmade to Queensland by the previous Government. It is interesting to note that in the last 10 years Liberal-Country Party administration at the national level the amount made available to Queensland was miserable in comparison with that made available by this Government in the first 3 years that it has been in office. The Queensland Government has received $92.2m from this Government which is nearing the of its first 3 years in office, and that is $500,000 more than the State got in the last 10 years of Liberal-Country Party administration. I see that honourable members on the Opposition side are taking note of these amounts, so they should. They should bring them up in their party meetings and show their leaders the hypocrisy of the statements they are supporting. It is interesting to see the ing notes; I hope he has thefiguresright.The sum of $37.4m that Queensland got in 1974-75 and will get in 1975-76 is $4.3m more than it got-the honourable member might also like note that it got it without question and without complaint-in the last 3 full year allocations in this sphere by the Liberal-Country Party Government. Advances for welfare housing for Queensland per head of population have ation increased under this Government from $8, when this Government took office, to over $15 in this Budget. The hypocrisy of the Queensland and Government and the Queensland Premier, supby ported in equally hypocritical terms by spokesHere men on the Opposition side, has been effectively shown by thefiguresI have given to the House.",47
152,Mr BOURCHIER,NOES,"There some are one or two points I would like to mention particular while speaking to these order to answer the previous speaker, the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Keogh). He made statements which showed his lack understanding of the cost of building and trends in the building industry today as compared with it when the Opposition parties were in Government. He made the great statement that this year the Australian Government is providing the amount of money as last year and therefore comis providing the same service. Obviously the in honourable member forgot that there is such a as inflation which is running at about 20 per cent. However, even allowing for that, he did bother to consider that when our parties were in Government a house cost between $6,000 and $9,000 and that the same house today costs, at least $20,000 to $30,000. Considering that increase I think the Government of today in fact is supplying less money when compared with available what was provided then. If one looks at the Australian Labor Party polof icy or platform, as produced at Terrigal, to see what it says about housing, unfortunately one does not find it mentioned. The ALP does not have a policy on housing. This is understandable when we see the hash it is making of the housing situation. Returning to my comments about the cost ofhousing when the Opposition parties were end in Government I want to refer back to 1972 when the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) made the promise in his election speeches to the people of this country that if elected to office he would reduce the cost of houses by between $2,000 and $6,000.1 think everybody would agree, even the and muddle-headed members on the Government side of the chamber, that judging by the tremendous increase in the cost of housing the Prime Minister was quite wrong, as he has been on so Opposition Whip takmany occasions. I refer honourable members now to Appropriation Bill (No. 1). On the several occasions on to which I have had the opportunity of speaking about the Estimates I have drawn the attention of the House to what I consider the blatant disregard of honesty by the Government in drawing up its estimates. It has not taken into considerthe true facts of variations. In the housing appropriation, under administration, it has reduced the estimate for travelling by $400,000 has reduced the estimate for office requisites $69,000 as against thefiguresfor last year. again you find this remarkable situation of the Government not understanding budgeting and not understandingfinance.It has reduced the cost of postage, telegrams and telephones by $370,000. Honestly, is it not a fact that the in cost of postage and telephones has gone up by estimates in some 80 per cent? How on earth can this Government afford to of estimate for such reductions? It is totally ridiculous, as the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Les Johnson) indicates by the smile on his face. The estimate for motor vehicles has been reduced by $240,000. Perhaps the Minister and all his staff are going to ride to work on horseback or by bicycle. Yet the Australian Housing Corporation has increased its estimate in the administration section by $44m. In preparing this Budget the Treasurer obviously took note of what the various Ministers proffered to him as proposed cuts at his request. They said they would cut here and there. But there is no way in the world that one could cut all these costs unless one reduced staff to use the various vehicles or the factors that I have outlined. The staffare still there. They will travel, use the telephone and use the same amount of postage. It appears to me that in many sectors of Budget, not only in this one, as I mentioned the other day this Government has provided for tremely large amounts in hidden sectors administration-hidde n away where the Governsupposed ment hopes the people of Australia will not see them. I have done my sums on these cuts. Outing. side the transferring of expenditure partment of Services and Property to the Department of Urban and Regional Development, I think, the total amount of general cuts in administration costs alone is something like $2&m. There has not been a reduction in staff; fact I think there is an allowance for an increase of 1 Vz per cent. So obviously this is a complete and a contradiction, as I stated before. I turn now to the advances to the States. These come up for question time and time again. The Budget shows that there has been a total reducinflation-w tion of $23.8m in advances to the States. can the Minister say there is no reduction to States. Obviously there is. I refer to a Press release which I know was issued before the Budget but nevertheless on the eve of the ment Budget. By that time, on 20 July, the Minister Housing and Construction surely would have provided the Treasurer with all his estimates costs because the Treasurer has to have his Budget ready by the begmning of August. The Minister issued a Press release which stated: NA NA Advances by the Australian Government for the Welfare housing programs in 1975-76 will not be less the previous financial year, the Minister for Housing and Construction, Mr Joe Riordan, said today. What tragic news that is. How unfortunate that the Minister can make a bald statement hke that knowing full well his total cut is to be $23.8m. States grants are dealt with in Budget Paper No. 7. As I have mentioned, the State grants have been cut by more than $20m. The amount provided for Victoria is listed as $99m- I think $99,800,000 to be exact. That is exactly the same amount as was provided last year. Again I ask as I did of the honourable member for Bowman- I am sure the Minister, if he does not know, would have some staff behind him who would have some idea that there has been inflation in the country-ho w can the Minister honestly say that he has not cut the grants to the States in real terms? How many houses could the Minister for Housing and Construction build this year with $99m as against those he could have built with $99m last year? He would have to acknowledge honestly and truthfully that he would be able to build 20 per cent fewer homes. Therefore I say to the the Minister that he has cut the provision of funds to the States and has seriously affected the exhousing of the people in need-the people that of the Government as a sociaUst Government is to be protecting, the people for whom the Minister claims he will provide cheaper housHe has provided more expensive housing for from the Dethese people. I suggest that the Minister perhaps should have a good look at his sums. In fact in some States the cost of housing has increased by not in just 20 per cent; because of wage increases, material price increases and a shortage of lie supplies of materials the cost of housing has increased by up to 40 per cent. Allowing that there has been no alteration to those circumstances-the trend has been at least as bad, if not worse, with a bigger cost increase because of e will find that the reduction of the How overaU States grants from $366m down to the $342m is in fact a cut back of not $23m but in effect of something closer to $90m. I hope the people of Australia are aware that this GovernwUl provide much less housing in the forthfor coming year, with all the problems that will mean. It does not mean only that there will be a of cut back in the avaUabUity of homes to those in need; it means that there will be a cut back of employment to those in the building industry, and we already have far too much unemployment in Australia at present. I should Uke to mention one other point, the States' homes savings grants. I have mentioned this than in matter before. The Budget for the Department of Housing and Construction shows an appropriation of $10m for homes savings grants- a worthwhUe system of funding homes for young people introduced by our Party when in Government. But what aridiculoussituation the Minister has placed these young people in. They cannot qualify for this grant unless they buy a home and land for a total of no more than $22,500.1 challenge the Minister to go anywhere in the Commonwealth today, even to Oodnadatta if he likes, and buy a block of land and build even a reasonably small home on it for less than $22,500. He knows that it is not possible. None of this money will be used. The Minister has made yet another blatant mistake. I ask the Minister to consider seriously introducing a small amendment-nothin g really to upset anything and not involving any extra cost. It is merely to Uft the limit from $22,500 to something over $30,000 so that the $10m that is budgeted for will be used by young people in Australia who are at present being deprived in every possible way by a socialist government dedicated to nationalising the building industry and doing away with home ownership and looking for socialism to the extreme.",49
153,Mr RIORDAN,HOUSING MINISTERS," I thank honourable members for the contributions that have been made-som e more than others because some contributions were more relevant than others. I regret that the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Elhcott) decided to make a speech in this debate about Aboriginal housing which has nothing to do with this portfolio or this Department in any way whatsoever, except for the Department acting as an agent for the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. I do not wish to canvass the ruling of the chair but I simply that the honourable member gave a speech about nothing that was really relevant to the portfolio that I have. However, I want to say that he was quite unfair in his criticism of the activimaking ties of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Les Johnson) and the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. He was quite unfair and indeed it is to suggest that this Government does not stand for dialogue, consultation and co-operation with Aborigines in the field of Aboriginal housing. But my Department of Housing and Construction is concerned with Aboriginal housing only as a service department. It acts on behalf of other departments. Having spoken on the irrelevance of that speech for a moment I turn briefly to the contribution of the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Bourchier). He seems to think that the estimates for this Department are hopelessly understated. Mr Bourchier- I have only quoted your described figures.",51
154,Mr RIORDAN,HOUSING MINISTERS,"He has looked at the figures and he has discovered that on things such as travelling expenditure, office requisites and cost of postage and telegrams less money is apportioned this year than was apportioned last year. I congratulate him on being able to look at 2 columns offiguresand to recognise that one represents a lowerfigurethan the other. That is something to be commended. But what he also might have done is to have made some preliminary inquiries about the matter and looked at the administrative arrangements that were made in the early part of June. He then would have understood the clear and simple reason for the reduction. It is no plot. It is no plan to deceive. It is no error of judgment. It is no accounting fault. It is simply that 1234 employees who were previously employed by the Department ofHousing and Construction have now been transferred to the Australian Housing Corporation. In other words the transfer of the defence service home loans activities from the Department ofHousing and Construction to the Australian Housing Corporation transfers that expenditure to the Department of Urban and Regional Development. That is the simple explanation. A great deal has been said in this debate and further scandalmongering has been indulged in. The Opposition has engaged in scandalmongering and misrepresentation in respect of the Priorities Review Staff's report on housing. I say again and I shall keep saying that those who say say that the Australian Government is considering a tax on home ownership, a tax on imputed rent or a tax on houses of more than a certain size are spreading a false, malicious rumour. They are false and mischievous statements which have no foundation in fact. Reference is made on page 22 of the Priority Review Staff's Report on false Housing to the propositions which members of the Opposition have referred to and which are canvassed in the report. In this regard the report states: But such devices have relatively little to be said for their equity and efficiency, are not less administratively complex and are not obviously more saleable politically than the preferred alternatives outlined above. If the honourable member for Boothby (Mr MCLeay) will simply look at the report, up to page 18, he will see that the propositions to which the Opposition claims the Government is giving consideration at the moment are by the Priorities Review Staff as 'politically infeasible and administratively complex'. The propositions are canvassed, and I concede that they are certainly canvassed at some length. The alleged merit is canvassed as well as the alleged deficiency. But it cannot be truthfully or accurately said, I think, that the PRS has recommended to the Government that it adopt these 2 proposals. That cannot be said, unless there is a massive nusconstruing, deliberately or otherwise, of the proposals which the PRS has put before the Parliament in this report. Of course, it is all very well for those opposite to complain that they do not get access to all the repons, all the discussion and all the propositions which are made from time to time, but as soon as we see put forward a report which openly and frankly canvasses alternatives, it seizes on an aspect, on one point, misconstrues it and attempts to attack the Government. The Opposition s misrepresentation will not be swallowed. I know that members of the Opposition are engaged in a cynical campaign at the present time. I know that they are engaged as the political desperadoes of Australia, desperate to try to get power by any means, to use any strategem, to use any tactic to try to grab power. But they shall not succeed because they cannot succeed on a falsehood. If the premise of their argument is false",51
155,Mr COHEN,HOUSING MINISTERS,They succeeded for 23 years.,52
156,Mr RIORDAN,HOUSING MINISTERS,"Well, they will not succeed now. Mr MCLeay-Would you like 2 bob on it?",52
157,Mr RIORDAN,HOUSING MINISTERS,Ye s I will.,52
158,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,HOUSING MINISTERS,Mr Innes)Order! The debate will continue through the Chair.,52
159,Mr RIORDAN,HOUSING MINISTERS,"Yes, Mr Deputy Chairman. I say that honourable members opposite will not succeed because they will not succeed in pulling the wool over the eyes of the Australian people ever again. Mr MCLeay-You have done it for 3 years.",52
160,Mr RIORDAN,HOUSING MINISTERS,"I know that you can claim to have done it for 3 years, but the thing is that that you will not do it for the next 3 years. The Opposition did not succeed in 1972 and in 1974 and it will not succeed whenever next there is an election, whenever that may be. Let me just ask honourable members to consider some very significant points in the next minute of two. Firstly, in the last 2 years this Government has made avaUable more funds for public housing than ever before and its record will stand up against any long period of time to which one might wish to refer. Mr Bourchier-They are worth less.",52
161,Mr RIORDAN,HOUSING MINISTERS,"Worth less, nothing. In each of the last 2 years the funds made avaUable represent 2Vi times as much as was made avaUable in the last year of government of honourable members opposite. That is a fact that cannot be denied. One of the reasons there is a rental problem in this country today is because of the continued neglect of the State colleagues of honourable members opposite who have sold off housing commission homes without regard for the problems of renters and at a substantial capital gain for those who have least deserved it. But when we talk about the rapid escalation in costs, let us look at the facts. The wholesale price index of materials used in house buUding is showing a steady considerable faU. For example, it was running at 22 per cent-almos t 23 per cent in fact-in March of this year. It is now down to less than 15.5 per cent. The time taken to construct an average cottage has fallen. Total costs are starting to be reduced. In other words, the increase in costs is reducing. Wage indexation will bring greater certainty. I tliink honourable members opposite ought to recognise also that the reason total money amounts in this year's Budget are lower than those of last year is because advances were made in June of last year clearly on the basis, as the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Keogh) said, that they would be taken into account, as they were, and offset against this year's amount. Motion (by Mr Riordan) agreed to: That the quesuon be now put. Proposed expenditure agreed to. Department of Labor and Immigration Proposed expenditure, $314,208,000.",52
162,Mr STREET,HOUSING MINISTERS,"There are 2 matters to which I would like to refer specifically in speaking to the estimates of the Department ofLabor and Immigration. One is a matter which is largely completed now, but one which did create some problems and which was referred to, as I am sure the Minister for Housing and Construction (Mr Riordan) who is at the table is aware, in the Auditor-General's report. I refer to the income maintenance scheme. The Auditor-General drew attention to some highly undesirable features of the results of that scheme and some abuses of it. If my memory serves me right, I believe the Department was trying to recoup some money which it had found upon investigation to have been wrongly paid. Mr Riordan-It has recouped most ofit.",52
163,Mr STREET,HOUSING MINISTERS,"I am interested in the comment that the Minister has just made. I had in my mind - and I do not want to be held to this-somethin g hke $260,000 as being overpaid. I am glad to have the Minister's assurance that the major portion of that amount has been recovered. When the Minister replies in due course he may be able to give some more information on that matter. The other aspect of the estimates to which I would like to refer is the Regional Employment Development scheme which still involves a very large sum of money- $ 135m-in the estimates but which the Government has announced is to be run down over the next few months. I think that the Minister said today in answer to a question from me during question time that employment on the RED scheme had been reduced to something of the order of 20 000 from, I think, 32 000 at its peak. But still, very large sums of money are involved. As the Minister would know, there had been a great deal of confusion and uncertainty among local government bodies which have been involved with projects which were either just started or approved and about to be commenced when the announcement was made that the scheme was to be phased down. A letter from the Department of Labor and Immigration states: . . . projects not already commenced will be finalised only in a limited number of areas experiencing the most severe unemployment-in general where the local unemployment rate is twice the national average. Therefore letters have been sent out to various local government organisations saying that particular projects of theirs do not fall within that category and that, therefore, even though they had hoped that the projects would go ahead, they now will not do so. To give an illustration of the severity of this decision I would like to quote the experience of certain areas, namely, the electorate of Braddon in north-west Tasmania plus municipalities in the Latrobe and Kentish areas on the eastern boundary of that electorate. The value of the schemes cancelled in six of the municipalities totals $568,000. That is a very considerable sum of money. As the Minister would know, the unemploysaid. ment situation in Tasmania is extremely difficult. I imagine that in Braddon and municipalities adjoining it the cancellation of projects of that magnitude at pretty short notice is going to involve even greater difficulties for the area in the mediate future. For instance, the councils which had RED schemes cancelled are King Island, $99,000; Circular Head, $97,000; Wynyard, $160,000; Latrobe, $99,000; Kentish, $108,000; and Strahan, $25,000. In an area which is authorities already suffering high unemployment that obviously is going to have a very severe eflfect. The most difficult cases of all involve projects which were approved and had been started but which it may not be possible to complete. I quote again from the letter sent out by the Minister's Department. It states: The quesuon of reimbursing you for nnancial commitments which you have already incurred will be sympathetically considered. That soundsfineif the sympathetic consideration which is mentioned turns out to be in favour of the council or whatever the organisation is. But if the Minister, having sympathetically considered the quesuon, decides that the council is not going to be reimbursed for this money some local government authorities are going to be seriously embarrassed. Even more seriously embarrassed will be individual organisations which believed that they were going to get their facilities upgraded through the RED scheme. I cite merely one. It is the Muswellbrook Park Sports Club, which was to get a grant. It has been left with bills for labour escalation of a bit over $2,000, for cost escalation of just under $1,000 and for material escalation of just under $2,000. So there is about $5,000 for which this sports club is left holding the baby.",53
164,Mr COHEN,HOUSING MINISTERS,What was its original grant?,53
165,Mr STREET,HOUSING MINISTERS,"I have the application in front of me. A grant of $54,060 was duly approved and the job commenced during the week ending 30 April. The point is that it is left now with an uncompleted facility and there is an amount of about $5,000 which it has to pay or may have to pay. I just make a plea to the Minister on this question of sympathetic consideration that in the case of organisations which have very little financial backing-no t that I am saying that all municipalities are very well off at the present time by any means-particularl y sporting clubs or charitable organisationsMr Riordan-Sportin g clubs are not charitable organisations, are they?",53
166,Mr STREET,HOUSING MINISTERS,"'Or charitable organisations', I Mr Riordan- I thought you said 'or other'.",53
167,Mr STREET,HOUSING MINISTERS,"No, I said: 'Sporting clubs or charitable organisations'-organisation s of that imnature, which have been left holding considerablefinancialburdens through no fault of their own. They should receive special consideration because of their limitedfinancialbacking. As I say, I am not implying that all local government are able to stand the financial loss with which some of them may be faced, but these other organisations are able to stand it a good deal less. I would hope that the Minister in his reply would give a rather more certain indication to a great number of organisations which at the moment merely have an undertaking that their requests will be sympathetically considered that their commitments will be met. I have something like a dozen local government organisations in my own electorate which find themselves in that position, but fortunately they had not started the scheme concerned so they are not up for any money themselves specifically. The RED scheme had great difficulties during its time of operation mainly because this Governstand ment insisted on its being administered from Canberra. I think this has illustrated the great difficulty of central government in trying to priorities which are best known and best handled by the people closest to them, that is, the local organisations and local government authorities. Mr Hodges-It took 7 Ministers to administer it too.",53
168,Mr STREET,HOUSING MINISTERS,"It was administered by 7 Ministers. The Opposition's policy, of course, is return administration of such schemes in times high local unemployment to the people who do best. They are the people closest to the problem-loca l government and local pened. organisations.",54
169,Mr KEITH JOHNSON,HOUSING MINISTERS," I ing must comment on the last point made and the point most made by the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Street) about the Regional Employment Development scheme. I think it ought to be said that the honourable member member of the Liberal Party and comes from Victoria. The Government has been berated the Opposition on more than one occasion about its spending and has been asked to cut back government spending. In fact, it has been deon manded that we cut back on government spendCouncU ing. It has been said that this is the way out of woods. Now- I do not necessarily agree that am in favour of it-becaus e there has been a cuttimes back in government spending, and RED some of its spending. schemes are government spending, the Opposition is now saying: 'This is not the way out of the wood at all. You do not cut back on government spending but in fact you increase it'. The argument gets a little bit more circular than that even. The closing remarks of the honourable member were that the Opposition would leave administration of this scheme up to the local bodies who, the Opposition believes, would be best equipped to deal with it because they are local. I remind the honourable member again that he is a member of the Liberal Party, that he is a Victorian, that he Uves in a State that has a Liberal government, that the Premier of that State, Mr Hamer, a Liberal, has taken the trouble of going to the High Court for a writ to restrain the Australian Government from dealing with local government in matters Uke this. It is curious that members of the Opposition should stand up, as they have done on more than one occasion on this matter, and criticise the Australian Labor Government for not doing this and not doing that when in fact their friends in 3 States of Austraha have taken out writs in the High Court to restrain us from doing it. I underthat the basis of the writ is that the Australian Government has no authority to deal with local government. Yet the closing words of the set honourable member for Corangamite were that the Liberal Party in government would deal with local government. I wish that members of the Opposition would be a bit sincere about it and make up their minds as to where they stand on it. I take the point about a cut-back in spending. I to mention one area in which I have a criticism of of my own Government. Perhaps the Minister- I it am sure he can-wi U properly explain to me in closing this debate why such a tiling has hapBy unanimous agreement both Houses of this Parliament have passed a Bill to set up a trade union training authority to set about traintrade unionists and to build a college, which the Australian Council for Union Training has appropriately decided ought to be named the Clyde Cameron College, at Wodonga. That Council submitted a budget to the Australian is a Government for something more than the amount which it has received in the Budget. In by other words, after careful assessment of the needs of each of the States and the need to spend on $1.7m or preferably $2.2m in thisfinancialyear the construction of a coUege at Wodonga, the was told that the Budget would have to the be pruned back. The Council did that. It did it in I the knowledge that the Government in these of economic difficulties must cut back onI express my disappointment rather than my criticism of the Government-disappointment ' would have been a better word to have used initially-that this item in particular was singled out for cutting back. It can easUy be said that because I have a great interest in this matter aU other things can go to pot so long as this issue continues. I do not say that at all. I simply make the point that a substantial cut was made in the funds available for the Australian Council for Union Training and express some regret about it. Another point I wish to make in the short available to me relates to the Commonwealth Employment Service. The service is a very highest integral part of the Minister's Department. It finds work for people andfindspeople to vacancies. I think we are all aware of that. Havnot ing observed it for a long time. I have come to view that it has been reduced in status over the years to nothing more or less than a exchange. Thatfillsme with some regret. I think that the Labor Government- I put in a plug for the Government-ha s done something about improving the status of that aspect of the service. But the function surely of every government ought to be-ther e has been no indication of from honourable members who sit opposite and who for 23 years did govern-to set out a manintegrated power policy for the nation. The Labor Governvery ment is taking great steps in that area. Surely people who seek out job vacancies and then seek out people to fill those vacancies must play integral part. So long as the Commonwealth Emfinding ployment Service is at the level of nothing more or less than a labour exchange, dealing only with unskilled or semi-skilled people and not entering into the field of people who are technically trained, semi-professionally or professionally trained, surely to goodness a government cannot get an overall picture of its manpower doing requirements or where it is going. It may be true that statistics can be collected from private agencies. A number of private agencies operate in this area. They the private enterprise system. They do not give their services for nothing; they make a charge. They seem to be very profitable enterprises from what I have seen of them. That section of emthe ployee placement is rather a rewarding area. years, because that area is profitable, it has left for private enterprise and the unprofitable least profitable section of the business was grudgingly taken over by the previous governtrouble ment. It has been left at that; something that been grudgingly taken over and something that has been run-and I repeat-at a level of nothing more than a labour exchange. I dare say that members of this Parliament have intimate knowledge or have availed themgreat selves in one way or another of these placement services. But deliberately to downgrade a government service, as I believe the previous Government did, in my mind is very sinful and serves no good purpose to the community. If the Government entered the area of employment for professional people the overall manpower picture would become better. A sense of job satisfaction and career opportunities in all facets of time job placement would be given for those people who work in the Department now. I have the regard for them. In the block in my electorate in which I have my office is the Glenroy fill Commonwealth Employment Service. I could speak in too high regard for the officers and the the staff of that branch of the CES. The same applies for the other 2 branches of the service labour that are situated in my electorate. Contrary to popular belief I do not have a pocket handkerchief electorate. Three CES offices are servicing it. Each of those offices is equal in the way its staff members deal with the this problems that come before them and the way they assist people to find better jobs. But surely into that must be other aspects. I am pleased to notice the increase in amounts the made available for apprenticeship training. Things of this sort are part and parcel of that an whole service. It has to go further than just an unskilled job for an unskilled worker. If the person is unskilled but has a capacity the service must do something about taking him and putting him through a scheme that will provide him with the necessary skills and ability to perform a task that is probably more financially rewarding than the one he has at the moment. By this we overcome a lot of other problems in our community. A lot of problems that are now dealt with by people from the Department of Social Security initially stem from the capacity and ability of people to earn money because of operate under their lack of ttaining.",54
170,Mr MACKELLAR,HOUSING MINISTERS,"As everybody knows we are debating the Estimates of the total Budget. Again, as everybody knows, Budget has now been revealed as describing For an overall picture of economic chaos brought been about by this short period of Labor Party rule or since 1972. I think that if any members of the Labor Party dispute this fact they should take the to walk into any hotel or club in has Ausualia, into any country town, into any business capital or into any unemployment office and thousands of Australians will tell them exactly what I have just told the Committee. Let us have a look more closely at some of the achievements that the Government does not boast so much about. I refer to the 300 000 people out of work, 16 per cent plus inflation, privatefirmsgoing out of business one after the other, large factories and plants putting off thousands of workers, schizophrenicfluctuationsin import quotas and restrictions, share markets lying dormant and primary producers being forced off properties. What has resulted is a half baked piecemeal Budget that is deceptive in its generosity and unfeeling in its severity; a Budget that does nothing to rekindle incentive and initiative; a Budget that discriminates against the majority of middle bracket wage earners to the benefit of professional dole dependants rather than the genuinely needy. I suggest that no group in the community would be more vulnerable to potential disaster brought on by a downturn in employment opportunities than migrants and members of ethnic communities. Due to the present Government's mismanagement of all things connected with immigration, language instruction is still grossly unsatisfactory, and we all know that understanding of the language is a major factor in job placement; counselling is backward and at present distrusted by those who seek to use it. The numbers of migrants-this is most significant-returnin g home is increasing. With 3 million Australians born outside Australia it is a recklessly irresponsible government that would continue with its seeming lack of interest in ethnic affairs, but continumg with it it seems to be doing. We all remember the disbandment of the Department of Immigration and the dramatic drop in morale within the Department. It caused a great deal of confusion among the ethnic communities. Valuable committees were disbanded. The Immigration Advisory Council lapsed. It has just been reconstituted. Consultation with ethnic groups was abandoned and effective channels of communication were closed. With full-time attention required to keep trade union demands under control, the present Minister for Labor and Immigration (Senator James MCClelland) has been no different from his predecessor in apportioning only a fraction of his time to ethnic affairs. If Senator James MCClelland can offer no more indication of his interest in immigration than letting commercial misfits such as Alice Cooper into the country I believe we have yet another example of appalling mismanagement or non-management on the part of the Government. Let us have a look at the vulnerability of nonEnglish speaking ethnic groups. Once a person with little knowledge of the language is sacked from his employment, which is usually as a result of some government inability to manage the economy, where is he supposed to find an alternative job? Often a person's training has been restricted to manual and semi-skilled occupations. When all factories and places of large scale personnel are laying off workers, what chance does the migrant have? With no reserve savings to fall back on, with no one in government willing to hear the migrant cause, with trade unions happy to take union dues but contemptuous and insensitive to migrant problems, it is no wonder that ethnic people in Australia are feeling more and more that they have been cheated by this Labor Government, and cheated they have been. They have families to support and to educate but no fully organised program of migrant education. They have health and psychological problems which need attention but no government action has been taken despite comprehensive investigations by migrant task forces and a host of concerned organisations. Language difficulties are undisputed and yet no effort has been made to establish a properly organised national committee to oversee interpreter needs, as recommended last year by the Committee on Overseas Professional Qualifications. I could go on at some length further to document the miserable series of failures which this Government has made in the area of immigration. I shall identifyfirstthe principal complaint. As it has deserted the ethnic people of Australia, so I believe the Labor Government is deserting the needs of the population as a whole. It is totally involved in a legislative program which has proven to be ill conceived and badly thought out. I believe the Whitlam Labor Government will be viewed by later generations as one of the most fraudulent and hypocritical assemblies of hopeless fanatics and self-interested incompetents ever to claim to have a political mandate. I wish to turn to a few specific examples of this Government's treatment of ethnic minorities, in the Federal Budget for this year and the Department of Labor and Immigration estimates. For the Government which has made such a great claim about its concern for minority groups in the community, its determination to be rid of inequalities and its commitment to egalitarianism, the Treasurer's statements on immigration show those worthy principles to be reduced to something less than farcial. We may have expected something better but not from a government which is so well practised in deceit. In another outburst of miscalculations it showed to ethnic people of this country exactly what its true attitude was, an attitude so cursory and so patronising that the Government Printer had to waste no more than 3 lines on the whole ambit of the immigration field. Three lines were all that this Government could bother to give to perhaps the strongest determining factor we have today on the direction which the population and demographic trends are to take. It was not just an insulting reference of only 3 lines; the content of the Treasurer's remarks on immigration was as logically incomprehensible as it was short. For those nonourabie members who may have yawned and missed the remarks, he said: We have decided to double the migrant contribution towards assisted passage costs to an amount of $ family or single person. Those people who have done their arithmetic on Department of Labor and Immigration appropriations will find that this 3-lihe move will save the Government $5,665,000 in 1975-76 in a projected Budget deficit of $2.7 billion. As an accounting method to improve the nation's finances it is hardly worth the time of plation. The gain is negligible. The effect those personally concerned is not far short disastrous. Further, we are told that assisted passages to be made unavailable to dependent parents. How is this a justifiable proposition from a people government purporting to be concerned with are family reunions and with the welfare and cessful integration of migrant people? I believe this present Government is hidebound in deceit. These measures, which are designed further to impede the necessary immigration flow to Australia, are solely and indisputably a result the Government's amateur and totally inept trails handling of the economy which has resulted, amongst other disasters, in a totally unacceptable level of employment. That situation larly affects ethnic groups. If this Government were sincere in the matter the answer is not to disguise the progress of ever increasing unemployment by stopping the input of people and causing loneliness and despair among individual migrant families; the solution needs to be sought elsewhere-in better management and in scheme. reasoned pohcies. In terms of successful integraofficer, tion and the success of a smoothly interacting multi-ethnic community the Government's notfindthem'. Budget measures are ill-judged. In terms humanitarian understanding they are callous and unfair. We on this side of the House have publicly stated that our policy regarding assisted passages is one of continued support. Perhaps it will have to be one of reinstatement. We believe the assisted passage element of family reunion vital to the well-being of the migrant in the munity. We have stated that immigration must be taken away from the present Government's restricting manpower considerations and placed in a much more broad context of a vital component of the nation's overall population policies. The ethnic people in this country are now well aware of the total disregard which the present Government has for their special problems. That disregard goes as far as to jeopardise family relations and happiness in the home. As in so many areas the Labor Government's record in the field of immigration is abysmal. As in so ISO per many areas much was promised to migrants and Australians of migrant background. Like many a young girl those people were seduced with smooth talking and large promises. They have been abandoned to carry alone the baby of neglect, disinterest and difficulty. Sitting suspendedfrom 6 to 8p.m. contem Mr COHEN (Robertson) (8.0)- I wish to on comment on the Regional Employment of Development scheme. BasicaUy I believe this has been the most maUgned of all the schemes are introduced by this Government. Now that it is being phased out we find suddenly the same who criticised it so viciously, so violently, screaming for its continuance. I should Uke to sucrecaU to honourable members some of the former forms of unemployment relief that were provided by our predecessors. When unemployment existed they provided to the States funds which were used for pamting pubUc amenities, of chipping weeds, mowing lawns, clearing fire and raUway Unes and raking up leaves. As a matter of fact, the State governments were given $30m for this type of unemployment relief and particuthat is exacdy what they used it for. I recall one incident in which the State instrumentaUties in the electorate of Robertson, which includes the Gosford area, were told that they each had to employ 2 or 3 people. This was for the State. It had nothing to do with the RED They rang the local district employment  told we have to take 3 people. We hope you canMr Lewis and his State colleagues of were saying this was the way to reduce unemployment-pain t fences, rake up leaves and so on. After the next shower of rain or the next bit of warm weather when the grass had grown there was absolutely nothing to show for it. In essence the RED scheme was the exact opposite to soon that scheme in as much as when the work was that done the community had something of value to is show for it. It is more expensive because more comfunds have to be provided for materials whereas almost aU the funds provided under the other schemes were simply for labour. The Central Coast has had some of the worse unemployment in the State of New South Wales. I will not go into the reason for this, but it is partly caused by enormous land speculation, an incredible housing boom and also the inherent unemployment that is peculiar to the district. We have always had bad unemployment; it is usually the highest in the State even in good times. It rose to about 3500 around February or March of this year, but under the RED scheme it was cut back to 2800 people. For a period of four or five months there was an average of 700 people employed under the RED scheme. Of course these 700 were not the same people. Some people left this scheme, some came back into it and so on. The most significant feature is the work that has been done under the RED scheme. As I said before, the Central Coast was a boom area. The population in the past 3 years increased by about 20 000 or about 20 per cent. Like many of these outer urban areas it was desperately deficient of ordinary basic amenities such as water, sewerage, roads, curbing, guttering, drainage, sporting facilities, recreation facilities, parks, gardens, hospitals and so on. One can go on forever, but the fact is that adequate provision was not made for the population that was pouring into the district. Under the RED scheme we received approximately $7.6m over the last 9 months. I want just for the benefit of the record to show how this amount was spent because there have been people who have said that the money was going into racecourses, golf clubs and things like that. There were small grants to some golf clubs, but primarily the money was going into very important areas. This is how the total expenditure was broken up: Major drainage works, $1,477,220; kerbing, guttering and minor drainage and foot paving, $1,015,510; water reticulation, $1,124,486; council parks, gardens, reserves and public amenities, $656,327; electricity, $39,021; Gosford hospital and ancillary work, $575,869; welfare projects, $454,794; servicing the RED scheme, $88,869; miscellaneous, $89,600; and sporting and recreational facilities, $2,154,714. We have been able to catch up with some of the bad flood areas on the Central Coast. Woy Woy area is prone to flooding. This area sports. was seriouslyfloodedout last May during heavy flooding. Flooding is no longer a problem in this area. The Terrigal area, where we held our Fedsome eral conference, was severelyfloodedevery there was a decent downpour. We have spent nearly $400,000 in Terrigal and the work carried out has eliminated the danger offloodingin this area of the Central Coast. The same applies in Davistown which was like a bog after any sort of a decent downpour. We have been able to provide water to 3 major areas on the Central Coast- Gwandalan, Empire Bay and Kincumber. In the area I am most pleased about, because the Central Coast is a retirement area, a tourist area and a playground of the 2 cities of Sydney and Newcastle, we have been able to upgrade sporting and recreational facilities in a way that was inconceivable under the previous Administration or State government administration. We got absolutely nothing for such works. I believe leisure is very important to all people and I believe it is going to play an increasingly important role in our society. It is about time that we started to provide these amenities and not think simply in terms of kerbing, guttering and similar works. Let me mention just a few of the major things that we have been able to do. At the weekend I was able to attend a very large tennis tournament in Gosford. We were able to cater for 700 visitors who came to the area because we built one of the finest tennis complexes in the southern hemisphere. We have added to what the Gosford tennis club already had. There are now 24 courts, 12 of which were provided under the RED scheme. In the Woy Woy area, which has 30 000 people, a population larger than that of any country town apart from the major cities in New South Wales, there are absolutely no facilities for young people. We are on the verge of opening a $600,000 youth centre. Of that cost $454,000 will have been provided by the Australian Government. At long last children in the Woy Woy district will have something to do after 5.30 at night. I believe that this is a great social advance. This youth centre will have basketball courts, squash courts, a coffee lounge, arts and craft facUities and so on. I could describe the way in which we have rebuUt, refurbished or redecorated 6 major surf clubs in this area. Is there anyone who would disagree with the view that surfing is not only a sport but is also a community service of untold value to Australians? I know from my own experience. My third son is alive today thanks to the surf club movement. I have been delighted that we have been able to do this for the surf club The movement, the cindereUa sport of Australian I want to say in winding up my remarks that of the criticisms of the workers under the time RED scheme have been totally unfounded and are completely untrue. Contrary to the argument that I have heard put forward, that these people are not working as hard as they should be, we have had reports from one after another of the sponsors who have come to us and said: 'When the scheme started we thought we were going to get the wrong sort of workers-laz y people who would not work. We have been staggered. We have been getting better people than we have normally been able to get. We have had some amazing references from people who said they had got their jobs finished early and they had been able to do more work than they had anticipated. Of course there have been one or two cases-mayb e half a dozen cases-of people who have bludged on the system. When there are 800 workers you are bound to have a few bad eggs, but overwhelmingly the sponsors have said how delighted they have been with the effort by workers under the RED scheme. There has been criticism about costs. On the contrary I have found that when the work is done by a sponsor, a member of a club who acts as a supervisor, costs have been lower than when the work has been put out on tender to a master builder. The gap between the cost when the work has been done by what is called the sponsor and when it is done by the ordinary contractor is staggering. We have been able to get the job done for half the price. Of course there is room for improvement. The scheme was started with a bit of a rush, but by the time we had finished I believe the people who were working on the RED scheme, the staff from the Department of Labor and Immigration, had learned a lot about it. We all had learned a lot about it. I pay credit, particularly for the tremendous job done by the Department of Labor and Immigration, to people such as Greg Castles, Kevin Steele and Mr MCKenzie, all of whom have done a fantastic job in getting this scheme going. I cannot speak highly enough of their work. As I said before, I believe that there is room for improvement and that we can improve this system. If I had time. I could mention to the Committee half a dozen ways in which we could improve it so that there would be less criticism ofit in the future. But lieve that the RED scheme is one of the great social breakthroughs. I do hope that when Treasury funds permit this scheme will be reintroduced. I believe that that will probably happen in the future.",55
171,The CHAIRMAN,HOUSING MINISTERS,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,59
172,Mr KING,HOUSING MINISTERS," I was amazed to listen to the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Cohen) this evening complaining that members of the Opposition originally were critical on the one hand of the Regional Employment Development scheme and yet on the other they supported the principals of our parties in the States in protesting against its cessation. What members of this Government do not understand is that honourable members on this side of the Chamber do not disagree with the objectives of the RED scheme; we agree that the RED scheme in principle is one of those plans which had to be introduced. We are surprised that the Government has decided to abandon it. What we have been criticising is not the system or the principles involved as originally laid down by the former Minister for Labour and Immigration, the present Minister for Science and Consumer Affairs (Mr Clyde Cameron), but the way in which the Government has carried out those principles. I remind the honourable member for Robertson that the then Minister made it quite clear in his first announcement that he was not going to put up with all the useless projects that were being proposed, such as chipping of grass, kerbing and channelling and that type of work. But after a while, the Department or someone- I am not too sure who it was-change d these principles. This is one of the reasons why some of our State colleagues were objecting to the scheme. We do not object to the RED scheme as such; we favour it. We would like to see it continue or be reintroduced. After all, Australia has a huge number of people unemployed today. If the scheme were carried out to the full, at least something could be done to assist them. Some worthwhile benefit would be obtained from the RED scheme. I wish to direct my comments this evening to the immigration aspect of the appropriations for the Department of Labor and Immigration. I have been prompted to speak on this subject because of Government decisions which have been made. Despite comments to the contrary, I believe that Australia owes a great deal to its migrant population. After listening to some memI be- bers of the Government party, one wonders just where they stand in relation to migrants. Let me quote just a few lines from a speech made by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr James) when he spoke in this debate on Thursday last, 2 October. He said: . . . we got a lot of decent citizens from Hungary. They have settled here and they have adapted themselves to the Australian way of life. I beheve that if we were able to assess the ngures we would find that for every decent citizen who has settled here and has been an asset to Australia we got two or three scum . . . Mr Sullivan-Who said that?",59
173,Mr KING,HOUSING MINISTERS,The honourable member for Hunter said that. I think that statement needs some further explanation by the honourable member for Hunter who referred to migrants in this country as scum. Perhaps that is only a percentage. He said they were not all scum. But he has quoted one out of every three or four in this instance as not being scum. This is a shocking statement. I think that the honourable member for Hunter should be more explicit as to what he really means because he refers in his comments to the fact that 75 per cent of our migrants are scum. That is certainly not the view on this side of the chamber. Mr Riordan-You are misquoting him.,59
174,Mr COHEN,HOUSING MINISTERS,He did not say that.,60
175,Mr KING,HOUSING MINISTERS,"I am not misquoting the honourable member. Here are his remarks in Hansard. Honourable members opposite may read them for themselves. The former Minister for Labor and Immigration on 26 October last year issued a Press statement on the migration program for 1974-75. I quote part of that statement: . . . it would be necessary to impose restrictions but that these would not affect people who had already been approved for entry. But, having regard to the smaller immigration program-8 0 000-decide d upon by the Government for 1974-75, there would need the approval rate. The statement continued: Family reunion still had the highest priority . . . It continued: Refugees and other individual cases where very strong compassionate circumstances existed, will, nevertheless, continue to be given special consideration. I have a case which I believe to be a compassionate one. I will not set out all the details because the former Minister for Labor and Immigration knows all about that case. He certainly accepted my submission to him and acted accordingly. But before completing the project he was, as we all know, removed from that office by the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam). Naturally, he could not finalise this matter. Let me quote briefly part of a paragraph of the letter that the Minister wrote to me. It is dated 30 May 1975. The former Minister said: I am writing again with reference to your representations on behalf of Mr 'H' . . . . concerning the unsuccessful nomination for migrant entry . . . of Mr'K'. Because of the economic situation in Australia, the Government has found it necessary to impose occupational restrictions on the entry of migrants other than those ing as the spouse, dependent children, aged or parents or nances of Australian residents. The letter states further: However, in view of the information provided in your representations I have agreed to treat this as a special case and have directed my Department to accept the nomination and to forward details to the Australian Embassy in Athens. Provided Mr 'K' is then found to be able to meet the migrant entry criteria other than the occupational requirements, his admission to Australia will be approved. That letter was dated 30 May. I received nothing further. The sponsor mentioned in the letter received nothing further. Then, on 15 September I wrote to the Department of Labor and Immigration and received a reply, a portion of which I will now quote. The letter states: As we have received no advice to date from Athens concerning the nomination, I have asked them to let me know the present position. However, I should mention that delays in the processing of appUcations are unavoidable in Greece because of the very high application rate. As soon as I have further information I will write to you again. Mr Bourchier-You were lucky.",60
176,Mr KING,HOUSING MINISTERS,"Perhaps I was lucky. I used to receive a number of letters of this type from the former Minister for Labor and Immigration, Al Grassby, who said that he was going to do a lot of things, but nothing ever happened. I was informed by the nominator as late as last weekend that he had been in touch with his relatives in Greece. This was some 4 months from the date on which the former Minister originally gave his to be a significant reduction in approval. I believe that the delay is a little too long. Yet, in Division 366, which is the appropriation to which I am speaking, we are being asked to approve a proposed expenditure of $4,884,600 for Overseas Services which are basically related to immigration. I regret the need to bring this case forward on this occasion. But I do believe that it provides an indication of what is taking place throughout Australia. It is one example only. Is it any wonder then that the migrant population of this country is very dissatisfied with the present regime holding office in Canberra. A delay of 4 months is something of which the Government ought to be ashamed. We must remember also that a big reduction has occurred in the number of migrants coming to Australia. If we were to revert to the former situation and if we sought to increase the number of migrants entering Austraha to up to 180 000, how would officers of the Department of Labor and Immigration be able to cope if they cannot handle the few migrants who are coming to Australia now? This raises another question. I have only a qualifyminute remaining in which to deal with it. I refer dependent to the reasons why the migrant intake into Australia is being cut back. The argument used is lack of employment opportunities. If we look at this on a short term basis, I must agree. If we bring to Australia a migrant who has not a job, we have on our hands another person who is unemployed. That is the short term view. If we look at the situation in the the long term, that argument is a fallacy; the true situation is the reverse. Every time a migrant family enters Australia, we must make sure that there is accommodation available immediately for it. This means that another house is being built. If there are enough of these migrants, another school and another hospital may be required. Work must be found. AU these factors result. In conclusion what I am saying is that in my mind the Government is tackling the problem of immigration back to front. It is time the Government woke up and reaUsed that immigration has played a very important role in the advancement of this nation. We owe a great debt of gratitude to our migrants. We have received much good service from them. I am amazed that the Government and the present Minister for Labor and Immigration (Sentor James MCClelland) are not prepared to extend the program to a reasonable limit so that the original suggestion of the former Minister for Labor and Immigration, Mr Clyde Cameron, may be acceded to.",60
177,The CHAIRMAN,HOUSING MINISTERS,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,61
178,Mr YOUNG,HOUSING MINISTERS,"Irisein this debate on the estimates of the Department of Labor and Immigration to refer to the schemes which have been operated by the Department over the past year. I refer specifically to the National Employment and Training scheme and to the Regional Employment Development scheme. I also wish to say a few words about the migration policies of this Government when one hears members of the Opposition decrying the efforts of this Government and when one looks back at the 23 years in which the conservative governments of this country dumped the migrants on our doorstep and hoped that everything would work out well for them as they entered the community, as they became the human fodder for the mass industries of this country and as they became the forgotten people one realises that this Government has done far more in its short term of office to assist those people once they have arrived in this country than the conservative forces did in 23 years. I want to stress the importance of the Government's NEAT scheme because it seems to me that for far too long it has been thought that a person would do for Ufe the job that he did when he left school. It took this Government to realise that people have to be trained and retrained through a variety of occupations. Mr Sullivan-Includin g unemployment.",61
179,The CHAIRMAN,HOUSING MINISTERS,Order! If the honourable member for Riverina keeps on with his low tone interjections I will give him the opportunity to slow march out of the chamber.,61
180,Mr YOUNG,HOUSING MINISTERS,"It took this Government to realise that one training upon leaving school was not sufficient to take a person through to retirement age and that there had to be some sort of infrastructure set up by the Government which would assist people to be retrained into other occupations as it became necessary and as industries in this country became restructured. There is no doubt that a great deal will have to be done to assist a lot of people on the land whom the honourable member for Hume (Mr Lusher) represents. He does a lot of talking but takes very little action. UntU such time as the people reaUse the importance and the ramifications of retraming people the responsibUity for initiating new ideas and setting new standards will remain with the Australian Labor Party. It is a very complex matter to understand what happens in a society and it demands that we realise our responsibilities to retrain people. There should be no stepping backwards by the individuals concerned and there should be no embarassment to the people who have to be retrained. The great difficulty in the past has been to make governments accept that this was necessary. When this Government introduced the idea there was a great deal of criticism. People asked 'Why are you doing this?' or they said: 'It is being abused'. Undoubtedly one of the problems that this Government and previous governments have had when they have introduced measures such as this is that on occasions it is very difficult to pohce them. People often say that the unemployment benefit is being abused and so ought to be stopped. There may be some sUght abuse of the unemployment benefit but it would cost more to poUce every person than it cost to conduct the scheme in the manner in which it is being conducted. The same thing appUes to the NEAT scheme. There may have been some abuse. Some people may have been given retraining allowances which they should not have been given them and which should perhaps have gone to other people, but this is the start of what I consider to be a massive undertaking in the years to come when people reaUse that the occupation they enter at 20 years of age wiU have to be changed when they are 30, changed again when they are 40 and perhaps changed again when they are 50. American statistics show that a person may have to be retrained no fewer than 3 times during his working life. I consider that the NEAT scheme is the start of what will be a great undertaking by this Labor Government- a government which understands the problems of the community and which is introducing measures to overcome those problems. Members of the National Country Party are interjecting. I used to work for some of you cockies out in the bush. You used to sit on the board all day watching us. So you should not talk about work. You would be the laziest people in the world. Now half of the farmers live in George Street. Fancy the Country Party talking about work. It is a joke. In South Australia we have not felt the effects of unemployment as much as some of the other States. The Regional Employment Development scheme is so far in advance of any previous scheme in its concept of attacking the problem of unemployment that it deserves recognition. It is not only the employment of people who may be out of work that needs to be considered but also the work that they carry out when they are employed under this scheme. Under the Regional Employment Development scheme right throughout Australia some very worthwhile local projects were undertaken and paid for by this Government which will be of lasting significance to the areas in which they were carried out. I refer to some of the areas of the mid-North Coast of New South Wales, the Gold Coast and other areas where the assistance was given. It was not given just in Labor areas. I understand that it was given to all areas which put in submissions. These schemes will be of lasting significance to the communities which they service. It seems to me that we should learn a lesson because in a society like ours, whether or not like to accept it, the fact is that we will continuthis ally have ups and downs in employment. These may be brought about for a variety of reasons. we look at what is called the record of the conreceive servatives between 1949 and 1972 we see the same sort of thing occurring but with no plans and no idea of how to counteract the problems thrust upon the community except for where National Country Party, once again in its normal role of running government policy as part coalition, brought about a relief scheme supposindividuals edly to help people in country areas to find ployment. They undertook some of the bodgiest schemes and some of the most invalid ways of paying out moneys to unemployed people in of the cutbackcountry areas that could ever be imagined. At least the Regional Employment Development scheme demanded some sort of satisfaction the community as to the projects that were being carried out. We have learnt a lesson and seen the failures of the rural relief scheme under the conservatives. The Regional Employment Development scheme, with its teething problems at the commencement, was recognised by the community groups-the schools and the local government authorities-that used it as being a very worthwhile contribution not only in employing the 26 000 or 28 000 people who were employed under it at its peak but also for the manner of work that was carried out. I turn now to the question of immigration. I also service an electorate containing a great number of people who have made Australia their home. I know of their problems. I know from meeting with these groups of people that they would far rather have a Labor Government in power than the old reactionary conservatives that were in government for so many years. This is the first government that has recognised that the problems of the migrants do not stop once they set foot on these shores. They continue to require assistance from their member of Parliament or from the Government. They require some sort of help in order to integrate into the community. This Government through a number of schemes, not the least of which was the Australian Assistance Plan which has now been challenged by Liberal State governmentsMr Lucock-So it should have been.",61
181,Mr YOUNG,HOUSING MINISTERS,"It has also paid a great deal of money to open up migration information services for which people have been begging for years. It is assisting the vast migrant communities which we have in these areas. It is very difficult for an Australian to face up to the government we and semi-government bureaucracies that exist in country. It is almost impossible for the migrant. There has to be some sort of stepping If stone or some sort of springboard for migrants to that assistance. In the case of the Australian Labor Party, having recognised this, we say that there should be no barriers to the use of any of these schemes, whether it is done through the this Department or through the Australian Assistance Plan, to see that that infrastructure is of the built to assist migrant communities and who need that sort of government asemsistance so that in time they can overcome the problems and fit into the community as we would like them to do. The other thing in terms",62
182,The CHAIRMAN,HOUSING MINISTERS,Order! The to honourable member's ume has expired.,62
183,Mr JARMAN,HOUSING MINISTERS,"We have recently seen tabled in this Parliament the report the National Population Inquiry, commonly known as the Borrie Report. This report warned that Australia was rapidly approaching zero population growth. In other words, if the immigration cutback by this Government were to continue Australia's population growth would stagnate at the present figure of around 13 milhon. At the best it has been estimated that Australia's population would reach 16 million by the turn of the century. The Government seems to be of the opinion that if we admit migrants to this country they will take jobs away from Australians. I believe nothing could be further from the truth. On the contrary, migrants, besides bringing many skills to this country, as they have done in the past, would create jobs. They would all need homes, they would all need furniture, schools for their children and numerous other facUities. It is just over 12 months since the former Minister for Labor and Immigration, the honourable Clyde Cameron, announced the Whitlam Labor Government's new restrictions on migrant entry into Australia. As a result of this Government's policies the immigration program has been reduced from a peak of 185 000 in 1970 to an anticipated figure this year of approximately 45 000. About 50 000 applicants who would have been admitted a year ago are now inehgible for entry. Having created, by its tariffs and other poUcies, the largest pool of unemployment in this country since the Great Depression, the Government somehow beUeves it can cure the problem, or at least alleviate it, by cutting down on immigration. I believe the impact of this poUcy to be detrimental to our long term needs. In attempting to remedy immediate problems the Government is abandoning long term planning. How can we, in all moraUty, say to a world which is bursting at the seams with a population explosion that we are going to limit the population of this vast land mass, with all its potential, to somewhere between 13 and 16 mUlion people. Australia needs people in increasing numbers, with their numerous skills, to help us develop wonderful country which by good fortune we inhabit. A recent study by the Flinders Institute of Labor Studies concluded that it is wrong to imply that migrant demand is of any importance in determining total Australian employment. The Institute concluded that whUe migration may affect some 'cannon-fodder'jobs of heavy industry in the degree of its labor turn-over, it was nevertheless erroneous to suggest that the entry of of one migrant specificaUy results in the absorption of a particular job, and consequently the denial of a particular position, for an Australian citizen. A vigorous and directed immigration program could well help re-stimulate the economy. An expansion of immigration would immediately lead to increased consumer demand. This would stimulate the economy into higher production, which in turn would call upon greater utUisation and expansion of the work force. The Government has, I am afraid, fallen victim to its own negative outlook. It seems to envisage every new migrant as a potential social security liabUity. The object of our migration policy should be the long term development of Australia. You cannot turn migration on and off like a tap. By imposing the present restrictions on the inflow of migrants to this country the Government has faUed to improve the employment situation. Not only has it faUed to estabUsh any connection between reducing immigration and improving the unemployment situation, but it has placed in jeopardy both our social structure and our long term national development. The Government maintains that Australia, at the present time, is incapable of sustaining an increase of more than 40 000 immigrants a year, despite the opinion of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation that the present capacity of Austraha's food energy resources is sufficient to support 37 mUlion people immediately-the e times our present population. The former Minister for Immigration and now the Minister's Advisor on Migrant Affairs, Mr Al Grassby, has even gone on record as stating that Australia has the capacity to support 100 mUlion people. When the late member for Melbourne, the Right Honourable Arthur Calwell, who was a good friend to many in this House,firstdesigned and implemented our post-war immigration policy we had a population of some 7 mUlion. Today our population is almost double thatfigureand Australia is immensely enriched by the skUls which migrants have brought to this country. this Much credit goes to the late right honourable member for Melbourne, Mr Calwell, for introducing that policy. It is sad to see the scheme now withering on the vine. I believe that the policy of the present Government towards immigration is wrong for a number of reasons. It faUs to acknowledge that Australia's demographic problems stem not from over-population but from a serious underpopulation compared with its size and capacity. It fails to recognise that our resources are capable of supporting at least 3 times our present population, and the pressing need to further develop those resources. It fails to respond to Austraha's impending zero population growth, as predicted by Borrie, which by the year 2000 is predicted to leave us nationally under-developed. It assumes that the only vahd basis for migrant entry is either immediate family reunion, and that is strictly enforced, or a recognised demand for certain limited classes of skills. Finally, it assumes that migration must not only be tuned to the existing employment situation, but that it must also be geared to it. All of us, as members acting on behalf of constituents, have seen people who would have made good migrants and excellent Australians refused entry to this country-peopl e who could have contributed greatly to Australia's future. I believe the Government's policy is not only short-sighted and damaging but that it fails to come to grips with the real problems facing Australia's long term development. The reintroduction of a vigorous immigration program could do much to revitalise Australia. I call upon the Government to rethink seriously its present immigration policy.",63
184,Mr KEOGH,HOUSING MINISTERS,"Earlier this The in evening my colleague the honourable member officers in Government for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) mentioned the take lack of concern for migrants once they were tled in this country. It was a significant feature the immigration policy under the previous Government, to such and extent that by the time we of the Australian Labor Party came in December 1972 some 25 per cent of our annual migrant intake was being lost by wastage of migrants returning to their home countries. Realising the need to reverse this trend and develop a policy of post-arrival and settlement concern, several actions were taken very quickly by the labor Minister for Immigration, Mr Al Grassby. Among those valuable initiatives was the decision to appoint a committee of the Immigration Advisory Council to inquire into and report upon the extent of discrimination exploitation of migrants, with particular emphashould sis on their use of community resources. The Committee has presented its interim report to the Minister for Labor and Immigration (Senator James MCClelland). It was tabled in the Parliaties ment in August 1974. The final report of the Committee has been completed. It will shortly be in the hands of the Minister and I would expect before the end of this session it will also be sented to Parliament. In the interim report the Committee put particular emphasis on several aspects of community concern for migrants and highlighted several areas in which discrimination was practised against migrants. Some of the recommendations made in the interim report, which is in fact a document in its own right, have received the attention of the Government. Several others are in the process of receiving the attention of the Government. I think it is important to reflect upon these recommendations and I want to mention just a few of them tonight so that they can receive fresh attention by the Minister and by the Department responsible for their implementation. The recommendations of the Committee in its interim report included one numbered 25 which was to the effect that training institutions should offer facilities for the training of skilled interpreters to enable the formation of a cadre of professional interpreters available for employment in government departments, private enterprise, hospitals, courts, prisons and in the community generally. Substantial progress has been made in the establishment of interpreter training courses at tertiary level institutions in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra. One of the major unfulfilled needs of the migrant communities Australia is for the services of interpreters. decision of the Public Service Board to allow Departments to underfull time interpreter courses at full salary setand for the Department of Labor and Immigraof tion to pay allowances made under the National Employment and Training scheme to certain categories of students enrolled in these courses is to office a positive step forward. It remains to be seen whether there has been acceptance by courts, police, hospitals and other to bodies in contact with the public of any obUgation to provide trained interpreters to facilitate their dealing with migrants. There is still much to be done by the Australian Public Service Board and the various boards responsible for the employment of public servants in the various Australian States. These bodies are responsible for and determining the conditions of employment and ensure that interpreting skills are adequately rewarded and positive action is taken to ensure that positions as interpreters are provided for the students now under training at universiand colleges of advanced education. WhUe it wiU be maintained that there are limits to the possibUities of introducing studies premigrant languages and cultures into professional training courses in Australia, the Committee in considering the needs decided that it was important to emphasise that there would be value in exploring ways and means of introducing such studies into the professional training social workers, doctors and lawyers and other professionals working in contact with migrant communities. Another important recommendation of the interim report of the Committee was recommendation 13 which dealt with the fundamental human right of a migrant without an adequate knowledge of English to have an immediate and absolute right to the choice of a skilled interpreter in every interrogation by the police and in all courts of law. This has been of serious concern to those interested in the welfare of migrants. There have been many blatant examples of justice having been denied to people over some of the most simple offences against the law simply because of the inability of the person charged or accused to understand the English language and to communicate with the law enforcement officers charging or accusing him. Recommendation 28 of the Committee suggested that official letters and documents issued by local government authorities and government departments offering services to the general public should be stamped in a number of the major migrant languages with the sentence: ' If you need this translated please indicate the language required and return'. There again in that particular area there have been numerous cases where, simply because of the inability of the migrant to understand his rights and entitlements from government departmentsthis could apply particularly in relation to the Department of Social Security-h e has been denied those rights. It is as well for the Government to remember that it has a responsibility to ensure that rights to every citizen, to every worker, are not denied simply because of the inability of the worker, being a migrant, to communicate in the normally used English language. The interim report supported proposals that the criterion restricting eligibility for permanent employment in the Public Service should reviewed. The National Committee on Discrimimanner nation in Employment and Occupation has quite endorsed this specific recommendation and expressed the view that where any nationality requirement is justified it should be restricted that of Australian citizenship. It is understood that the National Committee has included a recommendation to this effect in its submission the Royal Commission on Australian Government ment Administration. Until such time as action taken to revise the present nationality criteria, non-British migrants are being discriminated against in that they are cut off from obtaining permanent employment in Government services of teachers, in some circumstances. There, of course, we must be prepared to accept the fact that something is being done. It is unfortunately a fact that it is most unlikely that any action will be taken to overcome this problem effectively until suchtimeas the Royal commission-reports. But I believe that it should be regarded by the Government as a matter of urgency that this one area of discrimination against newly arrived migrants should be eliminated by the positive action of the Government to give equal employment opportunities in the Public Service to all Australian citizens regardless of their ability to handle effectively the EngUsh language. Bearing in mind of course that there could be some reason in some particular positions where it would be absolutely necessary for persons to be fluent in English, there would be mahy positions that they couldfiUbecause of the skills that they naturally possess and with which they came to this country. But at the moment they are discriminated against because of the fact' that they are not able to handle the EngUsh language. Having had the opportunity to take part in the deUberations of this Committee under the chairmanship of Mr Walter Lippmann, representing the Australian Jewish community from Melbourne, I must compUment the work that he undertook as chairman of the Committee and recommend to all members of the Parliament the value of this report.",64
185,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,HOUSING MINISTERS,Mr Armitage)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,65
186,Mr MACPHEE,HOUSING MINISTERS,"I wish to talk tonight about the National Employment and Traming scheme. The 3 fundamental objectives of the NEAT scheme are, of course, pursuant to the Cochrane report and are excellent. The only criticisms which have come from the Opposition be about the NEAT scheme have been about the of its administration, which has been deplorable. Our problems in regard to the has NEAT scheme may be discerned from the impartial first annual report of the National to Training Council for the year ended 31 December 1974. If one looks at that report one sees reference to the fact that the NEAT scheme to has superseded the previous Australian Governadministered labour market training aris rangements and it has absorbed aU trainees under previously operating training programs. Of course many of these were initiated by the previous Liberal-Country Party Government. This is one explanation of the fact that the Minister is able to claim that there are 10 000 trainees under the NEAT scheme. That report goes on to say this and this is rather important: Of necessity, persons unemployed by reason of tariff cuts, redundancy and other structural change agents, and who needed to undertake training to enter suitable new employment, were afforded highest priority assistance. One has to observe that the 25 per cent across board tariff cuts were prepared without the NEAT scheme being ready to cope with the consequent unemployment. This is one reason why NEAT is so maligned and one reason the Department ofLabor and Immigration, with the best will in the world, could not cope with strains and demands placed upon it. I wish to make clear that the criticisms which I direct not at the officers of the Department of Labor and Immigration but at the Government for tariff making across the board tariff cuts of this magniNational tude and expecting NEAT to be able to cope. The other aspect of the report tant is that at the end of December 1974 two-thirds of those training under NEAT were women. The policy has changed somewhat from that set out in a ministerial directive of 6 December 1974 when Mr Clyde Cameron was the Minister for Labor and Immigration. Howwealthy, ever, before referring to the training of women under NEAT I would like to make clear that all members of this Committee have experienced problems associated with maladministration, problems stemming from the fact that the in regard to NEAT has changed almost Departmental officers, again with the best will in the world, have scratched their heads and have been unable to explain adequately the policy because it has never seemed to be clear. Members from both sides of the chamber have written the Minister of the day asking for clarification, but this has never been forthcoming. Before I move on to the question of women under the NEAT scheme, I would like to raise third factor. The honourable member Adelaide (Mr Young) mentioned that the present Government had recognised that retraining is necessary because persons are not trained just once by way of an apprenticeship, a degree or otherwise; they need to be retrained several times. We would be a lot further advanced if only the trade union movement in Australia and, would recognise that proposition. The Governmatters ment of the day, whether it be Labor or Liberal, will have difficulties with the old conservative trade unionists who believe that once one has ticket one is trained for life. Having said that, all honourable members know of many serious anomalies and injustices which have resulted from the maladministration, the frequent policy changes and the absence of any certain guidelines surrounding this scheme. The first criticism one would make is that NEAT is supposedly directed towards labour market needs. Yet officers of the Commonwealth Employment Service appear to rely upon their the own flimsy resources for market information. The accuracy of information is crucial when taxpayers' money is being spent on trainees for 3 years. This is one reason why we hear stories of why one part of the Department of Labor and Immigration compensating employees and manthe agement for structural adjustment programs consequent upon tariff reforms and another part are of the Departmentttainingpeople for jobs which have been rendered redundant because of the reforms. Equally, there was a report in the Times of 2 June last of 22 persons being retrained for unskilled jobs. We hear of many which is imporother anomalies. The second criticism is that of a basic error in the Cochrane report which prescribed a flat allowance for trainees. This has led to a number of abuses. The first abuse is by the wives of the some of whom live in my electorate. Some of these people, who drive to the various educational institutions in their Mercedes-Benz or other expensive cars, are getting the same amount of approximately $97 as the unempolicy ployed labourer with many dependants who daily. rides his bike to school. Mr Keogh-And all vote Liberal.",65
187,Mr MACPHEE,HOUSING MINISTERS,"I am not denying that. I do not congratulate myself for that fact. But it is the to Government which is on trial at the moment. The NEAT scheme is also abused by husbands, some of whom are getting $97 a week although they have part-time or full-time jobs. Some are doing evening shifts and some have wives who a work on a full-time basis. But these people are for Port stUl getting their $97. There is also discrimination against married women who since 6 December are not regarded as 'primary breadwinners'. I am referring to women who wish to undertake a tertiary training program and to bereimbursedfor books or fares where appropriate, fees. I have raised these with the departmental officers for many months. In some cases I have raised them with the present Minister for Labor and Immigration a and with the previous Minister. But still there persists a discrimination which is really based on sex. It is very difficult to discuss these matters equately in 10 minutes. In myfilesI have some very eloquent cases of incompetence in regard to the administration of NEAT. The most impassioned and articulate of these is from a Mrs Moore whose letters are well worth reading. However, my less eloquent shorthand version raises these points. Firstly, she applied for assistconsiderable ance under NEAT in October 1974 when the then Minister boasted that NEAT did not discriminate against women and that both men and women had the right to qualify in their own right. She was told to contact the St Kilda Commonwealth Employment Service office when she heard from her institution that she had been accepted. This acceptance, of course, came after 6 December, the date on which the NEAT policy changed in regard to people not regarded as primary breadwinners. As it was she was never the primary breadwinner in her family. Therefore for the first time she was ineligible to receive the NEAT grant. She was therefore refused. But she sits beside people who applied at the same time as she made her application and who managed to obtain acceptances from their institution before 6 December and are therefore entitled to be reimbursed for registration, tuition and examination fees, and of course, their books. It is important that we reahse that the Australian Taxation Office does not allow her husband to deduct her educational expenses from his taxable income because she is over the age of 25 years. So here is another case of one Government department acting without coordinating with another. There are thousands of people like Mrs Moore who resent the fact that they are sitting beside people who get $97. They resent even more their inability to be able to deduct educational expenses from their taxable income. People like Mrs Moore would be content with a small sum to offset the cost of travel, books and child minding. But this is not appropriate at the moment. It seems that a means test is clearly necessary. We have to remove this impractical theory of t's egalitarianism. If we were to pay married women who have a primary breadwinner less than the thing, $97 decreed by NEAT there would be more money to go around, more people would be able to be trained and more would be able to satisfy the essential aims of the Cochrane report which are to contribute to overcoming skills in short supply; to assist in long term structuring of the work force and bring about overall increases the general levels of skill; and to serve the and economic well-being of the community by the removal of inequalities and the enhancement ad- of employment opportunities. There are many illustrations of this which make a mockery of the present aims of the NEAT scheme and affect thousands of people.",66
188,Mr RIORDAN,HOUSING MINISTERS,"The honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Macphee) spent a amount of his time in pointing up the deficiences and the difficulties which have been associated with the administration of the National Employment and Training scheme. I accept that there are deficiencies and that there are many imperfections in the NEAT scheme. But let me put it to him in this way: It is far better that there should be a NEAT scheme with all its imperfections, with all of its teething troubles and with all of its difficulties than that there should never have been the NEAT scheme. For a generation of neglect under the Liberal-Country Party Government this country did not have a manpower policy of any kind. We had ad hocracy at its worse. Here we have a situation where a scheme has been developed hurriedly without the adequate planning that this Government would have liked to have given it, but the urgency of events demanded that a scheme be implemented. We have learnt from our mistakes and the administrative errors, and they are being corrected. I am indeed grateful for the manner in which the honourable member brought his criticism forward. It has been noted and will be taken up and followed through. The honourable member for Corangamite (Mr Street) raised some criticism about the administration of the Department, particularly in respect of the Auditor-General's report concerning some overpayment under the income maintenance scheme. I am able to confirm for him that the majority of the funds which have been overspent on the income maintenance scheme have been recovered and the balance is in the process of being recovered. A considerable amount is still outstanding. The Department had the option really to dot all the i's and cross all the or get the money out to these people in need in a hurry. It opted to do what was the humane to get the money into the hands of those who needed it as quickly as possible. Hence there has been some overpayment. Those who have received the overpayment are honest people and have so far responded to the call to repay the funds which were overpaid to them. The honourable member for Corangamite in also raised some criticism of the Regional Emsocial ployment Development scheme. He mentioned that in the electorate of Braddon some $500,000 had been spent. The energetic and very vigorous honourable member for Braddon (Mr Davies) has pointed out to me that the figure is at least double that amount. In fact 36 projects have been approved in that electorate at a cost of $1,044,000. There are very many applications for RED scheme assistance. In the Braddon electorate 180 projects were approved, but in many cases where sponsors had indicated that they were ready to proceed immediately there were long delays between the time when the scheme was approved and when the work commenced. In some cases at least, sponsors of RED scheme projects lost sight of the objective of the scheme, which was to put to work quickly people who were unemployed, whilst at the same time engaging in a project which had community value. It has been a very good scheme, and I for one am somewhat tired of the hypocrisy of members of the Opposition who come into this Parliament and bemoan the fact that the RED scheme has had to be curtailed to a very large extent whilst at the same time encouraging their colleagues in the States to challenge the validity of the RED scheme. They attempt to assassinate it outside the Parliament but come into the Parliament on the other hand trying to uphold its virtues. Their stand is not being accepted except in the spirit in which it really should be seen.",67
189,Mr REYNOLDS,HOUSING MINISTERS,Crocodil e tears.,68
190,Mr RIORDAN,HOUSING MINISTERS,"My colleague says that members of the Opposition are shedding crocodile tears. They certamly are. Sympathetic consideration is being given and will be given to those who have sponsored projects on which expenditure has already been incurred. It was made clear that increased costs would not be part of the scheme, but even there the Minister for Labor and Immigration (Senator James MCClelland) is looking at particular projects to ensure that substantial justice is done in every case and that there is no undue hardship wherever that can be avoided. So those who are concerned ought to recall that this Government introduced this scheme and is keen to ensure that those who co-operated in it are not left financially disadvantaged if that is at all possible. Every project will be looked at on its merits. The honourable member for Warringah (Mr MACKeUar) had some things to say about the migration scheme. Again it was an exercise in humbug. He had the gall to stand before this Parliament this afternoon and criticise this Government for the funds that are being spent on migrant education, on language training. Mr MACKellar- I did not.",68
191,Mr RIORDAN,HOUSING MINISTERS,"Of course you did. Let me remind the honourable member of some figures. In 1970-71 the government he supported, a Liberal-Country Party government, spent $3.875m on the total migrant education services. In 1971-72 it exceUed itself. It went to $6.275m. This year the amount is $20.414m. That is the difference-nearl y three times as much as the former Government's last fuU year-and the honourable member criticises it. Let me talk about last year. One has to look at the estimates for the Department of Education to find the figure for adult migrant education. In 1975-76 it is $7.6m. Last year it was $4.8m. I thank those honourable members who made intelligent and positive contributions. I now move: That the question be now put. Question resolved in the affirmative. Proposed expenditure agreed to. Department of Northern Australia Proposed expenditure, $51,194,000.",68
192,Mr KATTER,HOUSING MINISTERS," I notice from the Estimates that the total to be allocated for expenditure in Northern Australia is $51,194,000.1 think that is about as inadequate as the 10 minutes one is permitted to try to expose and project",68
193,Dr PATTERSON,HOUSING MINISTERS,You rfiguresare all wrong.,68
194,Mr KATTER,HOUSING MINISTERS,I have your ownfigureshere.,68
195,Dr PATTERSON,HOUSING MINISTERS,There is $100m for Darwin alone.,68
196,Mr KATTER,HOUSING MINISTERS,"You get your officers to revise the summary of the Department of Northern Australia. May I make the most of the 10 minutes and overlook the interjection by the Minister. People think of northern Australia in terms of a strip ofland along the coast of north Queensland and the Northern Territory. It is not; it is a vast treasure house. If the production of that part of Australia were taken away this country would be brought to its kneesfinancially.The treatment which northern Australia gets is completely inadequate in comparison with its needs. If one were to calculate production per head of population in northern Australia one would appreciate how valuable the people of northern Australia are to this nation. They are people who suffer, particularly as you go further north and further west, unfriendly climatic conditions to say the least. However people do not go to these areas, as some would have it, to be confined to some sort of desert island or suffer some sort of second rate treatment by the rest of Austraha. They are usually strategic people associated with the great industries in that area. One of the industries most prominent in the area for which the Minister for Northern Australia (Dr Patterson) has responsibility and on which I as shadow Minister have to keep an eye is the beef cattle industry. I consider that no real attempt has been made yet by the Minister for Northern Austraha or the Minister for Agriculture (Senator Wriedt) to take a stand in Cabinet on the problems of the beef industry. I would like to see them take a stand as 2 Country Party Ministers did when the subsidy on wool was at stake. In the Cabinet room they had to light their own Cabinet for the survival of that industry which produces the best part of $1 billion and which every newspaper in the country said should be written off. These 2 young men, when John MCEwen was away, took their stand in the Cabinet and fought their own Cabinet on an issue that was of vital importance to this country. I challenge the Minister for Northern Australia and I challenge his associate, Senator Wriedt, to say when they have taken such a stand and to name any substantial concession they have secured for the beef cattle industry. Another matter which is of critical importance, particularly to the Northern Territory, is sealing of one section of beef road. I give credit to the Minister that when he was an officer of Department of Primary Industry one of his serving priorities, I believe, was the completion of the sealing of the road between Winton and Boulia. The section is some 60 miles long and is the misstion; ing link in any normal wet; never possibility of the floods we had the year before last. Had that section of road been sealed at that time immense worry and difficulties would have been avoided. Yet I was informed by the Ministo ter that there is no plan to complete the final sealing of this road. I hope that when the MinisLarge ter replies he has some better news than that. rather wonder what would happen if some 60 miles of road, say, to the Gold Coast or somewho where in the vicinity of the great populated areas suffered a series of potholes. My goodness, whole of the workforce would be out in action What and money would not be taken into account. The Barkly Highway, particularly near Mount Isa, has a series of potholes and missing sections. obvious attempt has been made to bring the highway into a condition where, when the wet comes-afte r all it is not very far away-it will offer an obstacle to those wanting to get through to Darwin. Let me deal briefly with the work of the Darwin Reconstruction Commission. I have said in this House and I repeat now that Tracy visited Darwin 9 months ago with all its devastation and as yet the Commission with millions of dollars at its disposal has not yet completed one house. The Minister interjected a moment ago and said $100m was allocated to the Commission alone. I agree with him. That is not taken into account in thefigureI gave. I was in Darwin a fortnight ago. I went right through the area and one house is about to be completed. Mr Keogh-You told them you were an exwaterside worker.",68
197,Mr KATTER,HOUSING MINISTERS,The honourable member should go and play with his yoyo or something; that is about his capabUity. Mr Keogh-When did you work on the wharves?,69
198,Mr KATTER,HOUSING MINISTERS,"The honourable member for Bowman is Uke the Condamine bell. He has a great tongue and a head full of nothingness. The reconstruction of Darwm is vital to the nation. Obvious facts are emerging. People who desire to resettle in Darwin are coming away with the thought that maybe they will never return because there are no homes waiting for them. Admittedly the ground floor has been laid for numerous homes. I believe that the official leak is the that probably about 200 homes will be constructed by Christmas, but the reality is, accordthe ing to those who know the score and who are obthe situation closely, that we will be lucky if we see 20 homes completed by Christmas. This is an obvious operation in socialised construca pilot scheme for socialism. It has fallen mind about the over on its face. I ask honourable members to look at the example set by private enterprise. One has only wander around Darwin to see that private enterprise has got everything back in action. companies have homes completed, includI ing painting, for their employees. One would never know the cyclone had hit. Yet the people want to return to their own homes find that there is no home to return to. Where are these the people put? Most were put on the ship Patris. is that costing? It is costing millions of dollars because of the over bureaucracy, the over planning and the complete bungUng that always No follows this sort of sociaUsm. I would like to stress one or two other points in the few minutes I have left. One is the freight not charges which are utterly brutal to the people of the Northern Territory. Price fixing on soft drinks is practised in the Northern Territory. It cost me 40 cents for a small can of Coca Cola in Alice Springs not so very long ago. So much for price fixing. Freight charges from Darwin to Tennant Creek, for instance, haverisen82% per cent in the last 12 months. The co-ordinated freight rate to Tennant Creek is about $140 a tonne. By road it is $75 a tonne. One might say that the freight rates are actually crippling and almost coming to a point where one would write off the rail and road co-ordinated transport. Getting away from the Territory for the moment let me refer to one project which is well known to the Minister. I refer to stage 2 of the Urannah Dam scheme. The first stage is certainly under way. The second stage is vital for many reasons. If sufficient water is not available the flourishing rice industry will be brought to a standstill. At present the amount of production is only a fraction of the amount ofricewhich could be produced and sold in that area. Obviously further allocations ofland for sugar will be made and this will absorb the very limited amount of water in the area. The next point relates to something I put before the Minister previously. I did so by telegram, which he ignored of course. I very rarely get a detailed reply from the Minister. I asked him whether it was true that no executive powers had been given as yet to the Legislative Assembly, and about the rumour of the Cabinet decision that there is no time set down for any executive powers to be given to the Legislative Assembly. I am sure my colleague, the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Calder), will enlarge on that subject. It is solute disgrace and an act of gross hypocrisy that the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) went up there and made a great flourish of trumpets about the executive powers which would be given to the Assembly. Because the Government gained no seats in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly this vicious party with its vitriolic detestation of those who do not go along with it has politically deprived the Legislative Assembly of any effective powers whatsoever.",69
199,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,HOUSING MINISTERS,Mr Armitage)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,70
200,Mr MORRIS,HOUSING MINISTERS,"The previous speaker, the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter), handles the truth like he would handle a handful of bulldust. He was a Minister in a government which had a priority of spending thousands of millions of dollars on the murder of South Vietnamese women and children and young Australians and which could not provide a few hundred million dollars for beef road schemes. I think it is absolute effrontery for him 3 or 4 years later to be talking about beef road priorities. Mr Katter-Who built the beef roads, you nincompoop?",70
201,Mr MORRIS,HOUSING MINISTERS,"The honourable member mentioned that no new homes had been built in Darwin, but he conveniendy ignored",70
202,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,HOUSING MINISTERS,Order! The honourable member for Kennedy will restrain himself and watch the rather colourful manner in which he sometimes interjects.,70
203,Mr MORRIS,HOUSING MINISTERS,"Mr Deputy Chairman, he is a very colourful character in the chamber. Many allusions are made about his activities. I am deliberately trying to address my remarks to the chamber in the least provocative manner so as not to disturb him. He mentioned that no new homes had been built in Darwin but he again conveniently ignored the fact that 4000 homes have been restored and are now being inhabited. He also ignored the facts that 5000 caravans have been transferred to Darwin and are now in use. He mentioned the Patris, but not in a pleasant or a congratulatory kind of way. He did not mention the 400 demountable homes that have also been moved to Darwin and are now set up in use. I think he is quite unfair and certainly some effort is called for on his part to try to bring himself to the truth of the matter. In speaking to the estimates for the Departan ab- ment of Northern Australia 1 want to refer specifically to the activities of the Department in association with the Darwin Cyclone Tracy Relief Trust Fund and the reports that have been tabled by the Minister for Northern Australia (Dr Patterson) in the past few months in this chamber. Honourable members will recall the public disquiet following the tragedy of cyclone Tracy over the proliferation of funds collecting donations ostensibly for the victims of the disaster and about the method of disbursement of moneys, a matter referred to by the fund in its reports for April and May 1975.1 will come back to that later. Australians have always been known for their generosity in assisting those in need when disasters such as cyclones, floods, fire and drought strike. Naturally that same generosity was displayed by millions of Australians in the wake of cyclone Tracy last December. However, I believe that large sums of money that were collected have not been accounted for yet. Further, I believe that when the pubhc subscribed to radio appeals and telethons they did so in the clear belief that all of the moneys collected in the telethons would go to the charity or organisations for which the appeal was being conducted. I am quite certain from talking to members of the public that they were under the impression that television and radio stations donated their services to the appeals free of charge. There doubt that radio and television stations derive considerable goodwill from the conduct of telethons. The public sees them as carrying out a much needed public service. I think this also induces members of the public to give more readily. They feel they are joining in a massive community effort to help those who are less privileged and those who are in difficulty. In February this year I placed on notice question No. 1949 to the Postmaster-General (Senator Bishop) seeking information on the services provided by the Postmaster-General's Department for telethons. The answer appeared in Hansard at page 1574 on 10 April. Also in February I placed on notice a question to the Minister representing the Minister for the Media. After repeated representations to the Minister I finally received an answer which appeared in Hansard of 2 June. Comparisons of those answers showed wide discrepancies in the amounts promised, the amounts collected and the amounts actually paid to the appeals concerned. When I received the answer from the Minister for the Media I issued a Press release calling on the Minister for the Media to conduct an inquiry into the conduct of telethons. I was particularly concerned with appeals ducted for victims of cyclone Tracy. The strange thing that happened while I was seeking inforoperating mation on the expenses deducted from telethon collections was that suddenly the Trust Fund received funds that had been collected several months previously but had not been remitted the Trust Fund. Where the funds had been held and why they had not been remitted previously have been unable to ascertain. An examination was deducted. of the answer from the Minister for the Media gives cause for serious concern, in my view, there should be a public inquiry, preferably by parliamentary committee, into the conduct of telethons and the disbursement of funds colthe lected. After all, the public gave that money the victims of cyclone Tracy and for other appeals. The public is entitled to know where went and for what it was used. I have learnt since I placed my question notice that the Australian Broadcasting Control Board does not have any real power to order an inquiry. For that reason I feel that the appropritied ate body would be a parliamentary committee. The public gave those donations in good faith and is entitled to know what happens to money which it donates. Some of the variations in the amounts promised as compared with the amounts collected are shown on the page of Hansard which I mentioned previously. If one is no looks at radio 2KM in Kempsey one sees that 87.6 per cent of funds promised were collected. Generally radio stations do not make any deductions for the conduct of appeals, but from talking to members of the public it is quite obvious that late in the evening and in the early hours of the monung it is considered quite a convenient practice to ring up a radio station or a television station when an appeal is being conducted to get one's name on television. All that is needed is a telephone call. There is no check that the money is actually subscribed. Mrs A or Mrs B may have her name mentioned on a television program as promising a donation of X dollars, and no one follows that through. I think that ought to be checked out. Radio station 4GR in Toowoomba in a Mother's Day appeal collected 81.3 per cent of what was promised. If we look at TCN9 in Sydney, $16,661 was deducted from the collections of the 1974 appeal for crippled children and only 79.9 per cent of the funds promised were collected. In the Melbourne University deafness appeal for 1974 which was conducted on ATVO 61.22 per cent of the funds promised were collected. If we move to NWS9 we find that that station in an appeal for the Minda Home conIncorporated and St John Council for South Australia deducted the sum of $27,082 for the appeal. We can go further and look at NBN3 in my own city. In an appeal for the Newcastle Sheltered Workshops 95 per cent of funds promised were collected and deductions to amounted to $3,750. In the TCN9 Darwin Relief Appeal, out of $3,077,832 funds collected, which I was 97.3 per cent of funds promised, $35,644 At the same time not all the stations which and conducted appeals provided information in a response to the question which I had placed on notice because they are not required to do so. All Minister could do was to rely on the goodwill for of the stations concerned. Channel 3 in Newcastle conducted an appeal for the victims of it Cyclone Tracy on New Year's Eve. There is no record of that appeal in the answer. I think these on matters ought to be looked at and ought to be brought to the notice of the public. Additionally, there were wide variations in the amounts deducby the stations concerned. In some cases no deductions were made. In other cases the deductions appear to be equivalent to the Post Office charge which was made. In other cases there appears to be no clear reason for the amounts deducted. Finally, some of the appeals conducted for Darwin did not show at all in the answer that was given. The Minister replied to my request for an inquiry by letter on 21 August. I will read it to the House. He referred to my letter and to my media releases. He said: I have discussed the matter of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, Mr Wright. Mr Wright has informed me that the question of telethons and appeals on radio and television has been taken up with the Federation of Australian Commercial Broadcasters the Federation of Commercial Television Stations. When the required information is available from the 2 Federations will write to you again. That was 7 months after I placed the question on notice and now, almost 8 months after I placed the question on notice, we are still waiting for information. The problem is that under the Broadcasting Act the Government has no power to demand the information which I sought. It is dependent on the goodwill of the stations. This is a serious deficiency in the power of the Broadcasting Control Board. Only a parliamentary inquiry will clear the air on what happened to the money which was collected for the victims of cyclone Tracy. Who sat on it for months? Why were the amounts deducted from the funds collected? What happened to the amounts collected? Where is the balance of the funds which were collected? I received no answer at all to this question: Can stations nominate the amounts to be paid to specific individuals or specific groups? I have solutely no doubt at all that an inquiry would show that at least one station attempted to do exactly that, to specify how much ought to given to a particular group. I refer honourable members to pages 1 and 2 of the March-April report of the Darwin Cyclone Tracy Relief Trust fund. I ask honourable members to bear in the comments of the Fund, particularly on page 2, in relation to its difficulty in trying to make an equitable and fair distribution of funds collected when many funds were operating, when many funds were collecting money and when many funds, including private funds, were distributing money. It is sad to see from the Auditorproduced General's report that even with the assistance which was given some people had to duplicate and triplicate their applications for assistance. think that is a very sad situation. I assume that is a very small minority of the people involved. hope that when the Auditor-General looks at that matter later we will have some more inforinclude mation on it.",70
204,Mr CALDER,HOUSING MINISTERS,I hope the honourable member for Shonland (Mr Moms) is not calling to account the Chairman of the Darwin Cyclone Tracy Relief Trust Fund. Mr Morris- I am supporting him.,72
205,Mr CALDER,HOUSING MINISTERS,It sounded to me as though the honourable member was accusing him of shortchanging. you raised with the Chairman Mr Morris-No .,72
206,Mr CALDER,HOUSING MINISTERS,"That is the way it sounded to and me. The honourable member for Kennedy (Mr I Katter) said that the last time he was in Darwin, which was late last month, no homes had been built. He was dead right. I was with him. The honourable member for Shonland said that there are 4000 homes. Of course there are 4000 homes. They have hit the roofs on with roofing nails. Why would they not do that? They have had to do it to stop the rain from coming in. But those houses are not cyclone-proof. They probably have not got ceilings. I suggest that the honourable member go to Darwin and have a look. The people are not accepting caravans. They do not want to live in caravans in the pouring rain. The honourable member mentioned demountable homes. They are temporary homes but the honourable member was talking as though they are permanent homes. Not one permanent home has been built by the Government since the cyclone. At least not one had been built when I was there the week before last. They may have since put a roof on one or two. I am not criticising the Fund so much as I am criticising abthe honourable member for misrepresenting the facts. To put up a demountable home in Darwin one spends $1,200 on putting in the foundations. be The honourable member should wake up to himself. Now the early storms are raging and the people are finding that caravans and temporary homes are not what they had hoped they would mind get. I feel very sorry for those people. I wish to address some remarks to the Minister for Northern Australia about the Northern Territory form of government. Those are strange words. They were quoted in 1972 in what was referred to as the yellow book which was in this House on 25 October. In that yellow book proposals were outlined for the transfer of the range of functions and executive I powers to the Northern Terrritory Legislative it Council, as it was in those days. I will not run I through them because the Minister would be well aware of them. They start with libraries and all the incidental State-type functions such as fire brigades, buildings, bus services, cemeteries, inspection of scaffolding and machinery, and so on. They include workers compensation, the control of firearms, electricity, water supply, sewerage, housing and the Northern Territory Public Service. In 1972 the then Government recommended that the administration and control of the police be offered to the Legislative Assembly. The proposal included the transfer of the printing office, State type taxation such as stamp duties succession duty and so on. Urban land was another item which was recommended in 1972 to be handed over to the control of the then Legislative Council. In 1974 there was much trumpeting about having a fully elected Assembly. We now have it and that is fair enough. It so happens that not one Labor representative was elected and because of that I accused this Government of not producing anything even approaching the October 1972 proposals in spite of the fact that there have been 2 joint parliamentary committee reports handed to the Government-. One of them recommended in paragraph 70 transferring many of the functions mentioned in the yellow book. The reports also mentioned that the Northern Territory police who with the Australian Capital Territory police do not want to be under the control of the great, all embracing Australia Police. A joint committee report recommended a sharing of the pohce functions- I think I have mentioned this in another debate-and said the responsibility for the enforcement of State-type laws over which the Territory has executive responsibihty should be in the hands of the Northern Territory police. That is one of many of the recommendations contained in the reports of 2 joint parliamentary committees. The shadow Minister for Northern Australia was recendy in the Northern Territory and he sounded out what the people think about this. He has come out and said- I have also said this-that the recommendations in these reports should be implemented. Why have these recommendations not been so implemented? I accuse the Government of stalling. I accuse it of not wishing to do the things which the Minister said would be done. Before this yellow book was introduced in 1972 and since that time he jumped up and down and said: 'These responsibilities are not enough. You are not doing enough for the Northern Territory. We will do more for the Northern Territory'. There was an election coming on, of course, so those who sit opposite promised everything in the worldMr Fulton-Who won it?",72
207,Mr CALDER,HOUSING MINISTERS,"We did and we have won it in the Northern Territory ever since. 17 to nil. Think that out. We now have had a fully elected Legislative Assembly as was promised, for almost 12 months ago. The Opposition has come out on several occasions and stated very recently that we will back the joint committee report. The Leader of the National Country Party (Mr Anthony) has also stated this. We have stated that we will implement, as recommended, the transfer of those powers and also we will establish a committee as recommended in paragraph 118 of the report which will have on it the Minister. What has the Minister done about this? He has done nothing. The Ministers in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly have been in office now for almost 12 months but what is happening? Absolutely nothing. The 17 members of the Assembly were elected by the will of the people, but not one Labor representative holds office. Mr Whan-You had 23 years and you got nowhere.",73
208,Mr CALDER,HOUSING MINISTERS,"Why do you not go up there and do a bit of electioneering? You would get on very well. The members of the Assembly were elected by the people but nothing has happened. I demand that this Government institute the recommendation to set up that committee, if it still holds office in the near future, so that the people of the Northern Territory can be given the things for which they voted. Honourable members opposite talk about democracy. Just briefly I ask the Minister what he is doing about the 1600 houses that this Government guaranteed it would buy back from the people of Darwin-house s which were devastated during the cyclone-whethe r they were on blocks of land with or without wrecked houses? What has happened? No money is available. All we get from this Minister and a Minister in another place is insults thrown at people in Darwin alleging that they are making false claims or claiming compensation which this Government considers they are not entitled to receive. There may be a very small percentage of people who do that sort of thing but the great majority of the people in Darwin, as the Minister would know, have had their houses devastated. They have lost their livelihood. They are not able to produce receipts. How can anyone produce a receipt when the roof is gone off the house, or the house is gone? The whole lot is gone and even the refrigerator is probably piled up against somebody else's house. The roof may be 2 miles away. This Government says: 'We will not pay you compenThe result was sation on that'. I know the rate of compensation was 50 per cent; that is fair enough. Originally it was a generous offer but it has turned into a completely sterile offer. The Minister has been insultmg the people of Darwin ever since the cyclone. He should try to meet them. Do not brush them off the way that he and other Ministers have been doing. This Government has been living by a double standard. It has said that people who suffered from Cyclone Tracy would be recompensed, but they have not been recompensed.",73
209,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,HOUSING MINISTERS,Mr Armitage)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,74
210,Dr PATTERSON,HOUSING MINISTERS," I was going to speak at length on the various projects which the Government has embarked on in the development of northern Australia but I think I will simply answer each of the statements made by the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) and the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Calder). Let me deal first with the honourable member for Kennedy who seems to specialise in going around the country and making grandiose, exaggerated statements, usually not based on fact, criticising me personally and criticising the Government. Only 3 weeks ago he went to Mackay in my electorate and criticised me publicly over the media and in the newspapers for my bungling of the Mount Isa railway deal. He said it was a shocking deal. The fact is that the Mount Isa railway deal was made by the Menzies Government. It was the Menzies Government, not the Holt Government, not the MCEwen Government, not the Gorton Government, not the MACMahon Government, not the Whitlam Government. It was made 15 years ago and I have criticised it. I have not stopped criticising it, because it is one of the worse deals that any government ever made. I agree with the honourable member for Kennedy. But it was the Party he supports that made that deal, not this Government. It involved a capital loan of $33m with total interest repayments of $24m. Out of a total of $57m $33m was a capital loan and $24m for interest payments. I agree with the honourable member for Kennedy, but it was a Country Party government that made the deal, not me and not the Whidam Government. The honourable member and the honourable member for the Northern Territory talked about statehood. Before I deal with that let me just refer to some more of these grandiose statements by the honourable member for Kennedy. He was in Darwin last last week. He criticised me. Speaking about me as the Minister for Northern Australia he said: ' I cannot get to him to get answers to questions'. The facts are that since 1972 the honourable member has asked me one question on northern Austraha. The honourable member also said: 'It is difficult to even get to him to ask him a question'. The point is that every",74
211,Mr CALDER,HOUSING MINISTERS,That is right. We cannot get you on the telephone. We cannot interview you.,74
212,Dr PATTERSON,HOUSING MINISTERS,"That is a deliberate untruth. Every member in this place, on the Opposition side and on the Government side, knows full well that any time they ask to come to my office they can come. If the honourable member for the Northern Territory is prepared to sit there and say that I have refused him permission to come to my office at any time then I cannot use language that is too strong to refute him. I say the same with respect to the honourable member for Kennedy. (Honourable members interjecting)",74
213,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,HOUSING MINISTERS,Mr Armitage)Order! The Committee will come to order. There are far too many interjections. The Minister will not reply to the interjections. He will address the Chair. The interjections will cease.,74
214,Dr PATTERSON,HOUSING MINISTERS,"Let me make this further point. The honourable member for Kennedy is reported in the Northern Territory News as saying that when the Liberal-Country Party coalition gained power it would take every step to make the Legislative Assembly effective and meaningful and would set about granting full powers that would lead to statehood. Statehood! 'That is', the honourable member said, 'our definite policy'. In 23 years of government, the Opposition Parties gave the people of the Northern Territory nothing. Who voted in this place and in the Senate against giving the people of the Northern Territory a vote in the Senate? Look at him. Look at the honourable member for Kennedy. Look also to the honourable member for the Northern Territory. He crossed the floor in this chamber. He voted against the Opposition Parties. He was not game to support his own Country Party.",74
215,Mr CALDER,HOUSING MINISTERS,Le t us get back to the estimates for the Northern Territory.,74
216,Dr PATTERSON,HOUSING MINISTERS,Can you not take it?,74
217,Mr CALDER,HOUSING MINISTERS,What about 2 senators for the Northern Territory?,74
218,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,HOUSING MINISTERS,Order!,74
219,Mr CALDER,HOUSING MINISTERS,Why did you not introduce legislation for 2 senators for the Northern Territory the Senate?,75
220,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,HOUSING MINISTERS,Order!,75
221,Mr CALDER,HOUSING MINISTERS,You did not because you know you will lose both positions.,75
222,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,HOUSING MINISTERS,Order! The honourable member for the Northern Territory will cease interjecting.,75
223,Mr CALDER,HOUSING MINISTERS,You know you will lose them both.,75
224,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,HOUSING MINISTERS,Order! The honourable member for the Northern Territory has spoken. He will cease interjecting.,75
225,Mr CALDER,HOUSING MINISTERS,I am being provoked.,75
226,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,HOUSING MINISTERS,Order! I warn the honourable member for the Northern Territory.,75
227,Mr CALDER,HOUSING MINISTERS,I am being provoked.,75
228,Dr PATTERSON,HOUSING MINISTERS,"In the Senate itself, who voted against giving the people of the Northern Territory a vote in Senate elections? It was the Liberal-Country Party senators. Who voted against giving the people of the Northern Territory a vote in referenda? It was the senators of the Liberal-Country Parties. Who took a case to the High Court to stop the people of the Northern Territory obtaiiiing a vote in Senate elections? It was the Liberal and Country Parties.",75
229,Mr CALDER,HOUSING MINISTERS,Who is making us listen to this nonsense?,75
230,Dr PATTERSON,HOUSING MINISTERS,Here these honourable members talk nonsense about,75
231,Mr CALDER,HOUSING MINISTERS,Ge t up in the Northern Temtory and say a word or two about that. Your name is worth nothing.,75
232,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,HOUSING MINISTERS,"Order! I have warned the Committee that it must come to order. Admittedly the Minister, I think, is being rather provocative. The honourable member for the Northern Territory in particular, who has spoken and whom I have already warned, will cease interjecting.",75
233,Mr CALDER,HOUSING MINISTERS,"Well , Mr Deputy Chairman, if you keep the Minister in order. I will remain in order.",75
234,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,HOUSING MINISTERS,The honourable member will cease interjecting or I will name him.,75
235,Mr CALDER,HOUSING MINISTERS,Thank s for your advice.,75
236,Dr PATTERSON,HOUSING MINISTERS,When the double dissolution debate on this matter took place we saw the same performance from the honourable member in for the Northern Territory. He tried to get thrown out just as he is trying to do so now. But then the Speaker was a wake-up to him. Let me deal again with my honourable friend from Kennedy and what he is reported as saying in the Northern Territory News. Listen to this. The newspaper reports: During his tour of DarwinMr Katter-Of the Northern Territory.,75
237,Dr PATTERSON,HOUSING MINISTERS,"You were only in Darwin for a few hours. The honourable member for Kennedy said that he was disappointed that he had not had time to meet wharf workers and the Port Authority. Listen to this: A waterside worker in Brisbane before entering politics, Mr Katter saidMr Katter a waterside worker? Mr Katter-That is right. I worked on the wharves. I will bet you $ 100 here and now that I can prove it.",75
238,Mr CALDER,HOUSING MINISTERS,At least he did some work. That is more than you have done.,75
239,Dr PATTERSON,HOUSING MINISTERS,I did not say that he did not work on the wharves.,75
240,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,HOUSING MINISTERS,Order! The Minister will address the Chair.,75
241,Mr CALDER,HOUSING MINISTERS,"He has nothing to say, nothing at all to say.",75
242,Dr PATTERSON,HOUSING MINISTERS,The honourable member should listen to what I am going to say.,75
243,Mr CALDER,HOUSING MINISTERS,You are the Minister. Why don't you do something?,75
244,Dr PATTERSON,HOUSING MINISTERS,"What the honourable member for Kennedy wanted to do was to 'sort out the port of Darwin'. Those were the words of Mr Katter, a former waterside worker. I must admit that I did not know that the honourable member was a waterside worker. Mr Katter-What is the point? You are the great academic, are you?",75
245,Dr PATTERSON,HOUSING MINISTERS,The honourable member always loves to criticise me personally. What I said was that I was not aware that he was a waterside worker. I said that he ran a picture show in Cloncurry and that the newspaper would not print that. I do not throw off at the honourable gentleman because of that. That is what I thought he did. Mr Katter- I worked on the wharves.,75
246,Dr PATTERSON,HOUSING MINISTERS,Right. The honourable member for Kennedy asked me what stand I took in Cabinet on certain issues. Mr Katter-That is right. This will be good.,75
247,Dr PATTERSON,HOUSING MINISTERS,"Let me give you 3 examples. I mention first compensation for tuberculosis reactor for cattle. What stand did you take? You completely rejected the case of the cattlemen. You, when in government, threw it out. This Government introduced it. It accepted my submission, which you in government threw out, refused to accept.",76
248,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,HOUSING MINISTERS,Order! I would rernind the Minister that he will address the Chair rather than the honourable member for Kennedy,76
249,Dr PATTERSON,HOUSING MINISTERS,"Well, he is interjecting.",76
250,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,HOUSING MINISTERS,Then the honourable member will not have any justification for mterjecting.,76
251,Dr PATTERSON,HOUSING MINISTERS,Let me take the next point. You asked the questions. I will answer them. I mention next the Kinchant Dam. I assume that you have heard of it because you turned it down flat and would not vote one cent for it. Mr MCVeigh-Who did? The Deputy Chairman?,76
252,Dr PATTERSON,HOUSING MINISTERS,"The Liberal-Country Party Government turned it down. Not one cent. It was asked for by the Queensland Government under Mr Bjelke-Petersen. It was turned flatly down-nil , nothing. Mr Katter-What about Bundaberg or the Burdekin?",76
253,Dr PATTERSON,HOUSING MINISTERS,"The honourable member asks about the Burdekin, the Urannah Dam. Mr Katter-And Bundaberg?",76
254,Dr PATTERSON,HOUSING MINISTERS,You are asking the questions; I am answering them. What did your Government do with respect to the Urannah Dam? Nothing. In 23 years you talked about Burdekin and the Urannah. The cold facts are to be found in the history books. They are that the former Government did nothing. Mr Katter-What about Burdekin irrigation?,76
255,Dr PATTERSON,HOUSING MINISTERS,"In 1949, in his policy speech, Arthur Fadden, as he was before he was knighted, said these words: We will not pigeonhole the great Burdekin scheme. We will go ahead and build it immediately. He said that in 1949. By 1972, nothing had been done. Not one cent had been spent on investigations. This Government commenced work immediately. It set up the joint Queensland Commonwealth Burdekin River committee. Already $500,000 has been spent on basic investigations in relation to geology and engineering. This work should have been done years ago. The honourable member for Kennedy asked me a question about beef roads, specifically the Winton-Boulia road. The Winton-Boulia road is not in the priority for this 3-year program, butMr Katter-You gave it priority.",76
256,Dr PATTERSON,HOUSING MINISTERS,"Yes, I know I did. But there are other roads with a higher priority. What I have suggested to the honourable member-and I am not certain from memory whether I said it in the letter-is that he ought to ask the Queensland Government to spend some of its money on this road becauseMr Katter-How can you say that when",76
257,Dr PATTERSON,HOUSING MINISTERS,"Wait a minute. In the previous 5-year program, the Queensland Government spent $9m of its own money in assisting in the beef roads program. In this 3-year program it is spending nothing. I would have thought that, as the Australian Government is spending $24m on beef roads, the Queensland Government could have found something. But not one cent is it providing. What I would suggest that the honourable member for Kennedy should do- I have not suggested this to the Queensland Government-is propose to the Queensland Government that it should spend some of its own money, the money that it has saved on national highways, for example, on this missing link with respect to the Winton-Boulia Road. Of course it is important. I never said otherwise. It is an important road. But there are other roads which have a higher priority in relation to the cattle industry. This missing link certainly should be completed. I repeat that the Queensland Government should use some of its resources. As regards the suggestion by the honourable member with respect to the Gold Coast, if the road to the Gold Coast was full of potholes there would be action. Most certainly there would be action. The Queensland Government-that is the Country Party dominated Government of Queensland-shoul d spend less money on super highways between Brisbane and the Gold Coast-and more money in the rural areas of Queensland from which the wealth of Queensland is produced. That is what the honourable member should be criticising the Queensland Government about. I wish to deal now with the Darwin Reconstruction Commission. The fashion in this Parliament seems to be for the honourable member for the Northern Territory and to a lesser extent the honourable member for Kennedy-h e not so much, although he has done so in recent weeks - to denigrate the Darwin Reconstruction Commission, together with the authorities and community organisations in Darwin, that are doing everything possible to return that city to its former state. Not once do they give any credit to the people of Darwin who have been working flat out since the cyclone repairing houses. Only 2 days ago the honourable member for the Northern Territory rubbished the Minister for Repatriation and Compensation (Senator Wheeldon) for suggesting",76
258,Mr CALDER,HOUSING MINISTERS,I told the truth.,77
259,Dr PATTERSON,HOUSING MINISTERS,"The honourable member them did not tell the truth. If he had read the newspaper for the last 2 days he would have interjecting. found that the Legislative Assembly and the Northern Territory News completely agreed that the Government should go ahead and find those people in the Northern Territory who have put deliberately false claims. The honourable memgoing ber apparently is protecting those people, whom of Darwin. no one else would protect. Even the anti-Labor Northern Territory News in its editorial said that the Government is doing the right thing. Even the member of the Legislative Assembly representing that field of work said that the Government is doing the right thing. But course the honourable member for the Northern Territory has to use every possible statement try to denigrate those people in the Northern Territory who are doing something constructive towards bringing Darwin back to the city it once was. At the present time in Darwin",77
260,Mr CALDER,HOUSING MINISTERS,Why do you not get some sound advisers. They are all here in Canberra.,77
261,Dr PATTERSON,HOUSING MINISTERS,"Why does the honourable member not return to his seat. There are certain forms of this chamber that he obey. At the present time the Darwin Reconstruction Commission is using $71m for its housing program. It has under construction 541 relocatable units, 101 modular house units, 117 flats, 70 reconstructed damaged houses and 1300 new houses. The 1975-76 works program provides $77m for 1500 detached houses and flats, 500 relocatable units and 400 reconstructed damaged houses. The total works under confrom struction will cost $71m and the total new works will cost $77m. The overall 1975-76 works gram provides $148m for the reconstruction of Darwin. In anyone's language, that is a magsome nificent effort. Over 4000 houses have been repaired. Hundreds of caravans have been purpeople chased and put into place. It has been said by mischievous Liberal National Country Party sources in Darwin that all the demountable units were leaking. The fact is that the investigation carried out urgently on my instructions revealed only one complaint of a minor leak in the whole of Darwin. But that is the type of nonsense generated by the Liberal and Country Parties in order to denigrate",77
262,Mr CALDER,HOUSING MINISTERS,Eve n your own staffare laughing.,77
263,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,HOUSING MINISTERS,Mr Lucock)Order! I have spoken on 3 occasions about interjections from my left. If those interjections continue 3 names may appear in the newspaper tomorrow morning and I do not want one of to be mine in these circumstances. I suggest Darwin to honourable members that they cease,77
264,Dr PATTERSON,HOUSING MINISTERS,"It is quite clear that the honourable member for the Northern Territory does not want to hear about his own electorate. in He does not want to hear about the work that is on in his own electorate, inside or outside",77
265,Mr CALDER,HOUSING MINISTERS,I live there.,77
266,Dr PATTERSON,HOUSING MINISTERS,"The honourable member lives there but he would not know. The whole objective of the Government in preparing the of Budget has been to continue to maintain the impetus of its policies of reform and progress into the Northern Territory. In anyone's language, there has been a massive injection of funds into the Northern Territory to honour the declared intention of the Government to relieve, rehabilitate and rebuild Darwin. It has done this over the last 12 months and it will continue to do so in the next 12 months. Not only is there a continuing construction program but there is also a continuing program of advancement in health, education, Aboriginal affairs, social development and improvements in outback roadworks and is supposed to other facilities. Not many people realise the magnitude of the money involved in this operation in Darwin. For example, in those early weeks following the onslaught of cyclone Tracy, the Government spent $74.7m in providing food, clothing and shelter for the homeless, evacuating 26 000 residents, restoring essential services and providing men the armed forces to undertake the massive clean-up of debris that covered Darwin. In this proParliament the work of the Government was recognised. Apparently it is not recognised now, months later, by the honourable member for the Northern Territory in particular. But the of Darwin and the people of the Northern Territory recognise the magnificent workMr King-The magnificent work that he has done.",77
267,Dr PATTERSON,HOUSING MINISTERS,Thank you. They have recognised the magnificent work that the Government has done since cyclone Tracy.,78
268,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,HOUSING MINISTERS,"I call the honourable member for Wakefield. Motion (by Mr Nicholls) agreed to: That the question be now put. Proposed expenditure agreed to. Department of Science and Consumer Affairs Proposed expenditure, $ 139,201,000.",78
269,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,HOUSING MINISTERS,"The present Minister for Science and Consumer Affairs (Mr Clyde Cameron)-has been in charge of this Department for only about months, but his comments made at public meetmation ings and at meetings of the Australian Science and Technology Council suggest that he will energetic despite his reluctance to accept the portfolio. He talks of it as one of growing direction. influence in the Australian community, a sentiment that I share because I believe that and technology can contribute enormously to nation. In practical forms it will mean greater productivity, more jobs, better conditions, better wages and greater leisure. We live in a competiknow tive world and it is not possible for us to be to afford to lag behind in that world-. Tx is time that the present Government realy started to be energetic'about science. One of thefirstacts of the Labor Party, despite its platform and despite the pledges made by the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) and others prior to achieving regrettable office, was to disband the Science Advisory Council which had been set up by the previous Liberal-Country Party administration. For best part of 2 years we had a vacuum. Whilst previous Minister for Science, Mr Morrison, had Green Papers and White Papers published, they are no substitute for action. We had Virtually action in science in the first 2 years or So Government. Looking at the national record it is divisions. fair to concede that it has been mixed - I believe that in primary industry we have made a very substantial contribution. In the time that I had the responsibihty of being the shadow Minance ister for Science I have not been able to ascertain the same success in the manufacturing industries. In fact there are many areas which deserve a great deal of interest. There needs to be greater knowledge and greater understanding. There needs to be more informed debate both inside this Parliament and outside it. There needs to above everything else a community involvement, which has not heen apparent in Aus&ahji. If we look at the reports of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development- I think that the Minister will agree with this comment-w e find that compared with similar countries there is no doubt that we do not spend anywhere near as much as they do. We have a national responsibihty and an international responsibility, particularly in the areas of health, primary production and primary nutrition so far as our close neighbours are concerned. I support the concept of a science statement. It would be very desirable if the Parliament and the. nation knew what was expended by the in allfieldsof science. Not only do we want to know that; we want also greater accessibility of information. There is not much point in 3 having spent a lot of money in gathering inforif it is not reasonably accessible. We need to centralise that operation and I thought the be opening of the science library at the National Library the other night was a step in the right - The biggest allocation, about $ 120m, is for the science Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial the Research Organisation, an honoured body with a world reputation and one whose strength depends on its independence and its totality. I that the Minister for Science and Conable sumer Affairs has gone on record about the about independence of the CSIRO. He mentioned publiely that is should not be connected with the Public Service in any way. It is a pity he had not seepfitto make that statement immediately after he was appointed Minister because we had the step, the disgraceful step I believe, of an attempt being made by the Prime Minister, aided and abetted by the Minister for Minerals the an,d Energy (Mr Connor), to dismember the the CSIRO by transferring the solar energy studies and the mineral research laboratories out of it and into the Public Service under the Minister no for Minerals and Energy thus breaking an of this important inter-relationship between the I thought the honourable member for Edenhave Monaro (Mr Whan) tried to be of some assistat that time.It took us weeks to sort out the situation. The Prime Minister was busy at that time belting himself into the ground, with marked success, in the Bass by-election and for weeks we had this problem about the CSIRO. We ended up with the compromise of control by 2 Ministers. I would like the Minister for Science be and Consumer Affairs to be good enough to comment on how he sees that situation. Does he believe that this decision has disturbed the totality of the CSIRO? Does he think that joint responsibility will work? I hope he will concede that in the meantime substantial damage has been done to the morale of many of the staff members of the Organisation. If that was not sufficient, only a few weeks later we had the crisis relating to the Australian Research Grants Committee. Again I would like the Minister to tell the House what is in his mind in regard to the triennial vote. We know that it has been reduced. We know that because of some bad planning and bad bookkeeping we had facing us the possible retrenchment of up to 350 skilled research workers. Again, after some weeks of substanual campaigmng, particularly by the science community, success was gained with the aid of the Opposition and, I believe, with the aid of the Minister. We have now reached the stage where a loan of $2.1m has been arranged for the universities. Again I would like to ask the Minister to tell us about the We have overcome the short term problem but what is the future long term plan for the Australian Research Grants Committee. The Opposition welcomes the Australian ence and Technology Council and I want to thank the Minister for the courtesy of inviting me to its meetings. We are pleased to see that it is be drawn from the entire community. At first glance its terms of reference appeal but we will wait with a great deal of interest lative form that the Government plans this Council to take. There is no doubt that we will study this legislation when we receive it with great deal of interest, and I hope that this pens during this session of the Parhament. Had ASTEC been functioning earlier on I think could have overcome some of the problems that this Government has faced. I refer to the regretgoing table position whereby the Government, on coming to office, sacked the Advisory Council and took so long to get the Australian Science and Technology Council moving. We will again watch with interest the thrust of the Governcommodity ment's pohcies and how it sees the job of we ASTEC. I read with interest the Minister's comterms, ments on it at the meeting on 18 July 1975 in which there is an indication that the Government wanted to see substantial interest in marine scireceived ence and in astronomy. Surly one of the great problems we have in Australia is that of energy research. I would like the Minister to comment on the ministerial trol of such research and how he sees the from Government's priorities in that field which we the Opposition regard as tremendously substanIn tial and tremendously important. I hope the social sciences will not be overlooked. Man has to hve within his environment and I hope that this Government and future governments will do what they can to encourage not only the universities but also private industry to take a very real interest in the social sciences. This is a significant department and one about which I have ttied to learn in the five or six months that I have had some responsibihty for it on behalf of the Opposition. It is crystal clear to me that for the sake of the nation we need much more informed debate free of a lot of the emotion which pervades many research areas. I think it might well be argued that an increasing share of national expenditure could be directed to this Department. I am not suggesting an increase in government expenditure in this Budget but I would have thought, from looking at some of the other departmental estimates, that there is evidence of substantial waste and some inefficiency. future. One would have hoped that this Department would have had a greater degree of priority. This is a Department which is worthy of greater expenditure, bearing in mind its significance. SciFinally, I hope we see a great deal of cooperation between the Government, the universities, the great institutes of Australia and industo try. If we get that sort of co-operation, with the Government acting as a catalyst, I think it can make a massive contribution to national welfare to see the legisand development.",78
270,Mr YOUNG,HOUSING MINISTERS,"In the few minutes available to me I want to direct my a remarks to the consumer affairs side of the hapDepartment of Science and Consumer Affairs. In reinforcing the views of the previous speaker, the we honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Eric Robinson), I also beheve the Department is to come under increasing scrutiny and to become of increasing importance in what happens to the consumers of this country. As we interpret consumers as the people who use a or a service, we are throwing the net over the whole population of this country when talk of consumers. If we are talking in those talking of the whole population, it stands to reason that this Department should receive a great deal more attention than it may have in the past. We are speaking of the purchaser, from the child who might go to a shop to purchase a sweet to the person who is buying a home. We are talking of people who use services, consuch as uavellers, from people who go to and their places of work in buses and trams and of other forms of pubhc uansport to the jet-setter. the case of holiday makers, we are talking in terms of a person who hires a rowboat to use on the local river as well as those who might go on To an ocean cruise. Therefore it becomes ing importance to consider what a government may or may not do for a country to give those people the protection they need. The protection that has been offered in years period of years past has fallen short of the desires of the people question of Austraha. It is the intention of this Governtheir ment, in legislation aheady passed and legistection lation intended for the future, to fill the gaps that have existed. Consumer protection always seems to the consumer to be an unreal or intangible thing. There can be no doubt, as all of us see situation, that the citizens of this country are demanding that some action be taken about their rights. They want as much action in the future they have had rhetoric in the past. With this Government, and especially with the present Minister for Science and Consumer Affairs (Mr Clyde Cameron), I am sure that that is the sort action they will receive. I want to read into this short address the pohcy of this Government in relation to these affairs, set out in a speech by an Opposition member, copy of which I have before me. They are: To identify, publicise and otherwise expose unfair or practices and the exploitation of consumers, and to develop the involvement of the Australian Government consumer affairs, including the use of the purchasing powers of government.

Having given what has been the pohcy of the Party, it becomes increasingly obvious, of course, that the Austrahan Labor Party over a long has considered very seriously the of how the Austrahan Government could become involved, perhaps co-ordinating activities with the States in giving the prothat is necessary. But of course all these poUcies under the one heading in our platform make one come to the the conclusion that greater integration of laws and services is required. I must say that some of the adventurous schemes undertaken in the United as States greatly impressed me during my visit there some years ago and in the major cities of the southern States of America I was tremendously impressed by the people doing work in what they of termed legal aid offices. Many of the ideas I have, which I think can be implemented in Australia, stem from my experience of those legal aid offices. Their influence went far beyond as just giving legal aid; they were in fact legal aid a and consumer protection agencies. The staff did not sit in the offices waiting for customers but prices they went out and tried to agitate amongst the generally community to promote their services and to in inform the people as to how they were being touched by false advertising and by prices in a trade store on one side of town which were well above Trade the prices which were charged by simUar stores on the other side of town. The officers also advised the community in no uncertain manner creditas to the interest rates being charged by the varito control effective demand and ous money lending agencies in the cities. They were doing a great job, of course, in bringing up to date a community awareness. I think a lot of for the purpose of setting stanand that can be incorporated in what we are trying to role in these do here in Australia. I seriously put to the Committee and to the Minister that such a system could well be put into in such operation in Australia; that is, a combination of research legal aid and consumer protection in the one stanoffice. UnUke the Opposition which puts forward the view that authorities in control of implementof ing the relevant clauses of the Trade Practices or Act and the testing of the physical properties of consumer products should remain separate, I beenUeve in complete integration. The British Consumer Council said in its annual report in 1970: Manufacturers regularly develop new products, new methods of presentation, new marketing and seUing techwhich are in advance of general consumer experience and knowledge. by To that extent I was rather attracted to a consumer affairs document from New York which talked of the male cosmetics market that now exists in that country. I wish to quote from this New York consumer's newsletter called Money's Worth. It states: The male cosmetic consumer is surfacing. Revlon and Estee Lauder, top names in the high fashion skin game, are fighting cap, tooth, lick and nail for the millions of dollars their research people tell them are available from men who are ready for cosmetics and skin care. Bronzers, wrinkle creams and moisturizers are all being peddled in terms so butch and so masculine that a Braggi advertisement, for instance, begins to make you feel as if you would as soon leave the house without your testicles as leave without your makeup kit. That is the sort of effect that advertising could have on the Austrahan community. As I said previously, I should hke to see estabhshed regional consumer protection agencies incorporating legal aid right throughout Australia. In all the areas that we might recognise as regions we should have these legal aid and consumer protection offices-no t based, as I said, on the concept of waiting in the office for the people to come in but actively agitating out in the community and advising the people of their rights and the manner in which they should go about their shopping. It would be difficult to participate in a debate of this nature without mentioning the name of Ralph Nader. Nader has made an enormous contribution in combating false prices and corrupt practices. For instance his book Unsafe at any Speed brought to the attention of the American motorist the way in which they had been conned for years. Traffic accidents were always the fault of the motorists. The nut behind the wheel theory existed in the United States. But the Congressional hearing on auto safety in 1965-66 found quite different faults and saw the way clear for the introduction of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act. The action by Nader is a classic example of what we could term 'people power'. The combining of the services of consumer protection and legal aid would give the necessary teeth to present and proposed Government legislation.",79
271,Mr HOWARD,HOUSING MINISTERS,"Like the the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) I should like to direct my remarks to the second limb of responsibility of the Minister Science and Consumer Affairs (Mr Clyde ing Cameron), and that is the area of consumer affairs. When the Minister was sworn into his present portfolio all the Australian States and Federal Government had a member of the that Government specifically designated as having responsibiUty for consumer affairs. This developwUl ment itself indicates the mounting community demand that Australian consumers should have a fairer deal and that there should be a proper voice for consumer protection demands in government. This is a trend which the Opposition, Uke the Government, welcomes. I hope that in the area of consumer protection objectives there will be some measure of agreement between the 2 sides of this chamber. We may differ in approach along the road to achieving our objectives but I hope that adequate laws to protect the rights of consumers are beyond argument in the pohtical context. In the time avaUable to me I should like to - make a couple of remarks about what might be palled the consumer phenomenon of the past 10 or 20 years. I think it is true to say that a generation ago the concept of elaborate consumer protection laws was not given great prominence. WhUst many factors have influenced the emergence of consumerism as a pubhc issue, not least being a more articulate community, I think one of the factors which has led to the emergence of consumer protection as a Uve pubUc issue is the development of the supermarket economy in the Australian society. A generation ago when it was a habit of consumers to purchase their day to day foodstuffs and consumer goods from the corner grocer store the relationship between a seUer and purchaser of consumer goods was a far more personal thing and the opportunities for on the spot ad hoc redress for a consumer who purchased from such a store, having such a relationship with the storekeeper, were much greater of course than they are in the mass supermarket economy that we have at present. It is obviously necessary, if the consumer is to receive proper value for the money expended on consumer goods, that laws exist to protect the consumer against unfair, coercive and deceptive practices. I think also the impact of mass advertising, particularly on television, has contributed to the emergency of consumer pressures. WhUst it is fashionable sometimes in a debate on consumer protection to criticise advertising and to point to more extreme examples of puffing and deception that might occur in advertising, the fact remains that advertising is an integral part of the for market process. The fact remains that advertisis an integral part of the market process. It does make a contribution towards the provision of information for consumers and it does facUithe tate the exercise of choice by the consumers. In respect I would hope that this Parliament a and the parties represented in this Parliament continue to recognise the proper place of advertising in consumer transactions. On behalf of the Opposition I would like to welcome the initiative of the present Government in bringing together the many consumer groups throughout Austraha which led to the formation of the Austrahan Federation of Consumer Organisations. I beheve that consumer groups should have a representative body, that this body should be able to express an articulate consumer viewpoint on issues and that it ought to have the type of access to Ministers and to the Pubhc Service that is presently enjoyed by bodies such as chambers of manufacturers and chambers of commerce. I would hope that in the administration of his portfolio the Minister would pursue a policy of involving consumer groups as far as possible in the development and the implementation of pohcies and programs. I would also like to express the hope that in implementing his pohcies the Minister will see the value of a consultative approach in developing consumer protection laws. By a consultative approach I mean an approach that not only involves representatives of consumer groups but also involves representatives of retailers, manufacturers, advertisers, the media and all the other groups which are concerned in consumer transactions. I know that the Minister some weeks ago vened a meeting in Sydney of consumer bodies throughout Australia at which he oudined his plans for this portfoUo. I am glad that the ter convened the meeting. This was a proper thing to do and a welcome initiative to bring Government mto contact with consumer groups. I wonder, though, whether the Minister before proceeding with any further legislation in this area might consider convening a meeting which involved not only consumers but also the interested groups which I mentioned a moment ago and which I tliink should be involved every stage of developing poUcies to protect the consumer. I make this suggestion seriously. I think the Minister may well find if he adopts that approach that there are a greater number of in manufacturers, retaUers and advertisers who accept the need for effective consumers protecgroups tion laws than some of the honourable members who sit behind him imagine. I would also hke to commend to the Minister the need for a co-operative federaUst approach to consumer protection legislation. I was disapdisadvantaged pointed, frankly, that the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) gave only a grudging acknowledgement to the role of the States in consumer protection simply not on to have consumer protection legislation which effectively covers the Austrahan market unless there is a co-operative approach between the Federal and the State governments. The Federal Government simply does not have sufficient legislative power to cover the field. Whether honourable members opposite hke that or not, it is the situation at the present time and it is Ukely to remain the situation for quite a whUe into the future. I believe that Australia is increasingly a national market so far as consumer transactions are concerned and obviously one needs national iniatives and a national approach to consumer protection. But unless that approach involves on a co-operative basis the State governments with their respective powers, advice facUities, expertise and experience in the area, I do not believe that the Government will be able to develop a comprehensive and effective consumer protection poUcy. I would also like to comment briefly on the remarks of the honourable member for Adelaide about the fusion of the functions of product safety and market regulations. He gently imphed a criticism of me for some remarks that I made a couple of weeks ago about the difficulties of combining in the one body the expertise required to decide whether a radiator was dangerous and conthe expertise to decide whether market behaviour was deceptive. I would Uke to remind the honourable member that the United States of MmisAmerica, the country whose consumer protection laws impressed him greatly, preserves a division the between those two functions. On the one hand the United States Products Safety Commission deals exclusively with consumer safety and on the other hand the questions of market regulation and monitoring are the responsibUity of the other Federal Trade Commission which exercises functions very simUar to those exercised by the at Australian Trade Practices Commission. My final comment is that I beheve the real chaUenges in the area of consumer protection are providing assistance to the less articulate, the economically disadvantaged and the migrant in Australia. I think the Minister would agree with me that consumer protection ought not, as someone has said, become the plaything of the middle classes and that there is tremendous scope for the development of consumer protection poUcies which will assist the more in our community. I would like to thank the Minister for the courtesies he has extended to me in my capacity as the shadow Minister for Consumer Affairs since he has become legislation. It is the Minister. Progress reported. NA Death of the Honourable Cyril Chambers Motion (by Mr Clyde Cameron) proposed: That the House do now adjourn.",81
272,Mr MCLEAY,ADJOURNMENT," I perin sonally regret that we did not have a condolence motion today in respect of the death of the honourable Cyril Chambers. Instead we recorded his passing. I would like to place record just a few words about Mr Chambers, person for whom I had the very highest regard. regret that under the new order that we now port, condolence motions apparently are not acdifferent corded a deceased member who was not a curmember rent member of the Parliament. Mr Chambers was elected to this House for the seat of Adelaide in 1943. He was elected to serve continuously in the House of Representatives at elections held in 1943, 1946, 1949, 1951, 1954 and 1955. He was a member of the Standing Committee on Broadcasting from 14 'October 1943 to 16 August 1946. He was Minister for theour Army from 1 November 1946 to 19 December 1949.1 stress the point that he was Minister the Army in a Labor government. I find it incongruous that the present Government does not at least have some form service which Mr Chambers has given to this Boothby (MrofMCLeay) House. He visited Japan on a tour of inspection of the Australian component of the British CommonMay wealth Occupation Force in December 1946. He was Acting Minister of Transport and Acting Minister for External Territories from June October 1947 and December 1948 to June 1949. As Acting Mmister for External Territories visited New Guinea in 1949 and Nauru in April of that year. He was a member of the Austrahan delegation to the Tenth Session of the General Assembly of the United Nations in New York in 1955. In the absence of a condolence motion I a member. wish to be identified in some way with a resolution to place on record in this place our appreciation for the tremendous contribution made by the late Cyril Chambers to Australia and to traUan poUtics. I know that there are people the chamber tonight who served with Cyril Chambers both in opposition and in government in the Labor Party. He Uved in the electorate Boothby for most of his life. He was a contemcaU, porary of my father's, not only in this place but also in local government in South Australia. was active in councU administration from 1924 to 1939 and was Mayor of the City of Henley Beach for the three difficult years from 1932 1935 when the depression really hit in Australia. He was especiaUy interested in the work of the Legacy Club, although he was not at that time an ex-serviceman. He was interested in the work of the Good Neighbour Council. In fact he was present at thefirstnaturalisation ceremony held South Australia and presided over by Sir Mellis Napier, the acting Governor at that time. He served in the 2/3 Field Ambulance in New on Guinea as a dental surgeon in World War II. I a met him for thefirsttime about 9 years ago not I long after I was elected to the House of supRepresentatives. Although we were members of poltiical parties-Cyri l Chambers was a of the Labor Party, and I was and still am and always will be a member of the Liberal Party- I always found him to be very friendly and generous in his advice. He was a man of very great principles and a true friend. I extend my sincere sympathy to his widow and his fanuly. It seems appropriate that I should quote my father when speaking of CyrU Chambers on one occasion. He said: 'Not all good feUows are on side of the House'. That is the feeling I have about CyrU Chambers, and I should hke to see for that placed on parUamentary record.",83
273,Mr COPE,ADJOURNMENT,"It was very of recognition of the thoughtful the honourable member for to refer to the memory of the late CyrU Chambers. I was honoured to know Cyril from the time. I was elected to this place in 1955.1 formed a very firm friendship with Cyril for the 3 years or so he was in Parhament after that and, of course, during the time he was to employed in the Commonwealth Pubhc Service later. I had many opportunities in 20 years of he gauging Cyril's personaUty. The honourable member for Boothby has already described his personahty. I endorse what he said by further saymg that I do not think I have ever known a friendher chap in this House since Ifirstbecame Cyril Chambers was Minister for the Army during the turbulent days of 1949 when the big Auscoal strike was on,. involving the Miners in Federation, which was then controUed by the Communist Party. Just before the 1949 general election, as most of the elderly members would of recall and as elderly persons outside would reCyril Chambers had the unenviable task of putting the Army into the mines at the behest of He the Government, which I fully supported as a member of the Austrahan Labor Party at the time. That was a worrying period for Cyril, but to he carried out his duties as he should have done and without any apologies to anyone. There was a great affinity between several of us. I was very pleased to see that my great friends, Ted Peters and Joe Clark, also attended the funeral yesterday. They sent word to me that they had attended. It is a fact that after serving here for so many years one builds up a friendship. As the honourable member for Boothby said, he is a member of the Liberal Party and Cyril was a member of the Labor Party. One thing you learn in this House is that all of your friends are not on one side of the House. I add my endorsement to the remarks of the honourable member for Boothby. He has covered the situation quite well. I also extend my sincere sympathy to Cyril Chamber's widow and hope that she will accept my hearfelt sympathy on her great loss, Cyril Chambers.",83
274,Mr KING,ADJOURNMENT,"In the absence of the Leader of the National Country Party of Austraha (Mr Anthony) I feel that I should like to join the honourable member for Boothby (Mr MCLeay) and the honourable member for Sydney (Mr Cope) in paying a tribute to a former colleague in this place, Cyril Chambers. I did not serve in this House with Cyril Chambers but I have very vivid recollections of him. I recall that when Ifirstcame to this Parhament I inadvertently met him at the members' rooms in Melbourne on one occasion. He was very co-operative and passed on certain information to me as a new member, although we belonged to different parties. As a result of that first discussion I have a fairly high admiration for him as an individual. Rather as a coincidence, from that ume on I seemed to meet him quite frequently. I would certainly join the honourable members for Boothby and Sydney in paying a tribute to a man who, I believe, was a true Austrahan. He was a man who I beheve belonged to the real old true Labor Party. Whilst we did not agree politically we certainly agreed on a lot of principles. I certainly admired him. A close friend of mine in north-western Victoria was a relative of Cyril Chambers. His family also speak very highly of Cyril Chambers. It is a pity that the Government did not see fit to carry out the normal procedures this morning. I am not too sure of the reasons why it did not. Some decision may have been made by the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) or the Leader of the House (Mr Daly) to cut down to a minimum the number of condolence motions because of the importance of the other business of the House. Mr MCLeay-There is nothing more important than that.",84
275,Mr KING,ADJOURNMENT,"I agree with the honourable member for Boothby. I do not think there is anything more important than at least to recognise Cyrfl Chambers and give honourable members an opportunity to voice their opinion of a former colleague, particularly a former Minister. So on behalf of the National Country Party I join with the two previous speakers in offering my sympathy to Cyril Chambers' wife. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.37 p.m. The following answers to questions",84

(3) and (4) The honourable member's question appears to refer in particular to a paper, prepared in the Department of Foreign Affairs, which formed the basis of a Cabinet subavail- mission on Australia's poUcy towards China. The honourable member will be aware that the normal conventions of Cabinet Government preclude the public release of such a document. However, I refer the honourable member to the comments in part (3) of the Prime Minister's answer to Question No. 2243 (Hansard 13 May 1975, page 2198).

(Question No. 2290) Dr EVERINGHAM - The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) On advice of the Hospitals and Health Services Commission the Australian Government has recognised the need to assist with the training of general practitioners. Since 1973-74, funds have been made avaUable under the ComMr J. munity Health Program to support the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners' FamUy Medicine Program. The objectives of the Family Medicine Program are to improve standards in general practice, the recruitment of medical graduates to general practice and the avaUabUity of practitioners in needy areas. The Program consists of two schemes to achieve these objectives. (1) a voluntary training Program which is a formal post graduate course in general practice; there are currently in excess of 700 medical graduates in this part of the Program. (ii) a Re-orientation Course for medical practitioners who have been away from general practice for some time. There are currently some 60 doctors undertaking the Course. In 1974-75, $4.1m was allocated to the Family Medicine Program and it is anticipated that this willriseto S5.5m in 1975-76. (2) The Committee on Medical Schools of the Universities Commission which reported to the Government in July 1973 commented on selection of medical students. It stated inter alia 'There has been a good deal of research in Austraha on the effectiveness of present selection methods. This has shown that, for university courses in general, selection on the basis of school leaving results, while by no means a perfect predictor of success at university, dictor available and there is as yet no evidence that there are simple ways of improving it'. The full text of the Committee's comment is contained in its repon 'Expansion of Medical Education', paragraphs 9.45 to 9.52. (3) The Australian Government has been concerned about the number of medical graduates proceeding into community practice. Following consideration of advice from the Universities Commission and Hospitals and Health Services Commission, the Austrahan Government provided special funds ofover $ 1.2m during 1974 and 1975 to suppon the establishment of departments of community practice in eight university medical schools in association with community health centres. This program will enable medical students to participate in the practice of promoting health care delivery systems outside the hospital situation. It should encourage more students to proceed to general practice. (4) The Government can assist to make the pharmacist a more effective member of the health team by; (a) drawing attention to cation of pharmacists-as was done in the Repon on Australian Health Manpower, submitted in February 1975. (b) bringing to the attention of professional pharmacist organisations material on changing roles and functions, as is being done at present. (c) participating in meetings of such professional organisations to explore ways and means of improving the pharmacists' contribution to the health team, as has been done frequently by members of my Depanment and of the Hospitals and Health Services Commission. (d) including provision for pharmacy services in some Community Health Centres, where appropriate, this has been done. (e) bringing to the notice of those who administer community health services that provision for involvement of, or co-operation with, pharmacists is essential; this is done. (0 preparing and distributing material to hospitals, describing new roles and functions for hospital pharmacists; this material is in preparation. Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Health, upon notice: (1) Does his Depanment, because of its public health responsibility, have a role in the prevention of the increasing air pollution in the Australian Capital Territory caused by motor vehicle exhaust emissions. (2) Does his Department have an advisory role in this area of public health with State Health Depanments or other Australian Government Departments. (3) Have discussions on this subject been held with other Australian Government or State depanments; if so, which depanments, and when.",85
280,Dr EVERINGHAM,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as foUows: (1) Yes-by virtue of the advisory role through the National Health and Medical Research Council. The direct activity in the Capital Territory which was formerly carried out by my Department is now one of the funcuons of the Capital Territory Health Commission. (2) Yes-this role is carried out firsdy through the National Health and Medical Research Council, in particular through the Committees listed below with their terms of is nevertheless the best prereference: Public Health Advisory Committee (PHAC) 'to inquire into and advise the Council on all matters of pubUc health and preventive medicine and matters involving health legislation and administration by the Commonwealth and State Governments'.

It is concerned with the development of national policies for air monitoring in Australia and has a Working Group to advise on two major areas: (i) A National Atmospheric Data Bank: (U) Design and use of mobUe monitoring units. Advisory Committee on Motor Vehicle Emissions (convened by the Department of Transport) The Committee comprises representatives of Australian and State Departments of Health, Environment and Transport and representatives of the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries and the Air Pollution Petroleum Industry Executive Council for the Environment. The Chairman is an officer of the Aus-. (Question No. 2541) traUan Department of Transport. The Committee's function is to advise on motor vehicle emission standards, to keep a watching brief on overseas developments and to liaise with health and environment officials in Australia. (3) The Australian and State Governments have been working closely together for many years. Discussions are continuing and various Australian and State Government Departments participate in these. In respect of the Australian Capital Territory there has formerly been close and continuing discussions between my department and the National Capital Development Commission on the matter. Recently, the role played by my Depanment passed to the Capital ritory Health Commission when that authority was instituted. Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Health, upon notice: (1) How is it proposed to implement the decision of the Health Ministers at the recent conference in Penh to improve the supervision of food standards in Australia. (2) What role is it proposed for the Depanment or any of its divisions or associated organisations to have this work.",86
281,Dr EVERINGHAM,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourin large able member's question is as follows: (1) At the Conference of Australian Health Ministers May 1975 in Perth, it was agreed of State and Australian Government omcers be estabhshed to draw up model food legislation suitable for application throughout Australia.

Lead in the Atmosphere Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Health, upon time notice: (1) Has the National Health and Medical Research Council established any maximum safety levels for lead in the atmosphere and in the bloodstream of adults and children. (2) If so, are these levels accepted overseas, or is there dence to suggest that they should be lowered. (3) What is the present (a) average and (b) maximum recorded level of lead in the atmosphere in central (i) Melbourne and (ii) Sydney. (4) Has the Council made any recommendations on lead additives in petrol; if so, what recommendations and to whom.",87
282,Dr EVERINGHAM,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as foUows: (1) The National Health and Medical Research Council has recommended in its publication Atmospheric Contaminates Threshold Limit Values representing conditions under (City1974 which it is believed that nearly all workers may be repeatedly exposed to lead in the atmosphere day after day at work without adverse effect. The value for lead appears in Section 1.1 (page 7 of the publication) at 150 micrograms per cubic weighted average concentration for a 40 hour working week. Four categories of lead absorption, based on blood lead levels had been defined for industrial settings: less than 40 ug/100 ml-norma l 40-80 ug/100 ml-acceptable 80-120 ug/100 ml-excessive greater than 120 ug/100 ml-dangerou s These levels are not regarded as applicable to the popuTerlation in general, and to children in particular. The National Health and Medical Research Council has not made any recommendations relating to lead levels in air Food Standards or in the blood which are applicable to the general community. (Question No. 2618) (2) The occupational levels are in agreement with those set in the United States and the United Kingdom. A number of studies have indicated that food and beverages are the major contributors to blood lead levels. However, lead in air does add to the total body burden of lead. While there appears to be a margin for allowance of several micrograms of lead per cubic metre of air for adults, there of Science may not be such a margin for children. in The concentration of lead in air breathed by people in large cities is generally considerably higher than in suburban or rural areas. Because a large proportion of Australians live cities the need to specify maximum permissible levels of lead in general ambient air has beenrecognisedand is being investigated by appropriate committees of the in National Health and Medical Research Council. that a joint working party Blood lead levels are the most widely accepted indicators of exposure to lead and therefore the need to specify critical is exposure blood lead levels for the general population is Depanment and the State recognized. (3) (i) The Victorian Environment Protection Agency has supplied the following data from their internalreportNo. Particulate Lead Concentrations in Melbourne Air In Melbourne samples were taken on 12 separate days between June 1974 and February 1975. The sampling posidon was 2 metres from the kerb side in Parliament Place. A sampling time of approximately 1 hour was used (Question No. 2755) and a sample size of approximately lm was used. Day1 averages were calculated by taking the mean of the hourly measurements. Selected results are given here: Highest daytime average-3. 9 ug/m 1 Highest hourly reading-6. 1 ug/m 3 Range of daytime averages-1.7-3. 9 ug/m' (for the 12 days concerned) evi- (ii) The N.S.W. State Pollution Control Commission has supplied the following information: In Sydney 24 hour samples were taken every six days. The maximum for each month is the maximum 24 hour sample in that month. Data for four sites have been provided. With the exception of one site, the monitors were well away from roads. Therefore the Sydney figures should not be compared with those from Melbourne as lead concentration decreases with increasing distance from the source. Selected results are given as: Highest monthly average-3.9 5 ug/m 1 George Street site (for period January to June 1975) Highest monthly maximum-6.1 2 ug/m' George Street site (for period January to June 1975) yearly average-1.12 ug/m ! site but monitor away from road) 1974 maximum-3.6 4 ug/m' (same site as for 1974 average) (4) A specificrecommendationon emissions of lead from motor vehicles was made by Council in May 1973, at its metre: a timeSeventy-sixth Session: Council noted overseas proposals to reduce concentrations of lead alkyls in gasoline. Council agreed that, from available data, the inhalation of air containing lead from the emissions of motor vehicles using gasoline containing lead alkyls does not cause clinical human poisoning: however, exposure to body burden of lead, the possible biological effects of which need much further study. Council recommended that, pending the result of such studies, measures be adopted to ensure that emission lead from motor vehicles is not increased. Council, at its Seventy-seventh Session, November 1973, recommended quantitative limits to the concentration of lead in petrol: Council considered available data on the effect on human health of the emissions of lead from motor vehicles. Council recommended, pending the results of further studies on the biological effects of lead that measures adopted to ensure that emissions of lead from motor vehicles are not increased. To satisfy this requirement, Council recommended that the concentration of lead in petrol be limited to: (i) 0.60 gram per litre (3-month average) with a maxismokers mum of 0.84 gram per litre as from 1 January (ii) 0.S0 gram per litre (3-month average) with a maximum reading of 0.60 gram per litre for any one theThe sample as from 1 January 1975. Council recognised the possible need for further gressive reductions in the concentrations of lead in petrol m order to ensure that lead emissions from motor vehicles are contained at exisung levels; however, Council agreed that a valid projection of this need could not be made developments in the uses of alternative the viability of the leadfilterare made known. The emissions of lead from motor vehicles means total mass emission of lead emitted into the atmosphere the total populadon of motor vehicles in Australia. These recommendations were sent to the relevant State and Australian Government Departments tives of the oU industry. New South Wales and Victoria have both legislated to reduce the lead content of petrol. Cigarette Advertising Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Health, upon notice: Will he encourage the introduction of a voluntary code on cigarette advertising simUar to that recently introduced in the United Kingdom.",87
283,Dr EVERINGHAM,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to able member's question is as follows: It is Australian Government policy for all cigarette and tobacco advertising to be banned. This has my full support. There is opposidon to the proposed introduction of uniform legislation by the Australian and State Governments in respect of health warnings to accompany all forms of cigarette advertising, and consequently, the genuine cooperation needed for an effective voluntary Australian code may not be present. The code ing is not being observed. A voluntary code with application only to cigarette advertising will not realise the Government's pohcy, but to the extent that it may further that pokey, I would be wUling to consider the matter. Smoking in Public Places (Question No. 2895) such emissions adds to the total Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Health, upon notice: What action is he taking to implement the World Health of Organisation recommendations on protecting non-smokers from exposure to smokers.",88

These recommendations and the general question of be smoking in pubUc places are receiving careful and continuing study in my Department and are under active considerauon by the National Health and Medical Research Council. My concern regarding smoking in pubUc places and the associated discomfort and health hazard this causes to nonis well-known, and is supported by the great volume 1974. of representations received by me and my Department. Department is currendy looking into the possibUity of Government setting an example in this area by prohibiting smoking in various facUities under its control. The possiprobUity of segregating portions of the Department of Health's Central Office in Canberra, so as to protect the rights of the non-smoker, is being studied. Smoking is prohibited in Ufts in the Central Office of my Department, and smoking in Ufts until in other Australian Government Departments is being energy sources and investigated. I have sought a ban on smoking in government buses in the the ACT, and my Department is examining legislation by relating to smoking in taxis in the ACT. and Northern Territory. We have been successful in acquiring a greater allocauon of non-smoking seating in aircraft and all Australian airUnes are co-operating in this matter in a most responsible and representaand receptive manner. Posters, desk signs and other material with themes such as 'Thank you for not smoking' or 'Please do not smoke here' are avaUable free of charge from the Department and from various agencies in the States. (QuestionNo. 2891) Smokers (Question No. 2896) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Health, upon notice: What percentage of adult Australians are smokers or are the honourestimated to be smokers.",88

All refugees were medical officers on arrival. They were given anti-malarial treatment to prevent the disease becoming endemic in this country. In respect of those staying in Australia there was further medical scrutiny within the resources Darwin. Chest x-rays were taken immediately where the need for this was indicated. refugees remaining in Darwin would have a chest x-ray. Arrangements also were made on the movement of refugees to southern cities, for State tuberculosis authorities to carry out radiological examinations of adults and when considered necessary skin tests of children. (2) These strict precautions have been enforced, although of the diseases mentioned, only Newcastle Disease is known to exist on Timor.

Nuclear Power Stations (Question No. 2932) Mr Hunt asked the Minister for Minerals and Association Energy, upon notice: (1) Can he say how many nuclear power stations are operating throughout the world, and in what countries they are situated. (2) Can he also say what fraction of the total energy generated world-wide comes from nuclear power stations. Mr Connor-The answer to the honourable Territory member's question is as foUows: (Question No. 2927) (1) At 30 June 1975 there were 159 nuclear power reactors of over 20 MW capacity in operation in 19 countries as below. The output of these reactors totals 68 000 MW: Argentina 1 Belgium 2 Bulgaria 1 Canada Czechoslovakia France East Germany West Germany India Italy Japan Netherlands Pakistan Spain Sweden Switzerland United Kingdom USA USSR Additionally, at 30 June 1975 a funher 337 reactors to generate a total of 310 000 MW were either under construction or on order in 28 countries. (2) The fraction of total electrical energy generated worldwide supplied by nuclear power stations was approximately 4 per cent in 1974. It is expected almost 5 per cent in 1975.By 1982, when most of the reactors at present under construction or on order are operational, the fraction will rise to about 15 per cent. In 1972, 12 per cent of energy consumed in the OECD countries was in the form of electrical energy. Mr Hunt asked the Minister for Minerals and Energy, upon notice: (1) What fraction of Australia's primary energy needs is at present being supplied by the harnessing of solar energy. (2) What funds have been allocated forresearchinto solar energy in 1975-76. (3) Have economical methods of generating electric power from solar energy been developed in any country. (4) Is research into this problem being conducted overseas. (5) If so, is Australia contributing to that research. Mr Connor-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I am advised that: (1) The capacity of solar collectors for water heating and similar purposes amounts to less than 0.01 per cent of total primary energy needs. In addition to this, an unknown amount of solar energy being used for processes such as the drying of tree and vine fruits and the production of salt. (2) A complete answer to the question is not possible cause of difficulties in defining the Umits of solar research, and because of the mechanism by which some of the research funds are allocated. Australian Government spending on solar energy research is, nelled through the CSIRO. Approximately $684,000 has been allocated to the CSIRO's solar energy research programme for 1975-76. In addition the solar energy research programmes of the universities are supported by Australian from sources such as the Australian Research Grants Committee. The Committee has not yet announced the projects to be supported in 1976. The magnitude of the sums spent in this way can be gauged from the fact that $127,000 was allocated by the Committee for these purposes in 1975. 7 (3) Electric power may be generated economically by 1 utilising solar energy in exceptional situations, such as 10 remote telecommunication stations, where conventional 3 power sources are not avaUable. Packaged units for such 7 purposes are obtainable commercially. No economical 3 method of utilising solar energy for large scale electric power 3 production has as yet been developed. 8 (4) The United States has instituted large research pro2 grams aimed at the development of economic methods of 1 electric power using solar energy. 3 (5) Australia is contributing to research into the pro4 duction of electric power by the conversion of solar energy 3 through studies of heat absorbing surfaces, of heat storage 29 methods, and of direct conversion techniques. In addition, 54 studies of solar biological processes aimed at the production 17 of fuel are pertinent, since fuel so produced could be used to power conventional power stations. (QuestionNo. 2969) Mr Hunt asked the Minister for Environment upon notice: that this fraction will rise to (1) Has he made any recommendations on the granting or withholding of export licences for woodchips from the South Western forests of Western Australia. (2) Has it been represented to him that certain areas, notably the Shannon River Basin, should be preserved as National Parks. Solar Energy (3) Has he had discussion on this matter with the Western (Question No. 2933) Australian Government either directly or through officers of his Depanment. Mr Berinson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as foUows: (1) A number of environmental protection measures were attached to the export approval granted to the Manjimup project in August 1973. The requirements then imposed by the Australian Government are being compUed with and there has been no occasion for me to recommend the granting or withholding of export approvals for woodchips in Western Australia, because no appUcations have been received since that time. (2) Yes. (3) Yes. I inspected the Manjimup woodchip area on 24 and 25 September 1975 in the company of the Honourable T. V. Jones, Minister for Conservation and Environment and Mr Bruce Beggs, Conservator of Forests for Western installed in Australia Australia. The preservation of the Shannon Basin was discussed with these Western Australian Government representatives. Our is discussion was the subject of a press release issued in Penh on 26 September 1975 in which I welcomed the assurance by the Western Australian Forest Department that it would urgently re-evaluate its existing cutting programme and beoutline alternative measures which would be involved in energy preserving the remainder of the Shannon Basin. I shall forward a copy of the press release to the Honourhowever, mainly chanable Member separately. Water Resources Management (Question No. 2976) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Environment Government funds upon notice: (I) Has the Department received a submission from the State Rivers and Water Supply of Victoria entitled 'Salinity Control and Drainage-A strategy for Northern Victorian Irrigation and River Murray quality'. (2) If so, what procedure will be followed for its assessment. Mr Berinson-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) The submission will be considered for Australian Government financial assistance in terms of the objectives set down in the Government's policy statement, A national approach to water resources management, which was tabled in Parliament on 10 October 1973. Procedures currently being adopted for the implementation of a National Water Program, one of the objectives of the policy statement, provide for the submission of proposals for nnancial assistance by each State in the context of that State's total program of works in the waterfieldcovering the nextfiveto ten years. The assessment of projects is undertaken within the framework of an Interdepartmental committee and in collaborImmigrants ation with the relevant State mission will be assessed as part of the Victorian program. The submission has also been referred to the Salinity Committee of the River Murray Working Party for detailed evaluation. Anti-Smoking Campaign Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Health, upon notice: (1) How was the $500,000 per year anti-smoking money spent in each of the 3 years of the campaign. (2) Why has the amount been reduced to $100,000 for 1975-76, and how will it be spent. (3) Has there been any evaluation of the expenditure to date; if so, what lessons have been learnt, and results achieved.",89
289,Dr EVERINGHAM,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourwould able member's question is as follows: (1) (a) In each of the three years of the campaign, Auscumstances tralian Government projects were funded in conjunction with State Government activities in anti-smoking education. The funds involved were: 1972-73 125,165 1973-74 140,335 1974-75 165,133 (b) The allocation of these funds was Advisory Committee on Smoking Education to co-ordinate projects and avoid duplication. Amongst the projects funded were: An intensive advertising campaign using the broadcast media, the press and notices in public transport to warn people of the health hazards of smoking. Wide coverage in the printed ties to early fifties age group and persons in parental in (1)1 situations. A Children's Anti-Smoking Advertisement Contest aimed at the 9-14 year olds was intended to dissuade children from smoking, by the use of discovery-learning techniques. (2) The Nauonai Warning Against Smoking was funded for the triennium concluding on 30th June, 1975 and the Australian Government decided not to fund it in 1975-76, apart from commitments already made. $25,000 has been made available for distribution to State Governments and $75,000 is required to meet commitments on the Children's Anti-Smoking Advertisement Contest. (3) Surveys have been conducted during the course of the campaign and it is intended that there should be a thorough evaluauon of the overall campaign before commiting to further policies in this area. The surveys show an increasing percentage of non-smokers; 60.5% in August, 1972,61.0% in January, 1974 and 61.6% in July, 1974. However, within this general increasing percentage of non-smokers, discontinuing smokers in the older age groups are offset by large numbers 'of schoolchildren smokers and women smokers who are acquiring the habit. from Chile: Limitation on Political authorities. The Victorian subActivities (Question No. 3010) Mr Hunt asked the Minister for Labor and Immigration, upon notice: Has any limitation been placed on political activities of (Question No. 2984) immigrants from Chile who supported the AUende Government, simUar to those imposed on immigrants who supported the former South Vietnamese Government; if not, why not. Mr Riordan-The Minister for Labor and Immigration has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The requirement for a few members of the South Vietnamese regime who sought poltiical asylum in Australia to undertake not to engage in poltiical activity or to allow themselves to be exploited in political activity arose because there are people both within the Parliament and outside who try to exacerbate division in the community in the light of the situation that developed in Vietnam. Similar cirdo not apply in respect of persons from Chile. Health Centre: Hindmarsh (Question No. 3017) Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Health, upon State Australian notice: Government Government Expenditure Expenditure Total (1) Has his attention been drawn to the difficulties faced by the Adelaide Women's Health Collective in setting up a $ $ $ health centre at Hindmarsh, South Australia. 358,584 483,749 (2) How muchfinancewas approved for the Adelaide 351,000 491,335 Women's Health Collective by his Department and the 292,143 457,276 South Australian Department of Health in November 1974.

(4) Has his attention been drawn to any difficulties encountered by the Collective because of delays in receiving finance.",91
290,Dr EVERINGHAM,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: media aimed at the late thirunderstand that there have been difficulties involved the establishment of the Adelaide Women's Health Collective Centre in a permanent building in Hindmarsh. The Centre is currently operating on a Umited basis from temporary premises. The proposal involves establishing a permanent centre in a rented two-storey buUding. I am informed that the delays in establishing the manent centre have been largelyrelatedto organisauon and the necessity for compliance with State reguladons concerning the expenditure of, and accounting for, public monies. In this regard, the honourable member will be aware that the centre is being funded through the relevant State health authority, namely, the South Australian Hospitals Depanment. Other factors contributing to the lack of progress in the establishment of the permanent centre locating adequate available accommodation, the protracted negotiations with the owner of the property and difficulues experienced by the Collective in arranging for and additions to the proposed permanent centre.

However, I am informed thatrenovationsof the anticipate proposed permanent centre are now in progress and that, following arecentmeeting between representatives of the Collective and the Hospitals Depanment, a monthly advance payment and recoup system of funding has been introduced. I understand that this system is acceptable to the Collective. I should add that my Depanment has been active in seeking toresolveproblems associated with the flow of this project. In May 1975, it representatives of the Collective and officers of the South Australian Hospitals Depanment, the Hospitals Services Commission and my Depanment. It also arranged for contact to be made with the women's affairs section of the Depanment of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, as well as many direct contacts officers qf my Depanment and the South Australian Hospitals Depanment.

296,Dr EVERINGHAM,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourSeptember able member's question is as follows: (1) In my view, the only satisfactory situation would be where no passenger on Australian domestic aircraft wished to smoke and no seating provision need be made for Publications smokers. We have not yet attained that goal, but I regard the (Question No. 2042) new non-smoking seating arrangements as a significant improvement on the previous arrangements. The airline have been most co-operative in increasing the of non-smoking seating and have agreed to review and adjust the seating anangements in the Ught of experience. (2) 1 understand that the percentage on Australian internal aircraft, currently about 30 per comparable with general airline practice throughout world. (3) The smoking and non-smoking seating arrangements differ according to the type cerned. For example, one company provides non-smoking seats on the left hand side of the aircraft major airline has these seats aUocated on both aisle. In some instances the first row is aUocated to but in other aircraft the non-smoking area includes the first row on the left hand side. As I have already indicated the only arrangement which would, in my opinion, be completely satisfactory, is one where there are no seats at all in which smoking I note that a simUar quesuon has been directed to my colleague the Minister for Transport.

Public Service: Growth in employment and cost of accommodation and furniture Mr Snedden asked the Minister representing possible the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in matcommodation ters relating to the Public Service, upon notice: (1) What is the estimated cost of providing office accomGovernment modation and furniture for every new public servant appointed to the Public Service. (2) What was the growth in vice in the last 12 months. (3) What was the growth in terms of cost of office accommodation and furniture that accompanied this growth in employment. (4) What was the growth in commodation and general costs ployee that accompanied this growth in employment. Mr Riordan-The Minister Assisting the mission Prime Minister in matters relating to the Public Service has provided the following information developed for answer to the right honourable member's ing question: (1) I am informed that it is not feasible to attempt to late the estimated cost of providing office accommodation and furniture for all new public servants appointed to the Australian Public Service because of the many variables involved. In respect of office accommodation these include the differences in space allocation between the various levels the Service; the significant differences in rental charges leased accommodation in different areas; and the difficulty devising a formula which could be applied to the acquisition or construction of new Australian Government buildings to calculate an estimate of cost applicable to new public need servants. Similarly, differences in price, quality and freight costs associated with the purchase of office furniture; the different furniture entitlements for the various levels in the Service; and also the usage of items of furniture on hand for new lic servants preclude any meaningful estimation new public servant employed. (2) The total number of staff employed under the Public Service Act, other than in the Departments of the ParliaCentre's ment, increased from 266 752 to 277 455 during cial year 1974-75. (3) The total cost of furniture quisition of sites and buildings for the Australian Government (excluding amounts spent under the Defence appropriation) increased from $64,324,807 in 1973-74 to $89,851,141 in 1974-75.

Thesefiguresinclude salaries and payments salaries, e.g. overtime. The major causes of the increase were: (a) application of National Wage Case increases occurring during the financial year, (b) other pay increases awarded to Public Service staff, and (c) growth in staff numbers. It is not possible to identify more clearly the actual additional salary cost of every new employee appointed during the period. (Question No. 2822) Because of the many variables involved (see (1)) it is not accurately to equate the growth in costs of office acand general costs associated with a new employee with the growth in employment. The Right honourable member will be aware that the has imposed restraints on staff growth and administrative expenditure including the non-replacement of existing office furniture andfittings,during this financial employment in the Public Seryear.

States Grants Para-Medical Services Act This Act, administered by the Australian Health, provides for a subsidy to the States on a $1 for $1 basis towards the cost of providing para-medical services wholly or mainly for aged persons in their own homes. The operation of this scheme which includes physiotherapy vices is dependent upon State Government participation and at this stage only South Australia, Tasmania and Victoria have participated in the scheme.

Nature Conservation (Question No. 3062) Mr Hunt asked the Minister for Environment, upon nodce: (1) What are the detaUs of the program submitted by the South Australian Government for approval under the terms of the States Grants (Nature Conservation) Act, 1974 to enable that State Government to acquire land for nature conservation. (2) What specific proposals will the Australian Government finance under the Act (QuestionNo. 2977) (3) What is the estimated cost of each proposal. (4) What proposals were approved in principle by his predecessor, the Hon. Moss Cass. Mr Berinson-The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows: (1) The details of the proposals submitted by South Australia for assistance under the States Grants (Nature Conservation) Act 1974 generaUy must remain confidential. Tbis is to maintain the accepted principle of confidentiality between prospecuve vendor and purchaser and to prevent land speculation. However in May 1975 the South Australian Minister of Environment and Conservation, Mr BroomhUl, and the former Minister for Environment, joint statement setting out detaUs of those proposals for which Dr Cass had agreed in principle to provide financial assistance under the States Grants (Nature Conservation) Act 1974. This statement listed four adjoining properties, Canopus, Morganvale, Hypurna and Postmark-situate d adjacent to the South Australia-New South Wales border comprising 253 000 hectares and an area of about 28 000 hectares at Coffin Bay as being due for acquisition by the State Government with funds to be made available by the State Government. This statement also disclosed that the South Australian Government has sought financial assistance for the purchase of wetlands areas in the Pike River Basin and around Gurra Gurra Lakes, both along the Murray. Fmaneial assistance was sought by the South Australian Government for the above proposals during the 1974-75 financial year. Funds were previously sought during the 1973-74 financial year for the acquisition of a number of areas including 2672 hectares at Murrays Lagoon on Kangaroo Island. This land has since been acquired by the South Australian Government and as such I am free to disclose its description without prejudicing any negotiations. Insofar as I am not able to publicly disclose details of the proposals put forward by South Australia for assistance under the Act I will be pleased to provide detaUs to the honourable member on a confidential basis. (2) Due to the limited funds appropriated this financial year for the purposes of the States Grants (Nature Conservauon) Act it has been necessary for which agreements can be concluded and consequent legal and nnancial liability incurred this financial year. An additional amount has been offered to the State on the basis that agreements to be finalised this year will specify payment by the Australian Government in 1976-77. I have written to the South Australian Minister of Environment and Conservauon advising him of my desire to conclude agreements thisfinancialyear for the Murrays Lagoon program, a program at Pike River-Gurra Gurra Lakes and in respect of certain other lands for which no agreement to make a public statement has been made. I will be pleased to advise the honourable member of those areas not listed above for which it is intended to provide funds this financial year. (3) The Government is not able to provide detailed costs of proposed acquisitions in advance of acquisitions; nor is it prepared to provide publicly details of esumated cost as this could prejudice the negotiating abUity of the State Authority seeking the land. However, in the case of Murrays Lagoon this was acquired by the South Australian Government at a cost of $115,000 (Crown valuation) and this amount will be reimbursed to the State when an agreement is finalised. (4) As with part (1) of this question close details of areas approved in principle by the former Minister for Environment Dr Cass with the agreement of appropriate State Ministers. Accordingly I can only reiterate that the lands at Murrays Lagoon, Pike River and Gurra Gurra Lakes, Canopus, Morganvale, Hypurna and Postmark stations and lands at Coffin Bay were aU approved in principle by Dr Cass subject to conditions. These conditions, to be a part of the formal agreement for each area, were stated as mcluding the provision of Crown valuations, assurances that the purposes of nature conservation impUcit in the proposals would be achieved and the conclusion of agreements under the Act. There is one other South Australian area for which Dr Cass gave approval in principle but in respea of which no joint public statement has been made by Ministers. Dr Cass, agreed to issue a I am prepared to identify on a confidential basis to the honourable member the proposal not listed above that has been approved in principle by Dr Cass.
