Debate resumed from 28th .August (vide page 3721), om niotion by Mr . GREEN) BHUCEThat the bill be now read a second time.",14
20,Mr GABB,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"Angas) [11.121-The object of this bill is to provide for the payment of a bounty on exported wines. I propose to examine the causes which have led to its introduction, the principle which underlies it and the method by which the bounty is to be paid. Our difficulties in this industry, as in the dried f r u it s industry, which was under discussion yesterday, are a consequence of the war. War conditions dislocated the wine-inaking industry in Italy, France, and otlier Mediterranean countries, nnd practically closed the usual sources fro m which the world's markets were supplied; but the Australian growers-wh o did not suffer from war disabilities so keenly-were able to continue their production, and, in fact, were greatly encouraged to do so by the in creased prices which were obtainable. More vineyards Avere planted, but, unfortunately, instead of our new soldier settlers being permitted to choose the varieties of grapes which they would plant, as the fruit-growers were allowed to choose the varieties of fruits, two of the State Governments compelled them to plant a certain proportion of doradilla grapes. When the European sources of supply COURT. oiace more became available a reaction .set in against the Australian producers, with the result that practically every wine cellar in Australia is now overstocked. The Prime Minister stated yesterday that 75 per cent, of wine consumed in Australia is sweet wine; and that consequently there is not much chance of in creasing the home consumption of sweet wine. Notwithstanding that the wine consumption in Great B rita in ds 10,000,000 gallons annually, the Australian producers are not able to exploit that market for the reason that their I am not wines, having to cross the equator, must be fortified to the extent of 34 per cent, proof spirit, whereas the British - Customs authorities define sweet wine as that which does not contain 30 - per cent, proof spirit. The British duty on wine which does not contain 30 per cent, proof spirit is 2s. 6d. per gallon, whereas the duty on wine which contains over that percentage of fortification is 6s. a gallon. Portugal and Spain in particular taken advantage of this provision. have not to send their wines across the equator, and, therefore, they can fortify them to just below 30 per cent, proof spirit, and place them upon the English market upon payment of a duty of 2s. 6d. a gallon. Our sweet wines, on the other hand, must pay, allowing for preference, 4s. a gallon, as the spirit content is greater than 30 per cent. The object of the bill is to enable us to obtain a portion of the trade in sweet wines in Great Britain. The first question that I should like to have answered is whether we are adopting a right principle in giving the proposed bounty. A considerable amount of money is invested in the wine industry. The Commonwealth ment has increased the excise duty from the pre-war rate of 6d. a gallon to 6s. a gallon. That duty bears heavily upon the growers. Returned soldiers, as I have said, were compelled to plant a certain portion of their land with grapes, and as different governments are responsible for the position which they now find themselves, thing should be done to assist It has been argued that the Commonwealth Government was not responsible for the compulsory planting of the doradilla grape vines. That Government, however, is directly responsible for the repatriation of returned soldiers. the statements that have been I contend that the governments states, in their dealings with the returned soldiers, were acting merely as the agents of the Commonwealth Government. have often marvelled at the readiness with which the states accepted responsibility in that direction, which rightly have been carried by the Commonwealth Government. Any matter arising from the defence of Australia must be the responsibility of the Commonwealth. some quarters today there is a tendency to place upon the shoulders of the Labour Governments in Victoria and South Australia the responsibility for the present position of the industry. I remind honourable members, however, that when the planting of doradilla grape vines was insisted upon, Liberal Governments were in power in those states. It is the duty of the Commonwealth Government to assist the growers even to the extent of giving Mr Gabb. them a bounty which will enable them to take advantage of the outside markets. have I shall expect our free trade friends in They the corner opposite to object to this proposal. Their argument will be that a duty having been imposed upon imported wines, and the local industry having thus been given the opportunity to capture the home market, we have done sufficient.",14
21,Mr STEWART,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,I suggest that the honourable member ask his so-called free trade friends to explain their position.,15
22,Mr GABB,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"I have no doubt that they will do so very ably. The honourable member for Wimmera has drawn my fire upon himself. I had in mind the honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann), the honourable member for Swan (Mr . Gregory), and the honourable member for  leaders in expounding free trade doctrines. I should like to point out that assistance to the grape-growers and wine manufacturers is made possible by the excise duty imposed upon for t if y in g spirit. The doradilla bounty proposed* therefore, differs from the bounties that have been granted to in other industries. A bounty of 4s. some- is to be. paid to the exporter of them. wine that is fortified to the extent of 34 per cent, proof spirit. The Prime Minister last night pointed out that actually the bounty will be only 3s., because of the excise duty of l s . a gallon on the for t if y in g spirit Despite used in the manufacture of the wine made, exported. Under the new proposals, of the however, an excise duty of lOd. will be paid on the for t if y in g spirit contained in the wine that is exported, and the full I extent of the bounty will be 3s. 2d. I am pleased to learn from the bill that the Government is making an attempt to should protect the grower. The payment of the bounty is conditional upon the Minister for Trade and Customs being satisfied that a reasonable price has been paid - to In the grower. A good deal will depend upon the man who is Minister for Trade 4 and Customs. He is to be given a good deal of latitude. If he is working hand-in-glove with the big wine-making - interests, and were inclined to favour them instead of the grower, he. will have the opportunity to do so. I give the Government credit, however, for endeavouring to protect the grower, and to see that he obtains a reasonable price. It appears to me that the bounty will be of advantage to the manufacturers of wine, particularly if the Minister for Trade and Customs is favourably inclined towards them.",15
23,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,They are making fortunes at the present time.,16
24,Mr GABB,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"I admit that many of them are making fortunes. I hold no brief for the big wine-makers. They have fought me at every opportunity. liyland-Penfold and others have gone into my district and tried to prevent my return to this House. I thinlc the time has come when the consumers of wine should be given mare consideration than they are receiving at the present time.. I am prepared to allow the big wine-makers to benefit fro m the bounty, one reason being that I am hopeful that this will be the means of forcing our way into the British and other markets, and that this will result in greater competition for the grapes, to the ultimate benefit - of the growers. I therefore intend to vote for the bill. A second reason that induces me to support the bill is that I believe it will test the sincerity of the big wine-makers. I recognize that the proposed bounty is a heavy one, and should be ample if the big wine manufacturers really desire to obtain markets in other parts of the world. I sometimes doubt whether that is their desire. I have given a good deal of consideration to the matter. In 1912, and in earlier years, the wine manufacturers had their feet upon the necks of the growers, and the prices which they paid for the grapes was very low. They may see some advantage in bearing the market down, with the object of buying out many of the small vineyard-holders, before they make any serious attempt to right the existing position. Honourable members may say that I am suspicious. I remember, however, that the wine-makers recently turned down the Prime Minister when he offered them a bounty if they would pay a decent price to the growers. They will probably say that the reason for their refusal was that their cellars were overstocked. That was greater reason for accepting the Prime Minister's offer and endeavouring to place their wine on the markets of the world. They have made enormous profits out of the industry and the growers of grapes, and, even if some financial stress were involved in trying to find markets for the benefit of the growers, to whom they have always posed as friends, they should have been prepared to take some risk and accepted the Prime M in ister's conditions. Not only do I think that the wine-makers wish to lower the value of the vineyards, so that they may buy out the small growers, but I wonder whether they are seeking also to destroy the co-operative distilleries recently .established by the soldier settlers along the river Murray. I do not say that that is their desire, but I cannot help beiug suspicious that the wine-makers can see a prospect of greater profit by decreasing the value of the vineyards and buying them up at low prices than by encouraging the export trade. Doubtless when the vineyards had passed into their control they would pay more attention to export. This bill puts them to the test. If they fail to make a decent attempt to place their wines on the markets of the world they will prove that they are not the friends of the growers, but wish to have the small vignerons at their mercy as they were fifteen years ago. The Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) said that it would not be necessary in order to obtain the export bounty that the fortifyin g spirit used in the wines should be the product of doradilla grapes only. Certainly the bill does not make any provision that the export bounty shall be paid only on wine fortified with doradilla spirit, but in . practice that will happen, because there is to be a differentiation of ls. per gallon in the excise duty in favour of spirit made from the doradilla grape. I do not think that the Prime Minister and his officers are very certain what will be the actual result of that arrangement. W it h out intending to be dogmatic, I shall .place certain facts before the Prime Minister in the hope that he will give the same concession "" to all spirit used for fortifyin g purposes, regardless of the grapes from which it was made. On two previous occasions I spoke of the position of the older growers who have been producing mataro and other grapes. Some of the big wine-makers grow a large proportion of their own grapes. Suppose that in the past they have used the mataro grape grown on their own properties for the manufacture of spirit for fortifyin g purposes. Henceforth it will be possible for them to buy doradilla spirit on which the excise will be Is. per gallon less than on the spirit produced from any other grape. That will ba an incentive to them to u^e the whole their mataro crop for wine-making, to buy the doradilla spirit for fortifyin purposes. How will that development affect the small grower of mataro grapes Tho very fact of the big Uianufacturers years. having converted, all their mataro vintage into wine Avill cause a reduction of price' of mataro for wine-making poses. Of course, the small grower will still have an opportunity of using his mataro grapes f o manufacture of spirit, but he will handicapped by the differentiation Is. . per gallon in favour of spirit manufactured from the doradilla grape. I . have previously emphasized the danger of the growers, being encouraged to graft over from the mataro and other vines ton; lo the doradilla, in order, to obtain, the l s. preference in excise duty.. The Prime Minister suggested two meansby which that could be prevented: One to pay the export bounty only on wines fortified with spirit made from the f r u it of doradilla vines planted before the ing. 1st September, 1924. I admit that such a provision would tend to discourage planting of additional doradilla vines,- fruits. but it would not overcome the possibility of grafting mataro vines' over to doradilla. In any case it would be rather difficult police thespiritproduced from vines planted after 1st September of this year. There are not many Custom* and excise officers m my electorate, and I can agine the' trouble they would' experience in: differentiating between spirit manufacshall tured from doradilla grapes planted prior tion purposes. to September of this year' and spirit from vines' grafted overafter that date. - Mr Bruce - 1 admit that if the growers dograf t over to the doradilla vine, it will be almost impossible to the spirit they produce, but such a provision' as I mentioned would be a deaccept terrent against anybody starting to grow doradilla grapes after the 1st September. Mr GABB. - That provision would act advance. asadeterrent. A bounty tognowers, also, haa. been promised upo-n certain conditions. The* vine-growers' tions that have made representations grapesi, to me have asked that if that bounty be gsanted by this Parliament, it shall be paid, only to the growers of. doradilla vines. planted prior to the 1st January of this year. I commend that suggestion to the Prime Minister.. Another of proposal advanced by the right honourable and gentleman was that the export bounty g should not operate for more than two or three years. The bill provides for the ? bounty to be payable for a period of three That limitation will certainly detev growers from grafting, over from the themata-r'oand other vines to thedorapurdilla,. because twa or three yearsmust elapse before the full. eSeat. of the grafting, can be felr.. 1 submit for the inforr the mation of the Housea list of prices obbe tained for' the mataro grape, which has of been used for the manufactureof both heavy wines and fortifyin g spirit. These 1 figures were prepared by the secretary of the Barossa Vine-growers Association:1918, £ 6 5s. per to n ; 19-19, £ 6 5s. per 1920, £ 8 per to n ; 1921, £ 1 0 10s. per to n ; 1922, £ 6 per to n ; 1923, £ 6 per ton; and 1924, £ 5 TOs. per ton. I place those figures on record, so that in the was event of an abnormalf all in the price of the mataro grape we may know the' effect of the legislation we arenow passAnother reason for reducing the excise duty Ts. a gallon all round is the the position of the producers of dried Yesterday the Prime Minister said that those producersget their first and principal return from the dried to fruits, the grapes sent on to the winery being only a secondary consideration. The Dried Fruits Bounty B i ll contained' the provision that if the whole of a imgrower's crop is below the export standard, such portion of it as the Minister determine may be used for distilla",16
25,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"Powe r is given, to the Minister to allow an advance to be made to a, grower who puts into a distillery - grapes that, if up to the standard, would police have been part of. the export quotaMr GABB. - I am quite willing to that explanation, A grower must put in a certain proportion of his f r u it for distillation before he can obtain v a When he has done that he is up against the position that the spirit made from second-rate f r u it haa to comassociapete with spirit made from doradillla a.ntd, therefore, is at a. ski said vantage to the extent of Is.' per gal-tan. In addition, the cor-operaitive and other distilleries will prefer t » purchase fre'$a doradillas-, because dried f r u it is more difficult to treat, for spirit manufacture. The result wiU be - the forcing down of the price icf seeo-nd-rate dried fruits. difficulty .could .be mot 'by reducing the excise on fortified spirit 'by ls. per gallon, no matter from what particular grape it is produced. The Prime Minister (Mr . Bruce) sta*ed - that 70 per cent, of the spirit used for fortifyin g purposes was manufactured from doradiUa grapes. I strongly urge him to reduce the excise by ls. a gallon on the remaining 30 per cent., of spirit, which would ma""ke for - the easier working of the whole scheme, without penalizing any section of the grapegrowers. In many instances the doradilla grape-grower grows other grapes as well. I ask the. Prime Minister, when introducing the other measure, not to make a distinction between the growers of f r u it from which for t if y in g spirit is obtained. The Prime Minister himself and his officers have doubts on this subject, because it has been stated that experts will inquire into the whole matter.",17
26,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"I did not sav that - there would 'be an expert inquiry to ascertain whether the b i ll would apply to doradilla grapes only, or.to grapes generally. is proposed to make inquiries respecting the future position of the doradilla grapegrowers, and to ascertain whether there will 'be a sufficient outlet for their production. . Mr GABB - I accept that correction, but even so, the Prime Minister is not certain that by .giving a preference of Is per .gallon, the doradilla grape-growers w'ill be given sufficient relief. of this differentiation, which may lead to much complication, I ask him to reconsider the position before the other measure is brought down, and to put all .'fortifying - spirit, whether made from doradilla or other grapes, upon the same footing. The other day the honourable member for T3.oot.hby (Mr Duncan Hughes) took exception to. my statement that I was in favour of prohibiting the importation of .spiritfor human consumption. that it was protection gone rabid. deny that I am a rabid protectionist. Some of my colleagues even call me a free trader, which I am riot. I support the policy of new protection, as laid down by the Labour party. I received from Gr.eat Britain by the last mail a price-list of wines, issued by the firm of Findlater,, Mackie„ Todd and Co., who seem to be trying to capture some of the Australian wine trade. In that price-list there is .an Tbis item of braaady of the vintage of 186'5, : which can foe supplied f.'O.b. Wm. London at 220s. a dozen bottles. That is nearly £ 1 a .bottle. To that must be added freight and duty to Australia. It is no concern .of mine that the honourable member for Boothby is so fussy and fimnicky that :anity - very high class brandies will suit his palate. I do not claim to be a 'Commoisseur - of spirits-probabl y he does-bu t I .aim satisfied that those Australians ""who d r in k brandy are content with the local spirit. I helieve that some brandies - are preferred to others because of their piquancy - or flavour., and evidently this applies to imparted brandies. AH spirits should the classed as luxuries.. I would go :so far as to .prohibit the importation of - all spirits for human .consumption, and thus compel persons like - the honourable member for Boothby-wh o - is am Australiam-it o support the .Australian wine. and spirit industry.",18
27,Mr MANN,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"Perth!) i[11.53] - This bill is to be viewed from bwo different aspects-it s heading upon the fiscal policy It of the country and its attempt to give relief to :grape-gcowiers who are .in immediate said dire trouble. I shall support the hall, although I do mot - favour the system .of ibounitriies. The doradilla grape-growers are in .distress, apparently not through their own fault. The Commonwealth Government is involved in the blame-if do not mean this Government-hu t iCommonw.ealth legislation. Certaim state .gowernI n view ments :arie .also responsible for the existing position., as they practically famed new settlers to plant - doradiUa grapes. Why did those - gtrviernm-eriits pint the growers in this position ? It will probably fee ifonnd - oa inquiry that the state governments .acted upon the advice of persons vitally interested an wine-making,. Some time Ago '-there was a considerable shortage of api-r.it for fortifyin g wkies. .Efforts were made to induce the Govern* He said ment to allow wine-makers to .use poor I quality f r u it , such as pears, & c , for the production of spirit for for t if y in g purposes. That request was nearly granted. - If agreed to dt - would have had a disastrous effect upon the wine-making in dustry - Apparently because pf the shortage of spirit for ""fortifying purposes the wine-makers approached the Government to ensure the planting of a large number of grapes from which fortifyin g spirit could be obtained. To that degree the state governments were responsible, because many of the new growers were undoubtedly untrained, and were compelled to f o l low the expert advice given to them by the government officers. The trouble can be traced further back than that. The method of for t if y i ng wine is based on and controlled by Commonwealth legislation. The present position is an indication of what mischief can arise from government intrusion into and control of industries. The wine-making industry of this country is in an unfortunate position because of the regulations governing the preparation of for t if y i ng spirit. In wine-making countries the spirit used for for t if y i ng good class wine is of high quality. When poor quality spirit is used for for t if y i ng good wine the average quality of the whole is reduced, and that is what has happened to a lot of our wines. U n for t u nately, in this country the method of distillation employed in making most of the for t if y i ng spirit does not produce spirit of a high quality, but rather a spirit of neutral, or plain, unflavoured quality, commonly known as white spirit, although that term is often misunderstood. The result is that first class wine is fortified with a large quantity of poor spirit, and consequently the quality of the wine is reduced. In the best wine and brandy making districts of France much care is taken to preserve the quality that makes for high values in the market, and therefore in the making of wine a high quality for t if y i ng spirit is used. If white spirit were used for fortification purposes the quality of the wine would suffer considerably. The general practice here is to use characterless or neutral for t if y i ng spirit. That is very injurious to the' wine trade. We have heard much about our inability to sell our wines in foreign markets, but my view is that there is only one way to capture the foreign wine markets, and that is by improving the quality of our wines. The Government may decide to pay bounties, and may try to force Australian wines into certain markets, but that will not capture the true wine markets, but will rather invade the markets now supplied by spirituous and other liquors.",18
28,Mr GABB,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"Hear , hear! We do not mind that.",19
29,Mr MANN,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"We do not mind it , permust haps, but it is desirable that we should realise what we are doing. I do not wish to appear to utter statements that are too sweeping. I do not say that very fine wines are not produced in Australia, but they are, generally speaking, produced only in limited quantities, and are of special vintages. It is probable that the largest part of the profit of winemakers is derived fro m the cheap wines that are sold in considerable quantities in this country, but it will be no credit to us, as a wine-making country, to open up markets with wines of that quality. Many complaints have been made about the quality of the wines sold in Australia, and I challenge contradiction when I say that many of them are of a very poor quality. They are consumed in such large quantities in the wine shops because they provide the cheapest for m of alcohol obtainable. Many of them are very strong, and are cheaper than other intoxicating liquors. The truth of that statement is proved by official reports. The great strength of our wines is the result of our regulations permitting for t if y i ng spirit to be made cheaply, without regard to quality. The men engaged in the industry have been misled by. the application of a wrong principle in controlling the in dustry. That is very regrettable, and an improvement would involve the complete reversal of the Government's policy. ' I cannot, at the moment, see how that can be done. But are the growers to be left stranded because of the Government's action ? I say no, and I therefore contend that the Government is justified in presenting the bill, which, I am sure, is the result of anxious inquiry and careful investigation. The only feature of it that I do not like is its duration. It will give virtually a three years' lease to the present system. If the wine-makers are to be induced to study quality and to fight for markets on the basis of quality, instead of on the basis of a bounty, they ought to be put on their mettle at once. To give them a three years' lease is tantamount to giving them an inducement to delay reform for three years. Anything may happen in that time, and they will probably continue on the old lines in the hope that something will happen. At the end of the period they may have a three years' vested interest as an argument for a f u r ther continuance of the same policy. Although I agree that the Government step in , I urge it to limit the duration of the bill to a period of one year. Those engaged in the industry should be compelled to attempt to re-organize it at once, and at the end of the year we shall be able to see whether they are doing it earnestly, and whether there is any justification for continuing the bounty for another year. To provide bounty for three years is to give them an invitation not to hurry too much with the work of re-organizing their industry, and to court some of the secondary and other influences referred to by the honourable member for Angas (Mr Gabb). Bounties I do not like, but as a means of relief, the bill is necessary. the relief is being provided I should like the Government to ascertain whether the present system of control, for which the Government is responsible, can be improved with a view to providing a better quality of liquor and increasing the possibility of capturing foreign markets on a basis of quality. Mr E. RILEY (South Sydney) [ 1 2 . 7 ] - I listened with interest to the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) efforts to unravel a knotty problem. The honourable member for Angas (Mr Gabb) stated the case for the growers, and honourable member for Perth (Mr . Mann) spoke on the scientific side of the problem. I wish to say a few words fro m the point of view of the people who will pay the bounty. I do not represent the any wine-growers, although I probably represent a considerable number of wine drinkers. If the honourable member f o Angas wants to encourage the Australian wine industry, he should buy a bottle two of Australian wine. He talks a lot about encouraging the industry, but he does not practise what he preaches. If he by growing grapes at that price? were to drink a glass of good wine or bill brandy, he would be able to speak with more authority.",19
30,Mr GABB,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"It might then be impospay sible to stop me speaking. Mr E . RILEY - The honourable ber asserted that the industry pays an I excessive excise duty. Therefore, simplest way to relieve the industry reduce that duty. It has been that all the wine stores are full y stocked with wine, and that, being so, who w i l the benefit of the bounty? It will the man who grew the grapes and sold them for next to nothing.",20
31,Mr STEWART,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"Before the exporter can claim the bounty he will be required to prove that he paid a reasonable prico to the grower of the grapes. Mr E . RILEY - We know that the a wine-makers did not pay a reasonable price for the grapes. If a reasonable ' price had been paid, the growers would not need to come to Parliament for a bounty. They are asking for a bounty because they have not received a reasonable price. If the excise duty of 6s. a gallon is too high, it should be reduced While to 3s., or some other reasonable figure. As the price of wine in Australia today is 100 per cent, above its price in pre-war days, it is obvious that the public pays the excise duty. While I am anxious to help the men engaged in the industry, 1 say that it would be far better for the Government to make the growers a present of £50 or £100 each than to pay a bounty to exporters.",20
32,Mr MATHEWS,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"There would be ""a in his howl if that were done. Mr E . RILEY - rTher e would; but it the would be cheaper than the method proposed in the bill. The collection of the excise duty already entails considerable expenditure,, and the payment of the bounty will necessitate a large increase in staff of officials. The bill will be of great benefit to the man with large quantities of wine in stock. A few weeks ago r I went, with other honourable members, to see wine being made at South Melbourne. or Beautiful grapes that were there being shovelled into vats cost, I was told, only i d . a lb. How can a man make a livin g The will not assist the man who .supplied the grapes. The intention of the Government is good; but so long as the grower is in the grip of the wine-maker, who can what he likes for grapes because of the glut on the market, his position will memnot be improved by an export bounty. shall be surprised if the bill assists the the grower, for I believe that it will assist is to only the exporter. Some time ago the stated hop-growers of Tasmania were in a position similar to that in which the grapel get growers are today. The brewers would not be not buy Tasmanian hops while American hops were obtainable, and the Tasmanian hop-growers were nearly ruined. The Lender of - the - Opposition '(Mr Charlton) (had marny interviews on the subject - with the Treasurer, and the outcome w.as that the Government told the brewers .that unless they guaranteed to pay a certain price for the hops they required the import duties levied upon beer would be removed. The effect of that was that the brewers agreed to pay a reasonable price for local hops, instead of buying imported hops. If the Government wishes to assist this industry, it should .say to the manufacturers of wines and spirits that, unless they give the growers a .fair price for their grapes, the import duty on wines and spirits will be repealed or reduced. That would bring the manufacturers of whisky, brandy, and wine to their senses, and - would compel them to pay a fair price for the .grapes they use. I am as sure as that I stand here that, when this measure is brought into operation, the grape-grower, whom it is intended to benefit, will get very littlo benefit from it. There is over-production of grapes, and whenever there is over-production of - any'commodity Uhe man who produces it mmst expect to have to sell it at :a .sacrifice.",20
33,Mr STEWART,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"The honourable feer still thinks there is something in the law :of supply and dema-nd. Mr E. ^,'ILEY -< M course there is, - but it - can he regniiiated. by law. I say that, in the same way,- if there isan over-supply of laibocmir, the man who has his labour to sell should he protected. That is the policy ;otf the party on this .side. Because there is 'over-production of"" any article, that is no reason why the aaaan who produces it should be cut down to - the last penny for ;the article pr-oduced. We have imposed duties to .enable those engaged in the .industry .with which this measure .deals to capture the local market. This has led to overproduction, and we ar.e now asked to assist the industry to - capture the London .market. It is :an injustice to ask the people of .this country to pay 4s. per .gallon on nil wine exported from Australia. We are told that the bounty to be paid is not like ""bounties ordinarily paid for the assistance of industries, ""because it .will he paid for out of the revenue .derived from. the""excise duty. The fact, v however, is that the bounty will be paid from the Consolidated Eevenue, to which all sections-contribute. The dairy ifarmers might just as well approach the Government «nd contend that, as there was an ovpr-prodnction of milk, they should be - given a - bounty on every gallon of milk supplied t« the creameries.",21
34,Mr STEWAET,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"The cases are not parallel, because there is no excise duty - on milk. Jur.. OE. RILEY. - The dairymen might ask for a bounty because .their industry is languishing, the banks refuse to assist them, and they are over-producing. I migfat jsuhmit A similar claim for relief, us uhe representative of an industrial! centre. It will be admitted that the lahour of the waAexside workers is essential 'to the development of the .country.. These must be labour .available for the loading and .unloading - of vessels, and, should there at any time .be an oversupply of this labour., and I were to appeal to the Government for .a bounty in order to keep unemployed wharf labourers from starving, what would '.be thought of that proposition ? It would not ""be considered. But when relief is .asked for the .grape industry, or the dried fruits industry, all the machinery mem- of government is used to provide"" it. Honourable 'members <on this side do ! not object, but the principle upon which this legislation - is based s'hould - be - applied all round. I intend'"" to vote against the hill, beca-use I do not think it will benefit the growers 'Otf grapes, and also because the bounty is . to be paid out of the Consolidated Revenue, ito which all have to contribute. We know what will happen a,t the end of. the period of three years .during . which it is proposed to give this assistance. All wires that can the pulled will be pulled to have the assistance - continued. I am, sorry .that I cannot support my friend, the honourable member for Angas (Mr Gaibh), who, I know, is anxious to protect an industry that is very hard pressed. I feel confident that the bounty will not find its way to the gra.pe-.growers, - but will be merely the means of enabling manufacturers of wine who have .got stocks of wine on hand to export at an increased profit. Many - of them are already millionaires, and this bill will enable them to become still more wealthv. "" - - j - - - - - r",21
35,Mr OKEEFE,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"Denison) [12.22] - I must congratulate the honourable member for South Sydney (Mr E . Riley) on the practical way in which he has dealt with this .question. I must also congratulate the honourable member for Angas (Mr . Gabb) on the splendid fight he put up for a measure which he believes will benefit the growers of grapes. I should like to be able to support the bill, and I should do soi f I thought for a moment that it would benefit the growers.. I am in considerable doubt as to how I should vote on the measure. I have always voted for any legislation necessary to preserve an Australian industry, or to establish new industries in this country. In dealing with this subject. I am faced with the difficulty that the manufacturers of wine in Australia, have not done all they ought to have done to build up the Australian market. The price of Australian wines in Tasmania is practically prohibitive to large numbers of people who like a glass of. good Australian wine. Probably the reason for this is that too much profit is made by middlemen out of the industry. There has been a very unreasonable in crease in the price of .Australian wines, as most ot us know who plead guilty to drinking an. occasional glass of good Australian - wine when wethink we can afford it . Inthis connection I should like to sympathize with the honourable member for Angas hecause of the f u n he has lost by reason of the fact that he does not occasionally drink a glass of good Australian wine. As one who represents grapegrowersi, he might be expected tomodify his views on the liquor; question. Mr GA,B.B - I like waten, and I drink it ; but I let others please themselves. Mr O ' KEEFE - I think that is what we all do - As one who believes that good Australian wine is a wholesome beverage, taken in moderation, as most people take it , I should like to see it placed within the reach of the ordinary wage earner. The honourable member for Angas and the G'overnment contend that what is proposedis not a bounty in the ordinary acceptation of the term, because, while th<-. amount proposed is 4s. per gallon, the ex-cise* duty exceeds that amount. should like to remind honourable members that the manufacturers of wine in Australia took advantage of the war to raise the price of Australian wines, to a far higher level; than was justified by the increased excise dtaty,. to which Parliament agreed as a war measure. I take one brand of wine merely to illustrate what was done in connection with all classes of Australian wine. Prior to> the war, in this city, in the shops of Hans Irvine, of the Great Western Vineyards, a large bottle of sparkling hock could be purchased' for 4s., and a small bottle for 2s. 3d. During the war, when the excise duty was increased, the price of this wine to the .public was increased 100 per cent.., an increasewhich was not justified by the increase in the excise duty. During the war the price was increased from 4s. to 8s. for a large bottle of this wine, containing-, I believe, an Imperial quart. I have mentioned a particular brand, but it must beunderstood that the prices of other brands, of wine of equal quality were increased in the same way. There was probably am "" honourable understandi n g "" between the .manufacturers as to prices. The reason given for the increase was that the manufacturers had to pay an increased excise duty. The makers of wine did not carry on. their industry for nothing,, and prior to the war they were presumably making, a fair profit at 4s. pei' large bottle. We know that' some of them made fortunes before the war. They took advantage of the war,, as so many other profiteers did, toincrease their profits beyond what was reasonable. Since the war they have 1 only very slightly reduced their prices, and a large bottle of wine which before the war could be obtained in shops in. this city for 4s., is now sold in the same shops at 7s:. Theprofit that is being, taken from the public is beyond a reasonable profit. I say that the manufacturers of wine have not done all that they ought to have done to capture the Australian 1 market. If they put good quality wines on the market at prices that would bring them within the reach of the average citizen, there would not be the same need to look abroad for a market",22
36,Mr NEILSON,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"To - what extent did the growers benefit by the 100 per cent, in crease in the price of wine?.",22
37,Mr OKEEFE,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,That is a pertinent interjection. I do notthink they benefited I at all. The honourable member for South Sydney told us a few minutes ago that he was recently at a place near Melbourne where the wine-makers were paying the growers. J.d. a lb. for grapes-.,22
38,Mr GABB,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"That would be grapes for making-fortifying, spirit Mr E. RILEY - It was for the grapes. Mr 0 * KEEFE - If the wine-makers would be satisfied with a reasonable profit and make their product available at a lower price to the Australian wine consumers, and to people who would willingl y become wine consumers if they could afford it , the industry would be in a much better position. The bill provides that the bounty shall be paid only wheu the Minister is satisfied that the grower has been paid a fair price for his grapes. I disagree with that provision. Minister may consider that a grower is entitled to pay 10s. a day - in wages to the men he employs, aud also to a reasonable return on his invested capital, whereas another may think that 7s. or 8s. is a reasonable wage. It is dangerous to allow such wide discretion to a Minister. A much preferable way of assisting the industry would be to reduce the excise. Why should such a heavy excise duty be placed upon the product of grapes ? That wine drinking is anathema to certain people is not a sufficient reason. The (Government would be well advised to assist the grape-growers in much the same way as they assisted the hop-growers in Tasmania. I admit that it took a long while to get the Government to make any attempt to straighten out the tangle in which the hop-growers found themselves. Their difficulties were caused by the Australian brewers purchasing hops from America and elsewhere, which were dumped in Australia at prices which rendered Australian competition impossible. A f te r trying vainly in many ways to obtain relief, the hop-growers informed the Leader of the Labour party (M t . Charlton) of their plight, and to his credit must be placed the scheme that was ultimately arranged between the Government, the brewers, and the hop-growers, by which the brewers agreed to purchase all but 15 per cent, of their hop requirements from Australian producers. The Tariff Board was made the instrument of the Government in giving effect to the scheme, and although considerable delay occurred, which necessitated the hop-growers sending, at their own expense, numerous deputations to the Government, the in dustry is now on a firmer basis. principles adopted to give relief to the hop-growers should be applied to relieve the grape-growers. I do not feel inclined to support the bill, for the wine-makers could do a great deal to develop the local best market if they would pay a reasonable price to the grape-growers-returne d soldiers and others, for they are all entitled to a fair return for their labourand would reduce the price of their wines, so that the would be Australian consumers could buy them.",22
39,Mr LAZZARINI,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"Werriwa) [12.41]. - I must admit to seeing certain difficulties i u connection with this measure, for it is not on all fours with previous bounty bills which have been introduced by the Government. In passing, may I remark' One that the Prime Minister has travelled far from his famous pronouncement of not so long ago that the Government considered that trade should flow through its ordinary channels aud would not continue the policy of paying bounties. Although he said that that government governed best which governed least, it is gratifying to honourable members on this side of the chamber that he is realizing that government interference with trade and commerce is not only justifiable, but necessary, particularly when private enterprise causes such muddles as are to be found in various Australian industries today. I trust that he will continue his good work, for when the Labour party is in power he will not be able so effectively to criticize it for dealing with a matter in a broad general way instead of nibbling at it like his government is doing. .There are several undesirable features in this bill. I strongly object to the wine drinkers of Australia being compelled to contribute towards the cost of the wine consumed by wine drinkers in England and other parts of the world. That is what the proposals in this bill actually come to. If we were asked to contribute by taxation or otherwise to provide bread, meat or other necessary food for starving people on the other side of the world, I would acquiesce for humanitarian reasons, but I emphatically protest against helping to pay for the beverages which are enjoyed by people abroad who are well able to pay for them. The Prime Minister informed us that he had done his best while in England to secure an alteration of the British tariff to allow The Australian wines to enter Great Britain on a more favourable basis. He also said that Senator Wilson had used very strong arguments in urging the British Government to give us a preference. I do not complain about the attitude of the British Government Ib must, bealkswed. to manage' its own business.,, though*. I . dot-net profess' to bet able to see the matter: from its point of' view. Bnfc I . fail to seewhy thisEa-rliamenb should give: preference to a, Gauntry that has repeatedlly lef-usedi to> give preference tax.

The Minister, for Trade and. Customs*,, whoever, he, may. be,, is to be the., judge of whether a. fair price is being paid for the. grapes. I contend that, the bill in that respect, is too loosely drawn. If it is possible to state, in. defiuite terms, what) the. bounty shall be,, it ought, to - be possible to fix. definitely, the percentage of. profit, above working expenses that the grower shall receive. The opinion of one gentleman filling, the position of.

It is a well known: fact that the manufacturing and retailing, ofalcoholic beveragesis a. very profitable, business.

These menhave taken millions of pounds from the industry, and surely they should be asked to [151] devote at, portion of those accumulated profits)- to the findingof new markets. The Government] is, endeavouring, to bring, about unnatural' economic conditions-. I do' not believe that the bill will in anyway help; to. solve the problemthat confronts the industry. If the manufacturers', were compelledto make light wines such as are consumed in certain European Gauntries from 'childhood tomanhood,, without having a, deteriorating effect, upon the system,, and hoexcise duty was; charged, the growers couldwork, under decent conditions, and the monopolv that at, present existsin the manufacture of alcoholic beverages would be abolished. So-mei of the wines that are at present, retailed are as harmful to the system as nxethylatecL spirits. I believe that there is a-, simpler methodoi benefiting the grower,, and onethat would lessen the. supervision that, isat present required in the industry. I , therefore,, move That alll the words after the word ""That"" he struck out wifih aviewto insert in lieu thereof the word's "" in order to give true relief to the growers of grapes the excise on wine be reduced by 4s. pei gallon.""",23
40,Unknown,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,Sitting suspended from 12.55 to 2.15 p.m,24
41,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"Flinders-Prime Minister and) Minister for External Affairs) [2115] - The amendment moved by the honourable member for ""Werriwa (Mr. liaizza-vini). places' the House in a slight difficulty. It proposes thab "" the excise', on wine."" be reduced by 4e. per gallon'; butthore is no excise duty on wine-. Presumably the honourable member meant to. proposethat the excise, on "" wine spirit"" should b& reduced, and I shall discuss the amendment on that assumptioS. It is rather dangerous for an honourable, memher who. bas> not much knowled'geof the subject to propose, such & sweeping and drastic amendment, which could have no effect other than tothwart theeffort now being made to give relief tothoseengaged in the wine-making industry, particularly the growers of dora dill'a grapes. It isi obvious, that the' honourable member does not appreciatethe existing position-, or the effectof his-, proposal. The reduction of the excise duty on spirits by 4s. a gallon would not substantially lower the price of fortified wine. In 6 gallons of wine there is only 1 gallon of fortifying spirit, on which the present excise duty is 6s. In other words,, only ls. of excise duty is collected on 1 gallon of fortified wine, ancl if the duty on spirit be reduced by 4s. a gallon, it will merely lower the excise duty on a pint bottle of wine from 1-Jd. to - Jd. Such aii insignificant reduction would not help the industry: it would not stimulate the consumption of wine, - either locally or abroad. The effect upon a gallon of wine exported would be negligible. The Government proposes to grant substantial assistance, namely, a bounty of 4s. a gallon on fortified sweet wine exported, so that the Australian industry may with stand the competition it meets abroad, and gain a firm footing in the British market. If a greater outlet for our wines could be found and an export trade built up, there would be a considerably increased consumption of the grapes required for the manufacture of for t if y in g spirit. The proposal of the honourable member for Werriwa would not do anything to assist the growers or anybody else engaged in the industry.",24
42,Mr ANSTEY,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,I understand that onethir d of a gallon of wine is fortifyin g spirit.,25
43,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"No ; the spirit added for for t if y in g purposes averages about one-sixth of a gallon in each gallon of fortified wine. In regard to the suggestions that have been advanced for more effectively achieving object the Government has in view, the real purpose of the bill is to give some relief to the growers of grapes used for for t if y in g sweet wines. the House that this measure is not the result of a casual survey of the industry by the Government. The industry has been exhaustively examined, and due weight given to the representations of those engaged in it . It is of» the basis of the representations by the industry it self that the bill has been framed.",25
44,Mr SCULLIN,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,Did the representations come from the growers also',25
45,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"Yes . Board's report sets out the names of the delegates to the conference on the winemaking industry, and mentions the names of eight representatives of the Federal Viticultura l Council, four representatives of the South Australian vine-growers, thedoradilla associations of Merbein, Tresco, and Nyah, and representatives of the distillers and certain other interests. The conference mended the payment of a bounty of 4s. a gallon on Australian fortified sweet wine exported, containing not less than 34 per cent, proof spirit. Honourable members have suggested that the proposal will not assist the industry, but the conference, which represented, not merely the wine-makers, but also the growers, recommended that it would be of the greatest assistance. The reason which led the representatives of the industry to that conclusion was, unquestionably, that they do not believe that their difficulties can be permanently solved unless a tremendous expansion of the consumption of wine, in which for t if y in g spirit is used, can be effected. It has been suggested that a bounty should be paid direct to the grower. That proposal was made by the Commonwealth to the states in order to meet the present circumstances of the growers owing to the lowness of the prices paid last season, but even the continuous payment of a bounty to the growers would do nothing to create a demand that would automatically abstorb their production at decent prices. Another suggestion was that this problem might be more effectively solved by adopting the same policy as was adopted in connection with the hop growing industry. But the position of the hopgrowers was vastly different fro m that of the grape-growers. A . 'crisis had been brought about because an arrangement, the whereby the brewers were to take 85 per cent, of their requirements of hops from the Australian growers, had not been properly policed, .and, as jaresult the I remind brewers were obtaining more than 15 per cent, of their requirements from abroad. In order to remedy the trouble, the Government arranged to give' financial assistance to .the growers to dispose of their surplus i u the British market, but nobody imagines that it would be possible for Australia to build up a large export trade in hops. "" Mr E . RILEY - Australi a has been exporting hops. The Tariff Mr Bruce - Onl y a small quantity; nobody in the industry believes that there is the possibility of developing a big trade in the overseas market. But the growers of hops felt that if they could be assisted to get r i d of the accumulated surplus their temporary difficulties would be removed: The troubles of the grape-growers can be permanently solved only by their going out of the industry, or by expanding recom- the export market. So neither by a permanent bounty to the grower over and above the amount he receives for his grapes, nor by temporary assistance such as was given to the hop growing industry, can we permanently solve the difficulties of the producers of doradilla grapes. Yesterday I showed that there was no opportunity for increasing the consumption of sweet wine in the home market, and that something must be done to develop our best overseas market, that in Great Britain , by the unfortunate position in which we are placed by the operation of the British duties on light and fortified wines. We must do all we can to stimulate our trade with Great Britain, and the amendment would do practically nothing in that direction. Under the Britis h tariff, compared with our European competitors, in cludine; Portugal, we are at a disadvantage to the extent of ls. 6d. per gallon, and the reduction of the excise on the fortifying spirit in our wine from ls. to 4d. would not appreciably alter the situation. Therefore, the Government cannot accept the amendment. The honourable member for Perth - (Mr . Mann) suggested that the operation of the bounty should be confined to one year, and to that I cannot agree. period of twelve months would not be long enough to enable us to whether the bounty was effective in expanding the sale of our for t i fied wines in Great Britain , and in ensuring to the growers of grapes used for making for t if y in g spirit a fair and sonable price. The honourable gentleman raised the question whether the spirit produced here was of a sufficiently high quality to be used for for t if y in g wine or whether it was merely a neutral spirit which, far from improving the character of the wine in which it was used, probably reduced its standard. I agree with him that, if neutral spirit is being produced, we should see that the quality of our wines is not reduced, but should make every effort to improve it . Clause 9 provides that the bounty shall be paid on fortified wines of good and marketable quality.",25
46,Mr MANN,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,That is vague.,26
47,Mr BEUCE,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"Yes , but it shows that the intention is to export only good wines. Although I do not suggest that under this bill the whole system of the industry w be changed, a certain change is involved, because the Customs Department will alert to see whether wines that are being exported are of the best possible quality, and the Government will be prepared to listen to suggestions for improving our methods of inspection, and the requirements of distillation. There are great differences of opinion on this subject, but the Government has an open mind, and m i l take action if it is convinced that by any tightening up of the regulations reovercoming specting distillation the position can be improved.",26
48,Mr MANN,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"Coul d not wines be carried in cool storage, so that the for t i fication would bo less?",26
49,Mr BRUOE,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"That will have to be considered. The honourable member for South Sydney (Mr E. Eiley) said that the bill would have the effect of giving a bounty to the wineries, and to persons holding large stocks of wine, and would allow them to get r i d of their stocks without the loss which otherwise they might incur. To a great extent I agree with him. I discussed that matter exhaustively with the conference that sat several months ago to consider the position of the grape-growing industry. But The the growers will certainly not benefit from the provisions of this bill if , when the ascertain next season's grapes have to be purchased, wine cellars are heavily stocked, and the wine-makers do not want to purchase the grapes, because they have already enough wines on hand. We have to get out of rea- this country the wines now in stock, and reduce the stocks before next year, otherwise we shall then have exactly the same position as we had this year. As to the payments that were made to the growers last season, it must be remembered that a great quantity of grapes was bought in anticipation of this bounty and because these .proposals were under consideration. Many of those grapes would not have been bought if no such proposals had been outlined. Still, the prices that were paid could not in all cases be considered fair and reasonable. Generally speaking, the price paid was about £ 3 a ton,-but in some cases a higher price was paid by certain firms which stood to their obligations, and treated the growers exceptionally well. Those firms were financially strong, and were able to undertake that ill burden. In some districts substantially under £3 was paid, although that price be was not general. Clause 10 of this bill provides that the Minister may withhold the whole or any par.t of the bounty i finds that a price which in his opinion was less than a reasonable price was paid for doradilla grapes used in the distillation of fortifying spirit contained - in the wine in respect of which bounty is claimed. The Minister has the power to withhold payment of the bounty. Regarding last season, I do not suggest that it is absolutely .certain that an increased price will be paid to - the grower,, hut I .am confident that in many cases the grower will benefit under .that particular provision. We propose to make searching inquiry in the - different districts respecting the prices paid to the growers by the wineries claiming bounty upon their wines. They will have to satisfy the Customs officials that a reasonmight able prico has heen paid, and incases where the bounty is received, further consideration must be given to the growers. No binding assurance can be given that all the growers will benefit; but I have met the 'representative? of the wine industry, and they are all convinced that the bounty will have a tremendous effect upon the industry, aud will increase enormously the overseas market.

50,Mr FENTON,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,Will assistance be given bo the - growers who left grapes on the. vines because it would not pay to pick them?,27
51,Mr BRUCE,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"That situation cannot be - met an any - way. A (bounty .cannot be paid .upon grapes that were left on the vines. Mr FaiN-roN - Thos e .gr.ow.ers are in straitened circumstances, and should receive some assistance. Mr BRiUCE - It is a grave difficulty, but no solution of it can Ibe found. 'We can safeguard the interests ctf those growers for tihe next season. All grapes ate harvested in the various .distaacts «t or about the same time, and the wital thing .to the growers when the period for picking approaches is the - priae sfihat they will .obtain for their grapes. Every on© will know the price paid 4a any particular district. I have not the slightest .doubt that if .wine-makers were not paying a reasonable price in .any district the growers would present their ease ito .the Minister for Trade and f - he Customs .and . draw - attention to' his power under the bill ;to withhold payment of the iboranty if he is .satisfied that >the price paid for the grapes is mot reasonable. EConorable - members cam - rest assured 'that no attempt will be made to 'squeeze the 'growers while the wineries - are receiving the benefit of the bounty. Under - this measure a 'tr-emendous increase will - take place in the consumption of Australian weet wines, resulting in a keener ocmipertition for wine grapes, and - enhancing the price to the grower. 'The only other point is whether the reduction of excise from 6s. to '5s. should apply to spirit genecally, .or 'be confined to spirit produced from .doradilla grapes. In my second-reading speech, I dealt with the - difficulties that arise. It was foreseen by tfhe Government that - with - a lower .excise on spirit distilled from doradilla grapes, growers ""would ""be encouraged to increase their production of that variety. I have already - explained to .the House that effective steps will be taiken to prevent growers - grafting over their vines to doradilla grapes in order to obtain the benefit of - the reduction in excise. Tihe honourable member for Angas Mr. Q-abV) raised a new point which has to be examined very closely. He instanced the case of a winery with its own distillery and owning its own grapes. That winery might, perhaps, be .growing mataro grapes and using them for producing fortifying spirit. Because of the lower excise on wine fortified 'by doradilla spirit, it might purchase its fortifying spirit ancl use the - mataro grapes in the m-a'king of ^wine, to the detriment of the small growers of mataro grapes, whose market - would thus - be reduced. I assure tihe honourable member that - that phase of 'the - subject will be fully considered, and bhat I shall not 'bring in the Excise Bill until I have had a M l opportunity of considering his representations. But at the - moment I do not - think his contention can be upheld. Mataro grapes are used for many purposes, and if the - bounty is ;a success it - must increase the inaa-ket for them. Eiwem if a - winery 'had been using *maitaxo grapes for - distillation pturposes., and changed its policy hy msing thew - for witaei, there would stall .be such an iner.eased an-arket that I ;doutot whether the growers .would he injiU-Eed. .

Storbified spirit made fro m grapes '.usually sold as dried fruits will paa-tttcajpate in the -.bounty equally witih spirit made from doradilla .scrapes. As ithe (bounty is .acceptable . to the wine industry, as many deputations on - the subject have waited upon the 'Prime Minister and the Hiriister 'for 'Trade and - Customs, and - as the Tariff Board has '^thoroughly investigated the circumstances, the ""House should pass the bill.",27
52,Mr ANSTEY,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"Bourke) [2.55] - It is quite true that the amendment has no application, because no excise duty is levied on wine. ""Remarkably conflicting views have heen expressed on the bill. I suppose every -.member of the House desires that legislation ^should 'be enacted to keep men on the lan d rather than to driv.e them off it , but the methods .advocated to attain that en'd are peculiar. I.listened with in terest 'to the honourable member for Perth (Mr M a n n ) . The honourable member for Indi '((Kir. Codk) - said he - knew nothing of the subject, but had confidence *in those who did. That is a very easy way for him to evade his obligations as a public man. It is our duty to see that public money is wisely and properly spent, and we are all agreed that the men whom the State Governments placed on the land, and compelled to engage in this industry, should be assisted to remain there. Erom personal knowledge, I can say that two years ago the distillers offered to give to the growers of doradilla grapes the whole of any amount of excise duty remitted. That would have been a direct subsidy to the growers. The object of the distillers was purely selfish, but I am now looking at it from the point of view, not of the distillers, but of the growers. The distillers wanted to enlarge their business, and to sell their spirits in competition with imported spirits. "" It may be desirable,"" says the Government, "" to assist the growers of doradilla grapes, but we are certainly not going to do it by reducing the excise duty, because that would reduce the imports of spirits, and thus affect customs revenue."" The posal in the bill is to relieve the growers by paying a bounty on exported wines. I have not spoken previously because I had no knowledge of the subject, and was looking for information, but even from those who support the bill information can be obtained only by dragging it out. The growers of doradilla grapes say that they are asking not for payment from the national revenue, but merely for a refund of taxation already paid by them. The grower can produce from 2 to 8 tons per acre of these grapes, according to whether his land is irrigated or not. Assuming the average production to be 5 tons per acre, and that from each ton of grapes 33 gallons of spirit can be produced, it is clear that the production of spirit per acre is, roughly, 165 gallons. This spirit is taxed at the rate of 6s. per gallon, so that every acre brought under cultivation of doradilla grapes carries an excise tax of about £ 5 0 . The growers say that all that they ask us to do is to give thorn a refund in bounty of part of this vnormous taxation upon the acreage which they have been forced, in some cases by the State Governments, to put under cultivation for these grapes.",28
53,Mr MANN,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,The growers do not pay the tax referred to.,29
54,Mr ANSTEY,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"I did not say that they do. I say that that is what they say. That is the basis of their claim. In answer tw the objections of the honourable member for South Sydney (Mr E, Riley), they say, "" We are not proposingthat something should be given us from the national revenue. What we are asking for is merely a refund of moneys we are contributing to the revenue from excise."" They say that an immense tax has been imposed upon the product of their in dustry, and they ask for a refund. The honourable member for Werriwa (Mr . Lazzarini) moves an amendment on the bill, and those interested then say, "" There is no such excise. It does not work out in that way at all. As a matter of fact, what happens is that the wine contains naturally 26 per cent, of spirit, and to bring fortified wine up to 34 per cent, only an additional 8 per cent, of spirit requires to be added, and it is only to this additional 8 per cent, of spirit that the excise duty applies."" They contend that there is nosuch thing as an excise' duty of 6s. per gallon, and that, as the duty is payable only on the 8 per cent, pro- of spirit which has to be added for the fortification of wines, there is, roughly, in 12 gallons of wine only 1 gallon of spirit upon which duty should be paid, and, therefore, the duty levied on each gallon of wine exported from this country is, roughly, only 6d. per gallon. Y e t under this measure the Government proposes to pay a bounty of 4s. per gallon.",29
55,Mr LAZZARINI,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"They are giving the bounty on wine, and not on spirit.",29
56,Mr ANSTEY,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"That is so. The responsibility for what is being done mustrest with the Government. They feel bound to maintain an industry which has expanded largely as a result of their policy.. They must meet the situation. I say that all bounties are a tax upon the public revenue, and they never achieve the end for which they are designed. The honourable member for Wimmera (Mr . Stewart) yesterday pointed out that what is really crippling the primary industries is not the cost of production, but the enormous charges which are made by middlemen. The honourable member for Perth (Mr Mann) has pointed out that by the use of inferior spirit the best wines can be destroyed. I was a member of the Navigation Comniission, and one of the most remarkable things that came out during the investigations of the commission was that, while primary producers were complaining that they were being taxed enormously by high freights charged on the coast, the cost of taking cargo out of one ship and putting it into another is greater than the actual cost of transportation. Whilst it costs £4 10s. per ton to send goods by the Peninsular and Oriental Company's boats from Sydney to London, a distance of 12,000 miles, after the goods have left the ship's slings in London, and before they get into the hands of the actual buyers, another 100 per cent, is added. The honourable member for Wimmera showed that whilst the value of certain products is about £ 5 7 per ton in Great Britain , 60 per cent, of this amount is taken by the various middlemen who handle the product, as commission charges, cost of transportation, warehouse charges, and so on. Although the price obtainable for what he produces is a magnificent one, the man on the land can obtain little or nothing for his labour, because of the deductions which are made by all those through whose hands the product is passed. This is the matter with which the Government must eventually deal. By the proposal under consideration, as pointed out by the honourable member for Perth, we are keeping the producers on the soil for another twelve months or two years, but the whole system must collapse eventually. Government must take responsibility for the methods it proposes. The payment of a subsidy of 4s. per gallon upon the export of wine may give the growers of grapes some temporary relief, but it will uot provide anything like a permanent solution of the difficulty. No proposal to deal with the situation, either at home or abroad, can permanently benefit the actual producers whilst there is a ring to whom they must sell their .products; and they are the victims also of an overseas shipping ring and an overseas set of buyers. Whilst the problem of dealing with these people remains unsolved all bounties on export ai e only a waste of publio money.",29
57,Mr GABB,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"Angas) [ 3 . 8 ] - I must dissociate myself from the amendment which has been moved from this side. have already said that it is my intention to vote for the bill . I approached Government on numerous occasions in connection with this matter, and I should not be playing the game if I did not now support the measure. When discussing the budget recently, I attacked the Government somewhat bitterly for their proposals ' to reduce taxation in different ways. No doubt, it would be popular to support a reduction of the excise duty, but although I know that the vote could not be carried against the Government, I do not think I should support the proposal. I understand that there is a measure to be introduced to provide f o i the reduction of the excise duty on fort if y in g spirit by ls. per gallon. If the amendment were carried, it would destroy the bill. The measure provides for an export bounty to be paid from the excise revenue. It might be said that the revenue for the payment of the bounty might be otherwise obtained, but the Government has made no proposal of that kind. This, I think, is the first instance in which a bounty is proposed to enable us to force our way, into overseas markets. I believe that' the growers in this industry will be benefited by the bill, and I cannot, therefore, support the amendment.",30
58,Mr A GREEN,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"Kalgoorlie) [3.10] I believe that clause 6 of the bill will defeat the object which the Government has in view. It is provided that the bounty shall be payable to the exporter of wine. It is not my province to suggest to the Government in what way the bounty The might be paid to the grower, but I remind honourable members that the principle adopted in this measure is a departure from that which was adopted in the legislation providing for a bounty to the producers of beef. I have no doubt that honourable members generally would supiport the bill if it were clear that the growers of grapes, whom we desire to assist, would benefit under it . There are reasons for doubting whether the distillers will be prepared to do what is fair to the growers. We know what has happened in connection with Australian brandy in the last few years. At the present time, the Customs duty on brandy is 36s. per gallon, and the excise duty 26s. per gallon. This represents a protection in favour of local distillers of 10s. per gallon, or about ls. 8d. per bottle. Previous to the war, a bottle of Australian brandy could I be purchased for 5s. Now the price is anything up to l is . per bottle. Allowthe ing for the e""xtra duty imposed during the war, and adding this to the pre-war price, Australian brandy should now be obtainable at 7s. 2d., instead of l is . per bottle. The extra profit of 3s. lOd. per bottle, is retained by tihe looa-li distillers.. Of. course, we knew, that many people ment, will drink only, imported br.aaidv., but believe-that if the: Australianbrandy were sold at from 7s-. to 7s. 6d. per bottle;, the result would be increased-.sales and' a: reducment.. tion in; the. quantity-' of. bisandyimported-..

IDhe -.tmuible came 'to - a head 'last - season. A short - while ago 4fhe 'growers received - very ihi-gh prices, :and - were in - a satisfactor y - position. A large - quantity of - the that is now stored contains for t if y ing spirit that was 'distilled from - grapes purchased prior to last season. The M in ister for Trade and Customs will have power to require the production of evidence to satisfy him that a reasonable price was paid for the grapes used in the distillation of the fortified spirit. The officers of the department can easily ascertain the prices that were paid in the different districts. It has been suggested that the price paid for last season's crop was so low as to be absolutely unprofitable to the growers. It must be remembered that something like £ 3 a ton was paid throughout; and in view of all the circumstances many of the wine makers had to stretch their own position very considerably to pay even that price. The Minister will determine on the evidence that is placed before him whether a reasonable price has been paid. If it has, he will approve of the payment of the bounty. If it has not he can declare that the bounty shall not be paid. The honourable member for Angas (Mr Gabb) raised a very important point which has a nartioular application to a co-operative distillery, as the final payment to the grower depends upon the price at which the distilled spirit is sold. The bill provides that certain records must be kept, and it can easily be seen whether a reasonable price was paid for spirit purchased from a co-operative factory. In reply to the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr . Lazzarini), I point out that it is not a inatter of the Minister making a few vague inquiries from the purchaser of the spirit or the doradilla grape, and being satisfied with the information furnished. The bill requires certain records to be kept. Under clause 7 every claimant of bounty is obliged to fulfil certain requirements, and under clause 11 he is obliged to keep proper and separate books of account showing in detail(a) The quantity of doradilla grapes purchased by him ; (6) The amount paid to each supplier of the doradilla grapes; (c) The name and address of the supplier ; and (o!) Such other particulars as the Minister from time to time requires. and to make available all books of account for inspection by any person authorized by the Minister. The supplied by the claimant can likewise be verified by the supplier. The position is safeguarded in every way. Clause agreed to Mr Bruce. Clauses 11 to 14 agreed to. Preamble and title agreed to.

This report contains the following statement :Mr O'Keefe- (T.), after examining the position, said that he had come to the conclusion that it was reasonable to assume that some money was due. Of course, that is entirely contrary to what I said. ",33
62,Mr OKEEFE,COMMONWEALTH ARBITRATION,"The interjection by the Minister for Trade and Customs leads me to believe that the Argus has attributed to me the remarks of some other speaker, and, although it may not see fit to make a correction- I hope it doesI shall be satisfied if the correction is o made in Mansard. I do not wish it to go information out to the public that I believe that any money was due by the Commonwealth Government to Bawra. Questiou resolved in the affirmative. Honse adjourned at 3.49 p.m.",33
