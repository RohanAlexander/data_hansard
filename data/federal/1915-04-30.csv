1,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I desire to read a telegram which haB heen received from His Majesty the K in g. It ie dated Buckingham Palace, 29th A p r i l , 1915, and is as follows: I heartily oongratulate you upon the Bplendid conduct and bravery displayed by the Australian troops in the operations at the Dardanelles, who have indeed proved themselves worthy sons of the Empire.",4
2,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,The Assistant Minister of Defence told us yesterday that the Government has resolved to in crease the separation allowance of women whose husbands are at the front. Have Ministers given further consideration to the request thab I made yesterday' that the allowance to widows who have sons at the front on whom they depend may be increased ?,5
3,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"I had a consultation with the Minister of Defence this morning, and am in a position to say tlhat it is the intention of the Department to in crease by 10s. a week the allowance paid to widows with sons at the fron t who are their sole support, thus putting them on the same footing as the wives of soldiers abroad. Dr CART Y SALMON - Has the Government received any report in regard to the physical condition of the troops who have recently been in Egypt, with special reference to the alleged defects in the medical examination of the troops ?",5
4,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"We are continually receiving reports from, those in command at the front. I do not know of any special report such as the honourable member asks for, but I shall make inquiries, and let him know.",5
5,Dr CARTY SALMON,Unknown,"Will the Minister consult the issue of the Argus of the 24th A p r i l , in which a letter purporting to come from a leading medical officer attached to the First Expeditionary Force to a practitioner in Melbourne, saysYou would not believe the number of derelicts who have been passed as medically fit, but who have now to be returned to Australia at the public expense. How such cripples ever passod the medical and riding tests I cannot conceive. I ask the Minister also whether he will not inquire why a leading medical officer who was a member of the First Expeditionary Force should not have communicated with those .who are in authority rather than with a friend in Australia? I further ask how it is that the oensors who are fairly well paid for the services they render, have been so wanting in their duties as to allow such a paragraph to appear In the press in Australia?",5
6,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"I shall be pleased to comply with the request of the honourable member in regard to the lebter which has appeared in the Argus. It is right that GEORGB B . I . any medical man who is at the front should communicate with the Defence Department, seeing that he is in such a responsible position.",5
7,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,"Has the Prime M i nister any information later than that ' which appeared in this morning's newspapers regarding the series of actions in which our troops are or have been engaged in the Dardanelles? If he has not, will he make an effort to obtain that information, Beeing that there is now considerable anxiety in the minds of many persons in Australia ?",5
8,Mr FISHER,Unknown,Our information on the subject is not materially greater than that which has been made available to the public. We have invited the Imperial Government more than once to supply us with all details as soon as they can.,5
9,Mr FOWLER,Unknown,To be made public ?,5
10,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"Yes , as soon as they give permission. Whatever our feelings may be, we must, I take it , stand by what they consider the necessities of the war.",5
11,Mr MASSYGREENE,Unknown,"Can the Assistant Minister inform the House whether, if additional equipment were provided, the recruits offering would enable us to send more troops to the fronfJ than the Government can despatch at the present time?",5
12,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,The Government is despatching every man that the British Government has requested.,5
13,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Is it a fact that the Imperial Government has at any time made any request for the desptch of troops from Australia, and is it the policy of the Government to - despatch only such troorjs as may be requested by the I m perial Government?",5
14,Mr FISHER,Unknown,It is not.,5
15,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,Before troops are despatched from Australia an offer is made to the Imperial authorities. We have now two further brigades undergoing preparation. They have been offered and have been accepted. Sometimes it is two or three weeks after the making of an offer that the Imperial authorities accept it.,5
16,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"The honourable member should have said that Australia has despatched as many troops as the I m perial Government has consented to receive, not as many as it has requested.",6
17,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"During the discussion of the War Precautions Bill last night, the honourable member for Darwin stated that we were creating in this country a military despotism, and in this morning's Age I am reported to have interjected this statementLet me tell you that no Minister of Defence has had anything to do with this Bill. The Age report is entirely incorrect and ridiculous. What I said was that no member of the Militar y Porces had had anything to do with the Bill . , Mr. JOSEPH COOK - I wish to ask the Assistant-Minister of Defence a question arising out of an answer which he furnished to the House yesterday. would not ask these questions but that I am afraid the Minister's answers are giving a wrong impression outside. The Minister said yesterday that the Defence Department were equipping and despatching all the troops required by the I m perial Government. I ask him now if it is not a fact that the Imperial Government will accept any number of troops that we can despatch and send ?",6
18,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"T he right honourable gentleman at least, among honourable members opposite, should know that at the present juncture it is hardly right to submit such a question.",6
19,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I know nothing of the kind.,6
20,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"T he right honourable gentleman was Prime Minister of this Commonwealth, when",6
21,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Order ! The honourable member has already replied and cannot debate the matter.,6
22,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Yesterday the Assistant-Minister of Defence volunteered the statement that 70 per cent, of those who have enlisted in Australia are unionists, and he described his statement as being fairly accurate, whereas the Labour Bulletin, issued on the 15th March, and based on returns received to the 31st January, 1915, shows that of the total enlisted, namely 53,000, there were 23,300 members of unions and 30,600 other persons.  long as they enlist? [103]- a ",6
23,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"I quite agree with the honourable member, and I regret that the return was prepared, but in view of the statement of the Assistant-Minister, I wish to know which figures are correct, those given by Mr Knibbs or those given by the Assistant Minister.",6
24,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,"I think that the Eederal Statistician stated that he had received no returns from the Australian Workers Union, which is the biggest Labour organisation in Australia.",6
25,Mr HANNAN,Unknown,"Is the Assistant Minister of Defence aware of the fact that 12,000 members of the Australian Workers Union, numbers which were not included in the figures quoted by the honourable member for Darling Downs, have volunteered? Also that a number of those who have gone to the front , and I who are not included among those described as members of unions, are men who were employed in positions which did not make them eligible for membership of trade unions?",6
26,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,I can say no more than that I have heard the statement made that a great number of members of the Australian Workers Union have not been included in the Federal Statistician's report. TASMANIAN PRUIT-GROWERS.,6
27,Mr LAIRD SMITH,Unknown,"Seeing that a number of Tasmanian fruit-growers are likely to suffer pecuniary loss through being unable to obtain space for the export of their f r u it , will the Minister of Trade and Customs try to arrange for the provision of such space ?",6
28,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"T he British Government has commandeered the whole of the refrigerated or insulated space on all vessels trading between Great Britain and the Commonwealth, and has appointed me to act as its agent in Australia, and the Dominion Minister of Customs to act as its agent in New Zealand. It has asked that preference shall be given to the transport of meat, as meat is the commodity that it chiefly desires. If there is an opportunity to obtain space anywhere for the export of f r u it or other commodities, honourable members may rest assured that every part of Australia will get the fairest of fair deals from me. POSTMASTER-GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT. ALLOAVANCE POST-OFFICES : COMPTROLLER OF STORES: MAIL CONTRACTORS. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Is Postmaster-General aware that the Department over which he has the honour to preside is now cutting down the payments made to those in charge of allowance post-offices in the back blocks to such an extent that many of these persons are throwing up their positions, necessitating the closing of the post-offices, and causing inconvenience to the people of the district? These offices are being reduced to the state .of the London sweat shops, but there is no similar reduction in regard to city offices. I hope that the Postmaster-General will look into the matter, and will give a Christian answer to my question.",6
29,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,There has been no change in the scale of payment to allowance officers.  one.,7
30,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,Thos e in charge of allowance offices are not being sweated. The Department does not pretend to pay them salaries.  have been promised an increase.,7
31,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"They were given, an increase when the Labour party was last ih power, and there has been no change since.  pence a week!",7
32,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"If the payments to any allowance post officer have been reduced, it is in accordance with the scale, and by reason of a decrease in the business in the office.  Age that the Government intends to appoint a Comptroller of Stores in connection with the Post Office. Is tended to invite applications from those outside the Servioe, as well as from those inside the Service?",7
33,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,Application s are not confined to the Commonwealth Service.,7
34,Mr JOHN THOMSON,Unknown,"Will the Postmaster-General confer with the M in isters of Defence and Home Affairs as to the advisability of consolidating the stores branch of the different Departments, with a view to creating one general stores branch for the whole of the Public Servioe, so that economy and greater efficiency may be attained ? the Mr SPENCE - I have no objection to consulting with the Minister of Defence or the Minister of Home Affairs, but I do not think there would be any advantage gained. Almost all the departmental stores differ.  tion of the Postmaster-General to a letter that I received this morning, on which I desire to base a question. The letter was in reply to a request made by me for furthe r consideration for the mail contractors who had been so badly h it by the high price of fodder. I draw attention to this passage in it The general question of granting relief to mail contractors on account of the drought has already been given careful consideration, but it is not seen how, without inflicting a grave injustice on tenderers, and striking at the fundamental principle of public tendering for mail services, any consideration cnn be shown to contractors by way of increasing their subsidy during the currency of their contract. The contracts are let both in good years and in bad years, and tenderers understand that they must make provision in their tenders to meet the vicissitudes of the weather. The communication adds that the concession offered by the Department is that services may be reduced 50 per cent., with a subsidy of"" 25 per cent. I ask the Postmaster-General whether he is not aware that horses have to be fed, whether they make two trips a week or at r ip a day ? It is impossible, at the - present time, to tur n them out when they are not running. I ask him to again consider the representations that have been made to him on behalf of the mail contractors.",7
35,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"The Department, has entered into over 5,000 mail contracts, many of which are being carried out with motor cars. Since the drought, some of it in the contractors have substituted motor cars for horse-drawn vehicles. Of the contractors who are still using horses, while some have to feed their horses, others are able to obtain grass. All are not in the same position. The problem with which the Department has to deal is a most difficult one. A large number of the contracts were let last December, in the middle of the drought, and the contractors knew the conditions when they tendered. Doubtless their prices were higher than they Would have been under ordinary conditions. The Department does not demand a refund when seasons prove to bp Tinexpectedly good, and it would be an unsound business arrangement to increase subsidies when a bad season was being experienced. To do this would be unfair to those persons who, having calculated the probability of a bad season, had tendered at a higher price than those who succeeded in getting the contract. To increase the subsidies in the manner now proposed would cost an enormous sum of money, and could not be done in the offhand way that seems to be thought possible.",7
36,Mr RODGERS,Unknown,"In view of the disorganized state of the country mail services consequent on the increased price, of fodder, the weakening of horses, and so forth, will the Postmaster-General and his Government take the advance step, where possible, of instituting motor services? In one or two cases where motor services have been established, they are paying propositions. The Department can obtain cheap cars. If they do this, it will be a forward step.",8
37,Mr SPENCE,Unknown,"The honourable member has suggested to the Government a policy in the form of a question, to which, of course, I cannot reply. If we undertake the carrying of mails, we deprive a great many people of a means of livelihood, because, at present, the carrying of passengers is carried on in conjunction with the carrying of mails. I am surprised at the honourable member suggesting this. NAVIGATION ACT.",8
38,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"Some days PATENTS, TRADE MARKS, AND ago I asked the Minister of Trade and Customs a question relating to a statement appearing in the press to the effect that a first time. an attempt had been made to combine two impossible functions in one officer, and he promised that he would go into the matter; has he done so?",8
39,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"The honourable memof ber's question was whether, in connection with the Navigation Department, we were calling for one person to fill the combined positions of examiner of masters and mates, and ship's surveyor. Two adverbeing tisements have appeared; one calling applications for the position of examiner of masters and mates and ship's surveyor, and the other calling for applications for the position of surveyor. The first advertisement called for persons qualified not only to act as examiner of masters and mates, but also to deal with the rigging and safety provisions on ships' decks; that is to say, the person appointed would need to be a surveyor as well as an examiner of masters and mates. The second advertisement applied only to persons qualified to act as surveyors of ships' hulls, boilers, and engines. The advertisements related to separate offices, and not, as stated in the paragraph in the press, to one person combining two impossible positions. INTERNME NT CAMPS.",8
40,Mr KELLY,Unknown,"Will the Assistant Minister of Defence have any objection to informing the House next week as to the location, and capacity of, and the present numbers confined in, German concentration camps in Australia?",8
41,Mr JENSEN,Unknown,I shall endeavour to comply with the honourable member's request. NA CANBERRA .,8
42,Mr FENTON,REMOVA L OF PARLIAMEN T TO,"Seeing that several of the more important works at the Eederal Capital are approaching completion, have the Government arrived at any idea of the time when Parliament will be removed to Canberra?",8
43,Mr EISHER,REMOVA L OF PARLIAMEN T TO,No ; but the sooner we remove to Canberra the better I shall like it. DESIGNS BILL (No. 3). Bill presented by Mr HUGHES and read PRICE OF COMMODITIES.,8
44,Dr MALONEY,REMOVA L OF PARLIAMEN T TO,"In view of the figures supplied by Mr Knibbs on the 15th this month, which I take it were accurate, but which gave the price of rump steak as 9j?d._ in Melbourne, when I know that it is being sold at Is., and butter at Is. 7d. per lb. when I know that it is sold at 2s. per lb., will the Minisfor ter of Home Affairs next week give us up-to-date figures as to the price at which these commodities are being sold in Sydney and Melbourne?",8
45,Mr ARCHIBALD,REMOVA L OF PARLIAMEN T TO,I am not in a position to say whether the figures can be obtained before Wednesday.,9
46,Mr RODGERS,REMOVA L OF PARLIAMEN T TO,Were the supplied wholesale or retail prices ?,9
47,Mr ARCHIBALD,REMOVA L OF PARLIAMEN T TO,"I should say that they were average prices. Prices vary in all cities, depending very greatly on whether the dealer is paid in cash or whetlier he has to wait three or six months for his money. INTER - STA TE COMMISSION .  that the present Government was recently returned to power to carry out a Protectionist mandate, would the Minister of Trade and Customs be going too far out of his way in intimating to the gentlemen on the Inter-State Commission that the House and the Government expect from them a statement somewhat in accordance with the real evidence that has been submitted to the Commission, and not a report that has evidently been dictated by their own Free-trade proclivities?",9
48,Mr TUDOR,REMOVA L OF PARLIAMEN T TO,"I have every confidence in the Inter-State Commission. furnished a preliminary report which I believe is in accordance with the views of the gentlemen comprising the Commission, though it may not be in accordance with the views of honourable members of the House.  in accordance with the evidence.",9
49,Mr TUDOR,REMOVA L OF PARLIAMEN T TO,"I understand that only certain of the evidence is published, and that the Commission obtained evidence confidentially. It is quite possible that some of the decisions may have been based on that evidence. I suggest that it would be advisable to await some of the Commission's detailed reports.  we have to wait ?",9
50,Mr TUDOR,REMOVA L OF PARLIAMEN T TO,I cannot say. RIFLE CLUBS.,9
51,Mr ORCHARD,REMOVA L OF PARLIAMEN T TO,Is the Assistant Minister of Defence aware that a very serious check to the rifle club movement in New South Wales is being experienced owing to the shortage of rifles? Will he inform the House as to when we are likely to have sufficient rifles for the members of this very important section of our Defence Forces ?,9
52,Mr JENSEN,REMOVA L OF PARLIAMEN T TO,I am not willing to answer the honourable member's question. He may put it on the notice-paper if he figures you wishes. EXPO RT OF COAL.,9
53,Mr CHARLTON,REMOVA L OF PARLIAMEN T TO,"Is the Minister of Trade and Customs aware that in consequence of the regulations that were found necessary at the outbreak of war, governing the export of coal to foreign parts, a very large number of men are now out of employment? Seeing that the Pacific is clear of the foe, can anything be done to give relief in that direction?",9
54,Mr TUDOR,REMOVA L OF PARLIAMEN T TO,"T he Customs Department is only acting for the Defence Department in the matter, but I shall make representations to the proper authorities, and if the Defence Department see their way clear to have the embargo removed, I shall be delighted to have it done. FODDER IN NEW SOUTH WALES.",9
55,Mr CHANTER,REMOVA L OF PARLIAMEN T TO,H as the attention of the Postmaster-General been directed It has to a paragraph in this morning's paper in which it is stated that the New South Wales Government intend to acquire all the fodder in that State? Is he also aware that the past policy of the New South Wales Government has been to supply farmers only with seed for the not purpose of putting in wheat? Will he get into communication with the New South Wales Government and ask that fodder should also be supplied to mai l contractors on reasonable terms and on a deferred system of payment?,9
56,Mr SPENCE,REMOVA L OF PARLIAMEN T TO,I have not seen the paragraph. I may take some action when it is brought under my notice. OLD-AGE PENSIONS .,9
57,Mr BRENNAN,REMOVA L OF PARLIAMEN T TO,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister when I may expect a reply to the representations I made to him some time ago to the effect that the Commissioner for Old-age Pensions sets himself up as a censor of public morals in assessing what he considers to be the claims of pensioners. The applications of claimants have been refused on the ground that their past l if e has not been in. conformity with the moral standard set up by the Commissioner for Old-age Pensions. """,9
58,Mr FISHEE,REMOVA L OF PARLIAMEN T TO,I do not remember the question being submitted before.,10
59,Mr BRENNAN,REMOVA L OF PARLIAMEN T TO,On l y by letter.,10
60,Mr FISHEE,REMOVA L OF PARLIAMEN T TO,"I have heard nothing of it . The Government specifically states that under certain conditions, which the honourable member may consider are moral conditions, pensions may not be granted. That is statutory, and therefore it is the duty of officers to so report and so carry out the Act. If any injustice has arisen I shall be very glad of particulars; but it is my duty to protect the chief officers of my own Department and of other Departments against insinuations that they are merely censors, when they are engaged in carrying out their duties under the statutory authority of Parliament. Mr BRENNAN ' - Will the Prime Minister, when the opportunity offers, and as soon as he has time, afford me a reply to comniunications in which I gave definite and detailed information in regard to the matter of old-age pensions, and in respect of which I have made complaints respecting the Commissioner's attitude?",10
61,Mr FISHER,REMOVA L OF PARLIAMEN T TO,"I will give it to the honourable member tomorrow, if not today. TURKIN CENSOR'S OFFICE .  ago I directed the Prime Minister's attention to the fact that a secretary of the Young Turks Association was employed in the Censor's office in Adelaide. Has the Prime Minister made any inquiries as to that statement? What has been done in the matter?",10
62,Mr FISHER,REMOVA L OF PARLIAMEN T TO,"I remember the question. I mentioned it to the Minister of Defence, and shall furnish the honourable member with advice as soon as possible. NA  the Prime Minister if he will be good enough to take into consideration the desirability of having a Drought Bill prepared with the object of giving relief to taxpayers residing within the drought area. Will he be good enough to ask the Federal Land Tax Commissioner to deal leniently with those people?",10
63,Mr FISHER,TAX COLLECTION IN DROUGHT,"When we amended the Act last year we extended the powers of the Commissioner in that direction, and I have every reason to believe that he is giving full consideration to the scope of that new provision. AUSTRALIAN NOTES PAPER .",10
64,Mr WEST,TAX COLLECTION IN DROUGHT,In this morning's press there appears the statement by an expert giving evidence in the Crown prosecution in connection with the notes trouble that Commonwealth bank notes are printed on paper of a poor quality. Will the Prime Minister make inquiries and see if that is the fact or not?,10
65,Mr FISHER,TAX COLLECTION IN DROUGHT,"There was a time quite recently when we found it extremely difficult to get the very best paper. The circumstances are being guarded against as efficiently as possible. NA ELECTION. Sir JOHN FORREST asked the M in ister of Home Affairs, upon notice I. Has be received, and, if so, will he place on the table of the House, the report by the Commonwealth Chief Electoral Officer on the last general election, on 5th September, 1914? 2. Has the examination of the voting disclosed any duplicate voting, or any impersonation, in any subdivisions, and, if so, in which subdivisions, and to what extent? 3. Have any other breaches of the law of an important nature been discovered ? * Mr ARCHIBALD - The answer to the honourable member's questions is1 and 2. The Chief Electoral Officer has submitted(a) a detailed report as to the voting at the elections held on the 5th September, 1914; (b) a report as to the number of cases in which the names of individual electors were marked more than once on the certified lists of voters used at the polling. The first-mentioned report has already been tabled, and I now have pleasure in tabling the AREAS. second report. Whilst the examination of the voting discloses that 3,405 names in a total of 2,042,336 electors to whom ballot-papers were issued (.167 per cent.) were marked more than once at the polling, it may not be inferred that the persons concerned voted more than once, or were impersonated. Experience shows that it is impracticable to avoid a small percentage of clerical errors in marking the rolls at the polling. 3.

Six-the e the results of accidents, one heart failure, one heart failure and measles, one broncho-pneumonia. 2. The figures for yesterday, 29th April, were as follow :-7 5 convalescent men who are on country leave; 64 men in camp hospitals or in other hospitals in and around Melbourne; 32 men in the Measles Hospital. There were, approximately, about 10,000 troops in camp. 3. There are seven hospital tents, and each will hold about ten men. These tents have been properly equipped, and there is adequate medical attendance. There are no trained nurses (female), but there are trained men acting as nurses. Six hospital huts have now just been completed, two of which are for isolation purposes. These huts will take the place of the hospital tents. Any serious case of illness is sent to the Base Hospital in St. Kilda-road, where trained female nurses are employed. NA",12
72,Mr GREGORY,CRIMINALPROSECUTION OP,"the At to r n e y General, upon notice I. Was he correctly reported in the Argus of 26th April, wherein he is reported as having stated that- "" It was not so very long ago, historically speaking, since it was a crime to be a unionist. There were unionists transported to Australia-respectabl e men-wh o had not committed any offence, bnt because»they had chosen to become members of a union "" ? 2. If correctly reported, will he inform the House when and where any person has been transported because he had chosen to become a member of a union?",12
73,Mr HUGHES,CRIMINALPROSECUTION OP,"The replies to the honourable member's questions are1. The quotation is substantially correct, so far as it goes. 2. The English Court records covering the last quarter of the 18th century and the first quarter of the 19th century disclose thousands of cases of persons Who were fined, imprisoned, and, in many cases, transported, because they had exercised what they conceived to be their rights as free men to combine with their fellow-workmen in order to obtain decent wages and conditions. I refer the honourable member to one typical case cited by the honourable member for Barrier, who is reported in Hansard, Vol. LXX., page 752, as follows:I have here a pamphlet which gives an account of the arrest and t r i a l of six men simply because they proposed to form a trade union to improve the lot of their fellow-workers. They were agricultural labourers, and were anxious to obtain a living wage for those employed on the farms of England. They had been receiving 7s. per week, and when they were told that this rate was to be reduced to 6s. per week, they formed an association with the object of securing a wage of 10s. per week. In opposition to their scheme, placards were distributed throughout the agricultural areas of England setting forth that any one who joined the union would be sentenced to seven years' transportation. In the words of this pamphlet""This was no idle threat; within three days of the publication of the notice George Loveless and five other labourers were arrested and lodged in Dorchester gaol.""

82,Mr HUGHES,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PREFERENCE,"West Sydney-At torney-General) [11.20] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. This Bill is to amend the Judiciary Act in order to give the High Court original jurisdiction in matters arising out of offences againstl the laws of the Commonwealth, and to enable the Court to deal to re- with such offences directly without any preliminary. commitment. Under section 75 of the Constitution the High Court has original jurisdiction in all matters(i) Arising under any treaty; (ii) Affecting consuls or other representatives of other countries; (iii) In which the Commonwealth, or a person suing, or being sued, on behalf of the Commonwealth, is a party; (iv) Between States, or between residents of different States, or between a State and a resident of another State; (v) In which a writ of mandamus or prohibition, or an injunction is sought against an officer of the Commonwealth. And under section 76The Parliament may make laws conferring original jurisdiction on the High Court in any PAPERS. matter(i) Arising under this Constitution or involving its interpretation; (ii) Arising under any laws made by the ' Parliament; (iii) Of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; or (iv) Relating to the same subject-matter claimed under the laws of different States. By section 3 of the original Judiciary Act 1903, the Parliament conferred on the High Court original jurisdiction in matters arising under the Constitution or involving its interpretation; and by the amending Judiciary Act passed last year, in all matters of Admiralt y and maritime jurisdiction. The present measure gives the Court original jurisdiction trials of indictable offences against the laws of the Commonwealth. There is a broad, general reason for the passage of this measure. It is, first of all, an eminently desirable thing that the Federal Court should have jurisdiction to deal witli offences against Federal laws; and, secondly, it is very desirable that the power possessed by the Attorneys-General of most of the States to submit cases direct to the Court without any preliminary commitment, should be vested in the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth also. In South Australia that power is conferred by the Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1876, section 334; in Western Australia by the Criminal Code 1913, No. 28, section 579; in Queensland by the Criminal Code 1899, section 5 6 1 ; in Tasmania by 19 Victoria, No. 9, section 4 ; and in Victoria by the Crimes Act 1890, section 386. By those Statutes the Attorneys-General of those States are enabled to do what it is proposed to empower the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth to do under clause 3 of this Bill . By clause 4, section 72 of the principal A ct is to be amended in such a way as to prevent a conflict of jurisdiction and prolongation of procedure. As the section stands at present it would be possible for a person tried in the High Court to require that Court to reserve a question of law for the F u ll Court of the State or the F u ll Court of the High Court. This clause amends the law so that it will be possible to reserve such a point for the F u l l Court of the High Court only. It is proposed to amend clause 4 by striking out of the last line the words "" the Supreme,"" and inserting in lieu the word "" a , "" so that the last line in the Bill will read "" if the t r i al was had in a Court of a State."" The-reason for the alteration is thab in some States indictable offences can be tried in other State Courts than the Supreme Court, for example, in a Court of Quarter Sessions. I do not wish to labour this matter. The measure that stands next on the notice-paper must be regarded as complementary to, and consequential upon, this Bill , and I ask my learned friends to look at the Bill in that light, so that we shall not be traversing the same ground twice. As this is a measure which does not appeal to members generally, but only to those learned in the law, and deals with matters quite"" familiar to the learned members for in Angas and Darling Downs, I will confine myself to the reasons I have advanced in support of the Bill , and without further remark move the second reading.",13
83,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PREFERENCE,"Parramatta) [11.29] - I propose to offer no objection to the passage of this and another related Bill, but what is running in my mind is this: I understand that the Attorney-General desires to have these proposals carried into effect because of something connected with the war-that they are in reality war precautionary measures. If that be so, why not limit the whole of this jurisdiction to the duration of the war 1",14
84,Mr HUGHES,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PREFERENCE,But this measure ought in any case to be passed; original jurisdiction ought to be given to the High Court in this regard.,14
85,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PREFERENCE,"I understand that there is much difference of opinion as to that, even amongst legal authorities. The outstanding fact remains that it is proposed to set aside some of the ordinary privileges which have hitherto been exercised by persons indicted.",14
86,Mr HUGHES,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PREFERENCE,What we are proposing to do is to remit these matters to the High Court instead of to the State Courts.,14
87,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PREFERENCE,"I know; but would it not be wise to arrange that this legislation may be reviewed at the end of the war, retaining such portions as may prove themselves to be advantageous, and omitting others?",14
88,Mr HUGHES,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PREFERENCE,"If the honourable gentleman will look at section 76 of the Constitution he will see what this Parliament is empowered to do, and this Bill represents one of the powers.",14
89,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PREFERENCE,"I looked at the section this morning, but it does uot follow that because the power is given we should, therefore, pass Statutes for any purpose that may not be immediately and also ultimately desirable. The Bill is, of course, a grant of power; and I am not disputing the right of the AttornevGeneral to introduce the legislation, but merely discussing its expediency and wisdom. While I have nothing to say &3 to any measures the Government - mav deem it right to pass in order to equip themselves with reserves of power is connection with matters arising out of the war, I think it would be wiser, on the whole, to insert a clause providing for the reconsideration of all such measures when the war is over. If that were done we might very well pass all the proposals, on the statement of the Attorney-General that they are necessary to the Government during the war.",14
90,Mr HUGHES,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PREFERENCE,"Whil e I certainly do not see any reason for any fear as to the use of this measure at any time, still, if the honourable gentleman's legal advisers say that there is any danger, I shall do as he suggests.",15
91,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PREFERENCE,"There may not be any danger, but I remind the honourable member that while these powers have been given to the States, I understand that they are rarely exercised-that they are exercised only in exceptional cases.",15
92,Mr HUGHES,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PREFERENCE,And why should it be otherwise with the Commonwealth ?,15
93,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PREFERENCE,"Exactly ; but is it not evident that such measures are a severe limitation of the rights of l it i gants, a limitation which ought to be resorted to only in exceptional circumstances.",15
94,Mr HUGHES,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PREFERENCE,"The Bill will not at all affect litigants, having solely to do with offences. It will not affect the rights of parties in civil cases.",15
95,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PREFERENCE,"It is only my lack of legal knowledge that causes me to use the word "" l it i g a n t s "" ; I mean, of course, the whole of the people interested.",15
96,Mr HUGHES,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PREFERENCE,"Tria l by jury is insured by the Constitution, and every man concerned must have it . An accused person under the Bill will have the best Judges in Australia, men whom we trust and put in high places. How, or by what right, could a defendant object? Mir. JOSEPH COOK - All I know is that we are discovering in some of the Bills that have been passed provisions that are not without danger; and the proper course is to l i m it their operation to the period of the war. That has been done in other cases, and why not in this ?",15
97,Mr HUGHES,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PREFERENCE,This Bill is in a category altogether different from that of the War Precautions Bill ; this is an ordinary amendment of the civil law.,15
98,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PREFERENCE,I know it is.,15
99,Mr HUGHES,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PREFERENCE,"However , in order toshorten the discussion, I shall insert a clause, as the honourable member desires, limiting the operation of the Bill to theduration of the war, and for six monthsthereafter.",15
100,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PREFERENCE,That means that the Attorney-General will propose to insert a clause similar to that inserted in the other Bill?,15
101,Mr HUGHES,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PREFERENCE,"Yes ; and that will give Parliament an opportunity, if desired, to review the matter.",15
102,Mr JOSEPH COOK,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PREFERENCE,"On that understanding, I shall say no more concerning the measure. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee: Clause 1 (Short title and citation). Amendment (by - Mr HUGHES) proposed - That the following words he added to the clause :- "" (4) This Act shall remain in operation during the present war and for six months thereafter, and no longer.""",15
103,Mr GLYNN,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PREFERENCE,"Angas) [11.37] - I suggest that the Attorney-General may possibly have to consider some measure of the sort, even after the war; and it would be just as well to look closely into what has been done in the Old Country d u r i ng the last ten or fifteen years. Eor instance, I understand that, in the legislation at Home, there are special provisions in re* gardto examinations by the Crown Prosecutor, and that, to some extent, is similar ground to that covered by the Bill .",15
104,Mr HUGHES,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PREFERENCE,"Ver y well. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 2 agreed to. Clause 3 (T r i a l of indictable offence without preliminary examination).",15
105,Mr GROO M,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PREFERENCE,"Darlin g Downs) [11.38] - Is the power to be exercised by the Attorney-General only, or may it be exercised by those persons whom he has authorized to act on his behalf under section 69 of the Judiciary Act, which providesIndictable offences against the laws of the Commonwealth shall be prosecuted by indictment in the name of the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth, or of such other person as the Governor General appoints in that behalf. I understand that the Crown Law officers are already authorized to act on behalf of the Attorney-General in ordinary criminal jurisdiction, and I desire to know - whether those officers will , under the Bill , have power to prosecute, or whether that power will be confined to the Attorney-General ?",15
106,Mr HUGHES,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PREFERENCE,"West Sydney) [11.39]. - The power under this clause will be - exercisable only by the Attorney-General - of the Commonwealth. It is not proposed to delegate it . Clause agreed to. Clause 4Section 72 of the principal Act is amended 'by inserting in sub-section (1), after the words ""High Court or,"" the words "" if the trial was had in the Supreme Court of a State."" Sub-section proposed to be amendedWhen any person is indicted for an indictable offence against the laws of the Commonwealth, the Court before which he is triad shall, on the application by or on behalf of the accused person made before verdict, and may in its discretion, either before or after judgment without such application, reserue any question of law which arises on the trial for the consideration of a Full Court of the High Court, or of a Full Court of the Suprema Court of the State.

107,Mr GROOM,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PREFERENCE,Darling Downs) [11.41]. - I understand that this clause is in tended to give the right of appeal only on questions of law.

108,Mr HUGHES,RETURNED SOLDIERS AND PREFERENCE,"I have not. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Title agreed to. Bill reported with amendments. Standing Orders suspended. Report adopted, and Bill read a third time. NA SECOND READING .",16
109,Mr HUGHES,HIGH COURT PROCEDURE,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [11.43] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. As I have already explained to the House, this Bill is complementary to the amending Judiciary Bill just dealt with, providing the necessary machinery for giving effect to the latter. Without this Procedure Bill it would be impossible for cases to be tried in the H i gh Court, there being no machinery in regard to the qualification of jurors, the preparation of the jury panel, and so on. Hitherto the H i gh Court has had no jurisdiction to try in dictable offences; and, of course, there is no provision in the High Court Procedure Act for such trials. In regard to civil cases, section 12 of the Act providesIn every suit in the High Court, unless the Court or a Justice otherwise orders, the trial shall be by a Justice without a jury. But section 18 of the Constitution requires that indictable offences shall be tried before a j u r y ; and, therefore, this Bill is necessary to give effect to the Judiciary Bill , and to the guarantee in the Constitution that in the case of indictable offences there shall be a jury . _ I propose, of course, to insert a provision similar to that just inserted in the Judiciary Bill , limiting the duration of the measure. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee: Clause 11. This Act may be cited as the Defence Act 1915 Amendment (by Mr HUGHES) agreed toThat the following new sub-clause be added : - "" (3) This Act shall remain in operation during the present war, and for six months thereafter, and no longer.""

DEFENCEBILL (No. 2). SECOND READING.",16
110,Mr JENSEN,HIGH COURT PROCEDURE,"Bass-Assistant M in ister) [11.48] - I move That this Bill be now read a second time. The principal object of this Bill is to give statutory authority to certain Acts of the Government of the Commonwealth since the commencement of the war. It contains no important principles. Its object is really to fill up gaps that have been discovered, the most important of these being the fixing of the application of the Army Act. Under section 55 of the principal Act, when Defence Forces of the Commonwealth are called out for active service the Army Act applies, but the application of that Act is somewhat vague. It is desired to make it more definite and to put it beyond doubt'that it applies both within and without the limits of the Commonwealth. An amendment of the existing law in that respect is therefore embodied in this Bill. At the beginning of this session, we passed an Amending Defence Bill, which was designed to legalize the raising of Expeditionary Forces. At the outbreak of"" the war the then Government took the necessary action to raise those Forces, but there was really no complete authority in the Defence Act for that action, and an Amending Bill was therefore introduced to legalize it. Unfortunately that Bill, which was introduced at the beginning of the session, was not dated back to the commencement of the war, and therefore it became operative only as from the date on which it was assented to, which was subsequent to the raising of the Expeditionary Force despatched to New Guinea. It is desirable that we should bring these actions of our predecessors within the scope of the law, and this Bill will have that effect. Then again, under the law as it stands, no power is given to surveyors in the Department to enter upon private property to carry out certain necessary surveys.",16
111,Mr GROOM,HIGH COURT PROCEDURE,Does the Minister refer to surveys for acquisition purposes?,17
112,Mr JENSEN,HIGH COURT PROCEDURE,"Not altogether. is sometimes necessary for our surveyors to enter upon private property in the neighbourhood of defended ports in order to put in certain pegs that will enable our Forces to know exactly the radius within which they have to operate. Some trouble has arisen with regard to this matter, and in certain cases pegs so put in have been disturbed. ""We now desire that the Defence Department shall have statutory authority for such action. Since the commencement of the war the Dethrown partment has found it necessary, as an act of justice, to adopt a certain course, although it was doubtful whether we had the legal right to do so. For instance, as I mentioned in this House a few days ago, certain men enlisted for active service under assumed names, and stated they were unmarried. After their departure for the front, however, it was discovered that they were married, and the Department has assumed the responsibility of paying for the maintenance of their wives and children a portion of the money due to them. It is contended that under the law as it stands, these men, if they returned tomorrow, could claim a refund of the money so paid unless the authority for which we ask in this Bill be given to us.",17
113,Mr WEST,HIGH COURT PROCEDURE,Did they not make sworn declarations'?,17
114,Mr JENSEN,HIGH COURT PROCEDURE,"They made declarations, but on ascertaining the true facts, the Department allotted to their wives and children, whom they left behind, a proportion of their pay. We seek under this Bill authority for the action thus taken.",17
115,Mr GROOM,HIGH COURT PROCEDURE,Is the Bill made retrospective in this respect?,17
116,Mr JENSEN,HIGH COURT PROCEDURE,"Yes ; the clause dealing with the matter dates back to 1st August. That was some three days before the declaration of war, but even then the late Government doubtless had a good idea that war would be declared, because of circumstances: of which they knew. I do not think any one will object to the action we have taken in regard to these women and children. I regret to say that a good many cases of the kind have been discovered. Another matter with which this Bill deals, relates to fines inflicted on employers for dismissing employees It because of their attendance at drills as required by law. Under the law as it stands, if it be proved that a member of the Citizen Forces is dismissed from his employment because of attending drill or a camp of instruction that he is commanded' to attend, then the employer may be fined, and the fine so inflicted is paid into the consolidated revenue. The Government consider that where it is proved-and it has been proved in many cases-that a citizen soldier has been out of work owing to the action of his employer in dismissing him because of the service thus rendered by him to his country, the line imposed by the Court should be paid to the soldier who has suffered. The clause dealing with this matter provides tliatTlie Court may direct that the whole or any part of any penalty recovered from an employer for penalizing or prejudicing in his employment or attempting to penalize or prejudice in his employment any employee"" for rendering or being liable to render the personal service required of him or for attending a camp of instruction as aforesaid may be paid to the employee. Many men have been thrown out of employment by unscrupulous employers who have objected to their attending d r ill as required by law.",17
117,Mr GLYNN,HIGH COURT PROCEDURE,"The danger is in giving this power to the Court. The Court could not know what might occur within a fortnight. The power should be vested in the Minister, who would be in a better position 'to know all the facts. this clause the Government are proposing to pay a man compensation before any loss is proved.",18
118,Mr JENSEN,HIGH COURT PROCEDURE,"Where it can be shown to the Court that a citizen soldier has suffered-that he has been thrown out of work-becaus e of the action of his employer in dismissing him for attending d r ill , then the Government think he should receive the fine imposed.",18
119,Mr GROOM,HIGH COURT PROCEDURE,".Shoul d it not be regarded as compensation for actually proved loss? If a man is injured he should receive compensation, but here power is given the Court to grant compensation by way of penalizing the offender.",18
120,Mr JENSEN,HIGH COURT PROCEDURE,"The matter will be within the discretion of the Court, which may direct that the whole or any part of the penalty shall be paid to the person injured. I do not think that there can be any opposition to .this Bill . We endorse the action of our predecessors, and commend them for it . We should have done just what they did had we been in power, and we feel sure that they would have similarly honoured our obligations.",18
121,Mr JOSEPH COOK,HIGH COURT PROCEDURE,"Parramatta) [12.2] - There is no opposition to the Bill , which is largely a validating measure. It validates among other acts some done by myself. It adds another technical arm to the Defence Porce, and makes further detailed provisions which, T think, on the whole are wise. time authorities cannot stop to consider whether a necessary action is legal; it must be done at once. That was what we felt when war broke out. During the six weeks that we were in office, we did many things that were not strictly in accordance with the law, nor consonant with the expression of fine sentiment of which we have heard so much lately When war breaks out there is no timeto theorize. The duty of the authorities is to make the country safe, so far as they are able to do so, leaving all political and social obligations to be dealt with afterwards. It - is an old maxim that the safety of the State is the highest law. The Bill validates any informalities and illegalities that may have occurred during the trying period to which I refer. As to the compensation of employees who are unjustly dismissed from their employment for attending d r ill , I am inclined to think Under that the matter is best l e ft to a Court. It is better that a magistrate should determine what compensation shall be paid than that a Minister, Labour or Liberal, whose decisions in many cases would be looked upon by the public as influenced by political or personal considerations,should have the matter l e ft in his hands. Employers who prevent their assistants fro m undergoing training should be severely punished, but the Court must act at its discretion, according to the circumstances. There are cases in which the employer is not wholly to blame.",18
122,Mr GLYNN,HIGH COURT PROCEDURE,"Angas) [12.7] - The provision in clause 7, that the Court may direct that the whole or any part of any penalty recovered from an employer for penalizing an employee for attending training is related to a provision that is already law, which enables the Court to impose penalties for this offence. I would poiat out, however, that an employee may not be injured in any way by an attempt to penalize him or prejudice him in his employment. Yet, notwithstanding, the Court is empowered to direct that the whole or any part of the penalty recovered from his employer may be paid to him.. I think that the clause should be drafted to meet the case in which iii is proved that the employee has been penalized or injured, so that the magistrate may then assess reasonable compensation, and direct that it shall be paid out of the penalty recovered from the employer. In war To my mind, as the clause is drafted, a wider power is given than is intended to be given. Section 55 of the principal Act is to be amended by making it apply to troops on active service, whether within or without the limits of the Commonwealth. If I am not mistaken, the Imperial A r m y Ac t of 1881 applies to our troops when they are outside the limits of the Commonwealth only if there is a provision in our local legislation to permit it to do so, or if those troops are serving with Imperial troops. The amendment to which I refer is intended to give the A r m y Act application, whether our troops serving abroad are with the I m perial troops or not, and whether they are within or without the Commonwealth. It is an amendment that is clearly necessary.",18
123,Mr GROOM,HIGH COURT PROCEDURE,"Darling Downs) [12.9]. - I understand that Imperial reservists domiciled in Australia are being paid by the Department the difference between the Imperial rates of pay and the Australian rates of pay, but, unfortunately, this practice is not being adopted with regard to Imperial reserve officers. This seems to me exceedingly unjust. The reason that the men receive the same rates of pay as the men of the Australian Forces is that they have become citizens of Australia, and have entered into our - national life, so far as their Imperial obligations will permit, and that consequently they ought to be treated as Australians are treated. The same reasoning will apply to Imperial reserve officers. I know of a case of a second lieutenant who has taken up land in Australia, and has n ; curred obligations in connection with it , but who, now that he has been called away to the front, is being paid only the Imperial rate of pay, although the rank and file of the Imperial reservists receive the Australian rate of pay.",19
124,Mr JENSEN,HIGH COURT PROCEDURE,I shall bring the matter under the notice of the Minister.,19
125,Mr GROOM,HIGH COURT PROCEDURE,"There cannot be many of these cases, but if there were only one, the injustice should be removed.",19
126,Mr WEST,HIGH COURT PROCEDURE,What condition is imposed handed justice. in connection with Imperial reserviststhat they must have resided twelve months in Australia?,19
127,Mr GROOM,HIGH COURT PROCEDURE,I should think all that should be required would be that they are domiciled or settled in Australia.,19
128,Mr WEST,HIGH COURT PROCEDURE,What is meant by domiciled?,19
129,Mr GROOM,HIGH COURT PROCEDURE,A man who showed an intention to make his home permanently in Australia would be regarded as domiciled here. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee: Clauses 1 to 3 agreed to. Clause 4 (Amendment of section 55).,19
130,Mr WEST,HIGH COURT PROCEDURE,"East Sydney) [12.13] - I have no objection to the Bill , but I draw attention to the fact that it involves retrospective legislation. I cannot see how that can be avoided in this case, however repugnant it may be to our sense of rightin ordinary circumstances. Parliament must always be careful how it sanctions legislation of this kind. In this instance we are compelled to pass such legislation. Clause agreed to. Clauses 5 and 6 agreed to. Clause 7 (Penalizing employee for rendering service).",19
131,Mr FENTON,HIGH COURT PROCEDURE,"Maribyrnong) [12.14]. - I understand that the Minister of Defence has power to take action in the case of men who have gone from the country under an assumed name, leaving the Department in ignorance of the fact that they had wives or wives and families dependent on them, and without making provision through the Department for the maintenance of their dependants. This clause, however, deals with the question of an employer who may subject an employee to certain disabilities by discharging him from employment. This employer can be brought before a Court and penalized, and portion or all of the penalty inflicted may be diverted to the employee who has suffered the in j u r y. I am concerned as to the constitution of the Courts. I may be a littl e prejudiced in the matter, but it may happen that all the ordinary justices on the bench may be employers, though I do not go so far as to say that this fact would in terfere with the dispensation of evenSo long as I have the assurance that these cases will be brought before stipendiary magistrates, or before Courts where stipendiary magistrates will be on the bench, I have no objection to the clause.",19
132,Mr JENSEN,HIGH COURT PROCEDURE,"As a rule, these cases are dealt with before stipendiary magistrates.",19
133,Mr GROOM,HIGH COURT PROCEDURE,"Darling Downs) [12.17]. - Accordin g to the Judiciary Act the Federal jurisdiction of a Court of Summary Jurisdiction of a State shall not be judicially exercised except by a stipendiary, or police, or special magistrate, or some magistrate of the State who is specially authorized by the Governor General to exercise such jurisdiction. That covers the point raised by the honourable member. We certainly agree that if an employer has caused loss to an employee the latter should be compensated, but the Minister should take note of the plea submitted by the honourable member for Angas that where there is no proof of loss to the employee nothing should be awarded to the latter. At present the penalty goes to the Consolidated Revenue. It is now proposed to divert whole or part of it to the employees suffering in j u r y, but that should only take place when the employee has proved that he has sustained injury .",20
134,Mr JENSEN,HIGH COURT PROCEDURE,The Court will make no award unless that fact is proved.,20
135,Mr GROOM,HIGH COURT PROCEDURE,The danger in the provision is that the matter is left to the discretion of the Court.

The latest information should be posted here, and so made available to honourable members. Constituents who have relatives at the front often ring me up here, and at my own home, to ascertain if there is news of them. It would alleviate their fears to know that their friends had not met with disaster in battle, and even to know the worse would be better than to remain in suspense.

The suggestion of the honourable member for Maribyrnong that news of a special character should be posted in this building' is a good one. It frequently happens, however, that the press cablegrams anticipate the official communication. Anything that is news should be posted for the convenience of honourable members. I do not think that it is necessary to adjourn over next week, as the House has the Estimates to finish, and the Tariff is awaiting consideration. There is no news to give in regard to the Expeditionary Forces. Question, resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 4.38 p.m.",21
