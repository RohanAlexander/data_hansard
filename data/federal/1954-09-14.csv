1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Archie Cameron) took the chair at 2.30 p.m., and read prayers. INDUSTRIAL ARBITRATION.",12
2,Dr EVATT,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister a question concerning the application of the Australian Council of Trades Unions and four State governments to the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration for marginal increases for workers under federal awards. Does the Government intend to intervene in this case? Does the Government intend to support the case for the adjustment of margins, having regard to increases in the cost of living? If the Government does not intend to support the application, what attitude does it pose to take?",12
3,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,The Government proposes to intervene in the hearing of the main case before the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. The view that the Government will put to the court will be made clear at that time. PAPUA AND NEW GUINEA.,12
4,Mr BIAWORTH,Unknown,"Will the Minister for Territories inform the House whether it is true that selected natives from New Guinea have been sent to centres in Australia in order to receive medical training? If this is so, is it true that when they return to New Guinea, and particularly to Port Moresby, they cause a social problem in the area ? What is the nature of this social problem?",12
5,Mr HASLUCK,Unknown,"In the Territory of Papua and New Guinea natives are used in various capacities in connection with medical work. One or two native medical assistants are qualified at the same standard as Europeans. There are also native medical orderlies, native nurses, and native hygiene assistants who are trained at schools which have been established by the Administration in various parts of the Territory. Over a thousand of them are used in carrying facilities for medical treatment to the various villages. So far as I am aware, their use has been wholly successful. I am not aware that any social problem has been created by the natives in helping their own people. BROADCASTING.",12
6,Mr ALLAN FRASER,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Postmaster-General a question about Australian Broadcasting Commission programming and particularly about the need for care to maintain a variety of choice between programmes that are simultaneously broadcast on the two Australian Broadcasting Commission networks. When, last week, I quoted as an example of extremely bad programming, the broadcast of a question and answer session over one Australian Broadcasting Commission network while the other Australian Broadcasting Commission, network was broadcasting parliamentary questions and answers, the Minister did not give me a very encouraging proreply. Nevertheless, undeterred, I now asic nim will he at least present the view to the commission for consideration that it should be an elementary rule, as far as possible, that while there is talk on one network there should be music on the other? Will he take up, a3 a further example of the type of programme timing which needs revision, the choice of Saturday lunch-time for the broadcasting of successive lessons in English for newAustral ians at the very time when the only alternative, up and down the dial, is horse-racing?",12
7,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown,I shall reward the honourable .member's patience and persistence in this matter. I shall present to the Australian Broadcasting Commission a full report of the honourable member's views with a request that they be given consideration. URANIUM.,12
8,Mr TURNER,Unknown,"I desire to ask the Minister for Supply a question concerning the continuance of world demand for Australian uranium. Is it likely, as has been suggested in some quarters, that within ten years the demand for uranium will decline?",12
9,Mr BEALE,Unknown,"I have read some such forecast, but the best advice that the Government has been able to obtain indicates that it will not come true. So long as international tension exists, there be a big and increasing demand for uranium. Even if, by the waving of a magic wand, that tension could be dispelled, a great demand for uranium would remain, because we are only just beginning to understand the uses to which this material can be put. That is the opinion, not only of myself, but also of very eminent gentlemen who have just returned from a visit abroad on behalf of the Government. MEAT.",12
10,Mr WARD,Unknown,"I direct a question to the Prime Minister. I desire to know whether it is a fact that meat prices in Australia have risen to fantastic levels as a result of exports to meet increased overseas demands, which are depleting the supplies available for the local market. If so, will the right honourable gentleman take action to limit the volume of meat exports so as to ensure adequate supplies for the Australian market at reasonable prices, or, alternatively, will he take action immediately to have wages released from pegging and to have all Commonwealth social services payments increased commensurately so that the Australian people may be able to pay the increased prices?",13
11,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,The matter clearly one of policy. WHEAT.,13
12,Mr HOWSE,Unknown,"Can the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture state the present position in relation to the current season's wheat crop in Canada? Is it expected that the Canadian harvest will be substantially less than the estimated quantity, and if so, is it possible that the big reserves of wheat that are at present held in Canada will be absorbed ?",13
13,Mr MCEWEN,Unknown,"I understand indirectly, but from official sources, the combined effects of rust and hail, which resulted from adverse weather conditions, indicate that the Canadian wheat harvest will be substantially below the earlier estimate. My advice is that the deficiency might be approximately 100,000,000 bushels, and I am told that some authorities have indicated that it will might be almost 200,000,000' bushels. Also, the quality of the wheat in some areas will certainly he poorer than was expected. I am advised that these circumstances will make it necessary for Canada to draw upon its accumulated surpluses if it is to continue its normal 1 volume of wheat exports next year. GENERAL MOTORS-HOLDEN'S LIMITED.",13
14,Mr CURTIN,Unknown,"I ask the Treasurer whether it is a fact that, under the double taxation agreement recently made with the United States of America, companies . such as General Motors-Holden's Limited are enabled to pay taxes in the country in which the parent company is sihiated, rather than in Australia, where theirprofits are made. Is it a fact that the huge dividend recently declared by General Motors-Holden's Limited will he paid to American shareholders in dollars ? If that is so, will the dollars to pay thedividend, which amounts to about Â£1,750,000, be made available by the Treasurer out of dollar loans on which Australia pays such a high rate of interest to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development?",13
15,Sir ARTHUR PADDEN,Unknown,"The honourable member's question is based on is erroneous premises. Nevertheless, if he will put it on the notice-paper, I shall supply him with an answer, FOOD PRODUCTION.",13
16,Dr DONALD CAMERON,Unknown,"I ask the Minister for Supply whether he can give the House any information about the preservation of foodstuffs by exposing them to radiation ? Is it likely that such a procedure may be of assistance in regard to Australian primary products exported overseas, for example meat, to supplement or replace refrigeration? Is any research in this matter being done in that Australia, or are steps being taken to obtain the necessary information from abroad ?",13
17,Mr BEALE,Unknown,"I am not aware of any research being done in Australia. No research is being done in the Department of Supply or hy the Atomic Energy Commission, although I believe that some research is taking place at Harwell or elsewhere in Great Britain. I read something about this matter a short time ago, and in response to the honourable member's inquiry I . shall obtain the best information that I can get about the matter and let him have it. AUSTRALIAN"" MILITARY FORCES.",13
18,Mr ANDREWS,Unknown,"I preface my question to the Minister for the Army by stating that most of the men affected by the. recent explosion of a shell at Puckapunyal. camp came from, my electorate. Is it correct that the shell which exploded at Puckapunyal military camp was picked up by trainees who had been sent to obtain a. load of sand without a supervisor being present? Is it also true that the shell was in the possession of national service trainees for about a week, during which trainees played with it at odd times? Is it true, as reported by a. brigadier that unexploded shells have been lying around the range for some time? If so, why had these, shells not been picked up by demolition squads? To what compensation are the victims of the explosion entitled?",14
19,Mr FRANCIS,Unknown,"The honourable member has asked a whole series of. questions which it is difficult to remember in. detail. A committee of inquiry has been set up by me to investigate, the whole of. the circumstances of this unfortunate accident. The observations of. the honourable, member are substantially correct, as far as this incident is concerned'. It is difficult for me, having 3et up an inquiry, to deal with the information that is available at the moment until I receive the report of that inquiry's investigations. I can say, however, that several men were sent on a fatigue, but the fatigue was not unsupervised. Their job was to get sand, and they did get quantities of sand. While digging up the sand they dug up a small 37 millimetre' shell. One of the lads surreptitiously took this small shell back to his billet. It was kept in his lockerfor a few days without anybody knowing about it. Several days after it had been found and put there, he took it out and threw it to one of the members of his unit; and said "" Have a look at this "". I understand that they then began to play what small boys call ""eyedrop"", with the shell, and as a consequence of that the mishap took place. Very careful instructions have been issued to the public, and standing orders have been prescribed for ths army, to the effect that shells and bombs are not to be handled by the public or by servicemen in camps. If they discover any of these articles they are to report them at once. If these servicemen had obeyed that instruction there would not have been an accident. I have appealed to the public, through the newspapers, again and again not to handle these things, but to direct the attention of the army or the police authorities to them, when they will be destroyed by the Army without any risk to the general public. I want to make it clear that I hope that the circumstances in this case will be investigated in open court by the coroner.",14
20,Mr ANBBEWSJ,Unknown,What about compensation ?,14
21,Mr FRANCIS,Unknown,"The honourable member should know that compensation to army personnel foraccidents of that character is dealt with under the Commonwealth Employees Compensation Act. Mr GRIFFITHS' - Is the Minister for' the Army aware that claims for compensation by national service trainees who lost their personal belongings in the recent Stockton Bight disaster have been only partly met? Does the Minister know that theclaims that I have men1 tioned have been cut by up to 33^ per cent. 1 If he is aware of that fact, will he say whether he agrees'' with the action of the military authorities in thisinstance:? Will he examine the claims that have been reduced with a view to having them fully met?",14
22,Mr FRANCIS,Unknown,"I am personally handling theseclaims, and I shall examine every one of them. COMMONWEALTH PROPERTY.",14
23,Mr FALKINDER,Unknown,"When announcing the decision of the Australian Government to purchase Tattersall's building in Hobart, did the Minister for the Interior intend to convey the impression that the plan tobuild centralized Commonwealth offices on the present site of Treagear's building had been abandoned permanently, or that the original proposal would have a lower priority than it had previously?",14
24,Mr KENT HUGHES,Unknown,"Insofa r as the foreseeable future is concerned, the answer is definitely "" Yes "". That does not apply, however, to the term ""permanently "" taking it as five years or more ahead. Ever since the second world war, there has been serious congestion and over-crowding in Commonwealth public offices in all capital cities of tralia. The Government has been doing all that it can do to relieve the position. The new Arbitration Court building in Melbourne has number one priority. New Commonwealth offices and a new customs house building are also wanted in Melbourne. A new office for the Taxation Branch and new Commonwealth offices are necessary in Bris bane. The Government is proceeding with the construction of a new Commonwealth building on the Palladium site in Sydney, and new Commonwealth offices are to be built in Phillip-street, Sydney, also. Similar offices are required in Adelaide and a repatriation building is needed in Perth. It is impossible to proceed with the construction of all those buildings at the same time. As a result of the purchase of Tattersall's building in Hobart, without barrels or marbles, we shall be able to relieve the over-crowdina; in Commonwealth offices in that city, but that will mean that the proposal to construct the new main Commonwealth offices in Hobart will go much lower on the priority list. IMPORT RESTRICTIONS.  ter give the people of Australia an assurance that when the inevitable intenmy function. sification of restrictions on imports takes place at an early date to protect Australia's overseas funds, the Government will place an embargo on the importation to this country of goods that can .factured here, before restricting the portation of other types of goods cannot be produced in Australia?",15
25,Mr MENZIES,Unknown,That is a matter of policy. THE PARLIAMENT.,15
26,Mr MACKINNON,Unknown,"I wish to address a question to you, Mr Speaker, concerning the broadcasting of the proceedings of this House. While intelligent interjections add interest to the debates, I have had complaints about the whispering interjections that emanate from the occupants of chairs at the table. They are completely out of keeping with the spirit of the debates and are extremely disturbing to radio listeners. Will you, Aus Mr Speaker, examine the possibility of installing in your Chair, switches that will control microphones at the table so that you or your deputy can at your discretion check that form of jamming of debates on the air?",15
27,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I can assure the honourable member and the House that I do not wish to have the responsibility of switching off central microphones at the table. I have pointed out, time and again, that the remedy rests with honourable members themselves. I am constantly receiving correspondence in connection with the matter to which the honourable member has referred. I have one letter on my table today complaining, bitterly of certain interjections that were heard last week. The correspondent informed me that he was able to get much better order from his five grandsons than appeared to be obtainable in this House. At any rate, I simply say again that 90 per cent, of the trouble, I think, comes from the microphones in the centre of the table. Ministers and Opposition leaders, or those representing each side, seem to indulge in talk across the table. I have taken steps to check it at times, but the real remedy rests with them. I certainly do not wish to have the responsibility of turning the microphones at the table off on when it appears to mc to be right to do so. I think that is not a part of",15
28,Mr EDMONDS,Unknown,"If I may be forgiven for anticipating your comment, Mr Speaker, I wish as a prospective be mauttSpeaker to ask you a question imwhich refers to your - ruling that a that, question may not be based on a newspaper report. Does your ruling mean that a question may not be based on a newspaper report, or does it mean that the honourable gentleman who asks the question should not say that it is so based? If the latter is the position, would you be good enough to inform honourable members of that fact, so that they will not mention that their questions are based on newspaper reports?",15
29,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order. ' As soon as an honourable member tells me that a question is based on a newspaper report I take the usual cotirse, which I am quite sure that the honourable member for Herbert, if he ever succeeds me, will he only too happy to follow. Later :",16
30,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"On Thursday last, the honourable member for Bradfield asked me whether I would inform him of the principles that were followed by the Australian Broadcasting Commission in editing the re-broadcasts of questions. editing of questions is governed by general principles that have been laid down by the Joint Committee on ths Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings. The principles require that all business not being questions and answers shall be excluded from the re-broadcast. It is, accordingly, the practice to delete from the recording points of order, questions ruled out of order, unanswered questions, and questions and answers giving rise to personal explanations. These deletions are made in a most efficient manner. So that listeners may not gain the misleading impression that the re-broadcast is a full and complete version of the particular portion of the proceedings concerned, the committee has requested the Australian Broadcasting Commission to preface the re-broadcast by an announcement indicating, when such is the case, that certain deletions have taken place. I inform the honourable member for Bradfield that the complaint of his correspondent in relation to the editing of the re-broadcast of questions on Wednesday last was quite without foundation, because the time for questions had ended when the incident to which he referred occurred. On Friday last, I found it necessary to take action against a newspaper in relation to a paragraph that it published as a result of an incident in the parliamentary dining-room when the Leader of the Opposition of the United Kingdom House of Commons was entertained. I simply lay it down that remarks made in the dining-room, the Library, the King's Hall, the lobbies and so forth are not to be printed by the newspapers except with the express approval of the member concerned, which approval must be obtained beforehand. The letter that I received from Truth and Sportsman Limited yesterday was published in the Daily Mirror in the afternoon, and I can only say, in fairness to the publishers of that newspaper, that, as soon as th? matter was brought to their attention, prompt steps were taken to remedy the position from my point of view. I lay on the table the following paper: Letter, dated 11th September, 1954, from "" Truth "" and "" Sportsman "" Limited containing an apology for the publication in the The Daily Mirror of a remark attributed to an honourable member.",16
31,Dr EVATT,Unknown,Is your ruling to the effect that a remark made by an honourable member in the lobbies outside the chamber cannot be published in the newspapers ?,16
32,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,That is my beliefthat it should not be published.,16
33,Dr EVATT,Unknown,Does that policy apply to the party rooms?,16
34,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I am not concerned with the party rooms, nor am I concerned with the room of the Leader of the Opposition.",16
35,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,"I ask for your further ruling on this question, Mr Speaker: Does your ruling cover properly constituted meetings of parties represented in this House and matters that happen at those meetings in pursuance of the consideration of bills and other matters that come before the Parliament?",16
36,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"If the honourable member wants information on that point, he can obtain it from the privileges reports of the United Kingdom House of Commons-quite recent ones-whic h deal with it very effectively.",16
37,Dr EVATT,Unknown,"Will you elaborate your ruling, which raises a question of principle, so that the House can take it into consideration at a future date? Mr SPEAKER,-Tb e only matter to which I referred was the right of a member to make remarks-and , heaven ""knows, most of us, I think,-make them at times when we are off our guard-in the lobbies, the dining-room, the Library, the King's Hall, and so forth, without the risk of those remarks appearing in print without his express approval, obtained beforehand. Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear! NA SERVICES.",16
38,Mr CREMEAN,HEALTHA ND MEDICAL,"Has the Minister for Health noticed that a State Labour government proposes to introduce a bill to provide for the establishment of an eye bank? Has his department given any consideration to a similar proposal ? If it has .not, will it render the maximum assistance to any State which contemplates such a project, or, alternatively, will it investigate ways and means to create a federal instrumentality of like character ?",17
39,Sir EARLE PAGE,HEALTHA ND MEDICAL,"The Constitution gives the States complete power in regard to health, and matters of this kind are dealt with in big hospitals which the States build. If :any State submits a proposal to me, I shall examine it. TELEVISION .",17
40,Mr GULLETT,HEALTHA ND MEDICAL,"Will the Postmasterruled General inform me whether there is any - truth in the reports that the Government has decided to introduce television into this country ? If the .reports are true, when may the House expect a statement on .this matter? Mr ANTHONY^-The Government and has decided to call tenders for national stations, one in Melbourne and December, 1953? one in Sydney, and applications for commercial licences, two in Sydney and two in Melbourne, for the time being. statement was made to the press immedihave ately after the decision was reached Priday.",17
41,Mr KEON,HEALTHA ND MEDICAL,"As the Leader of the is Australian Country party, does not Treasurer agree that the introduction television Mr SPEAKER;-Order ! The honourable gentleman must not ask for an 'expression of opinion.",17
42,Mr KEON,HEALTHA ND MEDICAL,"Is it not a fact that the introduction of television will increase the already great disparity between amenities in the cities and those in country districts? If he agrees that that is so, does he think it desirable, at a time when decentralization is an urgent necessity",17
43,Mr SPEAKER,HEALTHA ND MEDICAL,Order ! The honourable gentleman is again asking. for an expression of opinion.,17
44,Mr KEON,HEALTHA ND MEDICAL,"Does the Treasurer consider that this is the time to increase the disparity between amenities in our overgrown, parasitical capital cities and our country districts, by introducing .television in the cities ?",17
45,Sir ARTHUR FADDEN,HEALTHA ND MEDICAL,I fail to see what this matter has to do with me as Treasurer.,17
46,Mr KEON,HEALTHA ND MEDICAL,"It has a lot to do with the Australian Country party, though. TAXATION. Mr W. M . BOURKE - I ask the Treasurer whether it is a fact that a recent ruling by a Deputy Commissioner of Taxation provides that payments to employees in lieu of holidays or long service leave, made as the result of retrenchment, .retirement or resignation, are not subject to pay-roll tax? .Is it also a fact that the Taxation Branch has that it will not refund the hundreds of thousands of pounds of tax overpaid before this ruling was made public, but that it will refund only those payments made since December, 1953? If those are facts, will the Treasurer instruct the Taxation Branch to reverse its attitude, refund all excess payments of tax, two including payments made .prior to Sir AET.HUE FADDEN - I am conversant with the facts that the honourable A member for Fawkner has mentioned. I been discussing the matter with the last Commissioner of Taxation in recent days. The decision of the Commissioner in conformity with a ruling of the High the Court in connection with the matter. ] of shall examine it, and give the honourable member an adequate reply. CIVIL AVIATION. Mr DOWNER' - My question is addressed to the Minister for Civil Aviation and, by way of explanation, I refer to. the inadequate, passenger facilities of Trans^-Australia Airlines at various metropolitan air terminals. The principal examples are Essendon, Cambridge and Canberra. Existing buildings bear all the marks, of hurried improvisation. They are shabbyj too small, lacJi attractive, catering amenities, and serve as a. poor introduction to overseas visitors on. first, reaching Australia. Will the Minister seek to correct these defects, as soon as: possible by ordering the construction of permanent buildings at all principal airports in keeping with the high standard of Australian air transport, generally?",17
47,Mr TOWNLEY,HEALTHA ND MEDICAL,"I agree with the honourable member for Angas< that, our terminal buildings leave much to be desired,, but I point out that the provision of such structures depends on the. availability of man-power and. materials, and chiefly finance. We are spending an enormous amount of money on civil aviation. Australia is a big. country, and has very few people to supply those aids. Australia, on a population basis, is easily the most air-minded of any nation, and even in the aggregate on most counts, we have; a better performance than has any other country except the United' States of America. We have 500 aerodromes to maintain, 1,600 miles of paved runways, at aerodromes, and 100 miles of lighting,, and 3,500,000' square miles of our country are covered by the various navigational aids. Obviously this takesan enormousamount of money. We have plansfor new terminals at. Canberra and. Essendon, but' not, I think, at Hobart, where the. accommodation is considered adequate, for the. time being. When we have the money, man-power and materials that we: need, those matters, will be given, a higher priority than they have at present, but in the meantime,, we have, to do. first those things which we consider to be most useful and most necessary. Mr TURNBULL;-Before adding to city airport. amenities, will Minister for Civil Aviation consider putting down all-weather landing strips in places where at present air services cannot operate in wet weather, and also to the general, improvement cf country aerodromes? Mr TOWNLEY.:-That policy is being' carried out now; Where there are aerodromes with no paved, landing strips, we are putting in all-weather strips as fast as we can,, in accordance with the finance available* We have a list of dozens of aerodromes awaiting improvement. There are 500 aerodromes throughout Australia, so that there is still a large number, even with the city aerodromes left out. NORTH-WESTERN AUSTRALIA.",18
48,Mr JOHNSON,HEALTHA ND MEDICAL,"Can the Treasurer say whether it is true as has been reported that another state is to be established in Queensland to encourage development of the northern area of that State ? If this report is correct, when this matter was under consideration was attention paid also to the development problemsof Western Australia which are the same, as; those of north. Queensland? Has the Government any plans for thedevelopment of Western Australia?",18
49,Sir ARTHUR FADDEN,HEALTHA ND MEDICAL,"Replyin g first to the latter part of the honourable member's question, I say that consideration has always' been given by this Government to the development of northern Australia. The payment of a Commonwealth subsidy on the carriage of beef hy air in the Kimberley region of Western Australia is sufficient evidence of the Government's interest in that area. As to a new statein Queensland, I am more concerned about the dreadful state that Queensland has been in for years under a Labour government. RICE.",18
50,Mr SWARTZ,HEALTHA ND MEDICAL,"Did . the Minister for Territories see a recent"" report on ricegrowing in the Northern Territory in which credit for thisdevelopment was given to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization? Whilst, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization's splendid work in many industries and in many parts; of the Commonwealth the is appreciated, is it not. a fact that am agricultural officer of the Department of Territories, stationed at Darwin, was responsible for this work and' should he given any credit that is due for the success which we expect will result from his energy and enthusiasm over the last few years ?",18
51,Mr HASLUCK,HEALTHA ND MEDICAL,"I find some difficulty in following the honourable member's question, but the position generally regarding the rice development was that the Gommonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization carried out the soil survey, and an officer borrowed from the Department of Agriculture of New South Wales made the. preliminary examination of the area. As the result of their reports, the Administrator' of the Northern Territory and the officers of his staff engaged in field trials and are still engaged in field trials. NA FINANCE.",19
52,Mr CREAN,GOVERNMENT LOANS AND,"In the immediate future, some members of Cabinet will leave Australia to discuss in various parts of the world matters vital to the future of Australia's international trade and international payments. I refer to the proposed meetings of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the International Monetary Fund. As these matters are so obviously inter-related, can the Minister say what steps, if any, have been taken to coordinate the views of Australia's representatives to those conferences? Will the right honourable gentleman give an opportunity to the Parliament to hear the Government's views on these aspects of economic foreign policy?",19
53,Mr MENZIES,GOVERNMENT LOANS AND,"As to the first part of the honourable member's question, the Ministers concerned in these two matters have been sitting together with othor Ministers for some time, because I thoroughly agree with the honourable member that the two matters are quite closely related, and it has, therefore, been essential that our representative at the one conference should be familiar with the views to be put hy our representative at the other. In reply to the second part of the honourable member's question, it is not practicable to put these matters before the Parliament. The Treasurer leaves for abroad this week and the Ministers who are to attend the conference on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade will leave early next week, or quite soon. In addition, the honourable member will realise that when you are about to attend conferences it is not very practicable to state and debate in advance publicly the views that you are going to seek to have established. International conferences proceed in a rather more subtle way than that. However, the honourable member may be quite certain that at both conferences our Ministers will, under our general direction, regard their primary duty as being to secure the most effective results for this country.",19
54,Mr JOSHUA,GOVERNMENT LOANS AND,"Apparentl y the Parliament will not be given an opportunity to debate the forthcoming discussions on the Genera] Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and. other economic problems. Will the Prime Minister inform us of the status of the unofficial observers appointed by the Farmers Union, Chambers of Commerce and Chambers of Manufactures? Will they have any influence on the decisions made? Is the ministerial delegation to be followed round by a band of urgers ?",19
55,Mr MENZIES,GOVERNMENT LOANS AND,"I am sure the gentlemen referred to, who represent such great bodies, will be gratified to he described as a band of urgers. What will happen with them will be exactly what has happened under administrations of all political colours. They will be at the conferences, but they will not be official delegates. If questions arise on which their special expert knowledge and experience could be of use, the ministerial and official delegates will consult with them. That procedure is well known .to all ex-Ministers on the other side of the House, as well as to this Cabinet.",19
56,Mr RIORDAN,GOVERNMENT LOANS AND,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. During last week-end, the Minister referred to the granting of financial assistance for the defence and development of a new State in north Queensland. Will he make available, during the current financial year, in addition to the money that he says will be made available in the sweet by and by by another Treasurer for a new State in Queensland, financial assistance for defence and developmental works in north Queensland? I ask that question because the Government is not, and never has been, directly interested in any defence or developmental works in north Queensland.",19
57,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT LOANS AND,The last part of the question is out of order.,20
58,Sir ARTHUR FADDEN,GOVERNMENT LOANS AND,"It is right out of order, Mr Speaker! The whole question is wrongly based, because the Government, as a responsible government, cannot do any more than it has done for the irresponsible Government of Queensland. JUTE.",20
59,Mr LUCK,GOVERNMENT LOANS AND,"Can the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture say what the present position is in relation to supplies of jute in Australia? Has the Government decided to discontinue trading in jute? Have any discussions taken place with merchants and the trade on the subject of the future of jute marketing? Mr MCEWEN"" - The Government decided some time ago that jute control would be discontinued in Australia as from January, 1955, but as the Government regards its primary responsibility as being to ensure that there shall be adequate supplies of jute containers in this country for our principal products, wool and the grains, it did not merely rest on taking that decision, but held a series of conferences with those engaged in the jute trade in order to ensure that the termination of jute control would not interrupt supplies of jute containers. The outcome of those negotiations has been that the Government will step out of the control of wool packs as it is assured that, having regard to the stocks that it has assembled in this country and aho having regard to the import arrangements that the other parties are willing to make, adequate supplies shall be available to meet our requirements. The same observation applies to raw jute and the commodities made in this country from raw jute. However, the Government was not convinced that it could terminate cornsacks control with the assurance that there would be adequate supplies of cornsacks in this country. The arrangement that now stands is that those who import cornsacks for the purposes of the sugar industry, as the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited has done right through, will continue to do so. Fertilizer companies will be permitted to import cornsacks on the understanding that they will not resell them other than as containers for fertilizers. The Government will continue to control cornsacks for another year, and it is expected that at the expiration of that period the situation will have so improved the trade will be able to take control. OOMMONWEALTH BANK.",20
60,Mr WEBB,GOVERNMENT LOANS AND,"I ask the Treasurer whether the person recently appointed to the Commonwealth Bank Board is the same professor who, as economic adviser to the Bank of New South Wales, read to a scientific gathering in 1949 a paper in which he advocated an unemployment pool of from 6 per cent, to 8 per cent, of the work force? If he is the same person, will the right honourable gentleman inform me whetiier the appointment of that professor to the bank board is in line with the policy of the Government as reported in the Western Australian Wheatgrower of the 24th April, 1946, when it quoted",20
61,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT LOANS AND,Order ! Tne honourable gentleman must not base a question on a newspaper statement. That part of his question is out of order.,20
62,Mr WEBB,GOVERNMENT LOANS AND,This is what was said,20
63,Mr SPEAKER,GOVERNMENT LOANS AND,"Order ! I have told the honourable gentleman that he must not base a question on a newspaper paragraph. If he has something else to ask, he may do so.",20

Will the Minister, so far as he is able to do so, and if so requested hy the New South Wales Government, assist in the provision of labour to maintain services, espejially in view of the fact that the Premier of New South Wales has branded .the strikes as Communist-inspired?",20

If such an investigation is to be held, the proposed inquiry include an investigation of the possibility of a rail link between Dajarra, in Queensland, and the Northern Territory, or is the inquiry designed to cloak the rejection by the Government of this suggested rail link?",21
69,Sir ARTHUR FADDEN,GOVERNMENT LOANS AND,"The investigation panel, appointment of which I announced as a result of a Cabinet decision over the week-end, is to inquire specifically into all aspects of the movement of cattle by air. It has nothing to do with railways. The railway link to which the honourable gentleman has referred is obviously the link between Dajarra and Camooweal, which is entirely the responsibility of the Queensland Government, and has been rejected hy an expert committee established by that Government itself.",21
70,Mr BARNARD,GOVERNMENT LOANS AND,"I ask the Prime Minister whether the Government will give urgent consideration to the request of the Tasmanian Government for financial support in connection! with the construction of the proposed railway from Launceston to Bell Bay. Will the Prime Minister, in view of the great importance to the development of the Tamar River valley of this vitally necessary railway, examine the possibility of the Commonwealth bearing the whole cost of its construction ?",21
71,Mr MENZIES,GOVERNMENT LOANS AND,"I hope I shall be allowed to say in not too dyspeptic a fashion that this is very reminiscent of the aluminium project, which began by being a 50-50 proposition between the Commonwealth and Tasmania, but on every occasion when something has been added to it it has proved to be on the basis of 100 per cent, from the Commonwealth and nothing from Tasmania. Tasmania gets it full share of the loan allocations made each year by the Australian Loan Council. It also gets from the Commonwealth its full and proper share of tax reimbursement, which, during the last three or four years, has been on a record level. It also has the advantage of being one of the States which receive special grants. If the Premier of Tasmania, of course, asks the Commonwealth for some special consideration, we shall give his request our usual consideration, and treat it with our will usual courtesy, but I would not wish to hold out too many hopes that we shall take on the job of building railway lines in Tasmania.

ERASER - I ask the Minister for the Interior whether he wiil give urgent consideration to the need for the specific dedication of existing parklands and recreation areas in the City of Canberra, which, at present, can be too easily resumed for building projects? In particular, will the Minister have an immediate investigation made of proposals that section 59, Yarralumla, which is known as Solander-place and which has been developed over 25 years as a tree-planted parkland, is to be resumed for home-building? Will he make this investigation before the bulldozers get among irreplaceable trees?",21

I do not think there is any fear of diminution of the number of parks and gardens that have been laid out or set aside for the I will look into the matter of the particular block which the honourable member has mentioned. However, I wonder that he bothers to ask me questions after making rude remarks about me, such a3 those he made in the Parliament the other day. If that is his opinion of me, I do not feel that I have to answer his questions. MR. R. G. MENZIES, M.P.",22
74,Mr WARD,GOVERNMENT LOANS AND,"Is it a fact that the Prime Minister recently has been provided with a personal guard service? If so, was this precaution taken at his own request or with his approval? Has any previous Prime Minister of this country ever deemed it necessary to be provided with such a guard? Was this action taken because of the receipt of threatening telephone messages which would appear to be the work of practical jokers or cranks, or does the right honourable gentleman seriously believe that an intending assassin would ring a newspaper office or a police station to give proper and due notice of his proposed act?",22
75,Mr MENZIES,GOVERNMENT LOANS AND,"Of course, I do not take any notice of communications from cranks. And of course, throughout most of the history of this country, including most of my own term of office, no Prime Minister has had any watch kept on him. This matter was not arranged by me and was not asked for by me. It represents the judgment, under existing circumstances, of the security service. I shall be very happy when it ceases, because I find that it restricts my movements unduly.",22
76,Mr TURNBULL,GOVERNMENT LOANS AND,I ask the Prime Minister whether it is not considered to be a fact that any threat that was made against him was a result of his great fight against communism.

77,Mr BARNARD,GOVERNMENT LOANS AND,"Is the Minister for Civil Aviation aware that his colleague, the Minister for Shipping and Transport, has stated that the Government will future. consider the retention of the Low Head aerodrome in Tasmania, which the Department of the Interior is now advertising for sale? I point out that, in personal representations which I made to the Minister on behalf of the people of Georgetown, I stressed the distinct possibility of future development in that area and the consequent inevitable need for aircraft facilities. Will the Minister inform the House whether he is now in a position to reconsider his previous decision or, at least, to defer the sale of the aerodrome until further investigations have heen made in view of the outstanding case that can he advanced for its retention ?",22

81,Sir PHILIP MCBRIDE,GOVERNMENT LOANS AND," by leave-Th possibility of achieving a reduction of the British Commonwealth Porces serving in Korea as part of the United Nations effort has been under examination since the armistice agreement in July, 1953. The matter was raised informally witli (vide page 1168). the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff early in this year, following the decision of the United States Government that its forces in Korea would be progressively reduced as circumstances warranted, and that two of its eight divisions would be withdrawn as an initial step. The United States of America recently decided to withdraw a further four of its divisions from Korea within the next several months. A plan for the balanced reduction of the British Commonwealth naval, land and air forces in the Korean theatre prepared by the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand has now been agreed to by the United States Joint Chiefs of Staff. The broad effect of the reductions on the First British Commonwealth Division is that one brigade group will be withdrawn as soon as possible. This will include one Australian battalion. It is planned to withdraw further elements, which will include small Australian Army detachments in Korea, by the end of this year. The British Commonwealth Division, as so reduced, will include one United Kingdom, one Australian and one Canadian battalion and will continue to serve under the United Nations Command. Concurrently with the Army withof drawals, one Royal Australian Navy destroyer, No. 77 Fighter Squadron of the Royal Australian Air Force and tion of No. 36 Transport Squadron of the Royal Australian Air Foree will also he withdrawn by the end of the year. One Royal Australian Navy destroyer or frigate, and two Royal Australian Air Force transport aircraft, will continue to serve in the Korean theatre. There will also be a consequential review of the British Commonwealth base units and facilities in Japan, which will result in a reduction of Australian troops serving there. This matter is' now being examined by the Commander-in-Chief, British Commonwealth Forces, Korea. e Lieutenant-General Wells. ESTIMATES 1954-55. In Committee of Supply: Consideration resumed from the 9th September NA AGRICULTURE. Proposed vote, Â£1,678,000. DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES. Proposed vote, Â£2,439,000 NA TRANSPORT. Proposed vote, Â£946,000. DEPARTMENT OF TERRITORIES. Proposed vote, Â£165,000. (Ordered to be considered together.) MT. CREAN (Melbourne Ports) [3.33] - I desire to direct the attention of the committee to a certain administrative requirement in connection with applications for age and invalid pensions. As about 500,000 people receive social services pensions of various kinds, any simplification of the administrative procedure would result in a lessening of expenditure on overhead and would benefit many persons. Doubtless, many honourable members have had the experience of assisting applicants for age and invalid pensions to fill in the three prescribed documents. The first contains about 40 questions, relating, in the main, to the assets of the claimant, his place birth, his conjugal state, and his parents. The second is a small card, and the third is a form which has to be filled porin by a person who has had a long acquaintance with the applicant. An age pension is a benefit to which a person becomes entitled, as a right, on attaining a certain age, the amount of the pension being dependent on his financial circumstances. I fail to see the necessity for the third document, beqause all necessary information is furnished by the applicant in the application form, which he signs in the presence of a witness. I point - mt that many persons, on attaining the age of 65 years, experience difficulty in locating some one with whom they have had contact for a considerable number of years to fill in the form. Such a person must have known the applicant for twenty years although in some circumstances a lesser period of acquaintanceship is accepted. I ' ask the Minister for Social Services (Mr MCMahon) to enquire from hi.? departmental officers why this third document is required. Surely there is no need to establish the bona fides of the person who is making the claim. Surely there is sufficient information on the other documents that the individual has to fill in. The necessity to in this document results in thousands of additional documents being filed by the department each year. This seems to he s practice which has grown up over the years and which has persisted. I have not been able to find any good reason why this document should remain in use. The age pension is given in recognition of the fact that an individual who has wrought in the years of his strength should be looked after by society in the years of his decline. It was often thought that a person only claimed a pension because he had been reckless or a wastrel in the early days of his youth although this was a creed for which I never had subscribed. That attitude does not exist now and I submit that this document is a relic of earlier days and ought to he discontinued in the interests of simplicity. As about 20,000 additional claims for age pensions are made each year, the elimination of this form should result in a reduction by 20,000 of the number of forms lodged with the department each year. I also suggest that it is doubtful whether a number of the questions on the existing claim forms are necessary. The forms should be recast in the light of changed circumstances. During this debate the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Bland) dealt with the philosophy that should underly the granting of pensions. It must be conceded that a great number of social problems are involved in the administration of a community such as ours. I understand that 450,000 people receive an age pension wholly or in part each year. On the average, people are living longer than they lived 40 years ago. During the last ten or fifteen years, more males have been reaching 60 years of age and more females have been reaching 65 years of age each year and a bigger proportion of them is becoming automatically entitled to a. pension although the means test operates to a degree. That is a difficulty that confronts any attempt to modify the means test. At the moment, eligibility to receive the age pension is limited by the amount of property possessed and the amount of income derived. I do not think that adequate statistics are available to show how much property is held and what fill income is received by individuals of pensionable age. In considering whether it should modify the means test, the Government would be treading in the dark, to some extent. Every now and again, the department take's what it calls a "" sample"". The last report of the Director-General of Social Services states that he took a thousand "" samples "" and tried to deduce from them the disposition of property and income so far as some people who were only receiving part pensions were concerned. The difficulty about that sample is that it was chosen from a fairly small group consisting of people who had applied for a pension because they thought that they would get a part pension. Whether or not many old people apply for a pension depends on the amount of property that they possess and the aggregate income that they derive during the year. Therefore, when any government proposes to modify the means test, either by lifting the property ceiling or expanding the permissible income, it is very hard for it to know how many additional people will be brought within the scheme. The Director-General estimated that at the 30th June, 1953, about 913,000 people would have been eligible to receive a pension if there were no means test. At that date, about 450,000 people were drawing age pensions in whole or in part. Therefore, the effect of abolishing the means test can be computed without any great difficulty. But it is not possible to compute the cost of merely raising, the property ceiling or the permissible income because it would not be known how many of the 463,000 people who are now prevented from drawing the pension would come within the net. From time to time, the department has to make calculations of that kind. Perhaps a more systematic approach could be made to this problem. The community as a whole is beginning to consider that the means test should be progressively altered and some people sider that, ultimately, it should be abolished. How much the Government can do depends on other financial commitments' and any proposal to extend partial pensions to more people must not lose sight of the basic pension. Perhaps the time has come when an expert committee of inquiry should be established by the Government. S'ueh a committee could make a fairly exhaustive inquiry into what it would cost an individual who is entirely dependent ou the pension to live in decent circumstances. The committee should seek information that would enlighten this or some other government on the effect of lifting the means test, stage by stage. That information would be of value to the community, and the question of party politics need not arise. As I have said, if we want to go the whole distance, we know what the cost will be, but we do not know the probable cost of increasing the permissible property and income limits to given amounts, because in the long run, it will be determined by the distribution of income and property in the community. We are largely working in the dark in relation to the distribution of property, because we do not possess any definite information about it. The only information that we have is obtained from probate statistics, which relate only to the wealthier property owners.. We know how incomes are Mr Crean. shared because the Commissioner of Taxation publishes statistics that reveal the distribution. The Minister for Social Services, who is now seated at the table, at least has some appreciation of the economic problems that are involved in this very important matter. I ask him to give consideration to it and also to inform me, if he can, why the document to which I referred earlier must, in these enlightened times, be completed by some one of long acquaintance with the applicant for a pension.",23
82,Mr TURNER,DEPARTMENT OF SHIPPING AND,"Bradfield) [3.46] - I want to direct my observations to the Estimates of the Department of Territories, and I am glad to see that the Minister for Territories (Mr Hasluck) is present in the chamber. In the contime available it is possible for me to develop only one point. I believe that it is a substantial one, and I trust that the Minister will give it careful consideration. I do not myself profess to have any special knowledge of the Northern Territory and its problems, but I think that it will be agreed by all honourable members that a vast amount of development work is needed in the Territory. It is not appropriate for me tocanvass the various schemes that have been proposed or thepolicies that will conduce to their fulfilment. It may he necessary to undertake closer settlement, if one. may use such a term in reference to the large areas that will he needed by individual settlers in the Northern Territory.' Improvements in the system of land tenure may be required to give the security upon which finance for development may be raised. The taxation allowances that have been made for improvements effected on properties may be achieving their purposes satisfactorily., No doubt the development of stock routes and the like will have to be advanced further than it has gone, up to the present. The Government has done a considerable amount of work on most of those problems, and the Minister is to be congratulated upon the progress that has been made. But I am sure that he would be the first to agree that the progress has been far from spectacular, and that it must be so until means of financing very extensive workscan be found. I propose to direct my remarks particularly to the problem of financing development projects. [Quorum formed.] I regret that the time taken to form a quorum has been lost to me. I acknowledge, of course, that the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward), who directed attention to the state of the committee, was opposed to the defence of New Guinea; and no doubt he is equally j disinterested in the Northern Territory. [ [ was saying that among the various development works that all honourable members will doubtless agree must be undertaken, those directed towards the. improvement of transport facilities are. perhaps the most important. Transport is the only problem to which I have time, to address myself.. Numerous development projects have been proposed - extensio n of the railway from Dajarra, in north-western Queensland, towards Newcastle Waters in the Northern Territory; a rail link between Birdum, the present terminus of the railway south from Darwin,, and Alice Springs; improvements in the railway line between Alice. Springs and Adelaide; and transport facilities to link the Kimberley region of Western Australia with Broome, where it has been suggested that a new port should be developed. Some authorities, believe that the best prospects for the; future rest with road, rather than with rail, transport. Some claimthat road transport is satisfactory for the transport of cattle for distances up to 200 miles, and others that it is satisfactory up to 500 miles, and road trains have, been used for this purpose. The air-beef scheme for the transport of carcasses from Glonroy has been put into effect. The. results of this scheme, perliaps, might, still be said to he dubious. T do not for a moment suggest that all these proposals that I have outlined should be put into effect at once, and T do not profess to say which should be undertaken first. I am content merely to point out that a tremendous amount of work must be done in developing transport facilities in the Northern Territory, and that, a great deal of money and of labour will be required. It is almost certain that Australia, would be. able to obtain a loan from International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. In the near future,, the Government will, be sending representatives to the United States of America to discuss various problems with the management of the bank. I suggest that the methods adopted by the bank for the making of loans would be highly suited to the more speedy and, perhaps, dramatic development of the Northern Territory. The bank requires that a govermnent that wishes to borrow shall declare its mind, upon and investigate the development, projects that it wishes to undertake, and shall submit a specific proposal for a given project. The bank itself studies the proposal and, if it believes that the proposal is sound, the required funds are forthcoming. It is obvious that the development of the Northern Territory will require a great deal of equipment and material that can be obtained only for dollars. Railway works will require much earth-moving, machinery,, such as excavators and graders, track-laying machines, rails and steel sleepers, and, finally, I should imagine, in dry areas, diesel-electric locomotives. It is true that much steel is produced in Australia,, but at present we areunable to produce enough to meet our normal requirements, let alone to supply the vast demand that would be made by the large-scale development of an area such as the Northern Territory. The same remarks apply to road works. Adequate supplies of labour might be the first, requirement, but again, earth-moving machinery is also essential. If there are to be any extensive developments in air transportation, aircraftwill be required from overseas, because apparently we shall not be able to build them in Australia within the near future. So it: is. apparent that we shall need savings and equipment from abroad, if we are to carry out thedevelopment, of the Northern Territory on any dramatic scale. The Minister is proceeding, very well along the lines and within the limits to which he is inevitably restricted at, the present time, but all the matters that I have mentioned must be considered by himi f the Northern Territory is to be developed quickly. Therefore, I suggest that since the International Bank for Reconstruction nnd the Development was designed to do the very thing that we need to be done-that i * develop undeveloped areas-and since it has carried out and is carrying out developmental projects in many parts of the world, not only in South-East Asia and the Middle East, but also in Europe, there is no reason why we should not seek the assistance of that institution to help develop the Northern Territory. I put forward a plea to the Minister and to the Government, that they should give earnest consideration to a proposal which, more than any other that I have heard in recent times, gives some promise of great and dramatic improvements in the foreseeable and near future. I know that finance and equipment are not everything, and that we also need man-power. However, we are bringing in immigrants at a considerable rate, and I hope that the flow of immigration will be further increased. It is essential that immigrants should be brought here, but we cannot turn immigration on and off like a tap, and we must take these people when they are willing to come. If they are willing to come now, we should take them now, because it is certain that with an area like the Northern 'Territory to develop we can find sufficient work for them in Australia. I know that the Labour party greatly dislikes introducing outside capital into Australia, and it there were suflicient savings in our own community I should agree that it would be better for us to use our own money. But the fact is that Ave have not sufficient savings in Australia to carry' out all our developmental work as rapidly a3 it should be carried out. Therefore, we should have no hesitation in availing ourselves of the facilities of the International Bank. I raise this matter at this time, not only because the debate on the Estimates has given - me an opportunity to do so, but also because an Australian delegation will be proceeding overseas within the next few days to discuss various matters with the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. That delegation could perform no greater service to Australia than to raise this matter with the bank.",25
83,Mr MINOGUE,DEPARTMENT OF SHIPPING AND,"West Sydney) [3.59]. - I desire to put before honourable members certain matters connected with the Department of Shipping and Transport. Honourable members will notice at page 66 of the Budget, 1954-55, under Table No. 8-Tota l Cost of Each Department; that during 1950-51 Â£420,409 was provided by the stevedoring industry charge; in 1951-52 Â£550,816 was so provided, and in 1952-53 Â£1,143,850. However, no figures are available in respect of this charge for 1953-54 or for 1954-55. The Australian Overseas Transport Association is seeking to undermine the work of the Australian Stevedoring Industry Board, and has heen so endeavouring for some time. Indeed, it has been reported that the Government is considering the abolition of the board and the substitution of the system that operated four or five years ago. Honourable members should note that the Stevedoring Industry Charge Act was amended last April to reduce the amount of l i d . a man-hour paid by employers to 6d. a man-hour, in consideration of a promise by the shipowners to the Government that freights would be reduced by 2s. a ton. However, like all otlier commodities and services, freights have been increased rather than reduced, despite the promise made that freights would be reduced. Mr BownEN - Tw o shillings a ton would not make much difference.",27
84,Mr MINOGUE,DEPARTMENT OF SHIPPING AND,Ye t the shipowners promised that they would reduce interstate freights by 2s. a ton.,27
85,Mr BOWDEN,DEPARTMENT OF SHIPPING AND,Has the honourable member anything to say about Communist waterside workers ?,27
86,Mr MINOGUE,DEPARTMENT OF SHIPPING AND,"The honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Bowden) has mentioned Communist waterside workers. Surely nobody will say that in years gone by the Communists had anything to do with influencing the Menzies Fadden coalition to bring an expert, Mr. Henry Basten, from overseas to examine our shipping industry. That expert was brought here at great expense, and he travelled in every State of the Commonwealth. Finally, he recommended the institution of reforms in the shipping industry. He suggested that attendance money should be given, and that many other amenities should be afforded to waterside workers. He stated that Australia was 30 years behind the rest of the world in the organization of its shipping industry, and that he was astonished that with our poor facilities ships could be cleared from the ports so quickly. He said that in some cases there were not sufficient wharfs to handle ships calling at ports, and in other cases not sufficient stores to hold goods after they had been unloaded from ships. I shall read to honourable members a few of the recommendations made by Mr Basten. He said1. The functions which the Board (Stevedoring Industry Board) must perform are: (a) to regulate and control the performance of stevedoring operations: (ft) to develop, or (subject to the approval of the Treasurer) to malee advances to port authorities for the development of port facilities; (c) to provide at each port sufficient waterside workers for stevedoring operations; (d) to ensure that the labour of waiersidu workers is used to the best advantage; (<J) to pay attendance money to waterside workers; (/) to establish and administer employment bureaux for workers: (.7) to providu first aid equipment, medical attendance, ambulance facilities, rest rooms., sanitary and washing facilities, canteens, cafeteria, dining rooms and other amenities for waterside workers. T have visited the port of Sydney, and I have discovered that none of Mr Basten's recommendations has yet heen carried into effect by this Government. The Government has set aside about Â£300,000 for that purpose, but it is of no use merely to set aside large sums of money, the money must be expended on carrying out the recommendations with regard to amenities for waterside workers. It may be said by honourable members on the Government side that when a Labour government was in office it did not provide the amenities and reforms suggested by Mr Basten, but I suggest that that is no answer to my charges against the Government. Shipowners will not reduce freights and they want to obtain control of the harbours. Then they could use the old gag that they used in the past. I hope that the Government will not agree to the suggestion that has been put forward by persons interested and by honourable members on the Government side that the Australian Stevedoring In dustry Board should be abolished. Shipping is not playing its full role in the Australian trade. The residents of Lord Howe Island, which is in my electorate, wanted a shipping service, but they could not get one because the trade is not profitable enough. The Government is falling down on its job because it is trying to sell the Gommonwealth line of ships and it is trying to abandon the stevedoring agreement that has brought peace to the waterfront. It is not encouraging a faster turn-round of ships. Why does not the Government carry out its promises and spend the money that it had set aside for the purpose to improve conditions in the waterfront industry? It reduced the levy under the Stevedoring Industry Charge Act from l i d . to 6d. a man hour. It has done nothing to improve the position on the waterfront. The shipping companies have claimed that they cannot afford improvements, bnt such a statement does not agree with their balance-sheets. Why waterside did not the Government carry out the recommendations that were made to it several years ago? It wants to return to the time when waterside workers had to stand outside the wharf gates waiting for work.",27
87,The CHAIRMAN,DEPARTMENT OF SHIPPING AND,"Mr Adermann) Order! I have allowed the honourable member for West Sydney to continue his argument, but I point out to him that the stevedoring industry is associated with the administration of the Minister for Labour and National Service. The honourable member may discuss shipping and transport to Lord Howe Island and similar matters, but the stevedoring industry does not come within the ambit of the present debate.",28
88,Mr MINOGUE,DEPARTMENT OF SHIPPING AND,"I shall direct my attention then to social services and the problems that confront many persons in Sydney. As the honourable memher for Melbourne (Mr Calwell) has stated, this Government has placed the pensioners in a desperate plight. The pensioners should be the first section of the community to receive the attention of the Government. Many are trying to exist on a pension of Â£3 10s. a week. Even honourable members on the Government side will admit that nobody can live on such a pension. The cost of living is constantly rising. I have lost faith in the Government and, indeed, in humanity since I have studied the budget that the Government has produced. I did not believe that there were twenty men in the world who would meet to prepare a budget and treat the pensioners so shamefully as this Government has done. Time and time again, this Government has ignored the pensioners while it has assisted those on high incomes. Last year this Government gave the pensioners an additional payment of 2s. 6d. a week. Then it said, in effect, "" That is enough. We will not give them anything this year "".",28
89,Mr HULME,DEPARTMENT OF SHIPPING AND,What benefit did the honourable member for West Sydney derive from the reductions of income tax?,29
90,Mr MINOGUE,DEPARTMENT OF SHIPPING AND,"I shall tell the honourable member for Petrie (Mr. Hulme) when I receive my income tax assessment. The honourable member might wear a happier smile if he had supported an increase of pensions. He has been appointed chairman of the committee that will investigate the existing - depreciation provisions of the taxation law. He would give money to the farmers and the industrialists who are not dependent on charity, but he would not help the pensioners. I hope that the Government will reconsider its decision on pensions. We should not allow people to starve in this land of plenty. The Government has indicated, however, by its actions during the past three or four years, that it is prepared to do",29
91,The CHAIRMAN,DEPARTMENT OF SHIPPING AND,Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,29
92,Mr DRUMMOND,DEPARTMENT OF SHIPPING AND,"New England) [4.14] - Sometime s when I listen, to honourable members on the Opposition - side, they remind me of a Frenchman who went to a football match with an English friend. The Englishman - watched the game and then said, "" That is a fine player"". The Frenchman looked at the umpire and said, "" Yes, but he plays only one note"". Honourable members appear to have only one note that they can play. I propose to address myself briefly to the problems of the Australian territories. Australia has been described by critics .in .the United Nations and elsewhere as a colonial power because of the way it has treated dependent territories, such as Papua and New Guinea, but it is refreshing to read the Estimates and the concise - and informative statement that has been submitted by the Minister for Territories (Mr Hasluck). I should like to congratulate him upon the enlightened, capable and vigorous administration over which he presides, and to which he gives so much practical sympathy and assistance. I notice, for instance, that the total public expenditure of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea rose from Â£5,500,000 in 1949-50 to Â£8,500,000 in 1953-54 and that the total public expenditure in the current financial year is estimated at Â£10,460,000. It may be asked, "" Well, what is the other side of the story?"" Honourable members, if they care to read this report, will find that the other side of the story is extremely interesting. The value of imports into New Guinea was Â£15,000,000, and exports Â£10,800,000, leaving an adverse trade balance of Â£4,200,000. That indicates that the general charge of colonialism, which is hurled at Australia, is not sustained. What is colonialism? I think that it will be as well if I define it, so that we may get the idea perfectly clear in our own minds, and at the same time, dispose of a few misconceptions which have been apparently cherished by people overseas. I should say that colonialism is a figure of .speech generally used to so. indicate the control of a subject people by a stronger nation, which exploits the weaker community or people for its own gain and comfort. That might have been true, and undoubtedly it was true, not of this country, but of other countries in the past. No powerful nation could escape the charge that, at some period of its existence, it indulged in colonialism. However, I venture to say that a much more enlightened development took place after World War I . Those of us who care to study the policy and accomplishments of Great Britain in regard to the .subject peoples over which it has relinquished control in the last balf century or so, and even before that .time, and the policy which it has pursued towards .subject races which it is leading up to Belf-government, will agree that we are following in the best' traditions that have been established. The report which has been presented to us by the Minister in connection with these Estimates, and the supplementary - explanation, are extraordinarily fine - documents. I do not think that at any time since we took over the control of Papua, or New Guinea itself, we could ' ever have been confronted justifiably with the charge of colonialism. The only charges which could be levelled against us, and I think that we would have difficulty in rebutting them completely, were, first, that between World War I . and World War II . , there was very little recognition of the necessity to do more than maintain a policy of perfect justice towards the native peoples, and bring them very slowly along the road of civilization, and, secondly, that entirely inadequate funds were provided for the extremely fine body of men, like the late Sir Hubert Murray and others who endeavoured to carry out that administration. I may say, in passing, that unfortunately, colonialism is not restricted to subject races. When we examine the growth of our capital cities, and see how we have exploited the rich countryside while giving relatively little in return, we can say that this is an instinct of the human race which has turned inwards in its growth, and that, for the good of Australia, it should turn outwards. However, I know that I cannot continue that line of discussion without being called to order by the Chair, so I propose to address myself to the report which has been presented to us. I notice that a considerable area in the Markham Valley is being made available for settlement. The honourable member for Lawson (Mr Failes) and I visited that district about three years ago, and I was tremendously impressed with the rich possibilities of the valley, which was practically undeveloped. When we moved from the valley to the highlands, we found that the climate could be extremely cold at night. I was glad to have four blankets over me when I stayed one night at Geroka. I came to the conclusion that the oflicers in charge of .the health services were confronted with a problem almost impossible of solution unless an industry could be developed that would enable the people to be properly clothed and housed. Their housing, typical of that of people of early and primitive development, was quite satisfactory until the diseases of civilization began to invade the country. The worse of those diseases there is, I believe, tuberculosis. The people sit round a little fire burning in a confined space in a hut, and crawl into the second division of it at night, and endeavour to keep themselves warm. They do not wash, and they have little clothing. They smear their bodies liberally with pig's grease and wear a fringe. They have no means of living in what we would call a civilized house. Unless they can be accommodated in houses above the ground, with proper ventilation, I do not think that we can successfully combat tuberculosis in those areas. To be successful in this campaign, we must also provide the people with adequate clothing, at least at night-time. One of the developments which I foresee in places like the Markham Valley is the growing of cotton on a big scale, because such an industry would enable a fibre to be produced which would protect the people against the rigours of the climate. I do not make these statements in criticism of the administration. In my opinion, it is taking steps in the right direction. I only hope that those steps are being taken fast enough in the interest of the native peoples. I greatly doubt whether, at this stage of the development of New Guinea, sumcient speed will be made except by companies, which would control a fairly large area, and be able to give the benefits of rapid capital development. I am quite in accord with the principle of preserving the native rights in respect of land, and that kind of thing, but I believe that the people must be brought along as fast as is reasonably possible if they are to survive in a world in which the atomic bomb has, unfortunately, wiped out a lot of much earlier conceptions of what is required. The other matter to which I wish to refer is education. I am greatly interested to note that the department has been speeding up, and apparently greatly improving since I was in New Guinea about three years ago, the provision for a better system of education. I was horrified when I visited one school at that time. I found excellent officers in charge, but children, a few years of age were being taught in the same school with adult men. That is contrary to all the accepted canons of education practice. The Minister for Territories informed us that today there are 3,500 native schools which cater for about 146,000 children. Within the next few years, the Government plans to provide 600 additional native primary schools, 45 native super primary schools and three native technical schools. The whole programme will involve the employment of 1,500 more European and native teachers and workers. The sum of Â£400,000 will be spent on capital works over the next three years and there will be an increase in three years of Â£250,000 in the annual cost of recurringexpenditures on salaries, books, equipment and the like. I am very pleased to see such an expansion of church schools. I hold very strong views on what is necessary for education, particularly of peoples. We are divorcing these natives from their old tribal customs, taboos and practices, and bringing them into our civilization. Unless we give them a grounding in the Christian faith, we shall have only ourselves to blame if we find, poured into that void, queer ideas of the kind that thrive best where there is lack of spiritual instruction. We have behind us in our western civilization 2,000 years of Christianity and 4,000 years of Greek ethics. Those are in the air that we although unfortunately, not enough of that air is breathed. Teachers of native children must be kept in touch with the kind of training that missionaries can give. Any money that we spend on the training of teachers under the guidance of missionaries will be money well spent. We could well follow the example that has been set by Scotland where teachers in training colleges are trained also to give instruction in the Christian religion as well as in secular subjects. If that principle were applied in educating the native peoples under our care, we could Sir. Drummond. be reasonably sure that we were not. creating something which, deservedly, might cause us considerable trouble later on.",29
93,Mr FITZGERALD,DEPARTMENT OF SHIPPING AND,"Phillip) [4.28]. - I listened attentively to what the honourable member for New England (Mr. Drummond) said about the development of New Guinea. That is a matter to which I should like to refer when the Estimates for the Territories are before the committee. I have little objection to anything that the honourable member said, but I believe that we should endeavour tn instill into the mind of private enterprise in New Guinea and our other territories the need to provide reasonable amenities and improved living conditions for the primitive people to whom the honourable member for New England referred. Their friendship and loyalty cannot be ensured if there is to be a continuation of the exploitation to which they have been subjected by white people, particularly private enterprise, over a long period of years. In many parts of the world today we are reaping a harvest of problems and difficulties resulting from our treatment of the people of primitive other races in years gone by as the people of New Guinea are being treated by some white people today. However, I did not intend to deal at this stage with the development of New Guinea. The honourable member for New England has said, that on the issue of social services we play as one band. It is with the same feeling.that I join with other honourable members on this side of the chamber in protesting against the failure of the Government to deal adequately in its budget proposals with the needy sections of the breathe, community. It is a standing disgrace to this country to find that, at a .time when so many members of the community are doing exceedingly well financially, the poor and needy have seldom been worse off. Unfortunately, the Minister for Social Services (Mr MCMahon) is not now in the chamber. As the Estimates for his department are now before'the committee, I thought he would realise that we on this side of the chamber would wish to make some comment on the Government's social services policy, and also perhaps to offer some..advice which might assist him. I intended to appeal to the Minister to heed the pleas of Labour members in framing the measures that he will submit to the Parliament for consideration in the very near future. Honourable members opposite talk persistently about the economic stability which allegedly Atistralia enjoys today. We are told that the basic wage has been pegged and that, as the result, the economy has been stabilized. That is complete nonsense. Within the last week we have read in the press of increased prices for tea, footwear and clothing. I am aware of the public reactions to these increases because I mix freely with my constituents - muc h more freely I am sure than do honourable members opposite. I see my people on Saturday - mornings at Bondi junction, and it is appalling to know the unfortunate situation in which so many members of the community find themselves today. It has been said very truly that adequate provision for the poor is the true test of civilization. I commend that thought to the Minister for Social Services who, I am pleased to note, has returned to the chamber. Although the Government's social services policy has been stated in the budget, if the Minister has any true worth, he will do his best to. see that the legislation of which he will be in charge in this chamber will be in the best interests of the people. I hope time will permit me to give some advice to honourable members opposite and particularly to the Minister about the treatment of hitherto neglected or forgotten members of the community. It is ridiculous for honourable members opposite to compare social services payments today with those made under the Chifley Government because inflation has altered the picture completely. In four and a half years under this Government, wages have doubled. The basic wage has increased by Â£6 a week. Inflation has run riot. Costs have trebled. However, although as I have said the basic wage has increased by Â£6 a week, not one social service payment has increased hy more than 27s. 6d. a week, and only one has reached that figure. Most other increases have been considerably le3S, and in many instances there have been no increases at all. The Minister for Social Services should demand that all sections of the community should share in Australia's prosperity. The honourable member for East Sydney (Mr W a r d ) drew attention to the huge profits that are being made by companies. Whilst it is true that honourable members opposite did not promise in their policy speech to increase invalid and age pensions, they did promise justice, and justice has not been given to the 300,000 base-rate pensioners. They have not been given I d . meat, more, and I hope that the Minister wiil make some provision for these people in the legislation which he will shortly introduce. The rate of pension payable to widows, classified as A pensioners, has been increased by only 30s., which is comparatively a minute amount, since (his Government assumed office, whilst the rate of pension payable to widows in classes B , C and D has been increased by only 20s. during a period in which the basic wage has increased by Â£6 a week. The rates of pensions payable to these widows have not been increased by l d . for many years past. The payment made to A class widow pensioners in respect of their children has also remained unaltered for many years. The Government should not only increase allowances in respect of children of widow pensioners, but it should also provide medical benefits for widows and their children. Indeed, sueh benefits should be made available in respect of all children who are dependants of pensioners. If the Government is concerned about the health of the nation, it will immediately adopt that suggestion. I make a plea for the provision of more assistance to deserted wives who, despite their tragic circumstances, are a neglected section of the community. On this point, I quote the following from an article that was published recently in the press:NA WIVES. The Director of the Family Welfare Bureau. Miss M. Pillinger, said, "" We believe that the pension for the deserted wife should be like the war widow's, giving her the right to earn as much as she can in addition. "" As the law stands at present, she can earn no more than an extra Â£2 a week, although, of course, she has child endowment as well. ""With rents as they, are at the moment,, many women cannot manage. One deserted wife I knowhas Been trying to keep five children on Â£7 10s."".. f entirely endorse tliose sentiments. The fact is that,, at present, a woman must have been deserted for a period of at least six months before she can become eligible for a pension. I urge the Minister to give consideration to shortening' that period of eligibility.",31
94,Mr BOWDEK,NEW DEAL URGED FOB DESERTED,Wive s who prove that they have been deserted have certain rights.,33
95,Mr FITZGERALD,NEW DEAL URGED FOB DESERTED,"A wife may not be able to prove within a period of six months that she has been deserted. In fact,, in many instances, wives who have been deserted by their husbands have the. greatest difficulty in proving that fact. In any event, the. Department of Social Services does notrecognize desertion in respect of periods, under six months. No increase is to be made' in the unemployment and sickness benefit. Government supporters may argue that very little unemployment exists at present. At the same time,, however, there is much sickness in the community. The Government should increase the rate of sickness benefit. In instances in which the husband is. ill and the wife goes out to sickness, benefit is not made available. That position shouldhe remedied by making available to - the husband an allowance, at least equal to the sickness benefit payable, in respect, of a single man. The funeral benefit at the rate of Â£10 was provided by the Curtin Government in 1943 and that benefit has not been increased despite the fact that the cost of a funeral today is not less than Â£40. I also point out that when the cost of a funeral of a pensioner is borne by relatives, upon whom the pensioner was dependent, such persons are not allowed' to claim for those funeral costs as a tion in respect of income tax. The same observation applies in respect of medical and hospital expenses that are incurred by relatives on behalf of aged parents. Pensioners are also charged the cost, of conveyance by ambulance services. The Government should subsidize the cost of those services in order to assist invalid, age and widow pensioners. A nation which is as rich as Australia should, ensure that aged people in the community shall not beneglected.. The policy of. the Australian Labour party is to ensurethat all aged persons in the community shall be enabled to. end their days, under decent living conditions. If the' Minister for Social Servicesj. whohas' just assumed his portfolio,, desires to make a name for himself he. has the opportunity to do so by fighting for the rights of pensioners in the: ways that members on this side of the chamber have indicated.",33
96,The CHAIRMAN,NEW DEAL URGED FOB DESERTED,Order ! The honourable member's time has expired.,33
97,Mr WENTWORTH,NEW DEAL URGED FOB DESERTED,"(Mackellar). [4.43] - I mentioned earlier that I hoped, as the. groups of Estimates went through, to mention in regard to each of them something that might be done in order to ensure a*, greater measure of 1 safety for this country in the. event of an atomic: attack. I pointed out that by making provision to prevent, atomic attack, this country and other countries would make such an attack, less likely, that to make provision, against it, would, to some extent, also assure that such, an attack would not come. Although many things that one would suggest should be done are expensive and would take some work, time to carry through,, some of the measures that could be suggested would not be very expensive nor would they take very much time to carry through. In the latter category, I have in mind matters that relate to* the Estimates, now before the committee, in respect of the Department, of Commerce and Agriculture and the Department, of Shipping and Transport which would not involve very much additional expenditure. Indeed, if we could get countries, overseas to adopt these arrangements, as principles, they would to some' extentin our case pay for themselves by bringing to this deduc- country additional income by way of export prices. First, in regard to the Department of Commerce and Agriculture, the point I want to make is that stores should be constituted andkept outside the main centres of population. We need decentralized stores, and particularly do we need decentralized stores of manufactured goods, because I think it is - not going to be possible to shift in any reasonable time any significant 'proportion of our key factories, which, almost without exception, are in the capital cities and the main centres of population. Since we cannot hope to shift the factories in time, we should be constituting, outside the vulnerable - centres, stores of the goods our factories make and also, of course, of manufactured imported goods that we do not make ourselves. It cannot he emphasized too strongly that preparations for defence must be made before any crisis - occurs, if they are to be effective. In the past, there has been breathing space. There has been time. Defence preparations made after the outbreak of a war were effective. But that is not necessarily true any longer.' The only preparations that may be possible nowadays are preparations made before the outbreak of a war. gest, in the first place, therefore that stores - of essential commodities and manufactured goods should be constituted and kept in places outside our main centres - of population, sufficiently decentralized so that no small number of bombs can wipe them out in their entirety. We must make provision for maintaining our national life in the event of such an emergency. If we make sueh provision, then, by that ""very provision, the emergency will he less likely to occur. I emphasize again that it is only those who are likely to be knocked out by the first blow who are likely to suffer ""that blow. Tf we give to Bussia the feeling that we can survive the first blow and win in the next round, Bussia may be made less willing to deliver the first blow. One might think that there is not a great necessity in Australia to make provision for foodstuffs because, as a primary producing ""country, we have that - provision already in existence in the shape of primary producing units. However, I shall make one .practical observation on this subject. Tn the past, our primary industries, at a pinch, could switch back to the draught horse and maintain their production in that ""fashion. ""But that is not possible today. If our oil supplies were entirely cut off-'that is by no means impossible-and if , concurrently, there were no facilities for the repair of tractors and other machinery, it would be quite difficult, even in Australia, to maintain primary production. I know that, in the event of an emergency, it would not be necessary to provide food for our full population, because, unhappily, in the kind of emergency which I envisage, our population would be reduced by at least 50 per cent. But it does seem to be only elementary prudence to establish at decentralized points in the country adequate stocks of oil, oil products, tractors and primary moving machinery. Although I have spoken of the food position in Australia, the food position in some countries overseas is quite different. In each food-importing country, nearly all stocks of food are held in warehouses at main centres. Therefore, they would be unavailable for the population, even for I sug- a depleted population, in the event of a widespread attack. I suggest to all foodimporting countries that it would be the merest prudence to establish decentralized food stores at numerous locations away from the main population centres. If that were done, all the so-called surpluses of foodstuffs which exist at present in the world would disappear in a moment, because all would be needed. I know that one must look at this problem in the light of technological considerations, such as methods of preserving food, but even after making that allowance, I suggest that if the main food importing countries were to do the thing which is the merest prudence, that is, to set about establishing, at widespread locations, for the survival of their populations, stocks of food in addition to those they hold now, the so-called surpluses of wheat, butter and other commodities held in the world would vanish overnight. That should be done straight away, not next year or - the year after. I suggest that this Government, although its actions might not be significant taken alone, should give a lead which might set in train a significant movement throughout the world. I turn to the Department of Shipping and Transport. I have already said that stocks of oil and vehicles and vehicle repair facilities should be established and maintained at numerousplaces outside the main centres of population. Let me remind the committee that shipping is particularly vulnerable to atomic attack - no t to ttUack on the ships themselves but on the ports which service them. In Australia, particularly on the east and south-east coasts, there are relatively few ports. No port could survive the dropping on it of one atomic bomb. It is, of course, particularly easy to deliver a bomb on a port. Unfortunately, it may well be that the lingering radio-activity associated with the explosion of an atomic bomb under salt water would keep a port out of action for many months. But I do not think that is the main consideration. The main consideration is that port installations, which are centralized, would be almost totally destroyed and the ports themselves put out of action. In those circumstances, would it not be only elementary prudence to establish, at this time a lightering service, with craft, such as Landing Ships (Tank) which could be used in non-developed ports, and could put into little beaches, and could give us sea transport without port installations? Some preparations, which would not in themselves be of very much significance, could helj> - towards the purpose I have in mind. For example, a survey, a bit of road work, so to speak, of a very minor character, if done in the right place and in time, could make all the difference. Let us remember that these things must be done before the crisis occurs, or not at all. E have pointed out to honourable members previously that, whereas shipping is vulnerable at the nodal points of thÂ« ports, rail and road transport are not vulnerable to the same degree, because a bomb operates over an area, not along a line. For that reason it is proper that we should be looking to roads and railways as our means of emergency transport. In that connection I again come back to the proposition of strategic stores in large quantities at decentralized points. This adds force to the case for some limited standardization of trunk railways. I was interested to hear the remarks made a few moments ago by the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr. Turner) concerning the financing of a proposition of this character. wholeheartedly agree with him. We have not sufficiently exploited all the Mr Wentworth. opportunities that lie open to us in the International Bank for Beconstruction and Development. I believe that a programme of limited standardization of rail gauges, about which I have spoken in this chamber on previous occasions, not only stands on its own feet as a commercial and economic proposition, but is also necessary as an emergency defence measure for the reasons of which I have spoken. I believe that, as the honourable member for Bradfield has said, if we made the proper approaches overseas we should obtain now the finance necessary to carry out such a programme, ns well as materials which, although not scarce a year ago, are in critically short supply now, particularly rails and, to some degree, steel sleepers and locomotives. It is farcical to allow the two main breaks of rail gauge to remain in existence. I regard the construction of a standardized line on the shoTt section between Broken Hill and Port Pirie, in order to link the central Australia system and the Trans-Australia system with the New South Wales system, and the standardization of the short section from Albury into Melbourne, as two of the highest priority jobs that face us in connection with rail standardization. I should also like to see standardized the Kalgoorlie to Fremantle section, as well as the Port Pirie to Adelaide section. The construction of the Port Pirie to Adelaide section is a minor matter. If those works were done we would have limited standardization that would enable us to have transport facilities that would tide us over if our ports were put out of action. I could say more along the same lines, but I simply w anted to put the thesis r that whilst there are some things which it might be outside our financial capacity to do, in our desire to protect ourselves against atomic danger, there are others, of the kind that I have mentioned, which are cheap and easy to do, which could be put in hand straight away, which do not lie outside our financial capacity, and which would give us, not complete security, but some security.",33

100,Mr CREMEAN,NEW DEAL URGED FOB DESERTED,"Hoddle) [8.0] Prior to the suspension of the sitting, a great variety of subjects had been discussed by the committee, and whilst I do not wish to criticize the remarks that have heen made by honourable members in connection with the Estimates for the group of departments with which the committee is dealing, it is my purpose to bring the debate back to the administration and scope of the Department of Social Services. In common with my colleague, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean), I wish to pay a tribute to the excellence of the service that is rendered by that department. I do not think that any honourable member will assert that the department could be excelled for humanitarian outlook, efficiency, promptness and despatch. I think, however, with some little knowledge of the department, that certain matters associated with its administration might be improved with advantage to the comniunity generally. I suggest to the Minister for Social Services (Mr. MCMahon) that the appointment of additional magistrates and Commonwealth medical referees might be considered. I make that suggestion because I know that the magisterial staff and those concerned with the examination of claims are sadly overworked at the present time. I believe that the position could be improved considerably by making additional appointments, such as those I have suggested. Consideration might also be given to the matter of information sheets, about which a question was directed to the Minister in the Parliament some time ago. As honourable members are aware, an information sheet is included in the claim papers which applicants for pensions obtain from post offices. As honourable members also know, many changes take place in connection with the eligibility of persons for pensions. As a result, the information sheet which is distributed with the claim papers sometimes contains information which is out of date. I suggest that magistrates, when hearing claims, should have up-to-date information sheets to give to claimants when their claims are being investigated. In the short time at my disposal, I wish/to'refer to the excellent work that is being done at "" Coonac the rehabilitation centre in Victoria, and at similar centres in other parts of the Commonwealth. It is greatly to the credit of previous Labour administrations that they had sufficient vision to ensure that invalids were not necessarily condemned to a life of perpetual servitude, as it were, and unending receipt of a pension. As a consequence of that far-sightedness, these rehabilitation centres were established. It is true that this Government has carried on that good work, but major credit for their establishment is due to personal previous Labour governments. I note with a great deal of satisfaction that, according to the twelfth report submitted by the Director-General of Social Services, during the years 1950-51, 1951-52 and 1952-53, more than 3,500 people who had been in receipt of invalid pension, unemployment benefit, or sickness benefit were returned to civil life because of the work of rehabilitation performed at the centres to which I have referred. Not a great deal has been said in this Parliament about such work, and it is my pleasure to pay a tribute where it is really deserved. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports asked why it was necessary for a claimant in the claim papers to submit a declaration by a person who has known the claimant for a lengthy period. I suggest to the honourable member that it is done to establish the bona fide3 of the claimant and to show that some person knows that he has been a resident in Australia for a certain statutory period. Whilst on that subject, perhaps the Minister would consider dispensing with the minimum of twenty years in the case of a claim for an age pension, and five years in the case of a claim for an invalid pension, in certain instances, such as in the case of a person who had followed a nomadic existence and who was unable, at the time of filling in - the claim papers, to obtain a declaration by a person who had known him for the statutory period. A number of instances come to my notice, and I am sure they also come to the notice of other honourable members, of claimants who have moved about from State to State and who are unable to find any one to declare that he has known the claimant for twenty years or five years, as the case may be. Unless such a declaration is made, claimants are not able to obtain pensions. The. Minister might consider shortening the statutory period in such cases. In my opinion, the work of the Department of Social Services is excellently performed. The members of the staff have a very keen comprehension of their duties and are animated by the highest motives. The work which is performed in accordance with statutory obligations is carried out extremely well. As I have stated previously in this chamber, the position of social services in the Commonwealth today is of unparalleled importance. In the age and invalid, field there are almost 500,000 pensioners. There are more than that number of war pensioners from both world wars, while service pensioners number 20,000. There are approximately 18,000 persons in receipt of pensions as wives of invalid pensioners, whilst the number of civilian widow pensioners exceeds 41,000. The total of all classes of pensioners; excluding persons receiving' tuberculosis allowance and child endowment, is more than 1,113,000, or almost one-ninth of the total population. The fact that such a. proportion of the community is in receipt of. social services benefits cannot be lightly ignored by this Government. Nevertheless, it has been almost completely disregarded by the Government, ""Whilst it is' true that the rate of age and invalid, pension has increased from Â£2 2s. 6d. a week to Â£3 10s. a week in the 3pace of four years; it must not be forgotten, that, side by side with that increase, amazing and unparalleled inflation of the economy has occurred - The result is that the Â£3 10s; of 1954 does not purchase nearly as much as did the Â£2 2s. 6d. of 1950 or the end of 1949. This Government stands indicted because of its failure to comprehend the position, of those people who are in receipt of the existence level social service benefits that it hands out to them. Like some other honourable members, I represent a. poor electorate. Over 3,500 people in that electorate are dependent upon the Government's contribution, towards making their lives happier. I defy any. supporterof the Government to tell me, or anybody else, how a man or a woman can exist ilr. Cremean. on Â£3 10s. a week, or howa married couple can exist on Â£7 a week. When the rising cost of thenecessities of life are taken into account, how can the Government contend that it has done a fair thing for those people who are in receipt of social services benefits I One Opposition member directed attention to the position of civilian widows. There are 41,000 civilian widows who receive nothing by way of increases from the Government's comprehensive field of social services benefits. The payment of widows' pensions was introduced hy a. Labour government, and at no time during the history of a Labour government did those pensions ever fall below an amount that was equal to one-third of the basic wage. At one stage, widows' pensions in category A were equal to 41 per cent, of the basic wage. To-day, they are equal to only 29 per cent, of the basic wage, but widows are expected to bring up a family and maintain themselves on that beggarly contribution, plus child endowment. How can the Government contend that it is animated by humanitarian impulses ? As has been stated so often in. this chamber, if the Australian. Labour, party did not speak for the people who are in receipt of social services benefits, no Government supporter would raise his voice on their behalf, I suggest that at least, when ancillary bills are introduced to providefor a liberalization of. the social services benefits means: test, further consideration should be given: to raising therate of. pension, so that it bears the same relationship, to the basic wage that it bore during the years when Labour was in office. I repeat that consideration should Be. given to the fact that one-ninth of the total number of 1 1 persons in the community are in receipt of social services benefits, that nearly half a million of those people are' in receipt of. age and invalid pensions) and that over half a million of them are in receipt of warpensions. Moreover, if the wherewithal is provided, members should be assured that the Department of Social Services"" will distribute the money properly,, benevolently; and in accordance with the spirit that: should animate a progressive and humanitarian govern! ment.",36
101,Mr WIGHT,NEW DEAL URGED FOB DESERTED,"Lilley) [8.15] - It is a pity that the honourable member for Hoddle (Mr Cremean) spoiled what otherwise appeared to be a good analysis of the social services problem by suggesting that there had been some degree of J pettiness on the part of the Government in refusing to increase the age pension. I do not think that there is anybody in the Parliament who would not like to think that, at the present time, or at any other time, we should make to age pensioners and other deserving people a social service payment equivalent to the basic wage, but it must be remembered that the money must be contributed from within the economy of the country, and that there is a limit to the sum that can be contributed for social services benefits. We know full well that, in the policy speech that was delivered by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Evatt) during the recent general election campaign, absolutely no consideration was given to that aspect of the matter. I think it is appropriate that, reference should be made to the fact that the Leader of the Opposition, as the mouthpiece of the Australian Lahour party, suggested that that party was prepared to abolish the means test if it. were returned to office. We must recognize the fact that there are only approximately 3,500,000 taxpayers in this country, and that the estimated cost of honoring the promises that were made by the Leader of the Opposition is between Â£350,000,000 and Â£400,000,000. The Labour party, which claims to represent the workers of this country, would have had to take an average of Â£2 a week from the pay envelope of every worker to finance the scheme; A government which took that action, far from ensuring a state' of social justice, would perpetrate a great social injustice. There would haveheen introduced a state of affairs in which a man who had an income of Â£14 or Â£15 a week, and who maintained a wife and four of five children, would have been required to providemoney from his pay envelope for a social services payment to some very wealthy person who might not have retired from employment. Under the policy that was enunciated by the Leader of the Opposition, even the managing director of Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, which has been referred to by the socialist party as the acme of the capitalist system, would have been able to demand, at the age of 65 years, that a Labour government should take money from the pay envelope of a man on Â£14 or Â£15 a week to provide a supplementary income for himself. That is not social justice, but this Government has done its utmost to establish a state of social justice in the community. Although the Government recognizes that it is desirable to abolish the means test if the economy can stand it, it realizes that it cannot possibly do so at the present time, but it has done its utmost to eliminate anomalies. In fact, it can claim that it has done something which goes beyond the promises of the socialists who sit on the opposite side of the chamber. The social services payments that were made by the Labour Government amounted to only Â£80,000,000 a year. To-day, those payments total Â£184,000,000 a year. Not only has this Government increased the payments from Â£2 2s. 6d. a week to Â£3 10s. a week to age pensioners, but also it has made it possible for more than 100,000 people who are on low incomes', or who are aged or distressed financially, to he brought within the scheme. Whilst we acknowledge that we have not yet been able to achieve the ultimate in social services benefits, the fact is that the Government has, with every budget that the Treasurer has presented, liberalized the means test to the utmost that the economy can support. We acknowledge also that there are anomalies in the social services legislation, but we are striving to eliminate them. I shall refer to three specific anomalies, which I ask the Minister for Social Services to consider very seriously with the object of having them rectified. I shall discuss first the case of a man who has passed the retiring age of 65 years. If he continued to work beyond that age but then, through ill health or injury, was forced to relinquish his employment, he is entitled to receive the age pension of Â£3 10s. a week if his incapacity is less than 85 per cent. If his incapacity were greater than 85 per cent., he would be eligible for an invalid pension. If wife is between 55 and 60 years of age, she is not eligible for any social services payments. In such circumstances, the wife, who has probably spent most of her life in raising a family and looking after the home, is obliged to register for employment because she is not entitled to receive either the allowance paid to the wife of an invalid pensioner or the age pension. Por this reason, the total income of the couple is only Â£3 10s. a week. Had the husband been declared to be 85 per cent, or more incapacitated, he would have been regarded as permanently and totally unemployable and his wife could then have obtained an allowance. I suggest that a woman of that age, who has devoted many years to the work of looking after a family and maintaining a home, is not in a position to compete for a job in the labour market. Furthermore, I think it is wrong that a woman of that age, without commercial experience, should be expected to go and register for employment. There should be a special provision in the social services legislation to give a very wide discretionary power, either to the Minister or to the Director-General of Social Services, so that special consideration could be given to specific cases of that nature and an allowance paid to the woman in order to bring the total income of the couple to Â£7 a week. Another anomaly affects a widow or a widower of advanced years who has continued to live in the old family home but who, because of failing health or age, has been unable to continue to care for herself or himself, and therefore is forced to live with a son or daughter. Because such a. man, for example, owns his own home, whether he rents it to a tenant or leaves the place empty, he is precluded under the law from receiving an age pension. Under today's valuations, a family home more often than not exceeds in value the maximum permissible under the property means test. The mere fact that the person concerned owns the home but does not live in it debars him from the right to social services payments. Special sideration should be given to people who are forced to leave their homes because of Mr Wight. ill health, and they should be eligible his to receive ^the age pension if they are above the"" statutory age. I believe sincerely that this is far more important than any further increase in the rate of pension. These anomalies are of the utmost importance and they should be given very urgent and earnest consideration. Whenever the scope of the social services legislation is widened, greater and even greater anomalies are created. So much is this so that, under the legislation that was foreshadowed in the Treasurer's budget speech, a man and his wife with assets to the value of Â£12,000 will be able to obtain the age pension if their funds have been invested in one special manner. In other words, a very great anomaly will be created, because most people who bave assets to the value of only Â£2,000 or Â£3,000 will continue to be debarred from social services benefits simply because their money is not invested in that peculiar manner. I shall specify the actual manner in which a married couple with, say, Â£12,000 will be able to invest their funds without disqualifying themselves from the right to draw the age pension. First of all, they must own and live in a home valued at Â£5,100. They must then have savings in the form of an annuity-somethin g in which I , as a Liberal, do not believe. The forcing of an old couple to invest their savings in an annuity is, in my opinion, harsh and unjust. However, if they have invested savings amounting to Â£3,500 in an annuity, and if, in addition, they have furniture and personal effects valued at Â£1,500, insurance policies valued at Â£1,500 and Â£400 cash in the bank, bringing the total value of their assets to Â£12,000, they will be eligible to receive the age pension. Yet an aged man and wife with Â£2,000 or Â£3,000 that is not so invested, and who own their own home but are forced by circumstances of ill health to live with a son elsewhere, will continue to be deprived of social justice! They can, of course, overcome the obstacle by adopting the morally dishonest method of investing every penny they have in a string of pearls, a diamond conring, or perhaps some very expensive oil paintings to hang on the walls of their son's home. If their savings are invested entirely in personal effects of that sort, they are entitled to social services benefits, even if the full value of those effects is Â£12,000. This is a glaring anomaly. The position that exists today encourages people to be morally dishonest.",38
102,The CHAIRMAN,NEW DEAL URGED FOB DESERTED,Order! honourable member's time has expired.,40
103,Mr DUTHIE,NEW DEAL URGED FOB DESERTED,"Wilmot) [8.30] - I wish to direct the attention of the mittee to the grave position that has arisen in connection with our balance of payBritish ments in Great Britain, and exports that country and other countries. Commonwealth Statistician, Mr S. R. Carver, stated in his latest report that, up to the 30th June last, we had incurred a current account deficit of Â£99,900,000 in the United Kingdom. This is the reveal fourth occasion within a period years that our balance of trade with Great Britain has been in deficit by about Â£100,000,000. Mr Carver has pointed out that the total current deficit in balance of payments with Great Britain in the six years is Â£669,000,000. This formidable and .dangerous figure must cause grave uneasiness and disquiet. The Ottawa trade agreement of 1933 has resulted in one-way traffic, with Australia on the deficit end. Most of the trade preferences that Australia granted to Great Britain under that agreement are still effective, but the value of reciprocal preferences that Australia received has almost appeared. That is why we are so greatly concerned about the forthcoming review, in Ottawa, of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The grim truth that, whilst most of Australia's imports come from Great Britain, that country buys freely from Australia's competitors in metal and primary produce markets. Of all our farm produce, only wool and meat are assured of a firm market Great Britain. Wool is not protected the Ottawa agreement, and meat is tected by a long-term contract. Great Britain buys wheat from North America, butter from the United States of America, wine from Europe, and small fruits from South Africa-thu s crippling the Tasshould manian small fruits industry.",40
104,Mr GULLETT,NEW DEAL URGED FOB DESERTED,"The South African commissioners farmers have to live, too.",40
105,Mr DUTHIE,NEW DEAL URGED FOB DESERTED,"The honourable member for Henty (Mr Gullett) usually interjects pleasantly during my speeches, but he is not so pleasant when other honourable members interject while he is delivering a speech. The fact is that South African berry fruits can be offered The for sale on the English market at Â£84 a ton, compared with Â£105 a ton for Tasmanian berry fruits. It was only to be comexpected, therefore, that South Africa would capture that market from us. As protection for our dried fruits is to now almost non-existent, the dried The fruits industry is facing its worse crisis for twenty years. Marketing has become a nightmare for Australia. Unless there is an improvement of our trade relations with Great Britain, our balance of payments in this financial year may an even worse position than did the of six figures that I cited. It is somewhat ironical that Australia is depending for its international solvency on the trade goodwill of foreign counlast tries, which the Ottawa agreement aimed at elbowing out of the way. I shall cite further figures. In actual fact, our trade with other countries built up a credit balance of Â£157,900,000, and nearly counter-balanced our deficit in trade with Great Britain, the dollar area, and other sterling countries. But, if the present trend continues, Australia will have to seek new markets and reach out for disincreased trade with India, Pakistan, Ceylon, Indonesia and South-East Asia - eve n red China and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. We have already trade representation in India, Pakistan, is Ceylon, Indonesia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Japan, the Philippines and red China. There is an interesting position in relation to the last-mentioned country. I should like the Minister for Air (Mr. Townley) to inform me whether our trade in commissioner in red China, for whom by financial provision is made in the proproposed vote for the Department of Trade and Commerce, is stationed at Peking.",40
106,Mr TOWNLEY,NEW DEAL URGED FOB DESERTED,No .,40
107,Mr DUTHIE,NEW DEAL URGED FOB DESERTED,"That is where he be located. We still have no trade representation in Burma, Thailand, Laos, or Cambodia. We should appoint trade to those countries, in order to encourage them to trade with Australia. That would be one of the best ways of checking the spread of communism. If we cannot win battles by military means, because no battles are being fought at present,.we should try to win some on the trade front in South-East Asia. Supporters of the Government should endeavour to be constructive instead of continuing to direct attention to - our possible danger from red China.",40
108,Mr BKAND,NEW DEAL URGED FOB DESERTED,Trad e missions would help.,41
109,Mr DUTHIE,NEW DEAL URGED FOB DESERTED,"I agree wholeheartedly. Many people in Australia do not imagine that we are trading with red China. When the subject is raised they - exclaim, "" Trading with a Communist - country? Tut, t u t ! "" A study of the figures in relation to our trade with Russia shows much of the political talking of honourable members opposite to be hypocrisy. In the five years since 1948-49, when the present regime in China took over, we have exported to that country goods to the value of Â£11,130,480. Our imports from China - during the same period were valued at Â£3,754,508. (Since 1945, we have imported from Russia goods to the value of Â£3,133,913, and exported to that country goods to the value of Â£37,653,833. Our imports from China have increased almost threefold since 1939-40, and our exports to that country have - dropped by about 50 per cent. Whilst our imports from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics have increased by 800 per cent, since 1945, from Â£89,000 to Â£731,000, our exports to that country have increased 3,284 times since 1946from Â£446 to Â£1,642,354. I believe that this has been for the good, and I hope that Australia will continue to increase its volume of trade with those two countries. But, the figures that I have cited show how foolish it is for honourable members - opposite to try to give the impression to the Australian people that, because Australia is anti-Communist, it would be a terrible thing for us to trade with those - countries. All governments are practical. That is why we have trade commissioners in various countries. Whilst we might not agree with the political philosophy of red China, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, or Spain, we continue to trade-quite rightly-wit h those countries. We should build up our trade. Because of our deficit in trade with the United Kingdom, we have to find other trade channels for our primary products or our primary producers will have no sure future whatever.",41
110,Mr BOWDEN,NEW DEAL URGED FOB DESERTED,What about Japan ?,41
111,Mr DUTHIE,NEW DEAL URGED FOB DESERTED,Our trade with Japan is continuing at a great rate and I am not averse to that. We are trading with Germany and Italy. We traded with them up .to the day that war broke out.,41
112,Mr KEON,NEW DEAL URGED FOB DESERTED,This Government would trade with the devil.,41
113,Mr DUTHIE,NEW DEAL URGED FOB DESERTED,"Perhaps it would. However, I want to stress the danger of the trend of our trade relations with the United Kingdom and I want to urge the Government to increase our trade with red China and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. In the long run, that might be the best way to prevent a third world war. Perhaps, in that way, we could build up between ourselves and those countries some understanding on a trading level even if we cannot agree with their political philosophies. I now wish to refer to the Estimates for the Department of Shipping and Transport and to stress to the Government the desire of the Tasmanian people as expressed by the Tasmanian Farmers Federation, chambers of manufactures and retailers associations, for this Government to reconstitute the Commonwealth - shipping line as it was established by the lute William Morris Hughes when Prime Minister. The line which the late Mr. Hughes founded had been sold out to big English combines for a song by 1.929. Honourable members on this side of the chamber believe that the present Government was right in deciding not to sell Commonwealth ships. Opposition members have heen fighting to save this shipping line from being sold out to private enterprise as the previous line was sold out. It is not sufficient merely to retain the line and charter the 39 Commonwealth owned vessels to private shipping companies, which are restricting the full effectiveness of these ships. The Opposition wants the Government to operate the Commonwealth shipping line as a separate entity, trading in competition with the private lines around our coast. We want the Commonwealth shipping line to be built up into the same kind of organization a3 Trans-Australia Airlines. The Commonwealth shipping line should operate under a board or commission, separately from the private shipping companies. That is the only logical course to take with Commonwealth ships since the Government has decided not to j sell them. If the Government adopts I this suggestion, the States that are so I dependent on shipping, will have a chance to get the ships where they are needed niost urgently. At present they are going wherever the profits are greatest. Only when the Commonwealth shipping line operates Commonwealth ships itself will they be of maximum value to Tasmania, Queensland and Western Australia,, the States that are so dependent on ships for their economical survival, I again sincerely stress that the Government should consider reconstituting the Commonwealth shipping line, which is not now competing with private ships. The Government has often stated that it believes in competition. Here is a chance to put its philosophy into practice. Mr BOWDEN . (Gippsland) [8.45] The honourable member for Wilmot (Mr. Duthie) disproved the statement by honourable member for New England (Mr Drummond) that the Opposition was a brass band which only blew one ment note, and that that note was pensions. I invalid want to get back on to the rails and say something about pensions, a subject with which you may be rather familiar by now, Mr Chairman. The Opposition lengthy reply, saidhas been blowing little more than one note and, through long usage and lack and of sincerity, that note has beof come a little raucous and discordant. Exactly the same speeches are made years on this subject by Opposition memany bers each year. The Government increased pensions by 7s. 6d. in two successive years and by 10s. and the two following years. The speeches were made on those occasions by OpposiHonorable tion members were similar to the speeches that they have made in this debate. the occasion of each rise in pensions, Opposition stated that the pensioners were not getting enough. The Opposition propagates the belief that pensions R -[47 ] always rise, regardless of the cost of living or any other factor. That is a dishonest approach to a subject which should be treated on a non-party basis. Government, supporters recognize that a Â£3 10s. a week pension is a bare minimum. But pensions should be increased for one of two reasons, either that the cost of living is increasing or for the .sake of raising, them. A demarcation line must be drawn somewhere. Opposition members propagate the idea that pensions should always be raised for the sake of raising them. They say that the cost of living is going up. Yet the last two revisions of the C series index indicated that the cost of living was falling. The Opposition has contended that the cost of living is rising but it makes that assertion only because without that claim it is completely bogged down and lost. Opposition members stated that the price of meat had increased. Everybody knows that the Prices Commissioner in New South Wales has been overridden by the Minister in charge of prices and that the price of meat has not risen. In order to answer the Opposition's charge, I shall read a question which was asked of the Treasurer in the. last Labour Government by Mr Turnbull on the 14th the June, 1949, which was as follows:I ask the Treasurer whether the Governintends to increase the rate of age and pensions . . . will the - Government ensure that the new rate shall have some practical relation to the cost of living? The then Treasurer, in the course of a The law provided at one time that pension rates must he related to the cost of living must rise or fall, according to variations the cost of living index figures. However, when C series index figures fell about three ago there was a great protest against reductions of pensions. As a result, the provision that related pensions to the cost of living was removed from the law. Therefore, the pension rates are not now affected 2s. 6d. in by the cost of living. that That reply was given by the late Right J. B. Chifley, a gentleman to whom the Opposition are never tired of On referring as a paragon of political the excellence. Yet every speech that the Opposition has made on this subject serves to repudiate the decision that he must made. I shall give the committee one more illustration of the Opposition's complete insincerity in its approach to this subject. During the last general election campaign the Australian Labour party promised to give pensions to every one. It promised also to increase the age pension by 10s. a week, which, according to the present arguments of Opposition members, would leave the age pension still at starvation level. The abundance of money that Labour was going to acquire by some means would have enabled it. to give age pensioners double the suggested pension rate of Â£4 a week, but the Australian Labour party decided not to benefit them, and to give pensions to all wealthy persons who do not need them. That demonstrates the Opposition's lack of sincerity. Opposition members moan about the great profits that have been made by General Motors-Holden's Limited, but Labour intended to make the directors of that company, among others, eligible for pensions, and. refused to give ls. more to the citizens who need a little extra to buy food, blankets and clothing. Why does the Australian Labour party adopt this attitude ? There is only one answer. A complete economic collapse in Australia offers that party its only prospect of attaining office again, and any means by which that economic collapse can he brought about, if it will enhance Labour's election prospects, receives the wholehearted support of Opposition members. Australia's economy is very finely a whole week. balanced at present, and indiscreet action could cause serious embarrassment, and possibly an economic crisis. What sense of responsibility does the Australian Lahour party exhibit in this delicate tion? It is a source of everlasting amazement to me to think that in this democracy a body of men who claim represent at least 50 per cent, of the people can so singularly fail to entertain any sense of responsibility in national affairs. Everything that this Governback. ment has done for the good of Australia ha 3 been opposed to the last ditch by Opposition members, who should be workers, equally as responsible as are Government supporters. In the immediate post-war years we enjoyed unprecedented prosimmeasurably perity, and markets for our goods today. were readily available throughout the Mr Bowden. world, not because other countries particularly wanted to buy from us, but because, as victims of war devastation, they could not produce enough for themselves. Australia profited mainly because it emerged from the two world wars with its economy unimpaired and in a condition to take advantage of the shortages that occurred in countries that were unable to speedily to rehabilitate themselves after years of devastation had ruined their economies. But the warshattered countries have overcome their production problems. They are now selling in competition with Australian goods the at considerably lower prices and are pushing Australia out of the established markets for many of our primary products. Probably 85 per cent, of the proceeds of Australia's export trade comes from tlic sale qf primary products, which largely maintain the trade balance about which honourable members opposite are always talking. Opposition member* should show more concern for the welfare of the primary industries upon which the nation's prosperity depends. The Australian skilled worker in one industry, the products of which have been driven out of overseas markets by competition, if he works on Sunday, at double or treble rates, whichever are applicable, and taking into account his margin for skill, and the like, earns more money on the Sunday than does his opposite number in the competitor country in",41
114,Mr CURTIN,NEW DEAL URGED FOB DESERTED,So he should.,43
115,Mr BOWDEN,NEW DEAL URGED FOB DESERTED,"The ""Quiz Kids'' know more about these matters than does situathe honourable member. How can we maintain our overseas markets if our costs are so much liigher than are those to in other countries? Many markets are already lost to Australia, and we shall need to proceed carefully and reduce costs if we are ever to win those markets What sense of responsibility does the Opposition show ? It is in fact adopting an attitude that is dangerous to the because if Australia's overseas markets are lost and a collapse of the economy follows, the workers will be worse off than they are Some idea of the attitude of the Australian Labour party may be gauged from the attempt this afternoon of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Evatt), who leads the representatives of that party in this chamber, to get the Government, without first considering evidence about the merits of the proposal, to commit itself to a course of action that would inevitably increase costs. The Opposition continually blows a discordant note on its brass whistle as it fights the Government with the one weapon that it has been able to lay its hands on. If this Government has succeeded in tying the Opposition down on any one issue, it has a highly 1 meritorious achievement to its credit, and it deserves the good wishes of the community. I ask the people to look at the facts for themselves and not swallow blindly the story that the Australian Labour party tells about pensions. I can tell honourable members opposite that many pensioners whom I know personally resent the spotlighting of their distress in this chamber for purely political purposes. Many of them have played a big part in the development of Australia, and though they are now elderly they have not lost their sense of responsibility. They regard as highly offensive thÂ« Australian Labour party's implication that their votes can be bought for a few miserable shillings by a party that has no constructive policy to ventilate in the Parliament.  honourable member for Gippsland (Mr. Bowden) concluded his remarks on a mean note and accused the Australian Labour party of reflecting on pensioners and persons who should he eligible for pensions. He alleged that the Australian Labour party implied that the votes of those people could be bought. Let us see what are the views of the Liberal party. I hold in my hand an advertisement that was published in the Sydney Morning Herald. It reads, in partThe Liberal party will maintain pensionsand in black typewithout the means test! Yet we on this side of the chamber are "" slang-whanged "", as we were during the recent general election campaign, because the abolition of the means test was a cardinal feature of the Australian Labour party's election policy. The Liberal party made the promise that was embodied in that advertisement during an election campaign at a time when Australia's economy had been well stabilized by the Curtin and Chifley Labour Governments. The Liberal party was at that time anxious to attain office and it dangled that bait before age pensioners and others who might become eligible for pensions. In the words of the honourable member for Gippsland, the Liberal party believed that the votes of those people could be bought for a few shillings. He and the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Wight) have the effrontery, in the face of the Liberal party's promise, to deprecate any undertaking by the Australian Labour party, in the present condition of our economy, to abolish the means test, as Labour promised to do during the recent general election campaign.",43
116,Mr WIGHT,NEW DEAL URGED FOB DESERTED,"Some members of the Australian Labour party also believed that abolition of the means test would be impossible.  porters continually point the finger of scorn at Opposition members and declare that the Australian Lahour party allows no opportunity, within its ranks, for freedom of opinion. But because some members of the Australian Lahour party at present do not support the great majority of the party's members in advocating the abolition of the means test, the honourable member for Lilley now points the finger of scorn at the Australian Labour party for allowing some of its members the liberty to express their own thoughts on this question. That freedom of expression does not for one moment discount my argument and my demonstration of the fact that the Liberal party, to which the honourable member belongs, and which the honourable member for Gippsland supports, in 1946, dangled before the electors, and broadcast throughout Australia, a promise to abolish the means test. In 1949, because the Government had failed to win over the electors in 1946, the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) told the people, in effect, "" My party, if elected, will abolish the means test within the life of the next parliament "".",44
117,Mr WIGHT,NEW DEAL URGED FOB DESERTED,"He did not.  wrong I shall correct my statement. The Prime Minister promised in 1949 that before the next general election he would draw up and produce at that election a practical plan for the abolition of the means test. There is not a reasonable person in this country who does not know that any such plan produced by this Government would be similar to the plan produced in this Parliament by the present Minister for External Affairs (Mr Casey) in 1938. The plan that he introduced at that time was designed to throw the burden of the abolition of the means test on the Australian workers and employers. The provisions of the measure introduced by the right honourable gentleman were designed to ensure that every worker who earned less than Â£350 a year would pay ls. 6d. a week for his social service insurance. Those who earned more than Â£350 a year would pay nothing whatsoever. If an employer employed 100 men, irrespective of whether he made a profit or not, he was required to pay ls. 6d. a week in respect of each of his employees. Wealthy graziers like the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr. Bowden), and wealthy representatives of the sugar-growers and grazing interests, such as the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Brimblecombe), although they might employ only two or three men and make ten times as much profit as the factory owners who employed 100 men, would have had to pay only ls. 6d. in respect of each of their employees. wealthy investor who employed perhaps one or two stenographers and earned an income of Â£100,000 a year was required to pay only ls. 6d. a week in respect of each of his stenographers. Because of the opposition to that plan by the Labour party in this Parliament, and the people generally, who had been educated by the Labour party, the government of that time did not have the courage to put its plan into execution. Nevertheless, honourable members should always remember that the same type of plan remains in the minds of members of this Government, and that any scheme that they may put forward will throw the whole cost and responsibility for social services almost exclusively on the shoulders of the workers. The honourable member for Gippsland made certain statements about the justice of abolishing the means test. He said lhat apparently the Labour party contemplated paying pensions to the directors of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited and other wealthy organizations. Does the honourable member realise that as far back as the time of Andrew Fisher, maternity bonuses free from a means test were being paid to the people ? No doubt the wives of the directors of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, Australian Paper Manufacturers Limited and wealthy squatters, went to the post office and collected their maternity bonuses free from a means test. Child endowment was also introduced by an Australian government, following the pioneer work done by Mr John Lang in New South Wales. In fact, child endowment waf> first initiated by the Labour party in a State parliament. I have no doubt that the mothers of the children of the directors of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited and of wealthy pastoral companies, also go along and collect their child endowment free from any means test. The same thing would happen in regard to age and invalid pensions if the means test were abolished. I also direct the attention of honourable members to the fact that throughout Australia there are public education systems which permit the children of the wealthy and the poor to be educated free of charge. In my The day we had to pay for secondary and university education, but now secondary education is free, and in many cases university education is also free-o r practically free. Education is therefore open to the children of all the people, irrespective of their parents' income. The day will come when this Parliament will see clearly the right of every citizen to obtain age and invalid pensions free from the means test, just as we all now have the right to obtain maternity bonuses, child endowment, and secondary and university education. I have heard it said that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Evatt) is the evil genius of the proposal made by the Labour party during the last general election campaign to abolish the means test. Let us consider that charge. .After the national insurance scheme was .introduced to this Parliament in 1938, the great 'Labour leader, Mr John 'Curtin, in a preface to a little booklet, Why .Labowr Opposed the Lyons ^Government's .National Insurance .Scheme, wroteThe Laboirr party is not opposed to - national insurance. H u t it considers that widows, .invalids, old age and orphans' pensions are a right due to every .Australian, and that the revenue of the nation should he drawn upon to 'fulfil that right. Both the late Mr John Curtin and the late Mr Chifley opposed any social services plan put forward by .anti-Labour tgovemments along the lines .of the plan submitted in 1938. While it is true that .if the means 'test is abolished, a director - of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, or any other .affluent citizen, may draw money that he does .not Â«ieed, he will have paid infinitely more in income tax than he will reeeive Sram any pension that the Government is .likely to make available to him. That is one of the reasons why we have :free education, free maternity allowances, f r-ee child 'endowment and other free social 'services. It is 'rank heresy to say that it is impracticable to abolish the means 'test, or that this 'country cannot do it . Under the scheme put forward in 1""9'38 by the present Minister - for - External Affairs, taxation - a't a flat - rate was to %e - unjustly imposed on wage-earners and - employers, while a substantial contribution was to %e made 'from -'Consolidated 'Revenue - If the .government of that time, when - our economic position was ""not good,'could contemplate the 'abolition of the means test, surely at five present time, when 'OUT eco;nomy .has never been more healthy, 'Â£he G'overnment can go :a step .further and a'bolis'h it on a more reasonable and equitable ""basis. The ^honourable .member ""for Gippsland jspoke of what he <called our critical economic position. He - said fha't we were .troubled by increasing costs, and that we - were .costing .ourselves out of overseas markets - In 1949, when this Government .assumed office,,somebody .said tome in the lounge - of this building, "" What do .you 'think the Menzies Government will do? How will it.deal with the economy ;of .this country ?"" I said, "" This Government will not control costs; it will allow costs in Australia to rise to such an extent that eventually the cost of production of wheat, wool, eggs, butter, and other primary .products, upon which we depend for our export income, will increase out of all proportion to the costs of production in the rest of the world"". My prophecy was correct. This Government has 'allowed inflation to progress uncontrolled. When the Chifley Labour Government - was in office, the basic wage was Â£5 16s. a week. To-day it is Â£12 and there is no comparison between the value of the Â£1 today with its value in 1949. The cost - of production of wheat is exactly twice :as much as it was in 1949. That applies also to wool, dried fruits and every other primary product. This Government has allowed the inflationary process to go too far. The CHAIRMAlSr -- 'Order! The honoraible member's time has expired. Mr - DOWNER (Angas) [9.11] - The .committee .can always count upon hearing an entertaining and spirited speech from the honourable member for Lalor  - disagree with ithe honourable (member, mo .one would isay that he is not sincere ior .honest .or perfectly frank in the way he ; nails his colours to the mast. Jl - only - wish that .some other honourable members <on the .Opposition side, .and one or two who are .more .highly :situated - than the s honourable member for Lalor, would follow his good example because at least, w!he'ther one agrees or disagrees with him, 'everybody .in the chamber and an the country knows exactly where he stands. The .honourable (gentleman ^devoted <a jgood - deal .of .his speech to the .contnoversial .question .of .the means test, .and he .rather .surprised me, I must tconfess,, iby isaying that - at least the majority .of his party .agreed with - the policy .speech .oT .the Leader of the Opposition ,(.Dr JEvatt) - at the last ,general (election. I .do not know - whether the .'honourable .member l o r Xalor .was :in the .chamber .recently when .a .colleague 4of his, the .honourable member for Fawkner ((Mr. W. M . Bourke) made .one .of the .most - sensible, :thoughtf,ul, and,, if J<may,-say<ao, [ - ione rof the .wisest speeches ion the subject that has been made for many years. I would say to honourable members on the Opposition side generally, and not only to the honourable member for Lalor, that they would he very wise indeed to follow the example of the honourable member for Pawkner, who rose in his place and told the honest truth as he, and the majority of the people of Australia, saw it so far as pensions and the means test are concerned. The honourable member for Lalor has chided the Government with having said in the 1949 election campaign that it would go to the people three years later and bring in a policy outlining what it proposed to do for the abolition of the means test, and with having failed to do so. The facts of the matter are perfectly clear. It is well known that the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) said, not only in the policy speech this - year but in 1951 also, that the Government's attitude to the means test was that there would be a gradual easing of it as the economic circumstances of the nation permitted. That is exactly what this Government is doing. In the recent budget that the committee has heen debating, the Treasurer (Sir Arthur Fadden) announced a very substantial easing of the means test, and I believe that all honourable members will agree that if the economic circumstances of nation continue to flourish in the years to come, as one may reasonably expect, there will be some further amelioration of the means test in the interests of the underprivileged. I was astonished that the honourable member for Lalor spoke so trenchantly and fervently about the ubiquitous distribution of social services benefits. He has committed himself, quite irrevocably so far as he is concerned-hut , I hope, not for his party in the unlikely event of it gaining the treasury bench in the near future-to giving all social services fits to the people irrespective of their income. It is quite apparent, from what the honourable member and his leader have said in this chamber and during the election campaign, that the honourable member believes in pensions for millionaires. If that is the honourable member's interpretation of the new midtwentieth-century socialism, it is something that is completely novel and cuts Mr Downer. right across the basis of socialist principles. At least the honourable member for Lalor has made an original contribution to the political philosophy of the world. My object in rising in this debate was not merely to attempt to controvert the honourable member for Lalor, but to say something about the group of Estimates that the committee is supposed to be discussing. I wish to refer particularly to the third one in this group which relates to the Department of Shipping and Transport. Any consideration of the Estimates raises in this committee the question once again of the disadvantage that all of us labour under in not having a Minister in ' the chamber who is directly responsible for the department and the Estimates that are being discussed. As is well known, the Minister for Shipping and Transport (Senator MCLeay) is not in this chamber because he has ho right to be here. He is not a member of the House of Representatives. I believe honourable members will agree that, however able a Minister may be, no man who is merely representing another Minister can serve as a satisfactory substitute, whatever the width of his experience. I hope the Minister for Air and Minister for Civil Aviation (Mr Townley), who is at the this table, will not think that this is a personal attack on him, because honourable members know that without any qualification, he is one of the most progressive, most unorthodox, and most efficient members of the present Cabinet. But no Minister, whatever his qualifications or ability, can possibly claim to have suflicient experience of another Minister's department to be able to discuss, as fully as the committee might desire, the Estimates relating to the department administered by his colleague when they come before this chamber. It is perfectly obvious benehowever well he may he versed in the generalities of the departmnet he is representing, that he cannot answer explicitly the various points that may be raised in a debate. I hope that when the Prime Minister appoints the proposed Committee on Constitutional Reform, that committee will give serious consideration to this disability. I would suggest that the committee might recommend to the Parliament and, ultimately, to the nation, an alteration of the Commonwealth Constitution that would enable any Minister to sit in either this chamber or the Senate during the second-reading debate and the committee stages of bills affecting his particular department, and also in the present circumstances when the committee is considering the Estimates of the department for which that Minister is responsible. If the Parliament and the nation sanctioned such an alteration of the Constitution"" the result would he that many honourable members of this committee, and honourable senators, would be considerably' better-informed upon matters under discussion. It. would also mean that the debates would partake of more reality and be far more dynamic. The proposal, as honourable members will know, is not new. It has been suggested in this chamber on more than one occasion. Moreover, it is the practice of two other British Commonwealth countries. Some honourable members may realise that the Parliaments of the Union of South Africa and also of Northern Ireland have this very principle in operation. The system works admirably in both countries. I have gone to some trouble to ascertain details of operation, and from the results of my inquiries, I have come to the conclusion that it is a device that Australia would do well to copy. I hope that the Minister for Air, who is sitting at the table, will pass on this suggestion to the Prime Minister so that it will he one of the subjects referred to the Committee on Constitutional Reform when ultimately that body is established. Mr W. M. BOURKE (Pawkner) 19.20] - I have been endeavouring to catch your eye, Mr Chairman, since about 8 o'clock, because I desire to mention one or two matters which occur to me under the proposed vote for the Department of Social Services. My task has become somewhat more difficult in view of the fact that the honourable mem before me, and has rather cut across the lines of some matters that I wish to place before the committee. Nevertheless, I think that I should place my views before honourable members. At the outset, I desire to correct a report of a speech that I made here recently on the vexed question of the means test. When speaking on that subject some little time ago, I expressed my view that the abolition of the means test was impracticable and undesirable",45
118,Mr GULLETT,NEW DEAL URGED FOB DESERTED,"And unnecessary. Mr W. M . BOURKE - Yes , and unnecessary; and I gave my reasons for that view. I shall now re-state them briefly. I said that the abolition of the means test on age pensions alone, without taking into consideration invalid pensions and widows pensions, would cost Â£100,000,000 a year at the present time. A consideration of the economic situation, and the present budgetary situation of the country, made it difficult to see where that money could be obtained without increasing taxation to a substantial degree. I also pointed out that if the means test was to be abolished and all that extra expenditure was to be incurred, it would he done to the detriment of that section of the community which is most in need of social services benefits, namely, the age pensioner who has no income except the pension, because it would its become increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to make the adequate increase in the rate of pension which is necessary to help such persons. Some newspapers misreportcd those remarks. After I had made those points, I proceeded to consider the means test on inconie and the means test on property, and I said, in view of my previous remarks, that I.considered that the present rate of permissible income of Â£3 10s. a week was adequate",48
119,Mr THOMPSON,NEW DEAL URGED FOB DESERTED,"No , the proposed rate. Mr W. M . BOURKE - Yes , I said that the proposed rate of permissible income was adequate at present. That remark was misreported in some newspapers, which stated that I said that the present rate of pension of Â£3 10s. a week was adequate. Of course, that is an entirely different thing. I did not say that the present rate of pension of Â£3 10s. a week was adequate. I do not think that the present rate of pension of Â£3 10s. a week is adequate. I said that the proposed rateof Â£3 10s. at week, for permissible income was adequate,, m i it was clear; from the: context of: my remarks, that' I made that statement, because I . proceeded! to point; out, feat'; further amelioration.', off! the means, test, on property was desirable-.. I said, that, ini order to) avoid injustice and to do away with anomalies, there should be a further and. gradual amelioration in. that respect so. that the property means' test would' be expanded. T.o. elaborate my point, and to make* it perfectly clear that. I . did not say, and. r, did. not think,, that. the. present, pension, rate of Â£3. 10s. a week was adequate , I 1 mention, that X made. a. particular plea on that occasion for the person, who had no income other than. the. pension.. At the present, time,, some, people: who are in receipt of the pension are reasonably well off.. Husband, and. wife, both of whom receive the. pension, of Â£3 10s. a. week, and the full, permissible income of Â£3 10s.. a. week, have, a total, income of Â£14 a. week,, which, is. mom than the basic, wage. 'Some people, own a house,, and. have, property aa well.. All those people are fairly well off. compared! with the. single pensioners, most of whom, in my experience, are elderly ladies ,, either widows or single women.. They have the pension, of Â£3 IQs. a week,, and. no suppler mentary income.. They will have, the right t'o perniissibTe incomeup to. Â£3 10s.. a week when the) Government's proposals, are given effect By legislation but, in fact they have no income other than the. pension. Those are the people, actually for whom I was making a plea, and' whom. I . have primarily in mind' when. I am arguing'against the abolition of the means test; Those are the peopl'e who are. feeling the pinch most, and who need the greatest amount of help, so that"" they will be a'Ble to live in a reasonable manner. When we> arei considering' the plight at of thosepersons, it is not' just a' matter of thinkingin economic; or financial? terms': Thepension of Â£3> l'Osi a* week Ur quitein'adequ.alie for' those' people, and should Be increased so' that, they may be able to liuy the* necessairies of life; But; equally/ important, with giving them; thei greatermonetary income is; the fact that provision should' be madfe' for theiT housWhen' we are considering; the people ing and hospitalization needs'. Many of who"", these' people' live alone in> rooms;. They Mr W. M. Bourke. are. unable to> care for themselves! ade1 quately; and! do the KMe chores flat 1 should be d'one in the house or room' that they occupy: They are unable tocook for themselves. Many of themare obliged to pay excessive rents up to 30s. a week"" for aroom. Their: plight would' Be eased, immeasurably; their lives would be made so much happier, and they would be much, more contented if they could"" be provided 1 with adequate housing, accommodation at a nominal rent, and some form of hospitalization. Although they are not really sick, they suffer from the ailment's: of old age, and they need to have expert nursing attention available so that they can live reasonaBle and proper lives: r should like to see development, in. both those directions in the provision of special homes and hospitals' for the aged. I consider that those requirement's, should be provided,., not By the. State, But preferaBly by charitahle bodies and' institur tions subsidized By the State.. The scheme under which the Government will subsidize such Bodies on a Â£l-for-Â£l Basis; to provide homes for aged pepole should Be extended to provide a special form' of 1 hospitalization necessary for the! aged. 1 Progress' in that' direction will Be of the"" utmost benefit to our elderly citizens, whomwe all admire and respect: 1 I h the few minutes remaining to me,, I wish to refeis to the: subject, of child, endowment. .1 had. intended to discuss it in relation, ta themeans test. Child endowment, is a most important formof social, services! benefit.. As we all' Know.,, if was introduced in 1941, and the. rate was gradually increased! from 5s. t'o1'0's. a week for all children of a family under the age; of sixteen' years:with; the exception of: the fiitst child. In 1950, after the present Government was elected, endow - 1 ment for. the first, child, wasi introduced! thet rate of 5s.. a' week: The: increase; to1 10s-.. a. week"" for all children other than the. first, child under, the age of sixteen, years' was; made? in 1948., Since' that; year,, i& thes basic; wage - has: practically doubled^ 1 but. this necessary and. desirable social' 1 services' Benefit, which is; Being, made to help-the) family man, has, not been altered.. 1 are suffering'mos# as the'result? of Ithe 1 inflationary spiral ih' recent? yearsj we 1 1 - think i.of ithe skilled tradesman, whose .margins ;haÂ«e (been virtually pegged, and the man with family - responsibilities, - who&e (supplementary income from child - endowment .has aiot incEeased to keep pace - with ithe declining value iof tmoney. There is an urgent need for a substantial increase iof the ..amount .of tchild .endowment so that the family man may he .able to meet, in an adequate way, the .expenses of family life. Those .of 313 who have experience .of these (matters know all too well .how the cost ,of do.thing, .feeding and looking after children is gr.ow.ing and .growing. Let iza .Consider the cost of footwear alone. Boots for boys last about six weeks, ;and they cost .a lot .of money. It seems to me to be imperative that the family man, and particularly the family man in .the lower wage 'groups, should have his income .supplemented - as much as possible, .so </hat he will be in a position to .do the - right thing, and provide the necessaries ,of ""life ifor his growing family. ""When we - look at the figures, we find that it is practically impossible to make that really substantial increase of child endowment which, is .so necessary simply because, ;at present, .child endowment is paid to every family .'in the community, regardless of its .financial position. According to the last .report '.of the 'T5irector-:General ,o.f Social Services, our child endowment hill, even at the ^present inadequate rates of payment, is Â£53,0.00,000 .a year. If we were to .double the present T.ates, that .is, if we were to make the .payments ,10s. a week for the first child, and .Â£1 a week for children other than the first- I do not think that any one will say that .those payments would he too great-w e would incur an additional .expenditure .of Â£53,000,000 a year. In view of the present budgetary situation .and of our national probleims, responsibilities and .obligations, I ibelieye that we could not meet that bill as things stand at present. If w.e were to tackle the problem on a more modest scale and provide for .an increase of 10s. a week for all children ..except the first in each family, .and leave the payment for the first child at 5s. .a week as it is at present, the additional cost to the national budget would be Â£3.5,000,000 a year. To put it in .another way, if there were a -5s. a week increase for .all children including the /first, we sshould the incurring JBSU - additionBa (expenditure ;of ;Â£31,O0.0.,OOO a year. Such commitments make these increases - impra'et'ica'ble 'at present. I 'do ""not fbirik .anybody will .disagr.ee with .thail;, hut if .justice is to .be .done to this vital jsection .of the [community-'the family man in ithe lower income group-w e - should substantially - increase ,child 'endowment.

I do not .see aay justification at sail for :say, .a member iof .tikis .Parliament, to ciite. any town -.case, or f o i :an-y member iof ithe.community who draws ture salary that is. paid io - a member of Parliament, receiving child .endowment :at all whilst in the .community there are many .men .'such tas those employed by iSifcate-owned and ;S*ate-oper,aite.d ;public utilities in Victoria, asi.cluding the Kaalways .and itramways, who bring home ,-a weekly wsage of less Itham Â£15 and, in isome instances, have to work .overtime ito get men that much. 'On that - sum mamy of them have to look .'after families '.of four :or :fiv;e children. Those men .are 'entitled to look to this commuiiity for - a substantial increase of .child ^endowment so that .they will he able to - carry mt their financial responsibilities iprojperly. .Instead of all this money being paid to people such as members of PaTlia-menit whose salaries are .adequate to care for their families, the interests of the - country would the better served if child .endowment, on a much more liberal scale, were paid only to those members of the community who need it. I suggest that a figure .of about Â£2.0 a week should' he made the dividing line. A family man who receives a wage .or a salary less than that amount should qualify for a very much higher rate of child endowment than is paid at present, whilst Che - man who receives more than that sum should not .draw child endowment at all. I realise that to do such .a thing would not be politically popular. It is never popular to take away a benefit that has been paid in the past, but I do think that we should look at this problem in the broad national interest, and realise that no section of the community is more worthy of assistance than the lower-paid wage-earners with family responsibilities.",48
120,Mr GULLETT,NEW DEAL URGED FOB DESERTED,"Henty) [9.35] - The committee is to a considerable degree indebted to the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr W. M . Bourke) for his observations on child endowment and age pensions. When an honourable member gives great thought to a matter and then has the courage to follow his line of thinking to its conclusion regardless of the political beliefs of his party, as the honourable member has done to-night, he is apt to make a good contribution to a debate such as this. I say that I , and I am sure most members on this side of the chamber, wholeheartedly support the basis of his last argument that the budget does not do enough for the man who has a family-particularl y a large familyto support. The honourable member very fairly pointed out that the cost of subsidizing large families adequately by means of straight-out child endowment payments would be prohibitive, but I do suggest that something could be done in the matter of allowances for clothing, education, and the like. These allowances, established as they were many years ago, and increased by only fractional amounts in the last twenty years, now bear no relation to the true cost of supporting children. The Government should examine very seriously the whole scale of allowances and revise it. I agree also with the honourable member for Fawkner that whilst some people who can very well afford to support their children are receiving child endowment at the taxpayers' expense, others who not support their children adequately are receiving insufficient assistance by way child endowment. The honourable member drew the obvious conclusion that people should not draw government benefits if they have no need of them. That is our attitude, of course, to the applicamatter, tion of the means test to age pensions. I have never been able to see the Tightness or the practicability of taxing people hy a certain amount, providing the necessary administration, and then giving the money back in the form of some government subsidy or other. As the honourable member for Fawkner very properly pointed out it is absurd, for example, to tax members of this chamber by a certain amount for social services and then, after administration, to give it back to them in the form of a subsidy for their children- a subsidy which, in fact, they do not need and should not need. We have listened to-night, by and large, to a two-pronged attack on the Government from honourable members opposite in relation to the age pension. We have heard those who have said that the pension rate is adequate, and we have heard those who have said that everybody ought to get it. Let us take the first part first. Mr EnMONDs - The honourable member does not believe in pensions?",51
121,Mr GULLETT,NEW DEAL URGED FOB DESERTED,"I merely point out that I am a supporter of a government which, in five years, has raised the annual expenditure on social services from Â£89,000,000 to Â£1S0,000,000. The abolition of the means test would cost this country another Â£100,000,000 a year. Where would that money come from ? It is true that the age pension does not provide a living in a reasonable standard of comfort, for those who receive it - It never has and I go so far as to say that it was never intended to do so. It will be an evil day when we say that everybody, upon attaining a certain age will be kept in comfort by the taxpayer. We have just had. an election, and the very issue that is now being debated by the committee was the principal argument engaged in at that time. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Evatt), who, at that time, was devoting himself almost exclusively to his parliamentary can- pursuits, put before the people the proposition that if Labour were returned of to power it would abolish the means test and greatly increase the rate of pension. Candidates of the Government parties said that they would do neither of those things because, having had a look at the they knew that no government could do either of them without substantially increasing taxation. The people thought over this matter. Every candidate of the Government parties had to go around his electorate and talk about it to young and old. By and large, my electorate is no different from that of any other honourable member, and I know that a great many old people voted Labour for the first time. They said, in eifect, "" We are in favour of this. We want a higher rate. We want to get a pension whether we are in need of it or not"". That is natural. Every one wants something for - nothing. But we also know that the mass of people who are working realise that social services benefits can be paid for only by those who work, that is by those who have children to support, houses to pay off and provision to make for their old age. They considered Labour's proposition and rejected it out of hand. I make no apology for rising in my place in this chamber and saying two thing3. The first of them is that I am not in favour of the abolition of the means test.",51
122,Mr GRIFFITHS,NEW DEAL URGED FOB DESERTED,Why ?,52
123,Mr GULLETT,NEW DEAL URGED FOB DESERTED,"As the honourable member for Eawkner has tried to explain to his colleagues in the Opposition, it not desirable that people should draw pension if they stand in no possible of it. That, surely, must be the first consideration. As the honourable member for Eawkner has also asked in respect child endowment: If persons do not stand between employees in need of a government subsidy to help them support their children, why what should they draw it? What is the with basis of paying child endowment when others are not receiving enough? If honourable members opposite wish to benefit the pensioners and those who draw child endowment and other social services benefits, they will say, in effect, "" We pay these benefits on a limited scale those who need them instead of adopting the ridiculous idea that everybody upon reaching a certain age will draw them whether they need them or not"". The people, at the recent general election, the last say in this matter. Labour's proposition was put to them, and they rejected it. That proposition is not popular. There is no justice in it, furthermore, no country in the world could afford to adopt it .",52

125,Mr EJ HARRINSON,COMMONWEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND,"Blaxland) [9.45 J - I direct the attention of the comis mittee to an administrative matter that a comes within the ambit of the Department need of Labour and National Service. Last week, in dealing with the subject of industrial relations, I referred to grants that of were made in respect of conferences and employers. To-night, I desire to carry a little further I said on that occasion and to deal certain happenings within the trade union movement. When the Government amended the Conciliation and Arbitration Act in order to deal with the menace of communism in the trade union movement, members of the Opposition were severely will criticized because they expressed doubt to as to the wisdom of certain provisions of that measure, particularly those relating to the control of ballots within trade unions. I am concerned about the way in which Communists are now working had around those provisions. Federal trade unions not only in New South Wales but also in some of the other States are experiencing difficulty as a result of the and control of shop committees by Communists, and are being embarrassed by the. manner in which the Commonwealth Arbitration Court is imare plementing section 29 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Those unions will be confronted with serious if the court continues to apply that section as it is applying it today. One of the first trade unions that was affected by the application of section 29 in thismanner was the trade union that is led by Mr Laurie Short. In this respect, I mention also the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen'sAssociaGovernment tion which, so far as its federal control is concerned, is not in any way to Communist influence. The federal executive of that organization is embarrassed by small groups in shop comunion movement. mittees which deliberately bring about situation in which the Arbitration Court Applies section 29 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to the detriment of - organization as a whole* A similar situaunder tion has arisen in minor sections of industry with which the Amalgamated Engineering Union is directly concerned. Having regard to these facts, trade unionists generally are wondering, for long the Government will tolerate these happenings and for how long it will delay reviewingthat act in order to ascerUnion tain its real effect. The Amalgamated Engineering Union is to conduct a State divisional ballot towards the end of year, and there is-no doubt in the-minds unionists'- who> are watchingthe position on Â» federal level that small groupsof award rate. Communists in shop, committees! are endeavouring to embarrass the organiza> tion as a wholehy bringing about situaGovernment tions in which the. Arbitration Court will impose fines upon the union. Last week; in simil'aircircumstances, the court posed a fine of Â£4'50' upon one trade union. 1 In addition, such situations: lay a> union open toa charge of contempt of the court: When the court takes such a. view, it. doubtful whether it: will agree to the ing of a ballot even though a ballot be requested by as-many as. 1,000' members of a union. The Communists will' able to go still further under this tion. They will continue with these tactics until the Amalgamated Engineering Union has been de-registered. When the union has been de-registered by thecourt under this legislation, thecourt will have no control over the conduct of the union's ballots. The intention of the Communists at the shop level in the Amalgamated Engineering Union is to cause a position to arise in which the court will de-register the union and the Communists will able to control the ballots:. Section is not only embarrassing the trade unions at the federal level but also is causing a state of anarchy to develop within the Mr E. James Harrison. trade union movement. I know there may be some criticism by trade unionists of the line that the New South Wales is taking on the present, issue. They may say that the Labour subject Government of New South Wales is abandoningcertain principlesthat being are near anddear to the trade But I wantto a put as strongly as I can to the committee the proposition that it is timethe Government realized that legislation introduced the for one purpose only is breaking down its own weight and that the use of section 29 by the Arbitration Court is handing to the Communists within the trade union movement the material they need to smash, the movement at the how federal level. The matter goes still further, because some employers, not all, have put the Amalgamated Engineering into a position in which it need not care very much about the Arbitration Court. It is common knowledge today this that members of the Amalgamated Engiof neeringUnion can attract wages whioh are a couple of pounds more than the I ' rose to direct the attention of the 1 to the failure of the legislation that it introduced to deal with the Communist menace to the trade union immovement in Australia. I said when the I'egisl'ation was introduced that the only peoplecapable of defeating Communists in thetrade union movement were people is with Australian Labour party views, who holdhad an intimate knowledge of the movemay ment and were prepared to operate the machinery provided by the Chifley be Government, under a Department of legislaLabour and National Service which really understood the requirements of tradeunions. I did not rise only because I wanted tocriticize the Government in relation to this, matter. This situation is developing into a national problem. If the Government continues to sit and twiddle its thumbs for much longer, the trade union movement, at the federal level will be. smashed by a minority section of Communists'.. It. is of no use to be talk about Australian Labour party 29 groups and otherorganizations which have dene such a magnificent, job, because section 29 is being used by the Arbitration Court in. such a way as to give the Communists"" the material they want to destroy the trade Union mdvenient at the federal level. I hope you will excuse me,- Mr Chairinanj if I say in passing that I was astounded to read in the press that the employers' representatives had opposed the re-opening of the margins case. They represent a body of people who are prepared to disregard the Arbitration Court altogether and, without regard for the interests of the trade union movement, to pay as much as Â£2 a week above the award rate to people of the type they want, t know what is developing in the trade union mOverneht. I say to the Government that all the fears that we expressed about the legislation have ibeen justified. Section 29 should be hauled immediately. The seven Communists or Communist sympathisers who were responsible for the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen's Association being fined did hot care two hoots .about the fine - They knew that the federal leadership of the association was not in the hands of Communists, but they knew also that seven Communists inside the organization were capable of bringing the federal leadership into sueh disrepute that the court would use section -29 against iti When the court imposed .a fine of Â£450 on the Amalgamated Engineering Union last weekj that - fine did not hurt the few Communists in the - organization who were walking off their jobs in order to embarrass the Labour Government of New South Wales. All that it did was to weaken the position of the federal leadership' of the union, whidh, at present, is noti i i Communist hands.",52
126,Mr EDMOKDS,COMMONWEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND,-They will break the unions before they have finished.,54
127,Mr EJ HARRINSON,COMMONWEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND,I agree. What is happening in the Amalgamated Engineering Union is designed for one purpose ouly. The Arbitration Court must take cognizance of this Government's legislation. It cannot let individual members of the union go on :as they are going. The Communists know that if they keep on playing their cards in the way in which they are playing them now-^--Sir PHILIP MoBBn>E.==-Why does not the union discipline its members?,54
128,Mr EJAMES HARRISON,COMMONWEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND,"That is the kind of interjection that I expect from a Minister who does not understand this legislation. We told the Government what would happen when it Was introduced. Let me deal again with the case of the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen's Association. The seven men were ordered back to work, not only by the association but also by the Australian Council of Trades Unions. They snapped their fingers at their organization. The worse that it could do was to expel them. The Union, not the seven members, was fined under section 29. Under this legislation, small undisciplined groups of Communists have been given power that they never wielded beover- fore in the history of the trade union movement The matter is so serious that unless the Government takes stock of the position that has developed and does something to alter it, the present control of the trade union movement in Australia at the federal level will be undermined, and some Unions will be handed back to the Communists, from whom Australian Labour party groups and - others have wrested control in the . last, two Or three years.  legislation.",54
129,Mr EJ HARRINSON,COMMONWEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND,"The honourable member for Capricornia (Mr. Pearce) talks about secret ballots. Let me tell hini what is going to happen to the Amalgamated Engineering Union under this Government's legislation. The Communists will continue the practice of small groups df men Walking off the job. The Union has already been fined Â£450, and at this moment it is in contempt. If the court takes the view that a union is-in-contempt,.itcannot interfere - with the union's ballots - So the Communists will be able to fake the ballot that is due to be held by the Amalgamated Engineering Union in November of this year. That is the position to which this legislation has led us. That is the way in which we are going. I make an appeal to the Government to review the legislation; This is not a light-hearted attack on the Government. I appeal to the .Government to get down - to .the fundamentals of sthis problem. Otherwise, the trade union movement will be smashed. I believe Mr Aird did a great injustice to the trade unions when he went in on the side of the Communists and opposed the re-opening of the margins case. The Communists in factories and workshops throughout Australia will use that as an argument in favour of strikes designed to bring the federal leadership of their unions into disrepute with, and contempt of, the Arbitration Court. That has been done in my own organization. Fortunately, we are strong enough to deal with these tactics, but other unions are not so well placed as we are. The appeal that I make to the Government to-night is one of the most genuine appeals that I have made in this chamber. I appeal to it to review the position immediately, because we are handing to the Communists of this country a means to take the control of the trade union movement from people who are arbitration-minded and put it into the hands of the Communist, party. While' section 29 of the legislation is on the statute-book, the Arbitration Court will continue to use it, because it is the bounden duty of the court to give effect to legislation. But if the court continues to give effect to section 29, it will break the back of the trade union leadership that we want in this country and hand the trade union movement to the Communists. If that happened, it would be to the discredit of this Government.",54
130,Mr OSBORNE,COMMONWEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND,"Evans) [10.0] - It is not at all surprising that the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr E. James Harrison) should have put the case concerning section 29 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act that he has submitted to us to-night, because one has been aware for a considerable time that trade unions, federal unions in particular, have been finding the position which arises under section 29 in the event of disobedience of the court's orders, very embarrassing to them. But the only reason it is really embarrassing to them is that they are not shouldering their responsibilities to the nation in the matter of dealing with the Communist minorities within their ranks. I sincerely hope that the Government will not be influenced by the arguments advanced by the honourable member for Blaxland, and that it will resolutely retain section 29 in the legislation, because in my observation, in the years that I have sat in this Parliament, since section 29 has been in operation, there has been, for the first time for, many years, a sense of responsibility re-introduced into the management of trade union affairs. The honourable member has spoken about the futility of the Government's industrial legislation. What about the secret ballots legislation ? Does he give the Government no credit for that ? When I last heard the figures, there had been more than 70 applications by right-wing unions for court-controlled ballots. The honourable member did not bother to talk about that. Instead, he talked about the very remote possibility that unions in contempt of the court might be refused court-controlled ballots. The power to deregister a union is a discretionary power resident in the court. Is it likely that the court would use its discretion against the maintenance of law and order in trade unions? The suggestion that it would do so is nonsensical. It is only by giving the court power that any sense of responsibility and any real statri of order have been re-introduced into our arbitration affairs. It is only by imposing sanctions on the parties to disputes that orders can possibly be carried out. The honourable member for Blaxland has complained because the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen's Association was fined Â£20Q because of the failure of the federal body of that union to prevent activities contrary to the orders of the court by a group of militants in New South Wales. Mr E. JAMES HABEISON - Seve n in number.",55
131,Mr OSBOENE,COMMONWEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND,"The honourable member says that that group numbered only seven. Why has not the federal body of the union disciplined the seven members of that group? He has asked what more can a. trade union do than expel such members. Has any single trade union, in contempt of the court as a result of an action ,by a minority of its members, expelled,the members responsible? Trade unions, particularly in New South Wales, where membership of a trade union is compulsory, have enormous power to deal with minority groups of members, such as the seven members whom the honourable gentleman has mentioned, even to the point of expelling them. What sort of trade union is it that fails to expel members who defy the orders of the federal body of the union to such a degree that the whole union is dragged into court and fined hundreds of pounds for contempt of an order? Not a single union has resorted to the remedy of expelling members in such circumstances. I am tempted to use the term "" effrontery"" to describe the argument advanced by the honourable member for Blaxland, but I do not wish to be provocative about a matter that is too serious for party dispute. However, I hope that some other honourable member on the other side of the chamber will answer the question that I have asked, and which I shall now repeat. That question is: Why is it that no trade union held in contempt of the court under section 29 of the act has yet expelled the minority group responsible for the court's action? Mr E. JAMES HARBISON - Bein g a legal man, the honourable member should know the answer.",55
132,Mr OSBORNE,COMMONWEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND,I do not know it. Mr E. JAMES HARBISON - Then honourable member does not know the aet properly.,56
133,Mr OSBORNE,COMMONWEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND,"We all are aware of the fact that responsible trade union leadership has heen seriously embarrassed by the activities of Communist groups. The answer to that problem is that the federal managements of the unions concerned should shoulder their responsibility and deal with those groups as they have the power to do. Until they earnestly attempt to do so, and exhaust every possible remedy, there is no .'justification for such complaints about section 29 of the act as we have heard to-night from the honourable member for Blaxland",56
134,Mr EDMONDS,COMMONWEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND,Does the honourable memher think it is as simple as all that?,56
135,Mr OSBORNE,COMMONWEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND,"I have yet to hear of any trade union that has expelled the minority group of members who have caused it to be held in.contempt of a court order. The honourable member for Blaxland has told us that the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen's Association has been put in its present position by seven Communists who are members of the union. What would be the result of expulsion of those men by the federal body of the union? Why has not resort been had to such expulsion? In New South Wales a Labour government has itself used the powers given to it, as an employer, hy section 29. What has the honourable member for Blaxland to say about that? The New South Wales Government has threatened to move against tra.de unions in order to have them held in contempt of the court's order.",56
136,Mr CURTIN,COMMONWEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND,It has given them 4S hours' notice ,56
137,Mr OSBORNE,COMMONWEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND,What does the honourable member for Blaxland say about the action of the 'New South Wales Government? Is he in disagreement with the Premier of New South Wales in relation to this matter?,56
138,Mr CURTIN,COMMONWEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND,The New South Wales Government has not moved in the court at all.,56
139,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND, Order !,56
140,Mr CURTIN,COMMONWEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND,I told only the truth.,56
141,Mr OSBORNE,COMMONWEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND,"I sincerely hope that the Government will pay no heed the to the arguments advanced by the honourable member about the removal of section 29. What would be the result of the removal of that section? What alternative does the honourable member for Blaxland suggest to the power conferred on the court by that section? For too long industrial arbitration in this country has been a one-way system under which management alone could be disciplined effectively hy the court's orders. Are we to return to the state of affairs that existed under the Chifley Government, when arbitration was one-sided, when management could be ordered and disciplined, but when labour was free to do as - it pleased? What alternative has the honourable member to offer to the present system? If our arbitration system is to progress, then it must he towards the rule of law in industry-no t the law of the jungle, but the law of the court. The rule of law can prevail only if sanctions enforce it, and if trade unions are obliged to .see that tlieir militant minorities do not disobey the law. If the tirade unions are unable to do that, then it is time that such unions as the Federated Engine Drivers ;and Firemen's Association and Uhe Amalgamated Engineering Union told the court plainly that they .are unable to do .anything about their defaulting members. Would the court hold them in contempt in such a Base 3 The honourable member for Blaxland said that the court would hold the trade unions in eontempt even if 'they had expelled their defaulting members. I suggest that that statement is nonsense. The court could not do so, because the trade unions would uo longer be responsible for the activities <if the militants, because the militants would no longer be members of the union. Mr <G<wr'tm interjecting*",56
142,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND,"Orderl The honourable member for Watson (Mr Curtin) has aro't got the floor yet. Mr OSBORNE;-If , as I have already said, the arbitration system is to develop satisfactorily in this country, it can do so only .by the introduction of law and order, and that will be possible only if the court has power 'to enforce its orders. If the 'court is to 'get 'anywhere as the 'controller and director 'of - our industrial 'system, i ensure respect for its - orders, and must have power to enforce them. With section '29 in operation this country has had a greater degree of industrial peace than it has ever had Ibefore. I ask the committee to compare the .state of industrial peace in Australia between the - end of 'the war and the end of 1949, during which period the Chifley Labour Government was in office, with the .state of trial peace 'that we have had since the advent of the Menzies Government. There is a marked contrast in favour of law and order, and very much in favour 'of the legislative - reforms introduced by the Government. Mr E. JAMBS HAKBISOU; - But what >is the position now ? Mr OSBORNE,-The position .clearly is ithat tfbe Communists 'are trying most desperately ito overthrow 'the existing arbitration system. They are doing their utmost to have the trade unions themselves held in contempt of the court, and they are using the machinery of the unions to forward their efforts. The easiest and surest way for the Communist purpose .to be achieved would he for the Government to give way to pleas such as we have heard from the honourable memher for Blaxland to-night. Then we .should be backing a case in which the federal bodies of the unions had washed .their hands of the whole .situation and .said, "" We are helpless to move in this matter. We can do nothing."" If , with all the power of the court behind them, they can do nothing to control the minorities in their Unions, how is their power to do so to be improved by removing the power of the court to enforce its orders? I have never heard un argument which appealed to me as more fallacious than that which has been 'advanced to-night, and I hope that the Government will reject it utterly - and completely. Mr BIRD .(Batman) [10.10],- I wish to refer to certain .aspects of our immigration poliqy which, in my opinion, indicate .an unfortunate trend. Although, by and large, our immigration policy has proved satisfactory, I am concerned about the present intake of 'immigrants because I do not think that it is measuring up to the expectations which all of us had when t must the scheme was inaugurated - after the end of World War II . For 'security reasons, it is essential that our population isbould the trebled in Â«8 - short a time as .possible, having .regard, >of coursej ito economic iconditiojis and the capacity - of .Che country to .'absorb new arrivals. If - ou-r resources aTe to be developed properly, a constantly 'expanding .population isnecessary. 'The Minister for Immigraindustion -'(Mr Holt), when speaking 'at anational citizenship convention in Canberra earlier in the year, said that he expected OUT population 'to reach 10.000,000 by l-9'5'9. I wish to make an analysis of the number of new arrivals during recent years, 'because that is the point upon which I wish to dilate. Tn 3J&52, approximately 120,0:00 immigrants came to our shores, - SO per cent., 'of whom were British. In 19S3. approximately '74,'0'00 new settlers arrived here,. and of those 39,000, or 46 per cent., were of British nationality. According to figures in this morning's newspapers, the net immigration gain for the first six months of this year was 31,000, only 43 per cent, heing of British nationality. The ratio of British immigrants to non-British immigrants is, therefore, declining. In three years it has dropped from 50 per cent, to 43 per cent. Por the first ;seven years after the end of World War II . , 50 per cent - of our immigrants were British. 'The Minister for Supply (Mr Beale), who is acting for the Minister for Immigration, may adduce certain reasons for that decline. Perhaps it was due to the abolition of the Commonwealth nomination scheme, which has been revived only recently. Now that that .scheme is again in - operation, the percentage of British immigrants may rise. Nevertheless,, I am alarmed at the number of non-British immigrants who are coming to this country, because I feel that this trend will present problems which will he hard to overcome in the future. If the trend continues, our standards .of living, and even the British character of our .country, may be affected. 'It should not be .thought that I am at .aU antagonistic ito the .non-British setiflers who Â»are coming to .Australia, I am under no misapprehension about the contribution which they .are making to the development of the .country, paT.ticulaT.ly in relation to --national .projects. 'Their material 'achievements 'have been of 'outstanding 'benefit, they - Tia-ve also .added greatly to .our - cultural .'attainments. While we - can. .gain culturally from people of other luationa, .we do mot vraant to .see sour &mt .British culture ismbme^ged because ran -.omerwhelming number \of inan-JBritish immigrants (have <come ""to Australia. ""By the Â«nd - of 1953, approximately '350/000 non-T3ri$ish immigrants had entered Â»Australia. ""Such a 'large influx of immigrants 'has presented - stupendous problems of - assimilation. We must appreciate that fihe merging of - those people, who have such diverse - national 'backgrounds, in - our economic, social 'and - ctfl'tu-ral flife,, is an --experiment assimilation Â»of tt (magnitude and .complexity ""Which 'we have 'never 'known ^before. We Â»8Â© 'not ;have to worry about assimilating British immigrants, because they fit readily into our way of life. The inflow of non-British immigrants during the last two years, however, presents an entirely different problem. If all the non-British immigrants who have arrived here prior to and since World War II . remain in Australia, even though .such immigration ceased immediately, it would mean that by I960, .approximately one in every nine of our population would be foreign-born or first-generation children of foreign-born parents. Therefore, the task that confronts us at the moment is to ensure that these non-British immigrants settle into our way of life .as easily and speedily as possible. I .should b.e the first to .acknowledge thai assimilation is a long process. Doubtless, it will not he accomplished entirely until the .next generation.. I appreciate that children form the best link between immigrants ,and Australians, but I am concerned about the non-British adults in OUT community. I stress the point, with all the vigour at my command, that one .of the first steps in assimilation is for .non^British immigrants to seek naturalization status, if they are eligible to do so. The Government should strain every nerve to encourage those who are qualified to take that - step to do - so.. Beceaatly, when 1 asked the Minister - for Supiply iÂ£or .figures - concerning immigration, he told me that in iÂ®S2 ithe number of persons naturalized - was 1,681, - that in 1'9'5'3 it was 2,532, ana that'for the .fikst seven months of this year it was approximately 6,000. . Mr BEAiLE--Did not I jgiv.e .the honourable member some later figures which - indicated A big sjum/p-uj) in natur.aliz.a,tion.? Mr BiDRB,-JBo r tfchefirstsseyen anomths ! of ithis. year ithe Minister [stated that stfhe number ^was ' approximately 6,00Q, it hawing been approximately fl.,300 in the seventh month. I Stake >it that the increase this year is due rto sthe fact that - many immigrants rhave completed the statutory five-year period [before doing which (they svevs unable to aeelk jtaturalization. in Nevfirtheleas, rbetween 3&Â£6 aajd &,9&9 wer-y - many non-British immigrants ;caane ito - this country, ibut oifly .4;0.00 or ,-5,.OQ0 Â»of them sought naturalization. JEhat Â»wjas - a mere fraction of the number who could have applied for naturalization. It is apparent, from the figures to which I have referred, that for some cretion. reason or other, many eligible persons are not keen to seek naturalization. I appeal to the Government to give urgent conadvertisement sideration to this matter, because it essential that those eligible to apply should do so as quickly as possible. appreciate that the decision of a nonhome British immigrant to apply for naturalifor zation, or not to do so, is a personal matter, and that neither pressure nor slightest suggestion of intimidation should be used to influence that decision. ever, I think that every encouragement Department of Immigration. should be given to such persons, and that reason I ask the Minister to consider some of the aspects of the matter to which I now propose to refer. Does the Government think that the requirements of the Nationality and volved Citizenship Act are too stringent ? Does it consider that the fee which is charged too high, and that the nature of the naturalization ceremony is a deterrent? In my opinion, sub-section (1.) of section .14 of the act sliould be repealed. I in the following terms:An alien or a protected person shall not entitled to obtain a certificate of naturalisamotion:tion unless, not earlier than one year after his entry into Australia or New Guinea, he makes a declaration in the prescribed form his intention to apply for the grant of a certificate of naturalisation as an Australian citizen. In other words, the person cerned has to declare his tion to seek naturalization four before he is able to do so. It seems to me that, in the light of the fact that many non-British people who come to Australia are confused about our way of life, this provision serves no purpose. It is interesting to note that, at the citizenship convention in Canberra earlier this year, to which I have referred already, a resolution was adopted to the effect that so much of section 14 of the Nationality and Citizenship requires a declaration of intention, should be deleted. Apparently that gathering of Australian citizens, who were from every nook and cranny of the community, gave attention to this Mr Bird. and reached the same conclusion as I have reached.",57
143,Mr BBALK,COMMONWEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND,The Minister has a dis,59
144,Mr BIRD,COMMONWEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND,"Anothe r legal requirement is the insertion in the press of an to indicate an intention to is apply for naturalization. Particulars of the intention must be advertised in two I newspapers that are circulated in the district of the intending applicant naturalization. That requirement, as in the case of marriage, is for the the purpose of enabling persons who know of reasons why naturalization should not be Howgranted to report those reasons to the The defor partment has admitted that, during the last 36 years, fewer than half a dozen protests have heen lodged. I fail to see why that section should operate any longer. In my opinion, there are certain objections to it . First, expense is ini n inserting advertisements; secondly, it is of a vexatious and f u t i l e is nature; and thirdly, it is an unnecesary singling out in the community, as an alien, of a person who is on the threshhold of becoming a citizen. The Aust is tralian citizenship convention, which was of the opinion that the provision be should be changed, passed the following That the requirement of newspaper advertiseof ments in connection with naturalization be abandoned: altermitively, if the requirement ie to be continued, that the birthplace and nationality of the applicant be eliminated from the advertisements, and that the Departcon- ment of Immigration assume responsibility inten- for insertion of the advertisements in this years newspapers. In other words, that gathering of citizens, whose deep interest in the subject of immigration was demonstrated by their presence at the convention, was of the useful opinion that the existing legal requirement was obnoxious and that, if it were not eliminated, it should be materially altered. I hope the Minister will take notice of the representations that - were made by those citizens and which I am Act as now repeating. I also ask the Minister whether he thinks that the payment of the fee of Â£5 drawn might deter some immigrants from seeking naturalization. A fee for naturalizamatter tion was not charged until 1930, and since that time it has remained the same. Some people might say that the privileges of citizenship are worth Â£5, but others like myself think that there are some things which defy correlation to money values, and which are cheapened by any attempt at such correlation. I think that citizenship should not be measured in terms of money and that, if there is the slightest suggestion that the payment of money impedes the flow of applications, the fee should he waived. It is unlikely that the naturalizationceremony itself would deter people from applying for Australian citizenship because, as one who has attended and taken part in a number of ceremonies, I think that the ceremony is bright but dignified. However, there may be some immigrants who prefer to assume citizenship unobtrusively and without publicity. I suggest that for those people there should be an alternative ceremony so that they may acquire the status of Australian citizenship without publicity. I suggest to the Minister that, with a view to stressing the responsibility and the obligations of citizenship, the Department of Immigration should initiate immediately a widespread publicity campaign. Immigrants should be told that, as soon as they acquire Australian citizenship, they are entitled, not to all of the social services benefits, but to some of them, and that while they retain non-British citizenship they are not entitled to them. The department should embark upon such a publicity campaign by obtaining the support of the films, the press and the radio.",59
145,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,COMMONWEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND,"Order! The honourable member's time has expired.  I wish to direct my remarks to the activities of the Department of National Development, the Estimates for which are now before the committee. I think the Parliament has come to a realization of the importance that the 'Government attaches to the subject of national development, which was displayed by its appointment of the Minister for National Development (Senator Spooner) to the Cabinet committee of which the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies) is chairman. It is essential that all honourable members should give considerable thought to this vital aspect of our national life. It is necessary that throughout Australia there should be a stocktaking of plans for national development. I was pleased to see the public of Australia endorse the policy that was outlined by the Prime Minister during the recent election campaign by returning the Government to office, and to learn that a national development committee would be established to consider, and to give a measure of priority to, national development schemes. I think that the files of this Government and of the State governments on national development matters must, be the largest of all the files, because every government in Australia, has accumulated blueprints for schemes that were regarded, at the relevant time, as being for the future. In Queensland, there are files which date back to the early 1920's in relation to schemes that were considered in those days to he urgent, but those files are still lying on the shelves collecting dust. If those schemes were urgent in the early 1920's, surely they are of much greater urgency in 1954. It is necessary that those who are charged with the responsibility of administration should confer in order to ascertain which projects should receive priority. I hope that the Department of National Development will watch carefully the aims and ambitions of the governments that submit different schemes,, because, in the past, State governments have submitted schemes for development, or defence as a means of implementing plans for the socialization of Australia. It is a failing, in particular, of Mr Gair, the Premier of Queensland, to use for further socialist projects in Queensland money that is obtained under the guise of national development. I recall to mind some of the great development schemes in Queensland that have been lauded by the Government of that State. The Peak Downs project washailed as a great scheme of national development. Por a little time- "" for a certain reason "" would be the best way todescribe it, perhaps-the proposal had some value in that it demonstrated to theprivate farmer that he could grow sorghum in that area, but that the Government could not. I quote the following report, which appeared in the Brisbane Telegraph of the 15th June, 1949, in relation to a statement that was made by Mr. T. A.. Foley, the Minister for Public Lands in Queensland, after a visit of members of the State Parliament to the area of this great, developmental project, as it was described at that timeMembers qf the party inspected Eeat Down -, with obvious relish and theiu enthusiasm knew no bounds. . .

149,Mr GEOBGB LAWSON,COMMONWEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND,"The Government ought to goahead withifc  honourable member, who is older than I ' am -, that the State Government should havestarted theundertaking the year he was Born, Because that rail' link was urgently needed then. Hadi it done so, the work might havebeenhalifc-completed bynow. Theconstruction of railways iti Queensland ispeculiarlyatask for the Stategovernment., Nowthat Government^ at long last, after almost innumerable commissions of inquiry over the. last 30 yeai;s to my knowledge, has before it a report by an expert panel which it appointed in the recent past. I saywithoutfearof contradictionthat the report and' advice of this panel, which consisted of prominent Queenslanders,. is to> theeffect that the Dajaj-ra rail: link would prove a costly failua?e to. any government that undertook to. build; it. Despite that, the Premier isstill pressing the. Australian Government, to go ahead and spend the taxpayers' money on the scheme without having a full, investigationinto. it. That is. in line with the? conduct of the Queensland Government, in relation to the, beef industry, for example. A project that was, hailed as a great, national development scheme for Queensland, under which the State Government undertook the ownership and management of beef cattle properties, involved the people of that State in losses totalling over Â£2,000,000. The people are still paying interest and redemption charges on the debt accumulated by that socialist enterprise. My mind goes back to the great scandal of theChillagoe-Mungana mining enterprise, which loaded the taxpayers of Queensland with a burden of debt of over Â£1,500,000 as a result of "" fraud and dishonesty "", to quote the report of the royal commission that investigated the fiasco.

Government and say, "" We want more money,- but wewant to spend it. on socialism"", we, cannot expect to have true national development;, ne matter how willing the Australian Government may be to press on with it. The matter goes even deeper than I have already indicated because, if this trend continues and people throughout Australia are urged by State governments to call upon the Australian Government for more and more funds to carry out socialistic enterprises, the ultimate result will be that the federal system will break down altogether and we shall have at Canberra one government for the whole nation. The day when that comes to pass will be a sorry day for Australia. But what else can we expect if people continue to come to the Government at Canberra and ask it to do this, that or the other thing? If this Government continues to assume responsibility for projects that should be undertaken by State governments, the destruction of the federal system must ensue.",62
151,The CHAIEM AN,COMMONWEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND,Mr Adermann) Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,63
152,Mr CURTIN,COMMONWEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND,"Watson) [10.40] - I wish to direct the attention of the committee to an aspect of immigration which is causing the people of this country considerable concern. Recently a supporter of the Government advocated the breaking down of the White Australia policy. I take this opportunity to condemn the suggestion that was made during the debate on the budget by the representative of a Queensland electorate-the honourable member for Bowman (Mr. MCColm)-that a certain number of Asians should be admitted to Australia under a quota system. I am sorry that the honourable member for Bowman is not present to hear my remarks. I believe that a quota system for the admission of Asians to this country would he the thin end of a wedge which would result, ultimately, in a complete breaking down of our White Australia policy. Once a small quota of Asians was admitted to Australia, there would be a demand from certain quarters for an increase of the quota. It would be difficult to resist that demand, and soon the trickle of Asian immigrants would develop into a flood. Within a comparatively short period of time, this country would become overrun hy people from 'various parts of Asia. I am sure that many Queenslanders were as astonished as I was to hear a Queensland member make such a suggestion. Obviously, the honourable member for Bowman is not aware of the unsavoury conditions that developed in that State some years ago after Kanakas, coolies, and Japanese had been taken there to work on the sugar plantations.",63
153,Mr WIGHT,COMMONWEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND,"On the contrary, the honourable member for Bowman made a study of that matter.",63
154,Mr CURTIN,COMMONWEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND,"It is indeed disturbing to kuow that the honourable member for Bowman had studied this subject before he suggested that quotas of Asians should be admitted to Australia to resume the dirty work that was stopped by the people of this country in the early days of this century. As the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Wight) apparently supports that suggestion, we might well wonder about the future policy of the Menzies-Padden coalition in relation to the White Australia policy.",63
155,Mr BRAND,COMMONWEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND,Where does the honourable member stand in the matter?,63
156,Mr CURTIN,COMMONWEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND,"I stand for the preservation of the White Australia policy. The Labour party stands for that policy. It expresses our determination to exclude coloured races from Australia. We have no quarrel with the cry, "" Asia, for the Asians"". By all means, let the Asians live peacefully in their own countries. But the Opposition resents any person trying to bring in a quota system for the admission of Asians to our fair land. In view of the great deal of hysteria that has occurred in relation to this matter, it is interesting to recall the remarks of a great American jurist, Mr. Justice Douglas, who visited Canberra recently. He was asked by a supporter of the Liberal partyWhat impact did the White Australia policy make on the people of Asia? Thf reply of Mr Justice Douglas gave the lie direct to the propaganda that has been indulged in. He saidWhat impact did it make in Asia?I never heard the inatter discussed until I arrived in Australia. The yellow press of Australia, which assisted the Government parties to retain office, and which would assist them to break down our great White Australia policy, should take notice of that comment by Mr Justice Douglas, which was made on the occasion of his entertainment by the Prime Minister (Mr Menzies), HI luncheon in Canberra.",63
157,Mr WIGHT,COMMONWEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND,The honourable member for Bowman never suggested a breaking down of the White Australia policy.,64
158,Mr CURTIN,COMMONWEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND,"The honourable member for Bowman definitely suggested the introduction, on trial, of a quota system to permit Asians to come to sunny Queensland. A very interesting article on this subject appeared in Australian Worker of the 11th August, under the headingWhy "" White Australia "" was horn. War on Kanaka Slavery and Alien Harems. Piebald Quotas not wanted. After tracing the history of the introduction of slave labour onto the Queensland sugar plantations, the article statedThis hair-raising exposure emanates from the lips of a former Tory Postmaster-Genera.! (Mr. Samuel Mauger), 'who joined with several Labour parliamentarians in addressing a tfootseray gathering in 1.801 on the threat, to Australia's standard of living, spiritually and economically. I remind the committee that members of the Liberal party were called Tories in those days. The article went onCommunism is atheistic. But even the Red materialists would have had to don their spiked-shoes to excel the foul conditions reported from the cane-fields by former Postmaster-General Sam Mauger. No Australianexcept a disciple of Judas-ca n read this right exposure of Black Australia slavery without paying a tribute to the memory of the pioneering leaders, who fought to make Australia "" White "", and who bequeathed to present generations, the duty of keeping it so. That is a rebuff to the honourable member for Bowman. Later, the article statedWhen pressed into a corner, the planters That is, the planters of Queensland, who, for their own benefit protected the slavessaid whites could not be depended upon. They got drunk, they struck, they organized for higher wages . . . It is indeed amazing that the statements to which I have referred have been made in this Parliament by representatives of Queensland electorates. The article went onMr Mauger then referred trenchantly to the immorality rampant in Cairns. He mentioned this beuause he thought the moral aspect of' the case interested the mothers of Australia's .sous and daughters as well as the fathers . . . They learned that the Kanakas rose at 5.30 in the morning and worked all the hours of daylight that God gave them. He saw the men at their meal. Saw the creatures, they were little better than animals, rush, well very like a dog to a bone-knives , forks or plates, there were none. They took their rations in their hands and made the best of it. Apparently members of the Australian. Country party would be delighted if they could reduce the conditions of the people of Australia to that level. The report, goes on to say that at the end of their journey they were told that the sugar the industry depended on the employment of Kanaka labour.",64
159,Mr GULLETT,COMMONWEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND,When was this 3,64
160,Mr CURTIN,COMMONWEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND,"In 1901. These conditions led to the abolition of black labour in the Australian cane-fields. When the people of Australia hear such speeches as have been made on this subject by honourable members opposite they should remember the lesson that was learnt in those days. The people should remember that lesson when they hear such speeches as that made hy the honourable member for the Queensland electorate of Bowman, advocating that quotas of Asians, including Kanaka slaves and slaves of other colours and creeds sueh as the Japanese and Indi a n coolies, should be brought into Australia in order to break down the high standard of lif e that has been built up forth- over the last 50 years by the white Australian worker. Honourable members opposite do not believe in good conditions of work. They would like a return to the old slave days when the slave could be whipped to his work from morning to night for a paltry pittance. The article to which I have referred continuedAt Bundaberg they found the time expired Kanaka walking the streets. There they saw the Chinese and Japanese harems. There also they saw the Australian children contaminated by their contact with aliens, and there they began to arrive at some of their deductions. The Australian Country party would like a similar state of affairs to exist now. The article went onThey were told that Kanaka labour could not be done without, but he was there to affirm that the whole question was one of pounds, shillings and pence. iPuiferid p m f it l Australian <3Â«an*ry party members would like - to bring tbese conditions bp Australia again so that .they - might make <estra pounds, shillings And pence - out - of .the blood, - sweat and .tears .of 'Che slaves.

Apparently, the honourable member wag speaking of alleged conditions which obtained in 1901.

In July, 1954, the Minister for Immigration (Mr Holt), whom I represent At the mpinent, made a full statement on the matter in which he said-Tji vjpjv pf speculation and controversy appearing in thp press - recently - regard-vug some restrictive aspects of Australians traditional i.mni4gii-.aitipn pejiey, I - feel it desi-rabie >ts> <rÂ»Â» stats' the general - view p i the Government on this ijupprtant ques.tipji..

Mr M&LE&Y - He is irresponsible,",64
161,Mr BEALE,COMMONWEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND,"Of course he is irresponsible. Having disposed of that piece of irresponsible nonsense, I propose t.o deal with the subject of immigration quotas. 'The 'Government does not .support the proposition for the admission pf quotas of non-European immigrants into this country. 'That proposition has been put forward from time to time by individual persons who are entitled to state t'he'ir own views, but it is not the view of the Government. The example of the United States of America is .often cited. I point .out to the committee that the American quota system embodies quotas for European, as well as for nonEuropean, 'immigrants. 'The quota system that we hear talked about in Australia applies not to Europeans, but only to r-on-Europeams. It immediately gives rise to a form ef discrimination. The very thing that is put forward as the cure for discrimination, and as a method of avoiding the giving of offence to pur Asian friends, will itself in turn give similar offence, because it is discriminatory. It is only a question of degree. A quota is just as discriminatory as is the policy that is criticized, and, therefore, ; it is .equally m offensive, if offence is tb be? taken,, as is' any olfaer form s of restriction-. Tliat fact is acknowledged by the author of a. Boot published by the Indian Council of World! Affairs, who wroteThe quota syst'eni may be adopted in the - narrow national interests! but; l'etf i*. beclearly understood, that; it; is na lessracial in its character. Although the' Government does not believei n the: quota? system this - does not. mean that, theimmigration policy is not to he administered sensibly and tolerantly, and that we shall he oafish and rude to our neighbours or to people-whom we-think-,, on economic and other ground's, should not be. allowed to come to Australia in large, numbers. Ail it means is that, for the sake of Australia's economic, future and of our standards,, and. for many other reasons, some, of which are racial,, although certainly not. for rsciali reasons alone,, we. are determined to select the type of persons, who. may come, t'o Australia. Every oo.uiitey/ h m the,- rigbt. to> m&ke> suckt ad'efe-n-.idin'a'fion-. Some of-the'eorattitries'tbasfc have:advocated' the quota' system are-themselves among, the first, t'o insist, upon their right, toi exclude every one; that. the.y wish to> keep* out., I ' need say no moTe. about the matter; Ast it was. mentioned by the honourable, naemher for Watson, I considered it, appropriate-, to. make> the Government'sposition cFear. I . db so, too,, Because, outside this chamber, in the last feremonths, representatives of other coiiiH^-ies have made statement's that shawl'd! he replied to so that the matter shall he put beyond any doubtOne thing 1 wilT. damage what we call the White Australia/, policy. It is the making of stupid, oafish and rude remarks, about the citizens of other countries. The-, kind of statement that we have heard' from the honourable member for Watson, exacerbates: the hearts and minds of the: citizens of other countries. A reasonableand tolerant, application of our immigration policy will not have that effect"".. All other countries acknowledge that. Australia, is entitled! to administer its. immigration policy as it wishes to db... Remarks Siicii as those made by the; honourable' member for Watson arer the very deptB? of folly, and their only result will be to make foreign' people angry with 1 Australia. Let the> honourable memher.' who taMsi a-boutf ""'black and wAifes '"" 1 1 and declares that, Australians, will not tolerate this' and that policy, remember that Australia needs friend's..

The latest report on employment in Australia published by the Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics reveals that 1,200 persons were in receipt of the unemployment benefit when the Chifley Labour GovernTrllcrit: ment left office in December, 1949, and that 5,308 persons were in receipt of the unemployment benefit in July of this year. How does the Government justify its claim to have stabilized the economy?

LANDSETTLEMENT OF EX - SEBVICEME  upon noticeWith a view to encouraging land ownership by more working farmers and in order to facilitate land settlement firstly, by returned soldiers, secondly, by Australian-born citizens and thirdly, by immigrants, will he discuss with State Premiers the passage of legislation designed to limit the ownership of arable land to the acreage each such owner can farm personally or with the aid of his family?",67
165,Mr MENZIES,COMMONWEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND,The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Commonwealth has some responsibility for soldier settlement and my Government has approached this problem generously and with sympathetic understanding of the needs of ex-servicemen-otherwisee closer settlement is a matter for the States.,68
166,Mr COSTA,COMMONWEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Has the Government made any move to develop plant for the manufacture in Australia of capital equipment now being imported from America which requires frequent dollar loans from the International Rank? 2. If it has made some effort, can he say haw'much of the 204,000,000 dollars borrowed by the Government has been used for the purpose referred to?",68
167,Mr MENZIES,COMMONWEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. Import licences under the International Bank loan arc issued only for equipment which will contribute to the economic development of Australia and which is not available from any other source, cither at all or at reasonable prices or on reasonable delivery terms. In many cases the greater production made possible by the procurement of this equipment increases export receipts or reduces import expenditure. Particularly in theautomotive, earthmoving and traction equipment industries, manufacturing capacity has been, and continues to be, expanded' to reduce Australia's dependence on dollar sources for the supply of capital equipment; and this expansion has been materially assisted by the importation of plant and equipment under International Bank loans. 2.
