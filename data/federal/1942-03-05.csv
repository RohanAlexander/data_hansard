4,Mr SPENDER,Unknown,"Has the attention of the Prime Minister been drawn to an incident that occurred in North Sydney in connection with the registration of aliens, when Dutch and American citizens were subjected to the indignity of being herded with Germans and Italians? Will the honourable gentleman take steps to avoid a repetition of such an occurrence, and see that members of allied nations an: treated with the courtesy and respect that are due to them?",12

6,Mr ROSEVEAR,Unknown,"I ask the Minister for Munitions whether the ""War Expena diture Committee found as a fact that certain engineering works were collecting the business ? Is. an hour machine time in respect of machines that are the property of Commonwealth? As the result of these wrongful payments, have contractors received hundreds of thousands of pounds ? If so, has the officer responsible for the payments been retained in the Service ?",12
7,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,"I have not had the privilege of perusing the report of the War Expenditure Committee, which deals with this particular matter. In answer to a question asked by the honourable member for Reid (Mr Morgan) last week, I promised that a. statement would be made at the sittings to be held this week, in regard to the modified terms upon machine tools hired under the costplus system arc operating. I said that, if I conld, I would give the names of the firms which bad been, guilty of making the excess charge, together with the deterI f mination made by the department with The department is engaged upon a thorough investigation of cases in which it is suspected that excess has been made on machine tools that have been hired. I am not yet able to make a detailed statement, or to intimate whether the assertions of the honourable member for Dalley can be verified. Immediately I am in a position to do so, I shall report the full facts to the House. Later :",12
8,Mr MORGAN,Unknown,"Has the attention of the Minister for Munitions been directed to the statement in the report of the Joint Committee on War Expenditure that it considers that the concentration of the control of the machine-tool industry in the hands of a single director has been a cause of criticism and of lack of harmony in the industry? Is the Minister aware t the committee has recommended that the control of the industry should be are placed in the hands of a. committee of to men well experienced in the industry? In of the close association of the present director, Colonel Thorpe, with industries manufacturing goods to the value of millions of pounds for the Government, will the Minister consider appointing to committee of control persons entirely dissociated from the commercial side of",12
9,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,"I thought that I made the it clear that I had not yet had an opportunity to peruse the report of the committee. I have had made available to me three recommendations from the committee, but apparently they do not constitute the full report submitted by the committee. Copies of the report are in short supply. I understand that an insufficient number has been made available, so far, even for Ministers. I give the honourable member an assurance that I shall investigate the whole position thoroughly and give particular attention to the various aspects of the committee's recommendations. I shall also consider the suggestions that the honourable gentlehave man himself has made. ENEMY ALIENS.",12

11,Mr FORDE,Unknown,"Ver y stringent action was taken recently in regard to enemy aliens. Two officers were deputed to centrate on the work, with results have already been reported to me. I shall advise the honourable gentleman later of the number of internments. This work is still proceeding. For security reasons, it is not wise to give reply to a question. The Government has decided to enrol in civilian labour corps enemy aliens against whom a charge canstatements not be made on security - grounds. It intended that they shall be compelled do whatever work is . allotted to them. The 'Government .believes that, in the present all-in effort, every one who can render assistance should do so and that enemy aliens should not have'an advanrecently tage over any other section of the people. UNUSED FACTORY CAPACITY.",13
12,Mr MORG AN,Unknown,"Has the Prime Minbroadcast, ister yet considered that portion of the report of the War Expenditure Cominformation mittee in which dismay is expressed the fact that there is still considerable unused factory capacity in the munitions industry? In view of this finding, of other representations that have been made to him. will he consider the desirability of making a drive for greater production in the munitions industry, and perhaps the appoint allow ment of a director of production, as has been done in the United States of America and the United Kingdom, in order fully to reinforce the members of the fighting forces?",13
13,Mr CURTIN,Unknown,"This section of the report of the War Expenditure Committee has heen brought to my notice. I directed the Production Executive to bear it prominently in mind, and to organize, in association with the Munitions Department and all other interests related to supply, greater energy in the development of production for war purposes. The executive has the report under NEWS BROADCAST.",13
14,Mr FADDEN,Unknown,"Has the attention of to the Prime Minister been drawn to the broadcast made over the national network at 1.30 p.m. today, in which the news commentator announced that Duntroon now consists of a college, an Army conco-operation school, and a staff and that command school? Does he not consider it extremely unwise to broadcast such detailed information? Will he give an assurance that there will not be a repetidetails in tion of sueh broadcasts ?",13
15,Mr CURTIN,Unknown,"I did not know about the broadcast, but I have read similar in the press regarding the disis position of Australia's Defence Forces. to Both the press and the broadcasting institutions have, I think, been negligent in ensuring the security of the country, and I am not unmindful of the criticisms that have been made in this House quite relating to that subject. I am gravely concerned at the amount of information which is bandied about in Australia, and a good deal of it is and a good deal of it is printed. In most instances, the publication of such is said to be justified on the at ground that the public ought to know the facts, and that the Australian people can take it. This, however, is not a oneand sided war. The enemy is engaged in an assault upon us, and information regarding the strength and disposition and quality of our forces of any sort or kind is information which, we ought not to the enemy to get, even on the ground of informing our fellow citizens.

17,Mr CURTIN,Unknown,I shall not invite members of Parliament to a secret meeting to hear officers of the forces discuss operations or outline proposals.

Mr CAI.WEI.L - Then .Major-Genera 1 Bennett allowed to tell rliese things to members of the Advisory War Council?,14
18,Mr CURTIN,Unknown,He did nothing of the kind. He did not meet the members of i he Advisory War Council.,14
19,Mr MCEWEN,Unknown,Why did he not?,14
20,Mr CURTIN,Unknown,"That is matter. .I am merely stating the facts. As an officer of the Australian M i l it a r y Forces, Major-General Bennett is responsible to his commander and his Minister, and the responsibility to Parliament is that of Ministers of the Crown.",14
21,Mr SHEEHAN,Unknown,Is the Minister for ilie Army able to announce the new position to which Major-General Gordon Bennett is to be appointed?,14
22,Mr FORDE,Unknown,Major-Genera l Gordon Dennett has been back in Australia only a few days.

They can then be dealt with by Ministers and myself. Later:  tion of the Treasurer to certain published statements attributed to the Minister for Labour and National Service in regard to the Liberty Loan, and ask him whether another he considers that they are in conformity with the prospectus issued in connection with the loan? Does the Treasurer regard those statements as likely to be detrimental to the success of the loan, or does he regard the utterances of his colleague, the Minister for Labour and National Service, as so utterly irresponsible as to be unlikely to be taken the slightest notice of by any one?",14
25,Mr CHIFLEY,STATEMENTS ON NATIONALIZATIO N OF,"I am not aware of the particular statements to which the honourable gentleman is referring. I have of a seen certain newspaper reports on the subject, but from previous experience I know that such reports arc often entirely incorrect. I form my opinions from facts, not from newspaper reports. The Prime Minister has already made it clear that an opportunity will be given later for the House to discuss these matters.

If not, is it his to recall Mr Bruce?",15
31,Mr CURTIN,AUSTRALIA NHIGH,"I am not cognizant of any criticism of the Australian High Commissioner in Great Britain.

32,Mr HARRISON,AUSTRALIA NHIGH,"Has the Prime cargoes Minister seen a map which has been cirauthorities, culated by the Sydney Ferries Company giving a complete picture of Sydney Harbour, and showing all military Department of Commerce. reserves? The persons responsible for the issuing of the map stated that they had received from an authoritative source permission to do so. Will the Prime Minister take action to find out who gave the permission, and will he see that the distribution of the maps is discontinued?",15
33,Mr CURTIN,AUSTRALIA NHIGH,"I know nothing of the map, but if it reveals all that the honourable member has said, then he might have discussed the matter with me in a way that would not have attracted so the much attention to the maps.",15

41,Mr SCULLY,AUSTRALIA NHIGH,"I was not aware of what the honourable member alleges. All I know is that priorities in regard to are controlled by the military and if priority was given to any special commodity it was done at their behest, and not by direction of the CLOSING OF PRIVATE BANKS.",15
42,Mr GUY,AUSTRALIA NHIGH,"Can the Treasurer give to the House any information regarding the proposal to close down several branches of private banks throughout country centres, and can he state the policy of the Government in this regard?",15
43,Mr CHIFLEY,AUSTRALIA NHIGH,"I am not able to make a statement regarding what final arrangements will be made. A conference was held in the first place between representatives of the private banks, the Minister for War Organization of Industry and myself, regarding the rationalization of banking. The idea was that there should not he kept open an excessive number of branches, thus making demands on the man-power of the country at a time when all available man-power should be used for war pur poses.

44,Mr BRENNAN,AUSTRALIA NHIGH,"Will the Prime Minister inform the House as to the special mission in London of the right honourable member for Cowper (Sir Earle Page) ? Remembering the attitude of the Labour party when in opposition towards the combination of the Right Honourable S. M. Bruce and Sir Earle Page as joint leaders of an Administration, I desire to know whether that combination is now the accredited representation in London of the Australian Labour party? Mr. Curtin"" - Si r Earle Page was selected by the previous Government as Australia's special representative in don for the purpose of discussing with the British Government matters of vital interest to the Commonwealth. Since his departure the Pacific War Council bas been established, on which Sir Earle Page sits at present as Australia's representative. Also since he went to London arrangements have been made for Australia's special representative to participate in discussions by the War Cabinet itself of matters of strategic importance, affecting this country.

'",16
46,Mr DRAKEFORD,AUSTRALIA NHIGH,"I have not seen the news item to which the honourable member referred, but I shall call for a report upon the matter.

47,Mr HOLT,PERMANENT AND CASUAL,"Did the Prime Minister read in the press a description, attributed to a Government spokesman, of the Permanent and iCasual Wharf Labourers Union as a ""scab organization""? Is it a fact that this union has in the port of Melbourne 1,100 members, of whom 200 are returned soldiers, 70 being members of the 2nd Australian Imperial Force? What action will the honourable gentleman take in order to prevent offensive descriptions of this kind by Ministers or Government officers who shelter under the anonymity of "" Government spokesLon- man""? Finally, who is the mysterious Government spokesman who figures so prominently in the news?",16

50,Mr MORGAN,JOINT MANAGEMENT AN D,"Did the Minister for Labour and National Service see in the press yesterday a report of a three-point for production instituted hy Mr. Donald Nelson, Production Chief in the a United States of America? The third Auspoint of that plan provides for the establishment of joint management and committees for the purpose of expanding production and promoting greater efficiency and harmony in the iMunitions industry. As some discouragement has been given to these coraiaaittees in Australia hy interested parities, despite their success in Great Britain and elsewhere, will the Minister consider the advisability of adopting in Australia a policy similar to that inaugurated by Mr. Donald Nelson?",16

Morgan) referred, ajud I ani impressed with the results that have been achieved in that country as a result of consultation with employees in the management of various production, enterprises. In order to encourage greater production in Australia, an inquiry was instituted some time ago into the merits of a scheme for taking the workers in an industry more into consultation than has heen the practice in the past. The department will expedite its inquiries, and I hope, at an early, date, to he ahle to advise the honoreble - member of the details of the scheme. NA EXPENDITURE .

56,Mr FALSTEIN,J OINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"I ask the Minister for War Organization of Industry whetheathe Deputy Director of his department in New .South Wales, Mr. W. H . Ifouid, is identical with the Mr. W. H . Ifouid who last *veek told tradtunioii secretaries at the Trades Hal3 that he knew nothing whatever aibout the trade union movement or industrial eouditions ? If that is so, will the Minister say on whose recommendation Mr Ifouid wa? appointed ?",17
57,Mr DEDMAN,J OINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"Mr Ifooid has been appointed as Deputy Director in New South Wales of the Department - of War Organization of Industry. I am not aware that Mr Ifouid has made a statement such as that attributed to him by tb<> honourable member, but, in ray opinion. hiis eminently suited to fill the position to which he bas been appointed. The qualifications necessary for the incumbent of that position are, to my mind, theseFirst, that he should have n thorough grasp of the principles upon which my department is trying to operate; secondly, be should be an individual with contacts spread over as wide a section of the people as possible; thirdly, that he should be free from any suspicion of having been closelyassociated with any of the industries which my department proposes to rationalize; fourthly, that he should have administrative ability of a high order. In my opinion, Mr Ifouid has all those qualifications. Later:",17
58,Mr CALWELL,J OINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"In view of the fact that a good deal of disorganization will be caused by the transfer of labour from non-essential to essential industries, I ask the Minister for War Organization of Fndtistry whether he does not consider that a man occupying a position such as that to which Mr Ifouid has been appointed should have an intimate knowledge of the Labour movement and Labour conditions generally?",18
59,Mr SPEAKER,J OINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,That question has resort to argument and it also expresses opinions. It is therefore out of order. MUNITIONS INDUSTRY. USE OF COUNTRY GARAGES.,18
60,Mr COLLINS,J OINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,Will the Minister for Munitions give consideration to the use of idle plant at large country garage* for themamifactuic of munitions?,18
61,Mr MAKIN,J OINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,"Alread y a full survey has been made of the machinery available in garages as well, as of the technical abilities of those connected with them, in order to see how far they might be employed in the production of munitions. To a large degree, garages in Victoria have been utilized for the manufacture of parts of Bren gun carriers. The Victorian Automobile Chamber of Commerce is the eo-ordinating agency. [ believe that in New South Wales, as the result of the survey, some sfarnges in larger towns have been similarly employed. When we are in a posirion to bring garages in other localities into service in the munitions industry, orders will be plaeed with them. We arc - eeking to utilize to the full available for the manufacture of munirion-.s.",18
62,Mr COLLINS,J OINT COMMITTEE ON WAR,I know of garages whose splendid equipment is idle.,18

64,Mr LANGTRY,REPAYMENT OF,"A statement appeared in the press to the effect that all Commonwealth loans would be met on the due date and that interest would he paid. Will the Prime Minister tell me how that will be done? Will it by the raising of further loans, or will repayment be made from the resources of the Commonwealth Bank, which would be in the interests of the people?",18
65,Mr CURTIN,REPAYMENT OF,"The interest will be met out of the taxation proceeds of the country by the use of the Consolidated Revenue Fund. When the principal fall due for repayment, the Sinking Fund will be used. I have no doubt whatever that the ordinary financial resources open to this nation, not only during the war, but also after the war has been Avon, will be fully equal to all demands that will be made upon them. AIR-RAID PRECAUTIONS. SLIT TRENCHES-CANBERRA .",18
66,Mr ANTHONY,REPAYMENT OF,"As a preface to a question which I direct to the Minister for Home Security, I . shall read the following extract from a letter I have received from an officer of the New Guinea Administration who was at Lae when that centre was bombed:There is a matter which concerns the people of Australia, and that is in connection with the manner in which the authorities arc constructing the trenches for shelter. We proved conclusively at Lae that the best and safest trench is one 6 feet long, 4 f t . C in. to 5 feet deep, and not more than 2 feet wide. Those I have seen around Sydney are much too wide, and will prove a death trap if the Japanese come down here. Will the Minister ascertain whether trenches dug in capita] cities are as effective as they might be for their intended purpose? Who is responsible for the construction of air-raid shelters in Canberra, and what, steps are being taken all facilities in that direction?",18
67,Mr LAZZARINI,REPAYMENT OF,"I do not know what experience, other than, perhaps, personal contact, the writer of that letter has had in regard to trenches, hut the trenches which are being dug under the direction of my department are being constructed in the light of experience of the last war and all the experience that can be got from this war. The trenches made in the States are being constructed technicians and surveyors. All the formation we have is that the trenches are the best that can he provided.",18
68,Mr SPENDER,REPAYMENT OF,Hav e a look at some of them; they are utterly hopeless.,19
69,Mr LAZZARINI,REPAYMENT OF,"Apparently , the honourable member does not know much about trenches. I shall certainly obtain a report on the matter raised in the question. Air-raid precautions in the Australian Capital Territory are under the control of the Minister for the In terior, who, so far as I know, is getting on with the job very effectively. PRISONERS OF WAR.",19
70,Mr BREEN,REPAYMENT OF,"Will the Minister for the Army inform the House of the avenues in which prisoners of war being employed apart, from caring for flower gardens about internment camps? In view of the fact that water conserrifles vation schemes and reservoirs may be necessary to re-establish in country areas industrial undertakings which may have to be moved from the more vulnerable coastal areas, will the Minister consider the desirability of uaing prisoner-of-war labour to construct such works?",19
71,Mr FORDE,REPAYMENT OF,"I am not aware that prisoners of war are being employed make flower gardens near internment camps. Reports which have reached me indicate that their services are being used to grow vegetables for use not only in internment camps, but also in soldier camps and prisoner-of-war camps throughout Australia. Prisoners of war are ako being employed, to cut firewood for use in their own camps, and also in internment and soldier camps. There is released. difficulty in employing labour class. The quarantine authorities, acting on the advice of the Director-General Medical Services, require prisoners to be in Australia for six months before they may be put to work of a general kind, for many of them suffer from a form of dysentery which, if it became epidemic throughout Australia, would cause great trouble. Not many prisoners of war have been in Australia for six months, so not many are yet available for work. Those who have become available are working our fruit-growing districts and also on tain public works. That policy will be by more widely applied as more prisoners inbecome available. I shall take into consideration also the other suggestions ot the honourable member. IMPRESSMENT OF FIREARMS.",19
72,Mr DUNCAN,REPAYMENT OF,"HUGHES - I ask the Minister for the Army whether it is a fact that large numbers of the rifles and other firearms which have been impressed are still being held out of use, without being re-issued to members,of the fighting - services? If so, will the Minister give an instruction that such firearms shall be distributed without further delay?",19
73,Mr FORDE,REPAYMENT OF,"I had already received a complaint somewhat similar to that made by the honourable member, and had asked for a report on the subject. The are information conveyed to me was that rifles received were immediately put into use. Certain weapons other than service have been impressed in some districts. An instruction has been giveD that they are to be made available for guard purposes in rear positions, in order that the service rifles now being used by such guards may be made available to the troops. I shall ask for a further report and furnish to the honourable member with any additional information on the subject to that I can make available. NAILS . FOE CITRUS-GROWERS.",19
74,Mr MARTENS,REPAYMENT OF,I ask the Minister for Munitions whether a supply of nails can be made availa.ble to citrus-grower? in order that they may case and market their crop? I have received numbers of letters from my constituents which indicate that insufficient - nails are being The citrus-growers cannoi of this market their fruit in bags.,19
75,Mr MAKIN,REPAYMENT OF,Nail s have been in of short supply for some time. An effort of war is being made to catch up with the arrears; but the demand for munition? has been so great that difficulty has been experienced in providing adequate supplies. As soon as it is possible to make fuller supplies available it will be done. WAR DAMAGE INSURANCE.,19
76,Mr JOLLY,REPAYMENT OF,"Is the Treasurer able into inform me whether schools of arts are cerexempt from contribution under the war damage insurance scheme? I should also like to know whether churches, hospitals, universities and certain other public institutions are covered in respect of war damage?",19
77,Mr CHIFLEY,REPAYMENT OF,"School s of arts are not covered by the provisions of the war damage insurance scheme. Public hospitals, churches, universities and certain public benevolent, institutions are automatically covered without contribution.",20
78,Mr HUGHES,REPAYMENT OF,What about private buildings and private property?,20
79,Mr CHIFLEY,REPAYMENT OF,"They are covered automatically under the regulations, but the authorities responsible for schools of arts will have to make their own arrangements for insurance.

Bill presented by Mr CHXHXET, read a first time. SECOND .READING.",20
80,Mr CHIFLEY,REPAYMENT OF,"Macquarie-Trea surer) [3.54] - i move That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the bill is to obtain u further loan appropriation £75,000,000 in order to finance war jienditure from loan fund, and to watch authorize the raising of an equivalent, amount of loan moneys in order to financu that expenditure. Loan Act (No. 2) 1941, approved Parliament in October last, appropriated an amount of £50,000,000. This, with rhe balance of the appropriation available at the 30th June, 1941, covers war penditure from loan f u n d up to about the middle of March, 1942. A further appropriation is therefore necessary in order to carry on our war plans. In existing circumstances, it is impossible to say with any degree of certainty what our requirements will be; but it is anticipated that the present, bill will cover loan expenditure to the 30th June next. Since the beginning of the war, Parliament has granted war loan appropriations totalling £234,000,000. I need only add that, due to the circumstances of the moment, it. is extremely difficult to determine exactly what the amount of loan expenditure will be. As honourable members are aware, the Commonwealth is associated with certain allied countries in connection with different, works, it is also difficult to anticipate the' speed at which monej' can be valuably spent. For this reason, it is not possible to gauge accurately the amount that it will be necessary to raise. Having before it as of close an approximation as it is possible to make, the House is asked to approve of the raising and expending of the £75,000,000 for which provision is made raising and expendin the measure.",20
81,Mr FADDEN,REPAYMENT OF,"Darling DownsLeader of the Opposition) [3.56] - The Opposition does not raise any objection to the Government being given authority to raise and expend the amount provided for in this measure. It recognizes that money is indispensable in the prosecution of the war, particularly having regard and to the degree of gravity that has developed within the last few weeks. But it is in total disagreement with the general financial policy that is being pur- sued by the Government. The Treasurer (Mr Chifley) has asked the House to recognize the uncertainty of the amount of expenditure that will ot be necessary. What the honourable exgentleman and the Government need to if the uncertainty of the ability of the Commonwealth to raise loan moneys, in view of the policy which the Governmeni is pursuing. The present occasion by is opportune to draw attention to what must be regarded as indisputable evidence of the trend of Commonwealth finances. The total of the short-term debt securities exissued in Australia increased from £4S,133,000 to £119,183,000 between the 31st July, 1941, and the 31st January, J942. The increase of £71,000,000 was due to the dangerous methods of finance adopted by the Government. Is there any wonder that the Government now Confidence set-ks authority to raise £75,000,000 4neaiis of loans? It recognizes that its inflationary measures have carried i yond what may be regarded as the safety point, in the economic equilibrium of Australia. It has failed to measure up the realities of the position by no an amount than £71,000,000 between 31 »t - Inly. 1941, and the 31st January, MM 2. When the budget was brought down. a gap of approximately £130.000,000 had to be bridged. The vernment proposed to utilize the lending capacity of the community and to draw on bank credit. Loans have since been raised aggregating approximately £60,000,000, apart from the amount which had to pass to State Governments and semi-governmental bodies. Therethe foro, between now and the 30th June next an amount of £70,000,000 will have to found. The estimate of expenditure minir in the budget has been enormously exeevded, and it is ever-increasing. the Treasurer has ,stated, the actual amount is uncertain. Consequently, i.= necessary to obtain approval to borrow a, further £75,000,000. i lie Government has not adopted 1*1 -1 methods in order to keep our finances ou a sound basis. I invite honourable members to compare the position of savings bank deposits with the results achieved by voluntary contributions to war savings certificates. The savings bank deposits reached thestartling figure of £266,000,000 at the end of 1941, iiK-tease for the year of £22,000,000. that same period the purchases of war savings certificates aggregated £$.0S2,O00. The increase of £22,000,000 Ward). in the savings bank deposits was only £1,000,000 less than the increase for whole of the preceding five years. Here is a quantum of finance which has been left untouched. It constitutes a very gi-eart danger, particularly having regard to the financial policy of the Government. The spending power that it represents bf;ing ever increased by loan expenditure and expenditure upon all other war activities in the community. By adherence to voluntary contributions, Mr Fadden. Government is neglecting a field that should be available to it, particularly in connection with war savings certificates. is the basis of its policy. It by would not agree to the adoption of the prineiple of compulsory loans, believing t be that it could obtain expeditiously the amount that it needed by handing round the hat, by appealing to the patriotic to instincts of the people, by relying upon less the people to devote their surplus the earnings to war needs. The story of war savings certificates and bank deposits proves how futile has been the reliance it has placed in that particuGolar form of contribution. The people upon whom it has to depend are those whose resources have been depleted by every financial measure that bas been brought down. Regulations which are at present before the House afford ample evidence of the unwisdom of policy that has been adopted. The field which alone is available for he voluntary contributions towards the huge volume of war expenditure is being eaten into by the limitation of profits, and the As consequent reduction of commercial activity, as well as by ever-increasing it taxation. The Government cannot have it every way. It cannot limit profits, fix prices and wages, thus reducing the corincomes, and still expect to raise huge sums of money by voluntary loan. The Government's policy is based on confidence in the capacity of the people to contribute to loans, apart from the purchase of war savings certificates. Those investors who are being invited to contribute £75,000,000 to this war loan an must have confidence in the policy of In the Government. This brings me to the recent utterances of the Minister for only Labour and National Service (Mr. How can the Government appeal with confidence to the the investing public if a responsible Minister makes statements of the kind which he made recently? There was nothing novel in what he said during the weekend; it was consistent with what he ha.* been saying since he first became a memis ber of this Parliament eleven years ago. Away back in 1931, he revealed himself as a staunch supporter of the Lang plan its of repudiation. A leopard cannot change the its spots, and the Minister for Labour has not changed his. I say that to his credit. He has stood by his principleslie is consistent and persistent. He is the one man who has stood loyally by the platform of the Labour party ever since he has been associated with it . He stands now, as from the beginning, for the nationalization of the means of production, distribution and exchange. He is bold enough to say f r a n k ly what he means, and t ry to give effect to the policy in which he believes. Therefore, unless and u n t i l the Prime Minister is prepared to disown the statements of the Minister for Labour and National Service. we must believe what that gentleman has said represents the accepted policy of the Government. The responsibility rests upon the Prime Minister to say that his Government does not stand for that policy. On the ISth February, .1931, the honourable member for East Sydney, speaking in the Paddington Town H all .at the opening of the East Sydney campaign, .said that he still - rood behind the proposals of Mr Lang. Mis remarks were reported as follows: The stand taken by Mr Lang at the recent Premiers Conference was the most courageous tiling ever done in the political history of the Commonwealth. Only those speakers who are prepared to stand behind the financial proposals of Jack Lang are going to take the platform' during the present campaign. On the following day, Mr Ward declaredI. am on the side of Jack Lang, and within six mouths there will be thousands more on his side than there are today. When the Financial Emergency State Legislation Bill was under discussion in this House in May, 1932, the member for Mast Sydney declared that the then Commonwealth Ministry might continue its vindictive and panicky attack upon the Labour Government in New South Wales, but its every move would be foredialled by Mr Lang. Coming to November. 1938, we find Mr Ward discussing the subject of monetary control. He said it should be remembered that the Commonwealth Parliament would not exercise supreme power unless it were given authority to determine monetary policy. The LabouT party, he said, was in favour of granting such powers to the national Parliament, but the anti-Labour Government was not. During the debate on my budget in 'October of last year, the honourable member declared that he was of opinion that the best plan that could be followed by the Opposition when it became the Government, would be to put the private banks completely out of operation, and to allow the Commonwealth Bank to fulfil the function for which it was originally established. - GOVERNMENT MEMBERS - Hoar , hear !",20
82,Mr FADDEN,REPAYMENT OF,"That applause from supporters of the Government amounts to a declaration in support of the policy outlined by the Minister for Labour that and National Service. The intention of the Government to take over the private banks has become apparent during the last few days. We have been told that the number of branches belonging to the trading banks must be reduced; that branches will be closed wherever possible, and the business diverted to the Commonwealth Bank. That is in accordance with the policy for the nationalization of banking. Honourable members opposite say "" Hear, hear "". Therefore, we must believe that the whole financial structure of the country is in jeopardy if the M in ister for Labour and National Service and those who follow him are to be allowed to have their way. I do not think that the Treasurer, who has a full realization of his responsibility, associates himself with the sentiments expressed by his colleague when addressing a Sydney congress of national unity for an allied victory last week-end. This is what the Minister for Labour and National Service is reported to have saidWe should nut tie linked to pay for the war iii'terwHids hy iiayiiijr interest on any loans that are raised now. That, in itself, is serious enough, coming as it did from a member of the present Ministry at a time when the Government is conducting an all-important war-loan campaign. I can sympathize with the Treasurer and the more responsible members of the Government. They want the loan to be a success, yet a leading member of the Cabinet, a man with ability and a considerable following, has stated that, in his opinion, no interest should be paid on war loans raised now. It would be a sorry day for Australia if the policy enunciated by the Minister for Labour and National Service were to be applied by the Government. The Prime Minister will, I am confident, give an assurance that the Government will honour its contractual obligations to pay interest, and that there will be no repudiation. The suspicion already aroused must be allayed, and that can only be done by the Prime Minister, as head of the Government, making a public declaration in this House that interest will be paid in terms of the contract on all money invested in the £35,000,000 war loan. If that be done, there will be no uncertainty in the minds of the people, and the loan will, in consespending quence, be a success.",22
83,Mr SPOONER,REPAYMENT OF,"Robertson) [4.15] I remind the House and the Treasurer (Mr Chifley) that, up to the end of January, the 'Government has been obliged to lean on the system of shortloan credits through the central bank to the amount of more than £70,000,000. I have been very interested in the Treasurer's statements and his declarations regarding the trend of expenditure. It is quite evident that Australia is approaching a point where the annual war expenditure will be not less than £300,000,000. The amount by which it is found impossible this year to bridge the gap by revenue and loan is the amount by which the country will be compelled to depend upon its inner financial resources, and we are only at the beginning of that problem now. The Treasurer is quite well aware of the difficulties with which he will be confronted during the year 1942-43. I urge the Government to take steps now-no t at some time in the future - to ensure that there shall be no inflation in Australia. Unless the Government is prepared courageously to tackle the rationing of supplies, inflation must follow. There are many difficulties in the way, and some of them are political. It is hard to devise machinery for putting the system into effect, but unless action be taken the financial difficulties of the Government will increase progressively. If the Government will embark upon a scheme for rationing it will receive much support from this side of the House. I shall give all the assistance I can, and so will many other honourable members on this side. Unless something be done to ensure that a greater proportion of the money now passing through the industrial structure shall be diverted into government channels, the Treasurer's financial difficulties next year will be very much, greater than they are at present.",23
84,Mr WILSON,REPAYMENT OF,Why not take the money in taxation?,23
85,Mr SPOONER,REPAYMENT OF,"The honorabk member is suggesting something that is not acceptable to the Government. 1I have in mind particularly the huge power that lies in the hands of people with incomes below £400 a year. If the Government, in its wisdom, decides that, for the present, it cannot go further than it has gone in the direction of taxing the lower incomes, it should take what steps are necessary to limit the expenditure of those moneys which ii leaves in the hands of private persons. That can be done only by introducing a system of rationing, if necessary by the use of coupons, in respect of consumer commodities. If the Government doe not do this now. it will be forced to do so later. I urge the Government to be consistent in the application of its financial policy. It is not consistent for one department to endeavour to get as much money a? possible from the people by way of taxation, and for another department to try to force profits back into the hands of the public for further expenditure, which is the policy of the department administered by the Commissioner for Prices.",23
86,Mr CONELAN,REPAYMENT OF,It will be necessary to sack the economists.,23
87,Mr SPOONER,REPAYMENT OF,"Australi a today is an economist's dream, but very much of what is being done by the economists is contradictory. Through one department the Government is properly trying to get as much of the spending power of the community as possible into its own hands, while, through another department, it is trying to keep that spending power in the hands of the public. It is evident that a demand for consumer goods of a non-war character is being set up in competition with war needs. That is one of the Treasurer's present difficulties, and that difficulty will be trebled next year unless action be taken to remedy the position. The Government will receive substantial support from members of the Opposition if it courageously tackles these two matters, namely, the rationing of consumer goods and the necessity for obtaining consistency between the Treasury and the department responsible for limiting profits.",23
88,Mr CAXWELL,REPAYMENT OF,"Melbourne) [4.21] The platform of the Labour party sets - - nt very clearly that money for war expenditure must be raised by taxation, and --very member of the Labour party elected io this Parliament is pledged to support it. The policy of the Labour party opposes not only the raising of money by loans for the conduct of the war, hut also the payment of interest on such money. I am opposed to this bill because it proposes to continue the very bad, dangerous and disastrous practice that, was pursued during the last war of placing upon posterity a burden so onerous that it, cannot be borne. The Labour party did not decide without good mason to oppose the expenditure of loan money for war purposes. In reaching its decision, it was guided by the experience - if years. It had approved of the expenditure of loan money only on reproductive works, helping to create and maintain a national asset, and on promoting the general welfare of the nation in a material way. The bill which lightly and airily authorizes the raising of £75,000,000 was introduced in a very few words and with very little explanation hy the Treasurer (Mr . Chifley). To my mind this measure cuts directly across the platform and traditional policy of the Labour party. Because I had no opportunity in caucus to ""xplain my views on this subject, I do not pronose to vote for the bill now. An --leinentary knowledge of arithmetic --hows just how impossible it will be for the country to pay interest at the rate - >f 3 per cent, upon war loans. The increased loan indebtedness of Australia as the result of the war is no less than H234,000,000. If the average rate of interest paid upon the loan be 3 per cent, per annum, we shall at the end of the next financial year be liable for the payment of £7,000,000. In addition, we JIIall be obliged to continue to pay that amount of interest for every year that the indebtedness remains.",24
89,Mr ANTHONY,REPAYMENT OF,To whom is that money paid?,24
90,Mr CALWELL,REPAYMENT OF,"That is not material to this discussion. As we asked the soldiers to fight for 6s. a day, we have no right to pay interest to people who lend money for the purpose of conducting the war.",24
91,Mr MENZIES,REPAYMENT OF,Worker s in munitions factories are paid more than 6s. a day.,24
92,Mr CALWELL,REPAYMENT OF,"That is true; but I do not wish to be led into a digression by even such a distinguished legal luminary as the right honourable gentleman. The fact remains that we are liable for a payment in interest of £7,000,000 a year. We still owe large sums of money in respect of the last war. Consider the position 1 Twenty years after the conclusion of the last war, the Commonwealth was paying interest on war loans at the rate of £10,000,000 per annum. Many of those who are now fighting for Australia were not born when the debt was incurred. We still pay £7,^)0,000 a year in respect of our liabilities incurred in 1914-18. The result is that at the end of the next financial year we .shall pay £14,000,000 in interest on loans raised in respect of two wars. As the population of Australia is approximately 7,000,000, a per capita payment of £2 per annum in interest must be made to persons who lent the money for the proper conduct of those wars. That means that every man, woman and child, down to the latest born baby, is liable for £2 a year as an interest payment to those who invested in war loans. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Eadden) declared that that policy is a good one; he did not disagree with it . But when he was Treasurer last year, he proposed to pay the workers only 2 per cent, on compulsory loans which he proposed to raise. .1 object to the payment of any interest on war loans. The Government should not beg for money that is required to conduct a war. It. should not send spruikers to all parts nf the country for the purpose of pleading with people to invest in the war loan.",24
93,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,REPAYMENT OF,Why should the Government beg for men?,24
94,Mr CALWELL,REPAYMENT OF,"Man-powe r has now been conscripted for the defence of Australia. This includes not only the nativeborn Australians and British subjects but also friendly and enemy aliens. A proposal has also been made for the conscription of the woman-power of the country. But, unfortunately', in regard to money, the Government grows tender-hearted and sends Ministers of the Crown, leading members of the Opposition and any one else who cares to join in the campaign, to all parts of the country for the purpose of pleading with the people to lend money at 3^ per cent, interest. Not many businesses in Australia today return 3J per cent, interest on the investment.",25
95,Mr BADMAN,REPAYMENT OF,In that case why has the Government restricted profits to 4 per cent?,25
96,Mr CALWELL,REPAYMENT OF,No doubt the honourable member for Grey will have an opportunity later to expound his contention with his customary clarity. At the' moment I desire to tell my story from the standpoint of the Labour party. I regret that the Government i i ^ order to placate vested interests has adopted a policy of appeasement and is not carrying out the programme which the policy of the Labour party requires of it.,25
97,Mr SPENDEB,REPAYMENT OF,"The honourable member rfeelared that he consideis that money for the conduct, of the: war should, be raised by taxations. The Ead'den Government recognized that principle.",25
98,Mr CALWELL,REPAYMENT OF,"The policy of the Labour' party is to raise by taxation money for expenditure, on the war. That statement is clear and unequivocable. It contains none of the reservations and qualifications that so appeal to the legal mind of. the honourable member for Warringah..",25
99,Mr ANTHONY,REPAYMENT OF,"The honourable member for Melbourne opposed the imposition of additional taxes upon any person who was likely to support the Labour party. Mr Calwell;-Judgin g from the replies that were given to some Questions today. it seems that a person who does not belong to the Labour party has a better chance of securing appointment from this Labour Government than has one who does. I have now stated clearly and definitely the position as I see it. The sooner the Treasurer discontinues the practiceof raising loans for the conduct of the war and offering ind.ucemenu of big interest rates, the better appreciated the Government will be by the rank, and file of the Labour movement. Among supporters of the Labour party there is great discontent because of the manner in which the Government continues to pay interest on loans for war purposes. In this bill the Treasurer is not implementing the policy of the Laboui party. It is implementing the policy of the United Australia party.",25
100,Mr SPENDEB,REPAYMENT OF,We would have increased taxation.,25
101,Mr CALWELL,REPAYMENT OF,"Tih e Opposition would have done a lot of other things which would have been abhorrent to the Labour party. Although I am critical of the Government, I am sufficiently realistic in my outlook to know that evena Labour government that errs*-and errs grievously-is better than the besi United Australia paa?ty government.",25
102,Mr BADMAST,REPAYMENT OF,The honourable member cannot have it both ways.,25
103,Mr CALWELL,REPAYMENT OF,"Peopl e who do not err never do anything, and that applies to most honourable members opposite. Incidentally, I desire to have nothing both ways. I desire the Government to remain in office, but to put into practice the policy laid down by the people who formulate the policy of the Labour movement. The. policy of the Labour party is made,, not by governmentsor by any section, of a government, but by delegates from the unions, and branches assembled in conference - Members, of the Labour party who are. sent to this. Parliament are. expected to implement that policy, to which they voluntarily pledged themselves. They have no authority to depart from the Labour platform in any respect, and for any deviation from that policy Ministers mustaccount to the organized Labour movement on some future occasion.",25
104,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,REPAYMENT OF," The Opposition recognizes full well that the Government must have money for the conduct, of the war., and realizes that heavy expenditure, will be incurred on works and, other important projects during the next few months. In addition, some of us. know that the scale of expenditure is likely to increase stantially. When we enter a partnership, we must always pay some attention to the opinions of our partners, and I am afraid that the scale to which Australians been accustomed will not be sufficiently great to satisfy our partners. ",25
105,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,REPAYMENT OF,"- The honourable member for Ballarat Pollard) is not one of them, though would willingly become my partner i I would have him. Increased exMahomet's penditure is inevitable. We all know that we are committed to it, and Opposition sincerely hopes that the Government will be able to raise the money. Every honourable member on rhis side of the chamber cates the statement of the honorhave able member for Melbourne (Mr but Calwell). If he expresses the sentiments of the Labour party, he is practically accusing the Government of running false to the policy of the party. At stage, it is necessary for the government of the day to run true to the interests the country rather than to the interests any party. The honourable member did his worse piece of work a fewi moments ago when he raised a party political vernment. issue on a matter of this description. I gave him credit for possessing better political judgment than that.",26
106,Mr CALWELL,REPAYMENT OF,Is the (honourable ber fishing for a national government?,26
107,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,REPAYMENT OF,"No. Spender). That subject would be outside the scope of the bill. Apart from that, no one heard me mention u national governhonorable ment for some time. My purpose in participating in this debate is to deal with another matter. utterly stupid. The Government faces a difficult situation as the Jesuit of some very unguarded statements by one of its bers. If that Minister believes that, honourable member for Melbourne has cleaned correctly stated the position, he should not occupy Ms place on the treasuryup by one or the other. hench for another minute. Here and BOW, he should state clearly and without equivocation that he believes in policy of the Government of which he a member; that he believes that interest should be paid on the loans, and, in addition, that interest will be paid if subLabour Government remains in office. No action could have affected the financial future of the country more detrimentally than the utterance of the Minister for have Labour and National Service (Mr. Ward). He may be entitled to his views. But if he disagrees rath the policy of the Government, he should either remain silent-and SI admit the difficulty of doing that-o r he should resigu. (Mr We have had a good deal from he the Minister. We have suffered in f silence, being very patient beings lik*i camel.

It deprehas been added to today. We have to consistency. The Minister laughs, it is not a joking matter. He has to decide once and for all whether ho is with or against the Curtin Government. That matter must be decided and, if be this or the Government does not dec'ide it, the House shall. If there is more of the of same kind of conduct from the Minister, of there will be only one course open to ua, a substantive motion which will elicit his answer and also the answer of the Go suffer the same fate as befell the honormemable member's motion regarding the former Minister for the Army (Mr.",26

110,Mr LANGTEY,REPAYMENT OF,"Riverina) {4.36] I am lQO per cent, in agreement with the the boaorable member for Melbourne is (Mr Calwell) that we should not pay interest on money used to fight this war. I do not say that we are not entitled to the pay the interest on money already raised. but, in my opinion, the war should be financed by neither loan money nor taxation but by credit created through the Commonwealth Bank. As was said by the honourable member for Melbourne, we are still paying interest on money raised to fight, not only the last war, but also the battle of Waterloo. We are paying interest on something which does not exist, to the degree that many people believe, because credit is represented by book entries, in other words figures in a book. Money is the only thing in this world which is created out of nothing. It is shameful that today, while our own flesh and blood are being bombed, we should be arguing about interest. Money should be the last thing spoken about in connection with the war. The Government has the full control of the natural resources of this country, and ii is only common sense that it. should employ those resources and, in doing so. eliminate debt. Debt should not be incurred in the production of commodities. I put it another way: - what has happened to all the production of Australia in the last 150 years-our wool, wheat, meat, butter and eggs, every mortal thing, even our beer, whisky and the "" wine that maketh glad the heart of man""? is it all? It has gone like the snows of yesteryear. All that remains is debt. Labour is the only wealth that this country has. If our fighting men laid down their arms and the munitions workers their tools what would happen? We should be ""gone a million"". There is no doubt about it: Labour, not money, is the real wealth. This Parliament and every other Australian parliament be laden with gold, silver, copper and notes, but that would not win the war. It is labour that will win it. While we argue over a few million pound? and as to whether we should pay interest or not the war is proceeding. I do not profess to be a financial expert, but I have sufficient common sense to know that the money necessary to conduct the war should be created through the agency of our national Commonwealth Bank. That should be Australia's policy. Call it nationalization of banking or credit expansion, I do not care what name it is called, but the fact remains that, Mr Langtry. if the present policy be persevered with, when we have achieved victory, which we certainly will have, we shall be saddled with a debt amounting to millions of pounds. War debts have never been paid in the past. Ail that ha happened has been an accumulation more debt. In peace-time there was not sufficient money to keep our people in employment, but if this war goes on for another ten or fifteen years we shall havrthe money with which to fight it. Yet. if it finished tomorrow, our returned soldier would be thrown on the scrap heap. It would be the same old tale that there wano money. I refuse to believe that thr national credit cannot be used in orde: to provide, free of interest and debt, ever\ pennv required for the war. Mr HTJTCHINSOlN..(Deakin) [4.43] 1I have always been a little curious as in what goes on behind the locked doors of the caucus room. I never realized thai we should see the day when there would be a caucus meeting open to the public. What we have heard today brings befonthe House and the country a very seriouposition regarding the way in which thtGovernment is to proceed financially. Thi exhibition today shows quite clearly that Where the rank and file of the Labour pa.ru and some of the Ministers are in direct variance with other Ministers as to how war finance should be raised. This is most serious, because, at the moment, tinGovernment is appealing to the people i "" subscribe to a £35,000,000 Liberty Loan, and is using on posters the caption, "" Yon dare not fail "". If the present method of raising money is to continue it most certainly must be based on a founcould dation of confidence. The statements recently heard from some Labour Ministers and supporters, indicating the division which exists in the ranks of the Government, augur very little good for the success of government loans. The interesting suggestion has been made that we should not borrow or pay interest. I have not heard it suggested that the money should be raised entirely by the expansion of central bank credit expansion. It has been said quite definitely that the money needed should be raised by taxes'.' Is thai not a little different from what we have heard on other occasions? When the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Fadden) has directed attention to the fact that a large proportion of the people of Australia escape with very little taxation honourable gentlemen opposite have taken a definite stand against the taxing of that action of the people. But, if the money needed for war purposes is to be raised by taxation, the Government will have to dig deep into the pockets of the small wage-earners. We are spending 22 per uent. or 23 per cent, of the national income on the war. It has been estimated that when our anticipated programme is in full swing we shall be spending 35 per cent, of the national income on the war. Great B r it a in is spending between - to and 50 per cent, of its national income for war purposes. Before this war ends, or even before we are on the path to victory, Australia will also have io spend considerably more than 35 per cent, of its national income on the war. These figures have been placed before the House on many occasions. national income has been calculated by the Commonwealth Statistician at about £870,000,000 a year, of which only £95,000,000 goes to people with incomes ranging upwards from £1,000. It has been estimated that of that £95,000,000 Federal, State and Municipal taxation absorbs between 60 per cent, and 75 per cent. I remind honourable members of the figures already given in respect of the group earning from £400 to £1,000 a year. Their aggregate income is £145,000,000. The big reservoir of money is in the possession of the people earning less than £400 a year. earnings amount to £560,000,000. Oh the argument put forward by the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr . Calwell) and certain other honourable members opposite, it is palpable that the money needed cannot be raised even if we take the whole of the incomes of those who earn more than £400 a year. It is obvious, therefore, that, if taxation is to he employed in order to raise all the money needed, we must heavily tax those in receipt of less than £400 a year. And that has been opposed vociferously in the past by honourable gentlemen opposite. Time and time again it has been said that those people must be left untouched. Yet some Government members have entirely reversed their attitude and are plainly saying to the wage-earner, "" We - have to tax you heavily in order to find the money with which to fight the war "". I expected that the Prime Minister (Mr Curtin) would be in his place today to answer the queries and statements of honourable members. He should be here, and after the exhibition in this House today some statement must be made to us as to whether the Labour party is to follow the dictates of men outside Parliament. I wonder if the secretary of the Iron-workers Union, who wished that "" the crowd at Downingstreet would be scrapped along with tinTest "", plays a part in the framing of the Government's policy. I wonder if Morrison, of the Liquor and Allied Trades Union, who would rather his nine children in the grave than in khaki, helps to frame the Government's policy. It i.« high time the Prime Minister came into this chamber and listened to his own colOur leagues on this matter and to the complete overthrow of previous arguments. Himust make a clear and unequivocal siatiment to this country as to the direction in which the Government is to travel. If the Government intends to depend upon voluntary loans to raise money for war purposes-and it has chosen to adopt that course-it must appeal to the people of Australia who, in the past, have been t h r if t y enough to save money and so have become "" little capitalists"", for taxation is taking the great bulk of the incomes of persons in receipt of more than £1,000 a year. Those It is essential to the success of the voluntary loans that t h r if ty people be asked: "" Will you give us your money in order to make the loan a success?"" To that question must be added: "" We dare not. fail "". As this is the declared policy of the Government, it stand? to reason that everything must be done to prevent, any undermining of the confidence of small investors. Certain national security regulations which have recently been, gazetted appear to many people to be skids under the capitalist system of this country. ",26
111,Mr HUTCHINSON,REPAYMENT OF,"The honourable member may say "" Hear, hear "", but, he should remember that the Govern men I cannot have it both ways. If it intends to rely upon the voluntary system of raising money, it will need the support of both its Ministers and back-benchers. It must maintain the confidence of the people. We require in this House today a definite and clear statement of the Government's policy in this regard. Recent outbursts by the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Ward) have been mentioned in this debate. I agree with the honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) that if that Minister holds the views that have been attributed to him. the only honourable course open to him is to resign from the Government. If he cannot support the Government on a vital matter of policy like that, he should resign. That is the only honourable thing for him to do. It may interest honourable members io know that speakers who were addressing a meeting outside the Melbourne Town Hall yesterday afternoon in support of the Liberty Loan were subject to continual interjections by individuals in their audience. Such questions as "" What about Ward and the payment of interest?"" were hurled at the speakers. ",28
112,Mr HUTCHINSON,REPAYMENT OF,That statement is absolutely true. It was most embarrassing for persons appealing to investors to invest in the Liberty Loan to receive interjections of that kind to which 'hey could not very well reply.  man is drawing upon his imagination.,29
113,Mr HUTCHINSON,REPAYMENT OF,"I am doing nothing of the kind. This is not a matter that we can take lightly. It is, in fact, a most serious business.  take the honourable member seriously.",29
114,Mr SPEAKER,REPAYMENT OF,Hon. W. M. Nairn). - The honourable member for Ballarat is interjecting too frequently.,29
115,Mr HUTCHINSON,REPAYMENT OF,"I again request that a clear statement of government policy be made this afternoon respecting the payment of interest on government loans. Unless such a statement be made, we can hardly expect future loans to be successful.",29
116,Mr WARD,REPAYMENT OF,"East Sydney-Minister for Labour and National Service) [4.55], - It is quite evident from the part taken in this debate by honourable members opposite that, in spite of the dire peril in which this countiy stands at the moment, they have not been able to place patriotism before profits. In order to clear away any misapprehension concerning what I actually said at a meeting that I addressed recently in Sydney-and I do not apologize for or withdraw anything that I said- I make it clear thai I have never said that it has ever been the intention of this 'Government to refuse to pay interest on war loans to which the public has already subscribed. That statement also applies to the present Liberty Loan. I said at the meeting to which reference has been made, and I repeat now, that I am of the opinion that this war should not be financed by the present process. The war should be financed by means of taxation, thereby taking the cost of it out of current production. Mr Archie: CAMERON - The honourable gentleman should not remain in the Government if those are his views.",29
117,Mr FADDEN,REPAYMENT OF,"Would the Minister apply that statement to the £35,000,000 now being floated?",29
118,Mr WARD,REPAYMENT OF,"My view is that, in an all-in war effort, every member of the community must give whatever he can to assist the nation without any desire to secure personal gain. To ensure this country's defence and its triumph over the powers that threaten it, the munitions workers, the miners and the people engaged in all our war industries give their services. The soldier, the sailor and the airman each offers his life. Is it too much to expect the moneyed man to give his money without expecting interest returns? Such action by those in a position to lend their money in the defence of their country and of themselves would definitely not damage the credit of this nation, but would be to it? everlasting credit. I say to certain honourable members who have accepted the reports of some daily newspapers as their authorities, that there have been occasions in the past when they have not been so ready to do so. I have in mind times when newspaper criticism has been levelled against themselves. I knew full well that from the moment I touched vested interest? I should become she target of the lackeys of capitalism, of capitalism's representative newspapers and of capitalism's representatives in this Parliament. Let me examine certain statements by i be Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Fadden). He said that at least I had been consistent in my advocacy of financial policy. He also added that the leopard cannot change its spots. I ft'itt sorry t%a.t I cannot say that the Leader of the Opposition has been consistent in lus advocacy of certain views which he held and' expressed about the r.iirne when he first entered this Parliament.",29
119,Mr FAODKN,REPAYMENT OF,Giv e us something new. 1,30
120,Mr WARD,REPAYMENT OF,"I intend to eite certain statements: made by the Leader of the Opposition and. subsequently quoted in Hansard. The honourable gentleman --earebed back to 19>31 in dealing with my political attitude. In replying to the honourable gentleman, I shall not go baok *o far.. He was elected to this Parliament somewhat later than I was ini 1931.. In a speech that he delivered when he was cocking election to this Parliament he referred, to the majority party supporting the government of the day-that is, the United Australia party-in the following terms:'the United Australia party gaveIts allegiance to the big financial and manufacturing interests of the cities and to the middlemen and monopolists because it received its. support and power, from those people.. How then could the United Australia party serve the countryside as welT as those in the city who slicked the lifehlood from the 1 1 countryside? Yet the honourable gentleman is today not only sitting side by side with these bloodsuckers, but has actually become their leader! So much for his consistency! Let us now look for a moment or two at his statements this afternoon. He said that the Government was relying entirely upon vcluntary loans and he asked how the Government could expect to get loan money when it limited profits? Taking the honourable gentleman's statement to its logical conclusion, he asked, in effect, "" How can you expect to raise loans unless you allow the profiteer in this country to go ahead?"" That is the policy of the United Australia party.  loans!",30
121,Mr WARD,REPAYMENT OF,"The honourable gentleman would have us. believe that the Government should not restrict profits but should let. the profiteer make money, with the idea of afterwards borrowing it from him at what it regarded, .as a. suitable rate of interest. The honourable gentleman's government propounded a policy of compulsory loans. Doubts were created in the minds of the workers in regard to such a policy because they knew very well, of the number of promises made during the last war which were repudiated by anti-Labour governments. They were afraid that the same kind of thing would happen in respect of the proposed compulsory loan policy. They held the opinion that the compulsory loans would never be repaid. I did not introduce personalities into this-debate. I listened quietly while other honourable gentlemen were speaking and particularly while they were saying that certain things should, be cleared up. 1 also desive certain things to be cleared up in this Parliament. I have been waiting for the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Hutchinson ) r for example, to honour the promise he made some years ago when he said that he would be on the firsts transport that left Australia.",30
122,Mr MCEWEN,REPAYMENT OF,The honourable gentleman volunteered.,30
123,Mr WARD,REPAYMENT OF,"Quite so, and he was rejected on the ground of faulty eyesight. Yet I noticed this afternoon that he read his notes without the use of spectacles. The honourable member for Barker (Mr Archie Cameron) suggested that there should be no place in this Government for me. I say that there should be no place in this Parliament for the honourable member, because of what he had to say against our most powerful ally, Russia, after the outbreak of hostilities between Germany and Russia. Speaking in this House on the 21st August, 1941, the honourable gentleman saidTaking a clearly objective view of the Russian situation-, I say that it is a good thing for us that these two great international thieves have fallen out, hut it is only a goodthing to the extent to which we use the opportunity created by the Russo-German war to put the British Empire in a better state to meet inevitable attack. Prom our point of view it does not matter who wins the liussoGerinun war, because the British Empire is committed to fight the winner. The honourable gentleman who made those statements now sits on the backmost bench of the Opposition in this Parliament. I have never said on any occasion that the Government should not pay interest on the loans which have been raised, or that it should not pay interest on the loan which is now being floated. What I have said, and what I say now, is that it is entirely wrong to apply a policy which will inevitably bring ruin, misery and degradation upon large numbers of people.",30
124,Mr FADDEN,REPAYMENT OF,What abot.it the loans which may be covered by this bill?,31
125,Mr WARD,REPAYMENT OF,"I intend now to refer to a leading article in the Sydney Daily Tulegrapli, of the 12th December, 1941, a journal which has been most hostile to me and which has repeatedly distorted my statements. It is one of the newspapers which supports the Leader of the Opposition. The leading article related lo an appeal for funds to replace HMAS. Sydney-a n appeal which was quite popular about that time. The article reads as follows:WANTED-£2,000,00 0 INA WEEK . The Lord Mayor of Sydney Crick) wants £2,000,000 to build a new HMAS. Sydney. He wants it-now . He wants it from you. He must get it. It is a debt every man and woman in this country owes to the 045 officers and men who perished when the Sydney went down. It is your job to provide the money. Hundreds of young Australians are waiting to mi!n the new jhip. Don't keep them waiting. Ami. when you've jriven what you can to the IH-W Sydney fund, dig down and give some more to Commodore Muirhead-Gould's appeal for the Royal Australian Naval Belief Kinnl, which will provide for the mothers, wives, and children of the 78fi officers and men «v li.i*t in the Sydney and Vamrma.Ua. Australia could fill both appeals in n week if it jrnvp its cash as generously as it gi\es its sympathy. This country isn't short of ready money. Trade is booming. The big stores are thriving; breweries shyly admit that their turnover has increased: the theatres screen Hollywood's ri.iii:i.nces to ful l houses; wages are up. The estimated national income for the curri'iit year is £75.(100.00(1 higher than Mr Ward. WHAT ABOUT THESE PROFITS? Let £. s. d. tell its own story. Here is a table showing the 1941 reserve? and profits of fourteen leading Australian companies1011 1041 Reserves. Profit. £ £ Australian Consolidated Industries 8,277,770 500,306 Australian Paper Manufacturers . . 430,280 242,378 Bunk of New South Wales 6,370,346 547,123 Adelaide Steamship Company 608,641 180,066 Broken Hill Proprietary (including subsidiaries) 7,545,287 1,550,214 Colonial Sugar Refining Company 8,947,156 1,697,101 Dunlop Rubber 869,500 459,907 Electrolytic Zinc Drug Houses of Australia 021,883 439,442 362,784 194,846 Tooth and Company 1,540,481 809,036 Ooldsbrough Mort 1,707,323 190,658 Bankers and Traders' Insurance . . 203,406 27,085 Nestle and Anglo-Swiss Milk 830,760 215,710 Yarra Talis Limited 427,939 154,853 Totals .. 34,120,241 7,150,157 Out of that total 1941 profit of £7,150,157. the fourteen companies paid £5,237,254 in dividends. We could just about buy a new cruiser of the Sydney class with the undistributed profit, which, for these fourteen companies in 1941. amounted to £1,912,903. Eight of the companies on the list made bigger profits this year than in 1940. They should be at the top of the Lord Mayor's list. Why talk about raising the money in a month when these prosperous companies-jus t a few of those which are making great profits (AldcTman in our war-time boom-hav e enough money locked up in reserves to pay for seventeen Sydneys at once? If this country is in dire peril, why should there be any lack of capacity in the nation to defend itself, simply because there are in it persons who will lend money to the Government only at a certain rate of interest? There are many ;,mall subscribers to Commonwealth loans, whose efforts on behalf of the. Government and the country are very greatly appreciated. I speak, not of the small contributor, but of those companies which, according to the Sydney Daily Telegraph, have built up huge reserves. A perusal of the list of contributions to the war loan, published daily in the press, will disclose that the largest amounts are contributed by those companies. Without any direct, or material passionate sacrifice, they could make available their reserves, entirely interest-free. That is last year. the position that we have to face. by what means may an all-in war effort be best achieved? The enthusiastic - upport of the people can be obtained unly if they are satisfied that there is no profiteering, and that whatever sacrifice is required is made proportionately by every unit in the community. The Sydney Daily Telegraph, giving reasons for some of the success gained by our Russian allies, said that Hitler's plan to annihilate the Russians had only one defect- a fatal defect; it underestimated die spirit of the Russian people and the genius of the Soviet TJnion'3 military leaders. The article went on to sayThe Soviet Union under Stalin wasn't caught asleep like Britain under Mr Chamberlain. Russia's intensive preparations for war began ns soon as Hitler came to power. The entire nation, because of its social and economic organization, was mobilized for war voked to that digression. - war with tanks and planes, not bayonets 1 |>t iiiiisiii. Enormous industrial duplicated and de-centralized, created for vice, not profit, were built all over the That is all that I am asking-tha every body shall take part in this all-in war effort, and that nobody shall profit the result of the country's participation in its own defence. Australia is a theatre of war; already its shores have heen attacked at three points. Its outinvestments. lying territories also have attacked. Australian pared to defend this country. We give to them a certain income, which in most nases represents an actual sacrifice of living standards to which they have been accustomed. They are willin g to make that sacrifice; but they would so much more enthusiastically if they knew that the flag-flappers and cheerers behind the lines were making sacrifices similar to those that are asked of the men in the front line of battle. If all-in war effort be needed, let, all be the one footing. Whatever basis fixed, the m»n who has to do the fighting, members of .Parliament, members of the judiciary, captains of industry, all should material be on the one footing.",31
126,Mr HARRISON,REPAYMENT OF,"The honourable gentlebasis, man would then find another excuse.",32
127,Mr WARD,REPAYMENT OF,"Is the honourable memcurrency, ber for Wentworth (Mr Harrison) preotherwise pared to accept such a policy?",32
128,Mr HABIMSON,REPAYMENT OF,I would accept anybe thing in order to get the honourable gentledard man into the front line; but that will never happen.,32
129,Mr WARD,REPAYMENT OF,"The honourable gentleman is merely quibbling, in reply to my direct question. To those honourable gentlemen who talk about what service 1 might have rendered, I would say that there is one army to which I would never belong-on e that did no real fighting, but tried to undermine the democratic government, of this country that we are now endeavouring to defend. I have never been a member of the New Guard, and I am proud of it . The honourable member for Wentworth, however, was a member of that organization.",32
130,Mr SPEAKER,REPAYMENT OF,Order ! The debate is becoming altogether too personal.,32
131,Mr WARD,REPAYMENT OF,"I regret that I was proI would and say to members of the Opposition that plants, wrno good is gained by the introduction of country. personalities. Let each member of the t Opposition answer for himself. The right honourable member for Kooyong as (Mr Menzies) smiles. I should grieve with him at the ""great sacrifice"" that he would have to make had he to give up the returns that be obtains from his been Mr SPEAKER - Order ! These pertroops are presonalities must cease.",32
132,Mr WARD,REPAYMENT OF,"The workers are now being conscripted into the Army, and the there is talk of conscripting them into labour squads in order that they may be sent wherever their services may be redo quired. The basis of their engagement would be identical with that of men in the fighting line. I ask members of the Opposition to state plainly whether they would support an all-in war effort, in an which all rlie people of this country on would be on the one footing. I believe be that it wa.= the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Spooner) who made the very good suggestion that, in respect ol requirements, the populace should immediately be placed on a. ration so that no one person would get more than another. In order to do that, it, would be necessary to freeze existing and work on a coupon basis, those who had bank accounts or capital upon which they could draw would able to live at a much higher stanthan those who had merely wages. Let all be placed on a coupon basis. Let the Government decide what is available of this or that commodity, and let every body share alike for as long as this - country is in dire peril and we are defending it to the utmost of our ability. If labour power and every other resource of the country is to go into the pool, why should there be such strong resistance and protest whenever it is suggested that profits should go in? That is all that the Government is asking. I challenge members of the Opposition to show whether they are genuine and sincere. Do they agree that members of Parliament, the judiciary,, and captains of industry, should be on the same footing as every body else ? Mr FADDEN.:-Why not bring it in as a Government measure?",32
133,Mr WARD,REPAYMENT OF,"This is a proposition about which the Opposition is not very enthusiastic. It is prepared to make all sorts of appeals to the workers, and to say, "" Let us all be in "". Notwithstanding what may have been said in regard to my courage, wherever the fight might be in Australia-and the thicker it was the better-I . should be prepared, in an all-in war effort, to take whatever post was allotted to me, so> long as some of those whose age is no greater than mine, yet who question my courage, were in front of, not behind, me, and could, run away when the first short was fired. I conclude by inviting members of the Opposition to give an indication of their sincerity. Let them advise their leader that it would not be wise in future to accept the Sydney Daily Telegraph as an authentic newspaper, and that, if he first checked the accuracy of press statements, he would find that I had never said that the Government ever intended to repudiate the payment of interest on either past loans or those that are now being raised.",33
134,Mr MENZIES,REPAYMENT OF,"Kooyong) [5.17] - If I might offer a personal view of what has been happening in the last twenty minutes, I should describe it as a deplorable contribution to parliamentary debate. The. Leader of the Opposition (Mr Fadden) properly brought up the subject of a statement made by a Minister of the Crown who is now serving in the Government- a statement which, if accurately reported, was calculated to have a most damaging effect upon the finances of this country in time of war. The Minister for Labour and National Service, as he was entitled to do, explained the statement he had made. I can see no reason, whatever for the subsequent stream of abuse from hdm, directed at various members of thichamber. All that I want to say aboin the original statement, as it wasreported in the newspapers, is this: Wh:t ! the Minister was reported to have said had the widest possible circulation in Australia. It had that circulation at a time when a war loan of first importan - c was heing floated. Until this afternoon, it had not been the subject of any correction whatever hy the Minister. For I do not know how many days,, thai damaging statement has had currency. Mr ROSEVEAH.:-It did not do as. much damage as was done by the shipping of scrap iron from Australia to Japan.",33
135,Mr MENZIES,REPAYMENT OF,"I shall discuss that matter with the honourable member on an appropriate occasion,, and. perhaps illuminate him on it.. I am not going to be drawn off by even "" red "" scrap iron, but shall direct myself to this problem. I say that the Minister is open to the very greatest censure, not only by thi c not House but also by the Leader of the Government, for having permitted to go into circulation a statement of the mosi damaging kind. I should be the last to suggest that on every occasion on which a. Minister, or any body else, liad been misreported, he should correct the mis1 report. Far be it from me to suggest that;, because he would probably have time to do little else. But this was a case of a special kind. This was a matter of major importance, and this last moment explanation by the Minister will, I am afraid, go only a small distance towards repairing the damage that has been done. But I did not rise to say more than that on that point. I rose to draw the attention of senior and responsible members of this Government to the f a d that we witnessed this afternoon one of the most extraordinary events within my recollection of politics. We have had a Minister speaking from the table as a Minister and in no other capacity-for no Minister can speak from the table of this I Ton sc as a private citizen-and propounding two policies. The first of them is that, puttiug on one side past contracts, and also, it wcnld appear, the contract that is now being made in respect of this current loan, no interest shall be paid on future loan raisings for this war. That is a statement of policy made during a debate on the very bill which is to authorize the raising of money for war purposes. Did the Minister speak for the Government? 1 think I am justified in pausing for a reply.",33
136,Mr CHIFLEY,REPAYMENT OF,We shall answer all that if the right honourable member keeps on.,34
137,Mr MENZIES,REPAYMENT OF,"Are we to take it that the Government is, through this spokesman-for he is a government spokesman-declarin g that, from now on, no interest shall be paid, and that this is a part of the Government's policy?",34
138,Mr CHIFLEY,REPAYMENT OF,That is a distortion of what was said.,34
139,Mr MENZIES,REPAYMENT OF,"There is no distortion about it. We can discuss this matter in a completely dispassionate manner. The second point is that we heard a Minister, speaking as a Minister from the table, deliver what can only be described as a new communist manifesto, namely, that in order to get an all-in war effort every body in this country called upon to do work of any kind shall receive exactly the same remuneration, aud shall receive it, not in. cash, but in coupons.",34
140,Mr MORGAN,REPAYMENT OF,That is the policy ot' the honourable member for Robertson (Mr. Spooner).,34
141,Mr MENZIES,REPAYMENT OF,"I do not know whether my taciturn friend, the honourable member for Reid agrees with it.  the originator of that idea.",34
142,Mr MENZIES,REPAYMENT OF,"I hesitate to believe that the honourable member for Ballarat  what I want to know is, does the Prime Minister believe in it? Does the Treasurer believe in it? Does it represent the policy of the Government?! This is a new political tactic-to put up a Minister notoriously devoted to extravagant speech, and get him to "" try it on the dog "", so to speak. He gets up and jeers at the Opposition, and says, "" Ah, you would not have this, and you would not havt that!""-whil e behind him, hoping fo: the best, but fearing the worse, sit other Ministers quite silently, still, so far a I know, drawing their salaries. I dinot know whether the Minister for Labour and National . Service hat begun to practice this new doctrine in his own case, but I would very much like to know whether what has been advocated by the Minister for Labour and National Service is, in fact, the policy of the Government. Members on. this side of the House, at least, will expect to have an answer to those questions before they are asked to pass the bill. The Prime Minister ought to answer them. How i the man in the street to adjust his conduct and his mind to the problems of this war if he is presented with one policy by tinPrime Minister and another by the.Minister for Labour and National Service?",34
143,Mr CONELAN,REPAYMENT OF,The right honourable member for Kooyong had several policies when he was Prime Minister.,34
144,Mr MENZIES,REPAYMENT OF,"That is not so. The honourable member's capacity for listening is not very great, and he is a little bit out of touch. Here we have a specific instance of two war-time policies of first class importance put before the House by a responsible Minister. Are we asked to approve them ? Are we to have bills presented to the House to give effect to them ? And what is the man in the street to think about it all? If he happens to read what the Prime Minister has said, he will say to himself, ""That is what I am to do: that is the measure of my duty"". Ithe has read in another newspaper what another member of the Government has said he will say, "" That is the measure of my duty"". I have had some parliamentary experience, but I have never before known of a bill being brought down by a responsible and respected Minister to authorize the raising of a loan, and then, after he had spoken, the only subsequent speech made on behalf of thp Government being one to propound two revolutionary principles, the very paternity of which we do not know, and as to the authenticity of which the Government has so far left us in complete ignorance. I i is the duty of the Treasurer (Mr. Chifley), if not of the Prime Minister, to say whether he accepts the policy outlined by the Minister for Labour and National Service. If he does not, then I should like to know how long this new constitutional principle has been in force which permits a Minister, whose policies are the opposite of the Government, to remain in the Cabinet and enjoy the benefits of ministerial rank.",34
145,Mr DEDMAN,REPAYMENT OF,"Corio-Minister for War Organization of Industry) [5.27] The Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Fadden) mentioned proposals for the rationalization of private trading banks., and either stated directly, or implied, that what was being done would damage the prospects of the raising of this loan.",35
146,Mr EADUEN,REPAYMENT OF,I never said any such thing.,35
147,Mr DEDMAN,REPAYMENT OF,I am sorry if I misunderstood the honourable member.,35
148,Mr FADDEN,REPAYMENT OF,I said what was being done constituted the first step towards the nationalization of banking. I never said anything about its effect upon the raising of the loan.,35
149,Mr DEDMAN,REPAYMENT OF,"I accept the honourable member's statement, but I point out that the rationalization of banking is ancillary to the effects which will be produced by the raising of this loan. The purpose of the loan is to take away spending power from the community so that the community, by its spending, will nor, be able to draw away, for the satisfaction of its wants, man-power which should be used for the prosecution of this war.",35
150,Mr MARWICK,REPAYMENT OF,Surely it is not suggested that that is the only reason for the loan!,35
151,Mr DEDMAN,REPAYMENT OF,It is the only reason.,35
152,Mr MARWICK,REPAYMENT OF,Then why not make it compulsory?,35
153,Mr DEDMAN,REPAYMENT OF,"J do not. propose to answer that question now. Compulsory diversion of spending-power can be done equally well by taxation. I am now discussing the actual effect of the rationalization of banking, or of any other industry, and I say that that effect on man-powerin relation to the war effort is exactly the same as that of the raising of loans.",35
154,Mr MENZIES,REPAYMENT OF,Why did not the Government extend its scheme to the Commonwealth Bank?,35
155,Mr DEDMAN,REPAYMENT OF,"If the honourable member had followed our proceedings, he would have realized that the scheme was being applied to all industries.",35
156,Mr FADDEN,REPAYMENT OF,But not to the Commonwealth Bank?,35
157,Mr DEDMAN,REPAYMENT OF,"No , because the Commonwealth Bank is in an entirely different position from that of the other banks.",35
158,Mr FADDEN,REPAYMENT OF,The Government is placing it in an entirely different position.,35
159,Mr DEDMAN,REPAYMENT OF,"Rationalizatio n is being applied to every industry, and the proposals in regard to banking are less drastic than those in regard to many other industries. The private trading banks have themselves agreed to the policy of rationalization in order to make man-power available, so I do not know what all the uproar is about.",35
160,Mr FADDEN,REPAYMENT OF,The private hanks did not. agree to the Government's proposals?,35
161,Mr DEDMAN,REPAYMENT OF,"The private banks, at a conference on Monday last, agreed to the general principles which I put before them.",35
162,Mr FADDEN,REPAYMENT OF,But not to the details.,35
163,Mr DEDMAN,REPAYMENT OF,"No detailed proposals have been placed before them. The private trading banks, like every other industry, are putting before me proposals for the release of man-power, and I shall examine the proposals put forward by the banks just as I shall examine those put forward by other industries. If I think they are drastic enough, I shall accept them. If , in my opinion, they do not go far enough, I shall ask the authors of them to think out something more effective. I shall do that with every one of our industries, so that the private trading banks have uot been singled out for special treatment. I believe that, in applying this policy for the rationalization of industry, including banking. I shall be doing something to assist in the most effective utilization of man-power, and that is exactly the effect for which we look from the raising of this loan.",35
164,Mr FRANCIS,REPAYMENT OF,"Moreton) [5.32] - In this bill, it is proposed to rais* £75.000,000 by way of loan for the prosecution of the war at n time of the utmost importance in the history of tralia and the British Empire. Never before have we been faced with such dangers as now confront us, and a Government, stranger walking into the House today and listening to the speech of the Ministhis ter for Labour and National Service (Mr Ward) might be pardoned for members. believing that, if we continue to debate an all-in war effort in the way that he and to propound such principles, we not deserve to win the war. I , in common with many thousands of other men, took part in the last war. We were short of men and materials on many occasions, populace and we wondered what, on earth Parliafanaticism. ment: was doing. It does not seem that Parliament, has improved much in the last 25 years if we. are to have a repetithe tion of what has occurred today on the other side of the chamber. Nothing but the best will enable us to pull through. Every body must help in the prosecution of a common plan, from the raising of the money to giving to every man in the fron t line the maximum of equipment and support. We need men, money and munitions. We need money with which to provide the men one with equipment, and munitions of war; yf.t, on the basic principle of the manner in which that money is to be raised, the party supporting the Government has beMinistry. come hopelessly divided. One Minister holds opinions directly opposite to those ment. held by the Government, and the honourable member for Melbourne (M Calwell) and the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Langtry) , by their speed les, have clearly indicated their opposition to the Government. Many would other Government members, by shouting ""Hear, hear"" have indicated their supyong port of the Minister as against the Government. Without sound backing, the Government, cannot make a supreme war effort. Parliament. a it is at present constituted, cannot effectively conduct the war unless it changes its attitude and 4iows a greater spirit of co-operation. The Government, should reconsider position because it has no majority, many of its own followers being opposed to paying any interest on Joans, and without a majority, it cannot inspire fidence in the people. My experience when visiting country districts has been Austhat people have no confidence in the Government, and draw no inspiration from it. Accordingly, I appeal to th«before it is too late, to reflect upon the incidents that have occurred afternoon and put its house in order. I leave this thought with honourable We shall not win the war unless we put forward our maximum effort. We did cannot obtain that maximum effort unlets do we have a, common plan, in which every /»ne believes. That plan is required to raise the necessary funds, to produce war materials, and to engender among the an enthusiasm akin to That spirit is not to be found in the Parliament or in the country under the present Government's leadership and spectacle that we have witnessed this afternoon will do irreparable harm.",35
165,Mr BLACKBURN,REPAYMENT OF,"Bourke) [5.37] It would be absurd to endeavour to conceal from the country the fact, that the Opposition assembled here today for the deliberate purpose of making an attack ii i inn the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Ward) . Every knew that the Opposition at, the dictation of influences outside the House, would use the first occasion that presented ir?elf to attempt to drive him out of the",36
166,Mr MORGAN,REPAYMENT OF,O r split the Govern,36
167,Mr BLACKBURN,REPAYMENT OF,"I do not agree r . that the object was to split the Govern iuent, because those interests considered that, a government deprived of the Minister for Labour and National Service, not be so offensive to them. It is idle for the right honourable member for Koo(Mr Menzies) to deprecate what happened in the House this afternoon, when he knows that he and other members of the Opposition are the cause of it. They took this, their first opportunity, to make e an attack upon the Minister, in the belief that he would be repudiated by his fellow Ministers and by private members of tinits Labour party. Whilst 1 do not agrne so with every statement that the Minister has made, I do agree with his declaration that we should not borrow money for the conpurpose of financing the war, and pay interest on it . That is all the Minister said, and the majority of Australians will agree with .him.. There was nothing in his statement that condemned the payment of interest npon obligations that have already been contracted. Mi:. HAIRBISOK - So that this loan wihl bea;r no interest;! Is that the idea ? The honourable member for Bourke (Mir. Blackburn) is holding a brief for the Minister. "" Mr JSLACKBUEN - I am not; I am merely ;expressing my own opinions. But .is I have been charged with holding a brief for the Minister, I may say that if the country were 'deprived of his services, it would be much - poorer for the loss. He is ione iof - our leaders in whom - the masses of the people have great conifideaice. The Government would stand much lower in popular esteem if he were - not a member of the 'Cabinet. The fact that ho is a Minister is a .guarantee to the people that their cause will be fought for and that their .interests will be guarded. A good deal has been made by honourable members - opposite about alleged divisions in the Cabinet. ""We had the spectacle of Satan rebuking Sin when the [honourable member for Barker (Mr. Archie Cameron) made that charge. When he was a member 'of the Menzies 'Goverriaaient, his policy - always differed from that of his colleagues. Finally, he forced .a general election upon the country. Other members of the Cabinet favoured an approach to .the British Government for an 'extension of the life of the Commonwealth Parliament, but rite honourable member., .at Bairnsdale, denounced that proposal. So it is not for him or for others to talk about divisions in Cabinet. Attention has also been directed to what has been described as a ""-difference of opinion"" among Ministers. Since the outbreak of war differences of opinion .among Ministers of all parties have not been unknown. The people are tremendously disappointed that the Government proposes to continue the .policy of borrowing money. Some of the appeals which have been made to people to contribute to the war loan wea'e exactly the same as those which were resorted to during the last war. The practice is to tell people: "" It is not necessary for you to have any money in order to support the war loan. You can borrow it from a bank "". As I lua.v.e .often .pointed oat, that .procedure - etrases inflation. What is more, - we have io ipay interest on the inflationary .loan. If we must-and it appears that we must -'har e irrflation, I prefer not to pay iiriifceiffisr upoiu ithe inflation; I support an - ex-paiisionast tpol'icy which - calls - for no iiiiitter-est. Ia my .opinion, we jiave reached - fill* stage when we can. mitigate the in-flarion-an-y character of our finance by con-ti'olil'iaig wages, profits and expenditure and by rationing goods so that no person ahu ll 'get too much. o.r too - little. The policy - of (the Government has disappointed and depressed the people. Although the - enemy is - attacking our - territories, we are told that ithe only way in which We can obtain amouey for the conduct of .the war is by - inndertaking to pay interest. Repeatedly I have ieard appeals of thi^-ii a Miii:e. ""The prudent and wise safe- - m am will invest in war loans because after the war he 'will be the only person who will have any means. There will .be a depression; wages will be reduced; and profits will be very limited. Consequently, the only person in the community who will have anything is the man who draws interest from his investments dn war - loans."" I .do not agree - with .everything that the Minister for Labour rand National Service has said., but I agree, with the great majority of - the people, that he is a consistent and - courageous .champion of the masses. He .can be relied .upon to be their consistent and courageous champion, and - it is be-caftise he fills that role that influences - outside the House .are trying to get rid - Of him.",36
168,Mr ANTHONY,REPAYMENT OF,"Richmond) [5.44] If the enemy wanted to take ad-vantage of us, one of the methods that he would adopt would be the creation of discord and suspicion in our ranks. One of the modern theories of war is that you can weaken your enemy by propaganda, aud the creation of class suspicion and hatred, and achieve as much by internal disruption as by the power of armed - divisions. In this instance, somebody has .done a grave disservice to Australia by creating in the minds of the people a. feeling of disquiet and distrust of the financial stability of this country during the war. I am not concerned with the theories of the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Ward). I do u-o-fr know what he actually said. Perhaps, he was misreported. If that were - sO,' he should have, issued a correction the earliest possible moment before the damage was' done. However, he allowed the public to believe that he had used those words. I am not one who regards the raising of money by loans as the best method of financing the war;. Upon this subject, I have very much in common with the Minister, for Labour and National Service, and other members of the Government. In my opinion, a large percentage of war finance-I doubt whether the whole could be found by this method-shoul d come from current savings' from current production. The best methodby which to obtain thatisby taxation. However,, that is not the policy o# the Government. When the Govern1 ment of which I was a member attempted to put that policy into practice, the Labour party criticized it, and succeeded in defeating it. If the Minister for Labour and National Service challenges our sincerity, we are at perfect liberty to challenge his sincerity. The only it to which an individual' can put profits' is to purchase' privileges with them. Money is of no use to an individual unless he can buy something with it, either in the form of goods or privileges. I should lik» to knowwhether the Minister for Labour and National Service' has, to date, set an example to the country by surrendering some of his ministerial privileges. Although the Government is appealing to people to make greater sacrifices than ever before, Ministers take to themselves greater and greater privileges. The Minister for Labour and National Service is probably the greatest exponent of that policy. He has a bigger staff of supernumeraries and of assistants than any other Minister. What is the value of their services? What remuneration do his colleagues, pals and friends get? Are they receiving £2 2s. or £2 10s. a day, free, or are they giving their service. 5 voluntarily, being satisfied with their parliamentary allowance of £1,000 per annum ?",37
169,Mr MORGAN,REPAYMENT OF,"I am receiving, no extra remuneration. Mr ANTHONY.;- I am glad to have the honourable member's disclaimer. I i appears to. me that the Minister for Labour and National Service has surat rounded himself with staff. Does he still reserve for himself a compartment when the demands on railway rolling-stock aiv so great?",38
170,Mr WARD,REPAYMENT OF,No .,38
171,Mr ANTHONY,REPAYMENT OF,"In time of wax, when every body is called upon to make sacrifices the example should come from the top, and when Ministers examine the question of man-power they should examine their own personal staffs, especially when they ask othersto do the same-. I have seen around the House in the entourage of Ministers men, who-, from appearances at any rate, might well be doing some more active job than penpushing or paper-carrying, jobs, which could be done by girls or people not of military capacity. I have a lot in common with honourable gentlemen opposite who. have expressed views about the raising, of money. 1 agree that money could be raised by a stroke of the pen at the bank.. The best --- way to make that, possible is by reducing ordinary civil consumption. The things that would, normally be bought, would not, be bought, and the money that would normally be expended on their purchase would be available in the form of savings for diversion to the war effort. We could, as the honourable member for Maranoa (ME. Baker) has so often proclaimed, finance the war through the Commonwealth bank, but that would do 1 nothing to reduce civil consumption or divert money to the production of war needs. War production can be increased by no other means than community saving enforced by the, restriction of production and sale of civil goods. That is the reason for the loan programme and heavy taxation as against the creation of credit. It would be easy to finance the war through the Commonwealth Bank, but taxthat would not make available one extra bullet or blanket or whatever be needed for war purposes. I regret that the debate has taken its present course. I did not rise in order to have the Minister for Labour and National Service disciplined, as was suggested by the honourable member for Iiuiirke (Mr Blackburn); but that Minister holds a. high and responsible post. He has great importance power, and, if he exercises that power with the vindictiveness which the munity is beginning to believe he is there will be no confidence among large - lections of the community. Confidence may be felt by the sections which port him, but the Government needs have behind it the whole of the comtrue munity, not just a part of it . If we lose the war, and this country, as we easily might, it will be because unity amongst ourselves and to organize and realise on our total resources. This country can be defended, hut only by strong concerted and united action by us all. No Minister has the right to strike a discordant note i policy of his government and thereby create distrust. He who does so, does r.he country a disservice of no small magnitude. I hope that the Minister Labour and National Service in the discharge of his high functions will ro bring an impartial judgment to problems on which he is required to adjudicate. Otherwise vast sections of the people will have no faith or confidGovernment. ence in , or hope for the future of this Government.",38
172,Mr MORGAN,REPAYMENT OF,"Reid) [ 4 . 5 2 ] not desire to impede the Government in its desire to have this legislation passed, bur, I have to make clear where I stand. 1 deplore the fact that the Government feels that it is bound to adopt the method of raising money set out in this proposed legislation. I am in full accord with the sentiments of the honourable member for Riverina (Mr Langtry), and I cannot put the matter in better words rban he used. It is time we realized we are losing this war. Why, we have ',i>t every round! The only points have trained h a v been those won by our Russian ally. It is because we have adopted the wrong organization and the wrong method of finance that, in spite of rhe fact that our resources of men four times as great, as those of the powers'-w e have 1.200,000,000 people a? against their 300.000,000 in manpre=ent power-and the hulk nf the raw perform materials, we cannot take a single or yardstick. point. If we had a proper monetary system, we could bring our preponderance of man-power and raw materials together. and The Leader of the Opposition (Mr . Fadden) let the cat out of the bag when comhe described money as being an indisusing, pensable commodity. He showed that money has become a commodity lent out at a profit instead of being a means of supbringing men and materials together. to The only way to make money serve its purpose is by using it to bring men and materials together. Until we do so we shall continue losing in this war. We of dismust make money the servant instead our failure of the master of man. I deprecate the attacks made on the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Ward) , who is to be commended on the stand he has taken, even n the though be is a member of the Government. It is obvious to anybody who has to been here today and has read the inspired press references to the Minister for for Labour and National Service that the attacks upon him are guided by an try unseen hand. It has gone out into the the country that "" Ward has to be put on the skids "". Every effort will be made to drive the honourable member out of the If possible this opportunity will be used to split the Ministry, especially by those who desire to raise the old I do issue of a national government. The days of the old hustings catch-cries of "" sound finance "", "" inflation "", "" confidence "" and 60 on used in order to create fear, have gone. They were used in order to retain power by the people who represent moneyed interests. It is now time, as the Minister for Labour and National Service has intimated, that profit wa> taken out of war. f t is unfortunate thai the honourable mem hers opposite who have that villified the Minister for Labour and National Service do not follow the ex we nmnle set hv the honourable member for Robertson f Mr Spooner). who was constructive, not destructive, when he suggested that the resources of the country ""-hotiJH be pooled, that commodities should are he rationed and njohilized. and that Axis recourse should be had to the coupon - ystein. That would do away with the financial system and make money its trn-e function as a measure Then we would be in a position in which our nisonrces could be directed to the objective which we all have. We would have food, clothing and shelter, which is all we need. Of what use would it be to make profits and accumulate money if this country were to be taken by the enemy, who is almost on our shores? If that policy of pooling our resources were applied, our effort would be "" all-in "" and we could apply ourselves to the prosecution of the war to a successful end. We have not only the enemy outside to consider; we have the enemy withinmoney power. That is the real enemy confronting us. That is as true today as it was when Lincoln saidThere are two enemies I have to fight-the one in front of me-the Confederate Army, which I can seek out and deal with effectively, and the one behind-the unseen money power - whic h is more subtle in its methods and is the more insidious of the two. We have that enemy within today; it is as insidious as it was in Lincoln's day, and it has to be dealt with as effectively as the enemy without. The outof-date money system is clogging the war effort. The influences behind that system are responsible for the attack upon the Minister for Labour and National Service. Those same influences are at the back of an effort to institute an even more orthodox method of finance than that which operates today. I cpjote this passage from the Sydney pressA common currency for all the nations <ii the anti-Axis front is envisaged as a development of the near future. Based on a gold standard, the common currency would do tniu-li to facilitate the How of goods from one antiAxis country to another. The plan would create :i pool of allied gold holdings and abolish trade barriers, while pegging Latin American currencies to a new unit. Those are the influences at work within the democracies today. If honourable members opposite continue on behalf of the moneyed interests propaganda of the type indulged in today the challenge will be accepted in this House or on the hustings at any time they like. Mr HARRISON ""(Wentworth) [6.1.]. - I had no intention of speaking but for the remarks of the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Blackburn). His specious plea on behalf of the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Ward) gave to this House some indication of how far party loyalty will go. We know that the honourable member for Bourke has been disciplined by the Labour party because of his "" L e f t is t"" leanings. At times he has been excluded from party conferences because of his communistic tendencies. The right honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Menzies) drew attention to the fact that one section of the policy propounded by the Minister for Labour and National Service was definitely communistic.",39
173,Mr WARD,REPAYMENT OF,What section?,40
174,Mr HARRISON,REPAYMENT OF,"The section dealing with coupons. The honourable member for Bourke said that there was a concerted attack on the .Minister for Labour and National Service, designed to drive him out of the Cabinet. That is not so. The honourable member for Bourke said that the masse bad no greater champion than the Minister for Labour and National Service. If the masses had to look to him for the lead which they need in this war they would be disappointed. They would fail to get inspiration, leadership or direction and, indeed, would be a leaderless mob. There is no need for honourable members on thi side to seek for the honourable member to be driven from the Cabinet. A ll that, necessary is that the people shall read extracts from Hansard reports of speeches made by the Minister when he was in London. Saturday. opposition. When what he said then i made known to the people outside they will demand his withdrawal from tht Government as probably the most dangerous member any Australian government has ever had in war-time. On the 5th November, 1936. speaking on the Estimates in this chamber the honourable member said1 should not be prepared to take up arm? against the workers of any country, whether they be German or of any other nationality As a matter of fact, because I am not prepared to do that, I am not prepared to tell other* to do so. 1 believe, and judging by statements mad* by honourable members on both sides of thp committee it seems to be generally agreed, that Australia would find it very difficult, if not impossible, to defend itself against an aggressor. This is the man who the member for Bourke says is the champion of the. masses. In 1936, he said that he would not take up aims against Germany or any aggressor. In other words he is Teady to let Japan flog its way through this country and take over all the resources of Australia. This is the man who when the pressure is applied will break. He is a man of the type of those Ministers in the French'Cabinet who'caused the capitulation of France. This is the man who as a private member said that ne would not take up arms to defend this country. He is a man of fixed opinions; as the deader of the Opposition has said, this man is at least - consistent and whether in office or out - of office attacks tbose of opposite politics to his own. There was no need for the specious pleading of tie honourable member for Bourke when le. was directing attention to what he considered to be a direct and organized attack on the Minister for Labour and National - Service from this side of the House. The people generally need only to have statements of the kind attributed to the Minister published in order to withdraw their support from public loans. The Minister is definitely the weak link in the Cabinet and he should be removed. I believe that he would be the first person to advise the workers of this country not to take up arms against their fellow workers, even though they might be Germans or Japanese. He would say in effect: "" Whatever they are, they are fellow workers "".",40
175,Mr CHIFLEY,REPAYMENT OF,I rise to order. The remarks of the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Harrison) have nothing whatever to do with the bill.,41
176,Mr HARRISON,REPAYMENT OF,"I quite understand the attitude of the Treasurer. He finds himself in a most unfortunate position. He commended this bill to the Bouse, yet he finds one of his ministerial colleagues propounding a financial policy entirely different from that propounded by the Government as a whole. He knows full well that he will be required to answer to the House for the statements made by the Minister for Labour and National Service. .He, and some other honourable gentlemen in the Government who do not favour the policy advocated by the Minister for Labour and National Service, do not desire to have either their characters or their credentials assailed. The fact is that the outlook of the Minister for Labour and National Service on financial issues has not changed. Erom time to time he ha made statements to the effect that he would not contribute a penny towards the defence of his country. Such statements must inevitably affect contributions to public loans. 'The honourable - gentleman has made no secret of his belief that interest should not be paid on money lent to defend the country. He has said that people should not receive any interest on money lent for war purposes. He stated in the House today that he was referring to past obligations, but when he was asked by responsible members of the Opposition whether 'his remarks had application to this bill ne was silent. His ministerial colleagues also were silent. I suggest that the honourable gentleman's attitude is designed to bring about a profound change in tihe financial policy of Australia. It will be remembered - that quite recently certain regulations dealing with tike economic organization in this country were tabled. The Government ha? appointed a special committee to report upon them. That would not have been done had the Minister for Labour and Na'tional Service had his way. I am sure that we should get no modification of the regulations if the decision depended .upon the Minister. When a question was asked of the Prime Minister recently concerning these regulations, the honourable gentleman interjected that the regulations were not severe enough.",41
177,Mr ROSEVEAH,REPAYMENT OF,Neithe r they are!,41
178,Mr HARRISON,REPAYMENT OF,"I am interested to hear the honourable - member for Dalley express that view. Nevertheless the regulations cut right across the present social structure of Australia, and, in my view, are being used by certain honourable gentlemen opposite in an endeavour to divide Australia.",41
179,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,REPAYMENT OF, Thos e regulations are not now before the House.,41
180,Mr HARRISON,REPAYMENT OF,"I desired to make only that passing reference to them in order to indicate the attitude of the Minister for Labour and National Service and of the honourable member for Dalley towards the general economic position of Australia. The Minister has made it clear that' he is not in favour of paying 1 interest on future war loans; and> hehas been supported by other honourable gentle^ men opposite-. The honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Menzies-) specifically directed theattention of the Treasurer to his colleague's statement and asked f o i a definite pronouncement on the subject by a responsible Minister. If the Minister for Labourand National Service cannot support the Go-vera-ment's financial policy, hiscourse is clear. Heshould be courageous enough toresign from the Cabinet' forthwith. Failing such action, he should be ignominiously removed. Undoubtedly,, bisattitude is undermining the confidence of the people in the Government. People are not likely to subscribe to new loans if they feai? 1ihat interest wilt not be paid according to the undertakings. given",41
181,Mr FALSTEIN,REPAYMENT OF,Does the honoaiable memibersuggest feat their patriotism' may be measuredby a percentage of interest?',42
182,Mr HARRISON,REPAYMENT OF,"The patriotism of the honourable member' for' ""Watson (Mr: Falsteirr) has never been, andisnot likely to be, measured. Hewill' always be up in theair and not on the ground staff: We have listened' this afternoon to speechesby the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Blackburn), the honourable member for Reid (Mr Morgan), the hon1 orable member for Melbourne (Mr. Calwell), the Minister for Labour and National Service, and the Minister for War Organization of Industry (Mr. Dedman), all' of whom referred' at length to the payment of interest on loans. I have been unable to find one point on which they agreed with the tinaneiai policy of the Government as indicated by this bill. Each of themenunciated principles contrary to that policy, lit is high time, therefore, that the Government soiight an adjournment of the House in order to hold a party meeting to formulate a financial policy that will be favoured by its supporters as a whole. If we are to make an effective war effort, we must be a united people, and have complete confidence in our Government. I regret that, so far, we have not bad an unambiguous pronouncement on financial policy from a responsible member of the Ministry. Until that has been made, the views of honourable members on this biflt must, remain seriously unsettled. It would appear that soma honourable membersopposite place the-. financial 1 viewsof the Minister for Labour and National Service in the forefront of their political policy. Silling suspended from 6.15 to 8 p.m.",42
183,Mr ROSEVEAR,REPAYMENT OF,"Dalley) £8.0'] - A good' deal of heat has been engendered , in this' debate. I have listened closely to it; in> order to see whether the Opposition is in. agreement with, O'P' is, opposed 1 to. the proposal contained in the bill. So far us I have been able todiscover, a positive determination has been made 1 by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Fad'den) and' his followers, not to support the bill but to make as muchparn political capital as possible out of statements published in the press. Their passionshave been torn to shreds and tatters over the question of whether the Minister £OE Labour and National Service (Mr Ward) was correctly reported in a statement he is allegedto have made in the press. I believe that the honourable gentleman has today given, a flat, contradiction, of thei construction' which honourable members opposite desire to put. upon that statement.. Hisfailure to take the t.ro'tiible' to: chase up with a denial every incorrect statement made in the press is regarded by the Opposition as evidence, of his guilt and the accuracy of the pres* statement. Any denial that he might make would merely draw from the press a counter-denial, and no one would be any wiser. Honourable members, opposite have publicly expressed a desire to co-operate with the Government in carrying on the war effort; yet, they seize upon any matter, however trivial it may be, that is calculated to embarrass the Government. That has been clearly demonstrated today by their efforts to set one Minister against another in a controversy as to which vr&s expressing the policy of Lahour. Instead of co-operating with the Ministry, their endeavours are directed towards its disruption by the playing of one Minister against another. Their impassioned speeches have been, actuated by political hatred of the Minister for Labour and National Service. When that honourable gentleman has the courage to tell them exactly what he did say, they are not. prepared to accept his explanation, but prefer to take for granted everything that is published in the press. Honourable o'.enibers who sit on this side of the House are not slaves hound to the party wheel, as are honourable members who sit opposite. ""We are entitled at all times to express our views in regard to party policy and the manner in which it is applied. Any honourable member, whether he be a Minister or a rank-and file member, has the right to express his '->pinion if he believes that there has been departure from the party platform by the Ministry. Furthermore, in view of rhe changed conditions brought about by the war, he is entitled to place on the platform of the party whatever interpretation he considers the Labour movement intended should be placed on it in a given set of circumstances. It is as well to consider what the platform of the Labour party is in regard to defence, and the measures that should be adopted in order to finance it. The defence policy sets out that it shall be financed by the operation of Labour's financial policy; and that policy very definitely states that naval and military expenditure shall be allocated from direct taxation. When the policy of direct raxation for the purpose of naval or military expenditure is departed from any member of the party is entitled to check up in order to determine whether or not, the Ministry is departing from the-platform of the party. Furthermore, Labour's financial policy lays down that there shall be restriction of public borrowing. 1 a.m beginning to wonder whether this bill, and every other loan measure that the Labour Government has asked this House to pass, are in conformity with the platform of the party in relation to public Imrrowing. It might be said in justification of the adoption of this practice, that taxation has reached the limit. Honourable members opposite say that it, has not; they would like the Government to invade the lower ranges of income in order to collect a greater amount of revenue. Possibly the Treasurer believes that the limit of taxation has been reached, and that the leeway must be made up by means of public borrowing. If this bill is not the result of consultation with the rank and file members of the party, any one of Mr Rosevear. them is perfectly justified in criticizing it. to the degree that it departs from the policy of the party. It has been said that the Minister for Labour and National Service should resign because, apparently, he disagrees with this procedure. Whether he resigns or not, is to be taken as evidence of whether or not he possesses personal courage. I put it to honourable members that if a man ran away from, his convictions that would not be a display of courage, but that, on the contrary, he would display courage if he were prepared to stand his ground in the Cabinet as well as in this House, in defence of views which he conceived to be in line with the policy of the party. The Minister has suggested that interest should not be offered in connection with the raising of future loans. That is regarded as a revolutionary proposal. I agree that it is. He has not advocated that contracts already made with the public shall be repudiated. I put it to the House that the Labour parn has already made a revolutionary change in its defence policy. It was committed to voluntaryism in defence, but has accepted the principle of conscription for military service. There have been no howls from the Opposition on that account. When the Government departs from voluntaryism and tends towards the reactionary policy that our opponents espouse, they welcome the change of front; but when we suggest that interest shall not be payable in connection with future loans, they repudiate the idea. In recent regulations, the Government, has gone dangerously close to industrial conscription, which to the Labour movement is anathema to a. greater degree than is military conscription. Honourable members opposite have not eluded us on that account. They have attempted to prove thai the suggestion of the Minister for Labour and National Service, if adopted, would damage public morale. Public morale can be damaged in a number of ways. I. suggest that infinitely more damage could be done by the suggestion, of honourable members opposite that the restriction of profits will lead to the restriction of investment in loans. Nothing could be more dama.ging to the morale of the great bulk of the people than the belief that there is in this House a substantial party, wbicb has been the Government and may again be the Government before the termination of the war, and which holds the view that a certain section is so paltry as to show patriotism only in the measure of the profits it can extract from the nation. The morale of the people can be damaged also by the bombardment of our cities by enemy ships and bombers. I remind honourable members opposite that quite recently Australia was bombed by Japanese raiders. A story told by an evacuee from New Guinea is to the effect that a piece of scrap iron from a bomb dropped on that territory was marked, "" Thank you, Mr Menzies"". Such an incident is most damaging to public morale. Which is likely to be the most damaging-the policy suggested b? the Minister for Labour and National Service, the current policy of the members of the Opposition, or the policy of those gentlemen less than two years ago? Let us examine, first, tie damage to the prospects of the loan which might be caused if interest were not payable. When will this interest be paid? Payment will be made in postwar years, when the mass of the people of Australia will be paying for this war in starvation and tears; when broken soldiers, who have fought to protect this countiy in the interests of those who have money to invest, will be walking about like mendicants looking for a dole from rhe Repatriation Department; when people are reconstructing their broken homes, which have taken them a lifetime of energetic endeavour to procure. At that stage, these patriots who lend rbeir money to the Government will be collecting interest on it with monotonous regularity. When the war is over, and work in munitions factories ceases, the unemployed will number perhaps 500,000. Those men will almost certainly have to search for work, and live on dole tickets, whilst these patriots, whom honourable members opposite are so feverishly endeavouring to protect, will be collecting their interest regularly. Present that picture to the people of Australia-the post-war picture, when levy is being paid to the interest-mongers-and then see whether honourable members opposite would be game enough, with all their humbug, to fight an election on it. That is the first test-damag e to the loan prospects because there is to be no interest. Let us examine the second proposition of honourable members opposite, namely, that if you restrict profits, you will discourage investment in war loans. What sort of policy is that to put before the people? How are you to improve the morale of the public if you must tell them that, unless you allow a certain class ruthlessly to exploit them, the members of that class will not invest their money in war loans? There is only one logical conclusion to be drawn from that: the greater the profit you allow some people to extort from the public, the greater will be the success of the war loan.",42
184,Mr ANTHONY,REPAYMENT OF,That is gross and deliberate distortion.,44
185,Mr ROSEVEAR,REPAYMENT OF,"That is the inevitable conclusion to which the arguments of honourable members opposite lead. I was interested to hear the honourable member for Kooyong (MT . Menzies), who usually acts as backstop for the Opposition when things are going badly for them, put forward a specious case on what turned out to be an incorrect newspaper report. After all,, of what use is it to be a lawyer if yon cannot put up some sort of an argument even on a bad case? He asked what would people of Australia think of the Minister for Labour and National Service who dared to say that future war loans should be interest free. A few weeks ago, the honourable member for Kooyong told the House that for two years, while he was Prime Minister, he knew that we would have to fight Japan; yet, during those two years, he forced the waterside workers with threats of gaol and deregistration to load pig iron for Japan. Now he tells us what the people would do to the Minister for Labour and National Service if they had the chance. I would rather hear the people say, ""Hang the Minister for Labour and National Service"", than hear the Japanese say, "" Thank you, Mr. Menzies "", as they have done for his part in providing them with supplies of scrap iron. The honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Harrison) quoted the statement of the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr Ward) in 1936 that he did not want to fight the workers of any country, and, incidentally, that he did not want to fight the German workers. Did any one know with any degree of certainty who would be fighting whom in this war until the nations had actually taken sides? In flaaisard I could turn up columns of rubbish talked hy some honourable members about countries which are now in the enemy's camp. The statement of the Minister for Labour and National Service, referred to by the honourable member for Wentworth, was made in 1936, and the people of his electorate have returned him twice since then, and his party has by plebiscite elected him a member of the Government. The same honourable members opposite, who were responsible for selling scrap iron to Japan, were, if I remember rightly, responsible for the attempt to lease the Yampi iron ore deposits to Japan. About the time the honourable member for East Sydney was saying that he did not want to fight the German workers, those other honourable members wanted to provide the Japanese with unlimited supplies of iron ore.",44
186,Mr ANTHONY,REPAYMENT OF,It was the State government in Western Australia that proposed to lease the deposits.,45
187,Mr ROSEVEAR,REPAYMENT OF,"If it was the State government which wanted to lease the deposits, the Government supported by the honourable member did nothing to prevent it",45
188,Mr ANTHONY,REPAYMENT OF,I rise to a point of order. Is the honourable member in order in making misstatements regarding the actions of a previous government? I take the point that the previous Commonwealth government did prohibit the --sport of iron ore from Yampi Sound.,45
189,Mr SPEAKER,REPAYMENT OF,Hon. W. M . Nairn). - That is only a. contradiction; it is a point of order..,45
190,Mr ROSEVEAR,REPAYMENT OF,"Honourable members opposite, most of whom were born with silver' spoons in their mouths, are shocked, at the suggestion of the honourable member for East Sydney that if every one were to make an equal contribution to the war effort we might pay for all services by the issue of coupons",45
191,Mr HARRISON,REPAYMENT OF,Does that represent Government policy?,45
192,Mr ROSEVEAR,REPAYMENT OF,"It is a suggestion from a very good Labour man. Honourable members opposite are scandalized at the suggestion that they, and other members of their class, should accept food coupons, but I never heard any of them condemn the issuing of dole coupons to the unemployed. Eor ten years they thought it good enough to issue food coupons to the men who are the present heroes of the workshops making munitions with which to fight the enemy. That is their contribution, whilst the contribution of honourable members opposite is a continuous heckling of the trade unions. Those honourable gentlemen have expressed great enthusiasm for the £75,000,000 loan for the purpose of destruction. The same honourable members, during the depression years, held up their hands in holy horror when it was suggested that a few million pounds might be raised to give work to the unemployed. They are always enthusiastic about war loans, but they have no enthusiasm for work loans for the purpose of making life bearable for those suffering the worse effects of depression. There is an obvious difference between the financial outlook of the Government and that of the Opposition. We support a policy of taxation for defence purposes, together with a restricted loan policy. 1 hope that the Government will not tempt the loyalty of the party too far by going in too much for loans. The defence policy which I have just enunciated is the one to which we have always subscribed., the one upon which we won our seats in this Pai'liament, and.it is up to us to ensure that that policy shall not be departed from too widely. Honourable members opposite are still harping on the fact that the Government not. has failed to make greater inroads into small incomes. They are perturbed at the fact that an amount of £500,000,000 is received each year by the lower-paid workers,, but none of them told the House just how many people share that money, and how much is left to each of them after he pays his taxes. The honourable member for Deakin (Mr Hutchinson) still bemoans the fact that the Labour party is not prepared to dig deeper into ilie earnings of the lower-paid workers. 1 commend the Government for not having done so. If it dug much deeper into the pockets of the workers, who are [he real wealth producers of the country, it might then logically present them with loin cloths and rice 'bowls. They would have no money to put in their pockets any way, so that a loin cloth would do them well enough.",45
193,Mr HOLT,REPAYMENT OF,"Fawkner) ['8.26TJ - I think it, might be well for me to deal first one of the larger red-herrings drawn across the path by the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Rosevear). I refer to the popular story about the scrap iron which the Menzies' Government allowed io be exported to Japan. The time has i-ome when the full facts regarding this - natter should be made public, and they are very different from the story told by members of the present Government for political purposes. This problem cropped up again last year while I was Minister for Labour. We received a report that rhere was likely to be industrial trouble - m the waterfront because the workers were being asked to load zinc concentrates aud lead for shipment to Japan. I asked the Minister for Trade and Customs for a full statement on the position, because it seemed at first sight strange that Ave should be supplying these materials to a potential enemy. When the matter was investigated it was found that Japan could secure supplies of zinc concentrates and lead from a number of other countries besides Australia.  - irder. What is the connection between pig iron and the Loan Rill now before 1 he House?",46
194,Mr SPEAKER,REPAYMENT OF,"This debate has, unfortunately, become altogether too wide, but since various matters have been raised on the one side, the other side must be permitted to answer them.",46
195,Mr HOLT,REPAYMENT OF,"It is quite understandable that what has for so long proved to be a popular story should be relinquished with reluctance by members of the present Government. As I have said, we learned that zinc concentrates could be obtained by Japan from several other countries, Burma being one of them. On the other hand, we found that we were getting from Japan articles which we could not get from any other country, articles which were essential for our defence preparations. These included machine tools, silk for parachutes, canvas tents, and khaki webbing for uniforms; there was also an offer of aeroplanes. 1 summoned representatives of the appropriate trade union and told them the story, and I am happy to say that the nnionists showed a good deal more sense in regard to the matter than have some with of those who claim to speak for them. That was the last we heard of it.",46
196,Mr LAZZARINI,REPAYMENT OF,That is all boloney. There was a strike on the waterfront for three months on this issue.,46
197,Mr HOLT,REPAYMENT OF,"I am referring to the episode which took place last year. To return to the subject before the House: It is quite clear that the Government found itself, after the extraordinary performance of one of its Ministers this afternoon, in a very unpleasant predicament. Although the Government is seeking authority under this bill to raise £75,,000,000, very grave doubts existed in all parts of the House after the Minister for Labour and National Service had spoken as to whether the Government was in favour of the bill. Accordingly, it arranged for its most astute debater to present, with such sophistry aB he could muster, a case which would attempt to resolve the dilemma in which the Government found itself. He declared that no positive declaration had been made on this side of the House in support of the bill. That is completely false. The Leader of the Opposition made it perfectly clear, in the opening sentences of his speech, that we were entirely in favour of the Loan Bill to raise £75,000,000. We recognized that it was for the purpose of conducting the war. Having made that declaration, the Leader of the Opposition proceeded to direct attention to what he regarded as some of the basic weaknesses in the financial policy of the Government. Not one member on this side of the chamber expressed any opposition to the bill; but. on the other hand, a responsible Minister endeavoured to explain to us a misrepresentation of certain remarks which he had made publicly, and he offered thecorrect version in its stead. Although we do not desire to question in detail the explanation which, was given by the Minister for Labour and National Service, I consider that it is appropriate to point out to the House that this alleged misrepresentation was not limited to the one newspaper from which he quoted. Such a respectable journal as the Brisbane Courier-Mail reported the Minister thusWc should not be asked to pay for the war afterwards by paying interest on any loans that are raised now. The Newcastle Morning Herald, which pays particular attention to industrial matters, reported on Monday, the 2nd March, that the Minister had saidIndustry was being concentrated and organized which meant that it got more and more into monopolistic hands. That was why he suggested that the Government take over basic war industries and organize them in the interests of the nation. Unfortunately, in Cabinet he was in the minority. The next best course in seeing that workers were being protected against exploitation was to give the workers themselves some say in the management of industry and some say in the production process. In view of the fact that the Loan Bill has some bearing on the stability of our financial institutions, it is appropriate for me to quote from the Adelaide Advertiser a statement by the Minister upon the subject of the banksMr Ward said he had long held the opinion that we had too many banks and that the Commonwealth Bank was quite able to do the banking business. He had declared the Com moil wealth Bank a protected industry. Private banks were on the same footing as Hiiy other undertaking. - So that if the Minister was misreported - and .1 remind the House that this is not the first time that embarrassing ments by the Minister have had to be announced to this House as misrepresentations of what he had actually apparently a number of newspapers fell into the same error after taking notes of the same speech. But we are prepared to meet him on entirely different ground and take the explanation which he offered to the House as being what he actually said. That explanation, in effect, is this: Minister does not resist the proposition that we should pay interest on previous loans, or upon the £35,000,000 Loan, which is now being floated; but he is opposed to the payment of interest on any loans which may be raised in future. ilr. Holt. There can be no misunderstanding on that point, because the honourable member for Dalley went to considerable pains to explain that this is a basic feature of the platform of the Labour party. The honourable member for Riverina (Mr Langtry) will recall that a meeting in his electorate, the proceedings of which were reported in the press this morning, resolved that he should be asked to place before the Government, in an effective and determined manner, the opinion of that branch that interest should not be paid in future on moneys raised for war purposes. So there can be no doubt as to where the Minister stands, or where many members of the Government stand on this important proposal. I a,sked earlier whether the Government was in favour of this bill which the Treasurer presented to the House, and I say that there is some point in my question, because the Minister for Labour and National Service said, "" I am in favour of . paying interest on the £35,000,000 Liberty Loan, but on no future loans "". Yet the Government is now seeking authority to raise loans totalling £75,000,000. Can we assume that even if the Minister's colleagues are in favour of raising an additional £40,000,000 and paying interest on that sum, he is not in favour of it , and that once again he finds himself in the minority, as he was when he referred to the nationalization of industry. In an attempt to j u s t if y the Minister's position, the honourable member for Dalley propounded what was for all of us a most original conception of minisstateterial responsibility. Apparently, the traditional theory of ministerial responsibility, which has been observed for said- many centuries, has been swept aside by this new doctrine that has been specially created to overcome the predicament of the Minister for Labour and National Service. The new theory is that if a Minister finds himself committed to a decision of Cabinet and he disapproves The of that decision because it is not in conformity with the platform of the Labour party as laid down regularly at its conLiberty ferences, it is his bounden duty to denounce that decision publicly and to advocate adherence to the platform. That was seriously put forward to the House as a justification of the attitude of the Minister. If that he so, it will make a cabinet government a very difficult proposition in this country for a long time. It will make effective government in wiar-time by Cabinet an outright impossibility. That is the really serious feature of the situation revealed by this performance today. We are fighting for our very existence. enemy is attacking our shores. But we are not able to look with confidence to Government for guidance. It is not able to reach agreement on basic matters of policy; and on that rests the whole future security of this Commonwealth. Honourable members opposite have a novel and revolutionary conception of the financing of the war. Even in Russia, to which so many honourable gentlemen opposite pledge their sentimental and personal attachment, a very handsome rate of interest is permitted on loans raised for the conduct of war. But in Australia we must be more extreme. The statement which was made this afternoon will have damaging repercussions, for both in its implications and its consequences it is tragic for the security of this country. This Government has denounced the proposal for finiincing the war by compulsory loans, taking from each individual according to his capacity to contribute to the war effort. It put previous Government out of office because it adopted that policy, and so it has decided that the system of voluntary loans is the one to which it will adhere. Whence will the contributions from this loan come? It has been suggested that they will come partly from the big companies, despite the heavy inroad's of taxation upon their earnings. It will not be seriously suggested that they will come from what we in normal times describe as the moderately wellto-do and wealthy classes, because those sections are passing through a most painful period of adjustment. The fact that those people still have what on paper appears to be a very healthy income does not render the adjustment any the less painful for them, because over a period of years they have been accustomed to a certain living standard and are now compelled to adjust themselves in a matter of weeks to a drastically [6] reduced living standard. While the voluntary principle remains, it will be extremely difficult to raise from this class substantial contributions for loans. Therefore, we must look to those elements in the community who today probably have more money, as the savings bank figures and the statistics relating to the purchase of conThe sumer goods show, than they ever had before. On what basis will they make the contributions to future loans? They are asked to do it voluntarily. It is perhaps the first time in their lives that they have had a little nest egg to which they look for their future economic security, and naturally they want to do the patriotic thing on behalf of the country. Accordingly, they decide to put their money into the loan. The interest might be only 3 per cent., but to them that is neither here nor there. It is a small return on their capital. But when these people are told that the Government is opposed to the payment of interest on loans, they fear that the next step will be the confiscation of their money, and that the repayment of the principal will be repudiated. That will immediately destroy confidence and adversely affect the Government's prospects of securing substantial additional loan moneys. That is the accusation which we level against those members of the Government who talk in this loose and the irresponsible manner at the present time. We say undeniably that they are destroying the confidence of the people in our financial institutions. All this talk about the private banks, interest from loans, confiscation of capital, and capital levies is having a most damaging and disastrous effect upon confidence. I ask the Treasurer to inform me whether it is a fact that there has been a significant "" run "" on some banks recently. People are showing a disposition to hoard their cash because of this fear of repudiation. The Minister for Labour and National Service and those who support him have done a great disservice to the country in raising this controversial issue at this juncture. I pass from that subject to what I believe is a more serious attempt to sow discord in the community, namely, the proposal of the Minister for Labour and National Service that every member of the community should be reduced to what might be termed the ""lowest common denominator standard "". Very good arguments, based on principles of social .justice, might be adduced as to why every person should participate equally in the goods and services available in the community. That is a delightful academic proposal which one could usefully discuss in time of peace for hours. But when a responsible Minister, at a time when the country is battling for its existence, puts that forward seriously as a practical proposal to be put into operation, the result will be to create disunity, class hatred and class distrust. In the - present crisis, the country should be pulling together in perfect unity. Does the honourable gentleman put forward that proposal seriously, believing it to be a practicable proposition or does he propound it because he knows that it will have a very popular appeal among some of the less informed sections of the community? I shall tackle bim on both propositions. If he made the suggestion, not believing that it is practicable, he is deliberately provoking uncertainty, disunity and discord at a time when such developments should be avoided. But if he seriously believes that the proposal will be given practical effect, does he speak as a member of the Government and enunciate government policy, or is he once again expressing a minority opinion from which his colleagues will openly dissociate themselves? In any event, he creates uncertainty and dissension, and so does a disservice to the community in this crisis. Whichever way one looks at it this Minister is able to do what he likes. He can publicly and privately disagree with the majority of his colleagues in a way which will appeal to certain elements of the community. I do not regard him as irresponsible or ignorant. I think he is playing a clever, shrewd game, from his own point of view, because he is obviously playing for the support of the militant industrial unions. We have got out of the habit of speaking of "" Com "" unions; the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Rosevear) and the Minister for Supply and Development (Mr Beasley) at one stage organized to destroy those elements, but today we all are Mr Bolt. brothers and cannot use the expression "" Com "" since it may suggest disrespect for our ally overseas. The Minister for Labour and National Service is anxious to secure the support of the trade unions, and, to that end, is ready to go to the lengths of raising most controversial issues. The people of this country and the Opposition have given to the Government, from the time it took office almost up to the present moment, the most generous measure of support. In my experience no government had a better beginning than this Government had. The newspapers were behind it ; they wanted to see it do well. The Opposition wanted to give it « fair trial. Hardly a member on this side has spoken publicly in the last few months.",46
198,Mr MENZIES,REPAYMENT OF,Eve n the honourable  wanted to give a trial to it.,49
199,Mr HOLT,REPAYMENT OF,"Yes , and the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Calwell). and the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Rosevear), too. They all were prepared to give it a good start. No man could have given to the Prime Minister a fairer deal than was given by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Fadden).",49
200,Mr FBOST,REPAYMENT OF,Did the honourable member not get a fair deal from the Opposition when his party was in power?,49
201,Mr HOLT,REPAYMENT OF,"Yes . The Prime Minister (Mr Curtin), when Leader of the Opposition, very properly reserved the right to be critical when he thought he should be. He tested the feeling of this House on the major issue of the last budget. We are not complaining; we have swallowed our medicine, and are doing our best to see that the game of politics is not played at the time when this country is struggling against the gravest menace it has had to face.",49
202,Mr SPEAKER,REPAYMENT OF,Order !,49
203,Mr HOLT,REPAYMENT OF,I agree with the inference that it is deplorable that we should have a repetition of the scene and the atmosphere created in this chamber this afternoon.,49
204,Mr SPEAKER,REPAYMENT OF,Order !,49
205,Mr HOLT,REPAYMENT OF,"We are trying to debate the merits of two fundamental proposals submitted by a responsible Minister of the Crown. We have endeavoured to . debate these proposals calmly and logically and free of personalities. The Opposition now feels that it must challenge these proposals because it sees, as the country sees, that whilst in time of war this Government has the authority to take the measures necessary for the protection of the Commonwealth, it has neither mandate nor authority to use as a cloak the circumstances of war in order to implement radical proposals which have been traditional planks of the Lahour platform. ""We challenge the Government on that. Some members of the Government, a minority, are using the opportunity, which feeling in the community and the circumstances of war give to them, to introduce a socialistic programme, even when some of the features of that programme disadvantage the war effort. We ask the Government to consider this matter seriously. Can Ministers from their experience of the funclioning of democracy since the outbreak of war believe that it can function effectively in war-time unless there is hasic unity on major proposals? They must consider that this is no time to make mistakes on matters of fundamental policy. There are in this chamber 60 or more members who have the same basic ideas as to how the war should be conducted, but the tragedy is that those members are not able, by some means or other, to pool their goodwill and unity of interests and policy in order to ensure this country against aggression and invasion. .1. - ay with all sincerity that until we pool the best administrative brains of this Parliament in order to establish the most effective government possible, we shall not be doing our duty to the public who sent us here and to the men who are risking their lives for us. Por that reason I ask the Government to ponder its responsibilities, not only to this generation, but also to the generations to come , otherwise the charge levelled against it will be that at the time when the country demanded our best the Government was not prepared to give that best, but preferred to play politics up to the hilt so as to preserve its own political advantages.",49
206,Mr FALSTEIN,REPAYMENT OF,"Watson) [8.56] Honourable members opposite have struck a new "" high "" in lowness. On the pretext of speaking on a loan bill, they have made an attack on the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr. Ward). If this bill had not come before the House, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Fadden) intended to move the adjournment to discuss whether or not that Minister should continue in the Cabinet. By their conduct in this debate, Opposition members have proved not that the Minister should resign, but rather, their own unfitness to represent the people in the Parliament at this grave time. I think it was the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Holt) who said that there was no substance in the criticism of the shipment of pig iron to Japan. I shall not discuss that matter, but I shall direct attention to something else. While the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Harrison) was reciting to the House what was said by the Minister for Labour and National Service - AS member for East Sydney in 1936, namely, that he would not fight against German workers in a war, I had lively recollections that in the same year the right honourable member for Kooyong (Mr. Menzies), when he returned from Germany, greatly praised Hitler's administration and said that what Australia needed was a leader, which is the English translation of "" Fuhrer "".",50
207,Mr SPEAKER,REPAYMENT OF,Hon. W. M. Nairn). - Order ! The question before the House is whether this bill should be read a second time. I shall disallow any further references to persons.,50
208,Mr FALSTEIN,REPAYMENT OF,In the debate it was said that it would be a bad thing if the Commonwealth Bank was to be the only bank to survive this war. I put it to honourable members opposite that the Commonwealth Bank is move than a bank. It is an instrument with which to prosecute the war.,50
209,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,REPAYMENT OF,It is more than that; it is the honourable member's office at present.,50
210,Mr FALSTEIN,REPAYMENT OF,"My only wish is that all members of the community could share equally with members of the Commonwealth Bank their privileges and what is permitted to them during the course of this war. I was saying that the Commonwealth Bank is not only a bank, but also an instrument with which to prosecute the war. We, as a Labour party, having regard to our policy, so fashion and sharpen that instrument that it will be the most effective weapon that we can procure on the financial side. I have drawn the attention of the Treasurer (Mr Chifley) on two occasions through the medium of questions to fact that, although the Government sees fit to continue its policy of borrowing from the public purse, nevertheless persons are still being paid a commission of 5s. per cent, in respect of applications made by their clients. Those from this commission are banks, large insurance companies and stockbrokers. Simple mathematical calculation that in respect of the £100,000,000 conversion loan recently floated, the commission of 5s. per cent, would mean that the Commonwealth Government might be appreciative liable to pay a sum not exceeding £250,000. A contribution of £250,000 this loan would be most substantial. still this practiceis being continued and, although the Treasurer has said that he to my question. proposes to review it in respect of future loans, none the le&3 the Commonwealth might be obliged to pay in respect present loan a sum of £100,000. If a firm of stockbrokers, for example, J. B. Were and Son, which acts for people like the Mutual Life and Citizens Assurance Company Limited, and the Bank New South Wales, which make very large Opposition. contributions, are to be paid 5s. per cent, on every application, which is merely written piece of paper lodged with the Commonwealth Bank, it means will be paid many thousands of pounds for very little work indeed. I do not regard such expenditure as proper respect of either the raising of loans the prosecution of the war. The 5s. cent, is over and above amounts authoI rized for expenditure on advertising, radio, and other publicity. In supporting the principle enunciated this afternoon by the Minister Labour and National Service that loans should be non-interest-bearing, emphasize that it is a poor lookout Australia if the measure of its people's patriotism is to be the percentage rate Mr Falstein. which those who have money will lend it for defence purposes. The arguments of the Opposition fall quite flat when we must remember that the money which the Government is seeking in order to prosecute the war is to provide for the safety of the very people who subscribe it. If war loans are to be looked upon purely as investments Australia is the in a most unhappy position. The great majority of our people look forward to the time when all the money necessary some for defence will be provided without argument, in order to give our men fighting in the front-line all the arms and who benefit equipment they need.",50
211,Mr MCEWEN,REPAYMENT OF,Does the honourable member favour voluntary or compulsory shows non-bearing interest loans?,51
212,Mr FALSTEIN,REPAYMENT OF,I believe that the people of Australia are now sufficiently of the peril of the country to spare no effort to provide the means to to keep out of our land the enemies who But are at present attacking it.,51
213,Mr MCEWEN,REPAYMENT OF,That is not an answer,51
214,Mr SPEAKER,REPAYMENT OF,The honourable member addressing the Chair is not of the obliged to answer questions.,51
215,Mr MCEWEN,REPAYMENT OF,It is a fair question.,51
216,Mr FALSTEIN,REPAYMENT OF,I regret that in recent weeks the Government has paid of so much heed to views enunciated by the,51
217,Mr MABWICK,REPAYMENT OF,"Our stiggestions have a been helpful, which is more than can be said of the remarks at present being made that they by the honourable member.",51
218,Mr FALSTEIN,REPAYMENT OF,"I am debarred by a recently promulgated national security in regulation from disclosing information or made available at the recent secret meetper ing of senators and members - Otherwise should be able to show clearly who are being helpful to Australia's cause and who are hindering it. Much has been said today concerning for the financial views of the Minister for war Labour and National Service. It has I been stated that if his policy were for adopted Australia would be divided. It might be a good thing if Australia were at divided on such an issue, for it would show us clearly which of the people were anxious for an all-in war effort and which were not. I believe that the division would be in the ratio of 97 per cent, for and 3 per cent, against. Included in that 3 per cent, would be the members of the Opposition and their friends. Some suggestion has heen made in this debate that private members who have been appointed to assist certain Ministers in their administrative work are receiving large amounts in remuneration for such service. That suggestion was made by the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) among others. The fact is that they are not receiving any remuneration. I have a most lively recollection that the committee system under which certain honourable gentlemen are receiving fees was introduced and sponsored by the present Opposition when in office. I am happy to say that I am not, and have not been, a member of any committee.",51
219,Mr SPEAKER,REPAYMENT OF,"The honourable member is now introducing party politics. Mr FALSTEIN"" - In any case, members of all parties in the Parliament are benefiting by the payment of fees to committee members. Two ideas have been specially emphasized by honourable gentlemen opposite in connection with this bill. The first is the Government's financial policy tends to inflation; and the second is that the principles enunciated by the Minister for Labour and National Service are communistic. The honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Menzies) described the Minister's speech as "" a new communist manifesto "". In doing so the honourable gentleman was playing the game of party politics at its hardest. As to the suggestion of inflation, I remind the House that this Government is being advised by the identical financial advisers who advised the previous Government. Honourable gentlemen opposite have done a great deal, by their utterances today, to disturb the financial stability of the country. As to the suggestion that the speech of the Minister for Labour and National Service was, in effect, a new communist manifesto I say frankly to honourable gentlemen opposite that I do not know, nor do I care, whether the communist system is good or bad; but I am convinced that the Communists of Soviet Russia, in being prepared to die for their system of government, have rendered a great service to Australia. We ought to be most thankful for what they have done.",52
220,Mr MARWICK,REPAYMENT OF,"Communists are patriots in Russia, but traitors in Australia.  honourable member for Swan recognized the Soviet Communists as patriots?",52
221,Mr MARWICK,REPAYMENT OF,"For many years. Mr FALSTEIN:-We in Australia are greatly indebted to the people of Soviet Russia for the splendid way in which they have maintained their resistance to aggression. It is probably true, as has been stated by Sir Stafford Cripps, the new Leader of the Government in the British House of Commons, that the war will be won primarily because of the magnificent stand of Russia against the German forces.",52
222,Mr JOLLY,REPAYMENT OF,"Lilley) [9.7] - In addressing myself to this bill, I begin by assuring the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Rosevear) that I intend to support the measure. I listened with in that terest to the honourable gentleman's speech, but, at its conclusion, I was unable to tell whether he favoured the bill or not. Parliament, of course, has already approved of the raising of this loan, for it was envisaged in the budget proposals agreed to last year. I believe that the people of Australia will wholeheartedly support the loan, for they are anxious that a maximum war effort shall be made, and are fully prepared to foot the bill. I assume that the interest rates on this loan will not be higher than those applicable to the Liberty Loan now being floated, namely, 2-J per cent, for the short period and 3^ per cent, for the long period. We all would be interested to know the proportions of applications for the long and short periods respectively in the Liberty Loan. It is gratifying to know that interest rates today are just about half what they were on loans raised during the last war. No other costs in connection with the war have shown such a large percentage reduction. In this respect, Australia is in step with Great Britain. We are apt to overlook the fact that persons who invest their money in war loans are accepting a greater reduction of income than persons who are assisting in any other war activity.",52
223,Mr MORGAN,REPAYMENT OF,Does the honourable member believe that interest rates should be even lower than they are?,53
224,Mr JOLLY,REPAYMENT OF,"Yes , if that be practicable. I am intrigued by the proposal of certain honourable gentlemen opposite that money should be provided for future war loans interestfree. Why should a person who invests £1,000 in a war loan be called upon to make his money available without interest, whilst other persons who invest similar amounts in property or in business undertakings may still receive fairly substantial returns in rents or dividends? I am aware, of course, that the security in respect of war loans is better than in respect of either property or business, but that, surely, is no reason why persons should be denied any interest on money invested in war loans. It would be absurd, in present circumstances, to ask people to provide money for war loans interest-free. The time has passed in this country for talking; it is high time that we were acting to the very utmost of OUT energy. I am not so much concerned, at the moment, as to how the money is to be raised as I am as to how it is to be expended. Our difficulty is not in raising money, but in spending it speedily and wisely to provide the needs of war. In making that statement, I do not criticize members of the present Government. I appreciate the difficulties that have to be faced. I do not think that any one in Australia today is satisfied with the nature and extent of our war effort. Much has been done, but a great deal more will have to be done in the future. I am afraid, however, that there is a tendency in some directions for us to spread ourselves too much. At this serious stage of the war, it is futile for us to be devoting our energies to activities which cannot be completed for twelve to eighteen months. We must put first things first. This is no time, for example, to be spending money on permanent buildings. We must be satisfied with temporary accommodation. We are too apt to spend our money lavishly in constructing permanent buildings. A single bomb may blow some of these buildings out of existence in a few moments. It would be far better for us to concentrate our spending on items of our war programme that are urgently needed at the moment. As a father who has sons in the services, I know that what our men at the front require are more planes, more guns and more ammunition. I agree with the view that our fighting services, and particularly the men in the front line, should receive greater consideration than they have received hitherto. I believe that the people of Australia would stand behind anything the Government did in this connection. It is urgent that planes, arms and equipment shall be provided with the least possible delay. Any person who impedes or obstructs the war effort should be regarded as a traitor and dealt with accordingly whether he be employer or employee. There has been too much interference with our war effort, and the Government should deal severely with those who adopt obstructive tactics. I urge the importance of giving our men who enlist in the forces a far more intensive training than they have received in the past. I know from personal experience that many of these young men have been discouraged and disheartened because they have not had practical training. In the present grave hour I hope that the military authorities will see that improvement is effected in that direction. The Government should be prepared to take action in order to curtail unnecessary expenditure. There cannot be any support for the degree to which pleasure and enjoyment are being sought and obtained in Australia today. It is the duty of every Australian to concentrate on the war effort. The Government should follow the lead set by the Premier of South Australia, and prohibit horse racing in the Commonwealth. The only task that confronts Australia today is the winning of the war. I am satisfied that if this Parliament will tell the people what it wants them to do, they will do it. The situation is serious; let us get on with the job before it is too late.",53
225,Mr BAKER,REPAYMENT OF,"Maranoa) [9.1S] - The war position is going from bad to worse. Three places on the mainland of Australia have been bombed-Darwi n on two occasions, Wyndham and Broome. We .«eom to be losing battles, picking up .straws. The only bright spot at the present juncture is in Russia, where the enemy is being driven back. Russia, vilified and cursed for a quarter of a century, may be destined to become the saviour of democracy. It abolished capitalism, and, like Othello, might well plead, "" The very head and front of my offending hath this extent, no more"". Sir Stafford Cripps, Lord Privy Seal and Leader of the House of Commons, said at a Liverpool meeting, according to a report appearing in the Melbourne Argus of the 23rd FebruaryTlie courage, determination, and self-sacnia tice shown by the Red Army, supported by all the people of Russia, have been the decisive factors in turning back the German invaders and protecting our country from MTazi attacks. A good deal has been said today as to the manner in which revenue should be obtained. It would appear that only two methods are considered suitable-taxa tion and borrowing. Surely there are other means! We must discard the orthodox, because the conditions are not normal. We are in a struggle for our national life. I remind the House that last, year the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr Fadden), who was then Treasurer, told us that the primary and secondary industries of this country had produced goods to a value of £925,000,000 in the previous twelve-months period and that, for the financial year ending the 30th June, 1942, the value of the production would be £1,000,000,000. That represents the national income of Australia ; and every £1 can be multiplied by ten in order to measure the national credit. Surely, then, we can expand the issue of credit through the Commonwealth Bank in order to win the war! I shall read to the House a short extract from the report of the royal commission that was appointed to inquire into the monetary and banking systems of Australia:The Commonwealth Bank . . . can lend to the governments or to others in a variety of ways, and it can even make money available to governments or to others free of any charge. When Mr Justice Napier, the chairman of the commission, was asked to explain that statement, he said that it meant what it said, namely, that the Commonwealth Bank could lend money for the construction of public buildings, &c, and that there would be no need to charge interest or even to repay the principal amount! A few days ago, in this House, as a protest against the parrot cry ""equality of sacrifice"", I suggested that every member should be placed on a soldier's pay of 6s. a day, in addition to keep and clothing. I have since received many complimentary letters, as well as a good deal of criticism. How can there be equality of sacrifice if we occupy easy seats while the soldier boys are enduring rain of hell? Let us be honest, and dispense with hypocrisy. I now make the further suggestion that all the necessaries of life be rationed and issued on the coupon system. If those who are privileged to sit in this national Parliament were to set an example to the men who are giving their lives, there would be no doubt as to the issue. Instead of that, what do we find? In the newspapers, there are protests against the economy plan put forward by the Government, and in this House there are protests against the reduction of the rate of interest to 4 per cent. Why should any interest at all be paid at a time like this? Mr J. A. L. Gunn, chartered accountant, giving evidence before the Parliamentary Committee on Profits, said, "" I am afraid of a curtailment of essential production. Some companies prefer to spend money rather than let the Government get it "" . Yet this is war-time! Before the war started, we were told that our Allies, China and Russia, and our antagonists Germany and Japan, were bankrupt. They have expanded the national credit, and look at what they have - achieved! We have to learn to do likewise. Why should we go cap in hand to the private banks in order to borrow money at 3| per cent., and pay brokerage amounting to 5s. on every £100 raised? The amount of brokerage on the money now being borrowed will total £87,500. Under the National Security Act, we bave complete power over men and women, money and materials; all of tbem belong to the Government in the present fierce struggle to defend our Commonwealth. If any man is instructed to go anywhere, he does not think of objecting, but goes. If we want money, we should not have a discussion as to whether we should pay for it so much per cent., but should take it.",54
226,Mr SPENDER,REPAYMENT OF,Is the honourable member in favour of the bill?,55
227,Mr BAKER,REPAYMENT OF,"Of course I am in favour of it ! But I hope that this will be the last occasion on which we shall vote to borrow money during the progress of this war, and even after its termination. We have complete power over men, money and material, and with them we must win the war. Only a small percentage of our ablest-bodied men can be placed in the firing line. Behind them are the skilled technicians in the shops and factories, who manufacture the lethal weapons of war; and behind those again there is another section of the population producing food. Napoleon said that an army marches on its stomach. Every army fights on its stomach. Discussing tactics, strategy, and so on, a general said to me the other day, ""The first thing is to feed your men, the second is to feed your men, the third is to feed your men. Equip and. train your men, and they will do what you want them to do in order to defend this country."" Has any one ever thought of what would be likely to happen if we were under the domination of the Japanese? I spent half a dozen years in the country around Thursday Island, Normanton, Croydon and Burke town and I can visualize what would happen. The sampans would creep round the coast, the Japanese would land and send out their scouts; there would be a raid on the blacks' camp, following which every female from twelve years upwards would be put on board the lugger. A little later-ove r the side; and the sharks are always hungry in the vicinity of Thursday Island. I lost my wife and two daughters some little time ago, and I say that I would rather them dead than that I should see them fall into the hands of such an enemy. Eor men the triumph of the Japanese would mean opium and dope, mutilation, captivity and murder. For the women it would mean violation, defilement, and captivity, from which there could be only one escape. I want the Australian men and women assembled here today to face this reality, and not bother whether the rate of interest should be 4J per cent, or 4 i per cent. Such considerations are unworthy of us. We must show a better example to our young men. Each of us should be, in the words of BrowningOne who never turned his back but marched breast forward, Never doubted clouds would break, Jfever dreamed, though right were worsted, wrong would triumph. Held we fall to rise, are baffled to fight better, Sleep to wake. I deplore the attack made this afternoon on the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Ward), who, of all honourable members of this House, has outstanding courage and high ability. But, because he dared to say that interest should not in future be paid on money raised to keep Australia from defilement, a massed attack was made upon him. Mr BERNA»D CORSER - Does the honourable member support what the Minister said?",55
228,Mr BAKER,REPAYMENT OF,"I do support it. I am glad that the honourable member asked me that question, because I was omitting to state my position. This money is needed to defend Australia, and it should be taken without any consideration.",55
229,Mr SPENDER,REPAYMENT OF,"The honourable member is still against the bill, and yet proposes to vote for it.",55
230,Mr BAKER,REPAYMENT OF,"I am not against the bill, but I hope this will be the last time that a Labour government will go cap in hand to the banks for a loan. We are, in effect, seeking to borrow what belongs rightly to us. One honourable member asked what the people would think if they heard what the Minister for Labour and National Service had said. He represents a large proportion of public opinion. In a letter which, came to me this afternoon, one citizen expressed what he thinks of the Government of which that Minister is a memberCongratulate the Government on the wonderful effort they are putting up to keep Australia free from war. I never met Eddie Ward, but I sure would like to. This is what Sir Stafford Oripps said recently about AustraliaAustralia's splendid response to the Pacific situation was an inspiration to the rest of the Empire, which should double its war effort and give Australia further assistance.",55
231,Mr CURTIN,REPAYMENT OF,"Fremantle - Prime Minister) [9.34] - The policy of the Government in respect of loans is that every condition set out in the prospectus will be completely honoured by the Government. We regard the prospectus as a contract between the Government, as the organized national entity, and its citizens. Whatever the prospectus sets out is the condition upon which the Government invites the public to subscribe to the loan. That is the guarantee which the people have as to the rights of investors in the loan. That is the obligation, without any quibble or reservation, which this Government completely accepts, and will completely discharge.",56
232,Mr CHIFLEY,REPAYMENT OF,"Macquarie - Treasurer) [9.35] - in reply- I had hoped that this bill would go through without my having to make a speech in reply, but it is necessary that I should say that some honourable members today have not shown an edifying or inspiring example to the people.",56
233,Mr FRANCIS,REPAYMENT OF,Neithe r did the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr Ward).,56
234,Mr CHIFLEY,REPAYMENT OF,"This is an ordinary bill of the kind which Parliament frequently passes in order to authorize the raising and spending of money. It does not specify how the money is to be raised. It might be as a part of an ordinary loan flotation on the market, or it might be by short-term loan from the Commonwealth Bank. Some of the speeches made today were no more than political posturing and, indeed, some of them contained a large measure of piffle. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Fadden) has been very generous and decent in his treatment of the subjects brought before the House, and some constructive criticism was offered by the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Spooner) and the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Jolly); but several of the speeches this afternoon were apparently delivered only for the purpose of gaining publicity or some political advantage. The Leader of the Opposition himself was forced into the position of expressing, on behalf of some disgruntled members of his own party, sentiments which he does not entirely endorse. Whatever the reason, we have been treated to an exchange of 'recriminations. It is all very well to say that the attack upon the Minister for Labour and National Service was not premeditated. Before the House met, the corridors were buzzing with talk of what was going to be said about the Minister. What is the position in regard to his statement? Honourable members opposite accept newspaper statements only when they suit them. In this instance, a newspaper reported the honourable gentleman as having made a certain statement, and he was attacked this afternoon before he was given .an opportunity to make an explanation in this House, which is the proper place in which to do so. Even after he had denied the statements attributed to him, honourable members opposite went on saying exactly the same things as they had said before he made thedenial. At a time when the country is in a critical position, an afternoon has been devoted to an exchange of recriminations. If members of the Opposition had not begun this tirade of abuse, we should not have been treated to this exhibition, but they could not resist seeking a political advantage on the strength of some remarks reported in the press, whether accurately or not. Having embarked upon the attack, they found thai the Minister for Labour and National Service was able to play the game better than they could. They found that he is quite as good at personal recrimination as they are. The whole incident rather reflects upon the political judgment of the Opposition. The right honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Menzies) challenged the Prime Minister to state the policy of the Government in regard to loans. Well, the Prime Minister has made a statement, and if he had not. done so, I should have felt quite confident to do it on his behalf. The Government is an honourable one, composed of honest men, and when it says that interest will be paid on money borrowed, it will keep its promise, just as honest men do. Although there is difference of opinion on the subject of the payment of interest, there is not one man on this side of the House who would say that this Government should be a party bo the repudiation of one pennyworth of interest or principal in respect of commitments entered into by this or any previous Government. If honourable members opposite wanted to damage the prospects of the loan, they could not have gone a better way about it than by voicing these inferences and innuendoes. The best answer I can give to the suggestion that anything which has been done by a member of the Government has damaged the prospects of the loan, is that there were 8,500 applications in respect of the loan today, and three out of every four were from people who were investing less than £200. Just before dinner the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Harrison), when most of the members of his own party had left the chamber, delivered a violent speech calling upon the Prime Minister to answer this charge and that. He spoke as if the Prime Minister, whose job at this time is in his office, should be present to answer every challenge which he and other honourable members opposite choose to throw out in order to obtain a little personal publicity. The Leader of the Opposition, in discussing the financial administration of the Government, referred to the short-term indebtedness. When right honourable member for Kooyong was Prime Minister, and the present Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer, there were times when loans were not fully subscribed, but they did not shout from the housetops that bank credit was being used to make up the difference. I have heard from this side of the House talk of the Government Mr Chifley. begging the private banks to subscribe to the loan. People who speak in that fashion do not know what they are talking about. This Government has not gone begging to the private banks. 3 can assure honourable members that the private banks have been very small contributors to the previous cash loan, or to this one. That is no reflection on their patriotism, or on their desire to help. It is due to the fact that the regulations under which they operate do not leave them any surplus which they can invest in loans, and require tliem to obtain the permission of the Commonwealth Bank before subscribing.",56
235,Mr ANTHONY,REPAYMENT OF,"They are actually putting in money at a nominal rate of interest. Mr .CHIFLEY - The surplus assets which come into their hands as a result of the expansion of credit are being put into a. special deposit account, which carries a rate of interest that only just covers administrative expenses. We have been warned of the dangers of inflation. Is there any man in this House foolish enough to think that our present rate of expenditure, which could not be anticipated six months ago, when different circumstances obtained, can be met out of taxation? Certainly it cannot, no matter what rate of taxation be imposed. When it is said that the deficit should be met from loans, I reply that the Prime Minister and I consulted with those persons who are supposed to know what the public can lend, and the loans that are now being put on the market, and those that will be floated in the future, are based upon their reports. Regarding the financing of the war, the Government in a period of three months imposed additional taxes estimated to the yield £50,000,000 per annum. Does any honourable member venture to assert that that is not a genuine attempt to - make the nation pay as far as possible for the war? Even if the previous Government had remained in office, it could not have carried on without the assistance of bank loans. It would be nonsense to say otherwise. Whilst I agree with the statements of the Leader of the Opposition. regarding the dangers of inflation, I remind him that the Government has taken almost every step, with the exception of that mentioned by the honourable member for Robertson (Mr. Spooner), in order to safeguard against it. The honourable member advocated the introduction of individual rationing in the community. When a government is utilizing bank credit up to the point where all of the national resources are involved and all man-power is engaged, it can no longer, with safety, expand credit. It has virtually reached the end of its tether in that respect. But these times are not normal; they are extraordinary. When a government has utilized bank credit beyond that point, it must impose stiff control so that the inflation which we fear will not occur. I challenge any one r.o 9ay that the Government has not introduced safe measures of control. Differences of opinion may exist about the incidence of taxation, but people often talk very loosely about financing the war from taxation. When I introduced the budget last year, I spent a busy time replying to requests by honourable members on both sides of the chamber for the exemption of certain articles from the sales tax, or for a reduction of the wartime (company) tax, because it would destroy the incentive of many businesses to contribute to a maximum war effort. Incidentally, these references to "" incentive "" are a reflection on a number of people engaged in industry. Some honourable members opposite have declared that unless companies can make ample profits, they have no incentive to expand production for the purpose of assisting in the conduct of the war. That is a reflection upon the patriotism of a number of people who accord their political support to the United Australia party and the United Country party. The constant references to inflation during this debate were made purely for political purposes. If Australia's war effort continues to expand, the expenditure which today is regarded by some as evidence of inflation will doubtless seem comparatively small. We must keep our feet on the ground, and realise that, because, the situation is abnormal, we must dn unusual things. Those unusual things may have bad consequences if we fail to exercise proper economic control. The Government is endeavouring, to the best of its ability, to provide that measure of control, and I think that its efforts have met with reasonable success. In making that statement. I do not overlook or discredit the measures that were taken by previous governments in this connection. When the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Spender) was Treasurer, he introduced a number of measures which were very creditable to him, in order to effect control in certain directions. I do not for one moment claim that this Government alone possesses a broad national outlook. I realise that we all are engaged in this fight and I hope that we all have the same objective. But our democracy does not receive a very good advertisement when the representatives of the people in Parliament engage in violent recriminations, and give emphasis to material that might, create a false impression. For some hours, this House has listened to unfortunate personal inveotive. In attempts to bolster up a case against a Minister, extracts have heen quoted from speeches that were delivered fifteen years ago. My only pleasure this afternoon arose from the fact that some one did not quote from past speeches by the right honourable member for North Sydney (Mr. Hughes), because there would have been such a mass of contradiction that every one would have been bewildered. I am in no dilemma regarding the position of the Government. An honest man has only to say, as the representative of an honest government, that we shall see that the prospectus which we issue is kept as regards the payment of interest and the repayment of principal. If later we are again in opposition, we shall try to see that, the promise is kept. No supporter of the Government would say that he does not agree fully with that undertaking. Some difference of opinion might exist about the rate of interest that is payable on these loans. Some honourable members on this side of the chamber might consider that the rate should be i per cent.; others might favour 1 per cent, or l i per cent. Still others may believe that no interest at all should be paid. Before today, people have considered that interest was an undesirable feature in the life of a community. Every one is entitled to his opinion, even if that opinion be that interest should be nominal, and should cover only the cost of administration. But if the Government and the majority of the members of the Labour party decide that, as a matter of policy, the Government should offer interest at 3 per cent., every member of the party will abide loyally by that decision. Even if one does not personally agree with it, that does not mean that he favours repudiation and confiscation. All such talk is a mere invention of the Opposition, despite this critical period in our history. Honourable members opposite expressed their horror that the confidence of investors should be destroyed, but many of the speeches that they delivered this afternoon were calculated to arouse serious misgivings among the public. Personally, I do not think that the people believe them; otherwise, there would not have been 8,500 applicants for the loan today. I have participated in this debate only for the purpose of replying to loose talk about inflation and the necessity for adequate control. I deprecate many of the utterances that have been made today, I was delighted to hear two constructive suggestions by the honourable member for Robertson and the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Jolly). The honourable member for Robertson advocated the introduction of rationing, the necessity for which I do not dispute. I realise the possibilities, and the action that might have to be taken to deal with the position. The honourable member for Lilley replied most effectively to the contention that interest should not be paid on loans. As an illustration, he said that one man might save £1,000, which he would invest in the purchase of a house or business that would return to him 3 per cent., 4 per cent, or 5 per cent, per annum. Another man, by working extremely hard, might save £1,000, which he proceeds to lend to his country for the purpose of conducting the war. Some persons contend that he should not be paid any interest upon his investment, but the honourable member for Lilley showed that that man is just as entitled to some Mr Chifley. reward for his thrift and for his patriotism in lending his savings to the Government for the purpose of defending the country as is the other man who invested his money in property. That is getting down to cold hard facts. All the other talk in the debate was loose, largely because it did not deal with realities. Unfortunately, there was a premeditated decision to launch an attack upon the Minister for Labour and National Service.",57
236,Mr HOLT,REPAYMENT OF,That is not true.,59
237,Mr CHIFLEY,REPAYMENT OF,"First , the question was asked as to whether the published statement by the Minister was accurate. Even after the honourable gentleman had denied the accuracy of the published statement, the debate continued. That convinced me that some honourable members opposite were determined to attack the Minister. His denial mattered nothing to them. Whilst I realise that we are engaged in politics, I warn honourable members opposite that we can overdo politics at the present time. The, responsibility for the recriminations that have taken place today rests with the Opposition, because it launched this attack. Honourable members opposite could have asked the Minister at question-time whether he had made that statement, and the Minister could have given his explanation. If the Opposition did not believe him, it would have regarded him as a liar. If it did believe him, there would be nothing more to be said on the subject. Certainly there was no necessity for introducing side issues and implying that some Ministers were not in favour of meeting, not the Government's obligations, but the nation's obligations. Those statements brought no credit to this Parliament. Perhaps we all are at fault; but honourable members should not forget that in the life of a democracy it is important that the public should have respect, not necessarily for a party, but for the Parliament. Everything that we do to destroy that respect deals a deathblow at democracy itself. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time and passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate.

In respect of Excise Item 2 (N ) and its counterpart Customs Tariff Item 3 (F ) , which relate to methylated spirits, the by-Jaw proviso in each case previously read "" for power purposes as prescribed by Departmental By-laws "". On this wording relief from duty could only be given in instances of methylated spirits being used for power purposes, but it ha? been demonstrated that certain other users of methylated spirits can present reasonable claims for by-law concession. For instance, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research has introduced a new method of shrinking wool, involving the use of methylated spirits. Accordingly, the restrictive incidence of both the Customs and Excise By-law Items has been removed. With regard to Excise Tariff Item 11 (c ) as it is at present worded, some doubt' exists amongst technical people as to whether certain types of petrol substitutes are dutiable under the item, as was originally intended. The wording of Item 11 (c ) has been so amended as to leave no doubt that such petrol substitutes are classifiable thereunder. The Metropolitan Gas Company of Melbourne has introduced a form of coal-gas as a distillate. It is felt that it should be in cluded in the dutiable range. There are no other alterations. The Government regrets that the opportunity ro discuss these tariff proposals has not presented itself. It appreciates the importance of a full discussion, but I hope that the Opposition will bear with the Government and validate these items in order that another opportunity may IKS given to the House for discussion.

243,Mr MAKIN,CITYMUTUALLIFE ASSURANCE SOCIETY,"Hindmarsh-Minister for Munitions) [10.3] - On the 25th February, the honourable member for Reid (Mr Morgan) asked me a question regarding the cost-plus scheme which had been in operation in connection with of the machine tool production. On that occatbe sion I informed the honourable member that I would make the necessary investithe gation and supply a full statement. I now infor m him that, following upon investigations made recently by the Minister assisting the Treasurer to (Mr Lazzarini) into profits said to will have been made by certain munil l tions contractors or annexe proprietors set as the result of costs allowed for the - operation of machine tools, the property the Commonwealth and leased by them, I have approved of changes in the costing system which should remove certain possibilities of exploitation of profits. Generally, the changes will eliminate the making of any profit whatsoever in respect of machine tools hired from the Commonwealth. I would add that the investigations hy the Minister assisting the Treasurer and inquiries instituted by myself have revealed that there were in fact a certain number of munitions contractors who were obtaining undue profits. Very largely this arose through opportunities for charging man-hour rates calculated on a skilled labour basis, whereas in some cases wages paid were for semi-skilled or process workers operating the machines. The investigations are proceeding and, whilst the transactions of a number of firms have been examined, there are others requiring further investigation. Until the investigations have been completed, it will not be possible to answer questions as to the undue profits which may have been made and the amounts of refund which should be demanded. The machine hour rates have now been fixed, as from the 1st January, as follows: (1) There will be an allowance of 5s. for each hour worked to be divided into two parts, 3s. repreand senting wages, and 2s. overhead charges. If the wages actually paid be more or less than 33. an hour, the rate will be adjusted up or down accordingly. (2) The amount to be allowed to the contractor for depreciation of the machine tools will be limited to the rental actually paid by him. It will therefore be impossible for him to make any profit out of the rental. (3) These modifications in the allowance and rental apply to all deliveries of machine and tool equipment made on and after the 1st January, 1942, irrespective of the date on which the order was placed. This will not penalize employers who have not abused the rate by the employment of unskilled or junior labour, but will enable the department to deal with contractors who have done so.",78
244,Mr SPENDER,CITYMUTUALLIFE ASSURANCE SOCIETY,"Warringah) [10.10]. - I think honourable members will agree that the sole purpose of censorship is to preserve the security of the country, and, unless censorship can be justified on the grounds of internal security, it has no place in a democratic system. Indeed, I remember bhat when the present Opposition was in office, certain members of the present Government very rightly indicated in general terms that censorship should be used only for that purpose. I asked the Prime Minister (Mr Curtin) last week whether he would lay upon the table of the House all written instructions to newspapers or broadcasting companies, censoring or giving instructions for censorship of any particular matter, so that private members of this House, as custodians of, the rights of the people, might know that these instructions were solely directed to security and to no other purpose. I further suggested to the Prime Minister that, if he was not prepared to do that, he should suggest means by which private members could have some say as to what should or should not be censored, so that they would be watchdogs of democracy to see that censorship was used for its proper purpose. I have had some experience in respect of security I know that censorship instructions cannot be made public, because to make them so would be to defeat one of the purposes for which censorship is instituted. But it seems to me that members of this House are entitled to know those instructions, and the mere tabling of them should not mean that they would be available for publication in the newspapers. In fact the press has them now, a and private members have no access to them at all. I see no reason why they should not have the right of access to all instructions which go to newspapers and broadcasting companies indicating what should or should not be reported or spoken about.",79
245,Mr CURTIN,CITYMUTUALLIFE ASSURANCE SOCIETY,The honourable member has discovered this right since ceasing to be a Minister.,79
246,Mr SPENDER,CITYMUTUALLIFE ASSURANCE SOCIETY,"No . I ask the Prime Minister to permit me to develop my argument. I do not wish to be controversial. I am concerned solely with the fundamental rights of democracy. The Prime Minister was approached with respect to this matter in the Advisory War Council, with the result that it was made possible to every one of the council to go to the Chief Publicity Censor and have the various instructions made available to him. So I am not quarrelling with the access given to representatives of the Opposition on the council, but I am directing my attention to this matter, because I have reason to believe that censorship instructions are not always concerned with national security. The first matter I desire to mention is the resignation of Mr Rorke, the Deputy Censor in New South Wales. Lie was a censor of some ability and had experience in the last war. I think £ am correct in saying he was a censor in New South Wales up to two or three weeks ago, when he resigned. What is behind the resignation I cannot speak about, but I do desire to have an answer lo this question: Is it a fact that Mr. Rorke submitted to the newspapers an explanation of his side of the question and chat its publication was prohibited by the Censor ? If so, on what grounds ? This vital matter. It seems extraordinary that a man who was a censor in this country during the last war, and has been a censor for two years during this war, should have been precluded-if I am correctly informed-fro m expressing his view as to the grounds for the resignation which was finally forced upon him.",79
247,Mr HARRISON,CITYMUTUALLIFE ASSURANCE SOCIETY,That is not censorship; it is suppression.,80
248,Mr SPENDER,CITYMUTUALLIFE ASSURANCE SOCIETY,"At any rate, it was a matter which should concern private members on both sides of the House. If it bo, as suggested to me, that Mr Rorke took exception two months ago to censorship instructions given to him on the ground that they had nothing to do with security matters, but were designed to prevent political criticism, and if , that time onwards, his position became untenable to him, so that, finally, he had no alternative but to resign, the House should demand an inquiry. I am not dealing at the moment with the merits of the case. I desire to know specifically whether a censorship instruction was issued to make any explanation by Mr. Rorke subject to censorship, and if, in fact, all of his statement but two or three lines was suppressed. The question is whether a democratic government, in a time of war, is taking steps to prevent [7] complete freedom of criticism of what is being done. I ask the Prime Minister to give me an answer to my questions either this evening or as early as possible. Another matter touching the censorship in relation to the Australian Broadcasting Commission has caused me concern. In the Senate the Minister for Information (Senator Ashley) was asked whether instructions had been given to the commission which in effect directed the commission how it should express itself. I now ask the Prime Minister, specifically, whether it is a fact that instructions were given, either directly or indirectly, by Ministers, to the Australian Broadcasting Commission, first, that there should be uo reference to Mr Churchill in the overseas broadcasts; secondly, that there should be no reference to the totality of the war, that is, that the Pacific war was part and parcel of a total war; and, thirdly, that there is a was to be nothing broadcast to detract from the proposition that the main and vital centre of the war at present was the Pacific?",80
249,Mr EALSTEIN,CITYMUTUALLIFE ASSURANCE SOCIETY,Why does not the honourable member ask his questions during question time?,80
250,Mr SPENDER,CITYMUTUALLIFE ASSURANCE SOCIETY,"I am not in the habit of asking many questions, and this is the first time that I have spoken on the motion for the adjournment of the House; but these are vital matters. I do not make any challenge in respect of the merits of the third question. I am asking these specific questions because a general question was asked of the Minister for Information who, in his reply, stated in a general way that no instruction had been given at any time as to how the Australian Broadcasting Comfrom mission should conduct its commentaries or its announcements. There was a further statement that an instruction had been given by the previous Government to prevent political criticism. I wish to dissociate myself from any direction of that kind to the Australian Broadcasting Commission.",80
251,Mr CURTIN,CITYMUTUALLIFE ASSURANCE SOCIETY,Did the honourable gentleman say that the Minister for Information had said that no such instructions were given?,80
252,Mr SPENDER,CITYMUTUALLIFE ASSURANCE SOCIETY,"The Minister was asked a general question and he gave a general reply. I am asking a specific question, but I propose to go farther. I such aswish to have tabled in the House any written instructions issued to the Ausand tralian Broadcasting Commission, or, methods what is more important, any written conand firmation from the Australian Broadcasting Commission of verbal instructions given to it. Such a letter would be most important.",80
253,Mr CUBTJK,CITYMUTUALLIFE ASSURANCE SOCIETY,Goin g back for how this. long?,81
254,Mr SPENDER,CITYMUTUALLIFE ASSURANCE SOCIETY,"I do not care how considerable far back the matter is taken, but been I particularly desire that the last three or four months shall be covered. I have reason to believe that confirmation has been received from the commission of claims r ertain verbal instructions.",81
255,Mr CUKTIH,CITYMUTUALLIFE ASSURANCE SOCIETY,"The previous Governfight in a new way. ment did not have to issue any instrucThat tions, because it saw that, from its point of view, the right men were appointed to the commission.",81
256,Mr SPENDER,CITYMUTUALLIFE ASSURANCE SOCIETY,"The same men have [Extension been in office since this Government has as follows:been in power. However, I do not wish to introduce any provocative matter into miners' the debate. It should be a simple matter to check whether instructions have been issued in writing or whether written firmation has been received from the comtheir mission of any verbal instructions. The last matter to which I shall refer relates to certain industrial disturbances sentatives in recent months. The House is entitled concentrated to know what instructions have been issued in respect of broadcasting comdistrict mentaries or announcements in relation dropping to industrial disturbances. I particular to a controversy involving the Moulders Union about Anniversary Day. that There was an argument as to whether the moulders should work on that day. In of fact, they did not work. I am not conCause, cerned at the moment as to whether they should or should not have worked. I am concerned with the refusal of the censors members:to allow certain statements to be published in the press concerning these matters. Another matter will give point to my argument. In Common Cause of the the censor continued2Sth February, a newspaper published by the Australian Coal and Shale EmWells' ployees Federation there was an article which contained a number of statements We have not forgone the right to strike, where the issue is a real one uud othei fail we w i ll still agree to strike, but on!}' after ful l consideration of the issueafter attempts to use other methods fail. Nor do we agree that conditions and wage should remain static. We have during the past week submitted several important claim; to the Central .Reference Board, and we arc confident that real gains will accrue from These claims are not very great, but they will result, provided we are successful, in gains to our members. There are too, quite a lot of other claims that have listed since Inst August. Some of these have already been dealt with by local boardand others are listed. We have reserved the right to bring any or all of the remaining before the local boards when we think best, so what our programme really means in practice is that we really fight, but that we article means that the miners intend to retain the right to strike, irrespectivtof conciliation or arbitration. As a reply to that article, another article was submitted to the censorship authorities. of time granted.] It reads It will be remembered that recently the representatives told the Central Coal Reference Board that they had modified their original claims and were submitting in their conplace eight major items. They said that aim, in view of the critical situation facing the country, was to level up present conditions of work. At the time the colliery proprietors' repre on the board stated that in effect the miners had dropped nothing and had everything in eight claims, leaving other matters to be dealt with by boards. Mr J. Johnson said, "" I can only say that the statement that you are all but one or two points was made refer in for propaganda purposes "". All along I have given it as my impression the miners are using the present national situation to force improved conditions and increased wages at the expense of the rest the working community, and in Common dated the 2Sth February, the president of the Miners Federation, Mr Harold Wells, makes the following statement to federation Then followed the extract from the article in Common Cause which I have already read. The article in reply submitted to I would draw particular attention to Mr . statement that the Miners Federation does not agree that ""conditions and wages should remain static"". In view of the Primp Minister's statement that "" wages and conditions were to be pegged for the duration of the war"", I think that the public is entitled to know whether Mr Curtin's or Mr. Wells' policy is to be carried into effect. The article was signed by the secretary of the Northern Collieries Limited, Mr. Gregory Forster. I should like to know what possible objection could have been taken to the publication of that article? Yet it was rejected by the State censorship authorities. If we are reduced to this kind of thing, I say to the Prime Minister, with great respect, that there is more than a little ground for the suspicion that the censorship is being used in this country for other than legitimate censorship purposes. I do not desire to make a provocative speech, but if the facts are as I have said, I ask that the whole question be remitted to a committee representative of private members on both sides of the House. Speaking as a member of the Advisory War Council, I , of course, have had an opportunity to see the instructions that have been issued, but in a democracy it is not too much to ask that, as the newspaper authorities are allowed to see copies of instructions, it should be permissible for private members of the Parliament also to see them. In this way they can determine whether our democracy is being preserved, or whether criticism is being stifled for ulterior purposes.",81
257,Mr SHEEHAN,CITYMUTUALLIFE ASSURANCE SOCIETY,"Cook) [10.28] - 1 too wish to make a reference to the preservers of democracy. I bring to the notice of the Prime Minister certain difficulties concerning the call-up of men for the Militia, and the volunteering of men for the Australian Imperial Force. Some time ago it was proposed that a rent allowance should be granted to soldiers in the forces, but the matter seems to have dropped out of sight. Many married men are now being called up for definite service, but no provision has been made for a rent allowance for them. Some of the men have been in receipt of high salaries or wages, but have had to enter camp under financial conditions which, unless remedied, will destroy their home life and make it impossible for them to provide educational facilities for their children. Men who have been paying fairly high rents to landlords, or are meeting substantial instalments on the purchase of their own homes, or have certain commitments in regard to hire-purchase agreements, are receiving, as members of the forces, such a small remuneration that it is impossible for them to meet their various obligations. Family life is the rock on which this nation stands, and if it should be submerged, our democracy will not be preserved. The Government, in my view, is not meeting its responsibilities to the men who are being called up, and I ask the Prime Minister to give' this matter his immediate attention with the object of providing the proposed rent allowance.",82
258,Mr ANTHONY,CITYMUTUALLIFE ASSURANCE SOCIETY,"Richmond) [10.30]. - I direct the attention of the Prime Minister (Mr Curtin) and the appropriate Minister to the lack of preparation to meet air raids in the Australian Capital Territory. Since Darwin was bombed and the first impact of war on Australia was felt a fortnight ago, on« would expect that a Government with its head-quarters in the capital city of Australia would have taken the necessary precautions in order to ensure that, in the event of an air raid, the administrative facilities would not be impaired to any appreciable extent. So far as I have been able to learn, however, the Government has continued to operate as though Japan had not struck, and on the assumption that this city is inviolate, instead of being, as it is, only 80 or 90 miles from the sea-coast, off which bombers could be launched from an aircraft carrier and be engaged in a raid here within about 50 minutes. Important though the provision of shelters may be, it is, perhaps, of minor importance compared with the security of the documents of the Commonwealth. So far as I have been able to ascertain, not one thing has so far been done in order to preserve the very important documents in the various administrative quarters. Photostats have not been taken, a3 they have been by banking institutions and business firms, and sent for security inland, far from the coast-line. The Government is in a state of hopeful bliss, evidently believing that we may escape the impact of attack by the enemy. It has the duty and the responsibility of attempting to safeguard the administrative machinery, so that, in the event of a bomb falling on a secretariat or on Parliament House, there will not he complete disorganization of th'i nation's services. Such a contingency is not at all unlikely. I suggest that the Government take time by the forelock, and act immediately in order to see that at least the important documents, without which it would be extremely difficult to carry on the Government, shall be placed in such a position that there will be no possibility of their destruction by aircraft, or that duplicates of them shall be made. Throughout Parliament House today, the doors were plastered with notices stating that, in the event of an air raid, those who are in the building shall leave Parliament House and "" take to the bush "". What a nice picture would be presented by the Prime Minister and the whole of the Cabinet seeking shelter under rose bushes in the parliamentary gardens! That is the only place in which they could shelter. In this matter, I am not looking for any publicity. The whole of my remarks can be censored, if that be thought necessary. It is a fact that no provision has been made for the safety of the Administration, the staff, or any member of Parliament. So far as I have been able to see, no provision has been made for the safety of any of the residents of Canberra. I have not seen a single trench. If it exists, it must be in a back garden. Who is responsible for that? To-day, I asked the Minister for Home Security (Mr Lazzarini) a question on the subject. I assumed that he was charged with responsibility for home security, but he very politely replied that such responsibility is vested in the Department of the Interior. Probably the Minister for the Interior (Senator Collings), if he were asked to comment, would tell us something else. The fact is that the enemy bombed Darwin a fortnight ago. Goodness knows when a bombing attack may he made, not only in this Territory, but also on points on the eastern sea-board. We have to remember that we are only 90 miles from where an aircraft carrier may be waiting to launch an attack upon us. I submit to the Prime Minister, the Minister for Home Security, and other Mr Anthony. Ministers, that the matter is one which affects not only the persona i safety of members of this Parliament, but also the positions that they hold in the parliamentary machinery for the government of Australia in its hour of crisis. The Government has the responsibility of seeing that adequate measures are taken., not only for the preservation of records, but also for the safety of the members of"" this Parliament and the residents of Canberra. If a similar state of affairs existed in Sydney or Melbourne, I could direct my criticism at the State authorities. In this Capital Territory, no one is responsible except the federal authorities. The position needs to be remedied very quickly by whoever is responsible, because the enemy does not give more than a few minutes' notice of his intention to attack. The longest notice that could be given of a bombing attack on this city would probably be 50 minutes, if the enemy were lying off the coast. I therefore urge the Prime Minister to take whatever steps are necessary to meet the position.",82
259,Mr MORGAN,CITYMUTUALLIFE ASSURANCE SOCIETY,"Reid) [10.37] - I appreciate the statement that has been made in regard to machine tools by the Minister for Munitions (Mr Makin), but am disappointed with the meagre details that it contains. This matter was first raised by me and by other honourable members particularly the honourable member for Dalley (Mr Rosevear) over three months ago. Inquiry into it has been made by three departments. Cost investigators of the Munitions Department have investigated it fully, and could have placed all of the details before the Minister. The Department of Home Security also has been conducting an inquiry since December last, when a special investigation was instituted; and on behalf of the Parliamentary Committee on War Expenditure, experts have been engaged on it for some considerable time. That committee has presented reports dealing with specific details, and showing that in certain instances the profits have been higher than 60 per cent. The comment of the experts is that some of the profits have been fantastic. These details are available, and should be placed before the House at the earliest possible moment, particularly as the gentleman who instituted the system is still in charge of machine tool production. While inquiries are being conducted he is, in effect, under a cloud. There is considerable disquiet in the whole of the munitions industry in regard to the supply of machine tools, and particularly the activities of the director and his associates in connection with machine tool production. This is one of the greatest bottlenecks in our war effort. It is holding up production, and causing a complete sense of frustration among, not only the workers, but also many of the manufacturers. I hope that the Minister will see that no facts are suppressed, and will issue definite instructions for a full disclosure to be made to him in order that he may make a report to the House as .'-arly as possible and thus enable the tion to be cleaned up. I am perfectly satisfied that when the facts become known this House wall consent to the setting up of a select committee, or even a royal commission, to investigate the control of machine tools and the activities of those who are concerned in their production. Several weeks ago, a dispute occurred at the Aircraft Factory, Lidcombe, as the result of which certain men were dismissed. They were members of a product-ion committee which had been set up in the industry in order to deal with inefficiency and production lag in that particular aircraft undertaking. When suggestions were proffered to the management with the object of rectifying certain matters that had come under their notice, the leaders were dismissed and other members of the committee were disrated. Many men on wages amounting to £10, £1.2 and £14 a week were being kept in a uate of idleness, contrary to their own wishes. They thought that it was high time for the matter to be dealt with properly, consequently they set up a production committee and placed their views before the management. A meeting to discuss the position following upon the dismissals was held during one lunch hour when the greater part of the works was idle. The meeting lasted a. little longer than was expected, and when the men endeavoured to return to work over 100 of them were locked out, and remained so for some days. The employers contended that they were on strike. Eight of the men received a telegram notifying them that they had been dismissed from their employment. Meetings were held at the Trades iHall - As the local member, I appealed to the men to return to work. I had received a notification from the Minister for Aircraft Production stating that the whole of the allegations made in the dispute would be inquired into, and that the mens charges would be fully sifted. On that specific undertaking, the men returned to their employment. The Minister has made statements which fully vindicate - the attitude adopted .by the men, whose names have been besmirched and who have been under a cloud.. On a Saturday night only a few weeks ago> I heard the Minister posi- state over the air that ultimately the action of the men would be found to be fully jtistified. Ho went on to say that the greed and selfishness of certain interests with an un-Australian outlook had been holding up aircraft production in Australia. He followed that with a statement which was published in the press only a few days ago, in which he saidDelays in production had occurred. These delays had been caused by(1) Government variation of production schedule; (2) Domination of the industry by private interests. In Sydney, there had been delays because key men were removed from high posts when their opinion did not correspond with the opinion of others. That our aircraft production industry could not afford to lose even one capable man meant nothing, apparently. Lower down the ladder, workers were charged with being f if t h columnists because they got restless and expressed their displeasure as trade unionists. I had to intervene. That was a public vindication of the men. The Prime Minister has called for a special report from the Leader of the Opposition, who is acquainted with the facts, having inquired as to the reason why a high American expert had left his employment and returned to America. These facts being in the possession of the Government, and the specific promise having been made that there would be an inquiry into the allegations of the men, the charges should be fully investigated, and the men should be given an opportunity to vindicate their attitude. The Clyde Engineering Company Limited at Granville employs 1,700 men. The War Expenditure Committee has inquired into the position at the works. It has obtained first-hand information, and has brought in reports which clearly show that the industry is not being used to its full productive capacity, as it cannot obtain the requisite war orders from the Munitions Department in Melbourne. Although it is an industry that the Board of Area Management in Sydney, under the chairmanship of Sir Phillip Goldfinch, stated should be used to full capacity, it is not getting the orders to which it is entitled. It was producing trench mortars at the rate of 70 each week, and the number could have been increased to 100. Suddenly the orders were stopped because the Army authorities stated that they had enough mortars. Surely, however, this cannot be true, now that so many troops are coming to this country. It would be better to have the work done here than to have the mortars made in Uie United States of America and shipped here, with all the risks attendant upon the voyage. These works have produced the largest locomotives made in Australia, and also the greatest crane, which was to the order of Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited for installation at Whyalla. The men say that they could produce tanks, if need be. I know that the Prime Minister (Mr. Curtin) has intervened in the matter, but so far no satisfaction has been obtained. To-day, I raised with the Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr. Ward) the subject of production committees in a number of industries. I desire to bring under the notice of honourable members the following report, published in the Sydney Morning Herald, dealing with what has been done in this way in the United States of AmericaNA - ROOSEVELT' S ORDER-PRODUCTIO N DRIVE. Mr Donald Nelson, United States War Production Chief, has issued a call for the greatest production job in history. He demands from his "" soldiers of production ""-to use his own term-in the next ten months: (1) an increase of 25 per cent. Mr 31orgov. in general output; (2) work in machine tool factories 24 hours a day-seve n days a week; and (3) the establishment of joint management aud labour committees to ensure that output is pushed up beyond President Roosevelt's previously announced goal for this year, namely, 00,000 planes, 45,000 tanks, 20,000 anti-aircnuft guns, and 3,000,000 tons of merchant shipping. Mr Nelson promises special awards for workers whose plants turn out a surplus. This policy has also been adopted in Great Britain, as the following report shows:BRITAIN'S WAR OUTPUT-RUSSIA N CRITICISM . London, 26th January (A.A.P.). Speaking at the trade union conference, the leader of the Russian delegation, M. Shvernik, declared that Britain was going well, but production was not ideal. There were unused reserves which, if mobilized, would considerably increase the output of tanks, aircraft, and munitions. These reserves should be mobilized, and the sooner the better. "" We saw production at its highest where shop stewards were giving the closest attention to it "", he added. SHOP COMMITTEES. Mr Conley, who visited Moscow last autumn, described this as the first big move in working out the establishment of an Anglo-Soviet Union Committee. He said it was applicable to the whole trades union movement and that the views had been represented to Cabinet. He declared: "" There is abundant evidence that production is held up owing to the stiffnecked, idiotic attitude of managerial control. On the other hand, there are enlightened managements in many - workshops where shop committees are operating. As a result of idea? tried out. production has increased.** That is an example of the practical application of the scheme. Such committees are already existent in several industries in Australia, and in some instances are working in complete harmony with tire management, thus making for increased production. In certain other industries, chiefly those of a monopolistic kind, their presence is regarded with some hostility, perhaps out of a fear that the workers may assume too great an interest in industry and eventually demand a share of the profits. Within the last few days, members of a shop committee from the Howard Auto Cultivators Limited, which employs 750 men, visited Canberra to interview Ministers because they considered that the industry was not working to full capacity. Before that, they had been to Melbourne to interview departmental 0 aicers. Such men deserve to receive official recognition. We have been told that the men in the fighting services have been let down because of lack of equipment. The encouragement of these committees would he one way to ensure the production of increased quantities of equipment.",83
260,Mr FALSTEIN,RE ORGANIZING UNITED STATES ARMY,"Watson) [10.48] From time to time since I have been a member of this Parliament, I have drawn attention to the fact that the activities lite assurance companies have been passed over by successive governments without proper regulation. Whereas the present Government has gazetted regulations controlling banking, nothing has been done to regulate these other financial institutions which play an important part in the life of the community, and which make large contributions to government loans. 1 propose to cite a case so shameful that it merits the serious consideration of the Government. It may be considered advisable to bring in legislation to control life assurance companies and their activities, with particular reference to the relationship of master and servant, so that persons who peddle life assurance for the companies may he assured of the benefits of workers' compensation. This is the case of a gentleman named Walter Rothwell Archibald, who shared in the Archibald estate. He contracted with the City Mutual Life Assurance Society of Sydney to borrow money on his interest under a will. Altogether, a sum exceeding £3,000 was lent up to the time when Archibald found it necessary to assign absolutely to the assurance company his interest under the will. The assurance company's solicitors were not satisfied that his interest was a vested interest at the time the assignment was made. Therefore, in order to make sure that his interest was not contingent upon his aged mother predeceasing him, it was suggested by the company, and agreed to by Archibald, that he enter into a contract with the company in the amount of .£5,000 against the contingency of his dying before his mother. In consideration of this assurance of £5,000, which was a nonprofit assurance, be was to pay to the company £385 as a single premium. The unexpected happened, and Archibald did not survive his mother. When the estate came to be distributed, Archibald having assigned his interest under the will, an amount of £13,000 was paid to the life assurance company. I have here a photostat copy of the policy for £5,000 which matured on Archibald's death. The company objected to paying the £5,000 on the ground that the premium had not been paid, but here is a deed issued by the responsible directors of the company of which sets it out that the premium was, in fact, paid. This matter would have gone to law except that Archibald's widow, who has . two small children, was left without means, and the executoi himself, in the event of the action, yoing against her, would have had to pay the costs.",86
261,Mr MENZIES,RE ORGANIZING UNITED STATES ARMY,Has the honourable member asked the City Mutual Life Assurance Society for its side of the case?,86
262,Mr FALSTEIN,RE ORGANIZING UNITED STATES ARMY,No .,86
263,Mr MENZIES,RE ORGANIZING UNITED STATES ARMY,Then we can take it that this is a one-sided statement.,86
264,Mr FALSTEIN,RE ORGANIZING UNITED STATES ARMY,"That is not so. The company has stated that its reason for not paying the £5,000 was because the premium had not been paid.",86
265,Mr MENZIES,RE ORGANIZING UNITED STATES ARMY,Has the honourable member gone to the company about the matter?,86
266,Mr FALSTEIN,RE ORGANIZING UNITED STATES ARMY,"No , because I did not want it said that I was using a bludgeon to force the company to pay before I had made the facts public. I invite the Attorney-General (Dr Evatt) to order an investigation of the facts of the case.",86
267,Mr MENZIES,RE ORGANIZING UNITED STATES ARMY,Why did the honourable member not report the matter in private to the Attorney-General?,86
268,Mr FALSTEIN,RE ORGANIZING UNITED STATES ARMY,"Because this is the kind of thing which is undermining the confidence of men with similar assurance policies who have been called up, or who have enlisted in the fighting services. They do not want their wives and children to be left in the same plight as was the widow of Mr Archibald.",86
269,Mr MENZIES,RE ORGANIZING UNITED STATES ARMY,"Do not say too much to me, because I have a passion for knowing both sides of the story.",86
270,Mr FALSTEIN,RE ORGANIZING UNITED STATES ARMY,I would not have taken up the time of the House at this hour if it had not been for the fact that a few weeks will elapse before the Government will summon Parliament to assemble for a legislative session. I earnestly suggest that in the interval the Government should inquire into this matter and should proceed forthwith to draft legislation which will deal effectively with life assurance companies in the same way as the Labour Government in Queensland has dealt with them.,86
271,Mr CURTIN,RE ORGANIZING UNITED STATES ARMY,"Fremantle-Prime Minister) [11.1] - in reply-The honourable member for Warringah (Mr. Spender) asked me a question, and is indignant at the affront to democracy by my refusal to lay upon the table of the House the instructions which censorship gives to newspapers. I reminded the honourable gentleman that this right which he said was vested in the democracy has only been discovered by him since he ceased to be a Minister. I have made no change in this practice. The censorship stands on precisely the same footing as it has stood on since the commencement of the war. It is true that nothing is better culated to assist the enemy than the creation of a feeling of distrust and alarm among the public. It is clear that countries have the censorship in order to promote security, and attacks upon the bona fides of the censorship, if widely circulated, would have the effect of undermining respect for the censorship and, indeed, arouse suspicion about the purposes for which it was being used. In that way, the security of the country would be affected. As the result, the Press Censorship Order, made under National Security Regulations before I became the Minister in charge of the department, prohibits any published reference to any specific act of censorship. That is the characteristic of censorships all over the world, including censorship in democracies.",87
272,Mr SPENDER,RE ORGANIZING UNITED STATES ARMY,I do not dispute that at all.,87
273,Mr CURTIN,RE ORGANIZING UNITED STATES ARMY,"No , the honourable member does not dispute it. Therefore, point. he says that when the censor issues an order to a newspaper, a copy of it should be placed upon the table of the House. I remind him that documents which are tabled here are available, not only to honourable members, but also to the press.",87
274,Mr SPENDER,RE ORGANIZING UNITED STATES ARMY,"I indicated that realized that fact, and I said that there would be no objection to a censorship regulation that would debar the press or the public from having access to the information.",87
275,Mr CURTIN,RE ORGANIZING UNITED STATES ARMY,"The press has access to the instruction, - because the press receives it ; but the press is not entitled to make any reference to the instruction.",87
276,Mr SPENDER,RE ORGANIZING UNITED STATES ARMY,I am not asking for that.,87
277,Mr CURTIN,RE ORGANIZING UNITED STATES ARMY,"I merely point out to the honourable gentleman that Ministers of State may see these orders. Ministers of the Advisory War Council were not given them until recently, and I direct attention to the fact that members of the Advisory War Council and members of the Executive take a distinct oath of office, which involves secrecy. Members of Parliament do not take sucb an oath. My answer to the honourable gentleman is that I shall not lay on the table of this House the instructions which the censorship gives to newspapers. 1 calgave that answer before, and I shall not change it. I shall now deal with the facts about Mr Rorke. Does the honourable gentleman wish me to go into details?",87
278,Mr SPENDER,RE ORGANIZING UNITED STATES ARMY,"I asked a simple, specific question. I asked whether it was a fact that Mr Rorke gave an explanation to a newspaper in respect of the reason why he resigned, and that thai explanation was censored. If so, what were the grounds for such censorship?",87
279,Mr CURTIN,RE ORGANIZING UNITED STATES ARMY,"The passage in Mr. Rorke's communication which was censored was as follows: "" Mr Rorke said there had been a trend in censorship which he did not like "".",87
280,Mr SPENDER,RE ORGANIZING UNITED STATES ARMY,What was the trend ?,87
281,Mr CURTIN,RE ORGANIZING UNITED STATES ARMY,"That was a reflection upon the bona fides of the censorship. Mr Rorke was a censor, but he was not giving the whole of his time to censorship work.",87
282,Mr SPENDER,RE ORGANIZING UNITED STATES ARMY,That is beside the,87
283,Mr CURTIN,RE ORGANIZING UNITED STATES ARMY,"Is it beside the point ? He resigned because he refused to carry out the instruction of the Chief Publicity Censor, to attend his office early in the day, soon after 9 a.m. That instruction was given because of the deterioration of I the war situation. As the war came closer to Australia, its factual treatment required greater care on the part of the censor. Mr Rorke preferred to carry on certain private activities while, at the same time, holding the office of Deputy Chief Censor in a State.",87
284,Mr SPENDER,RE ORGANIZING UNITED STATES ARMY,That does not answer my question. What was the trend about which he spoke?,88
285,Mr CURTIN,RE ORGANIZING UNITED STATES ARMY,I do not know.,88
286,Mr SPENDER,RE ORGANIZING UNITED STATES ARMY,I can tell the Prime Minister.,88
287,Mr CURTIN,RE ORGANIZING UNITED STATES ARMY,The reference that he made to the trend was struck out on the ground that no censorship in the world allows itself to be misrepresented by innuendo or by suggestion.,88
288,Mr SPENDER,RE ORGANIZING UNITED STATES ARMY,O r by criticism?,88
289,Mr CURTIN,RE ORGANIZING UNITED STATES ARMY,O r by criticism. That is also true. The honourable gentleman is quite right.,88

293,Mr CURTIN,RE ORGANIZING UNITED STATES ARMY,I say that it cannot he misrepresented. I say that it was being misrepresented because Mr Rorke in this statement merely created an inference. Fie made no specific charge. He merely said that he had noticed a trend which he did not like. That did not necessarily indicate that the trend was bad or good.,88
294,Mr SPENDER,RE ORGANIZING UNITED STATES ARMY,Will the Prime Minister tabic the statement which Mr Rorke submitted for publication?,88
295,Mr CURTIN,RE ORGANIZING UNITED STATES ARMY,"I invite the honourable gentleman to peruse all the papers relating to this matter. It has never been my practice to say more than is necessary, but I approved of the decision of the Chief Publicity Censor in directing Mr. Rorke to devote the whole of his time to rhe work that he was entrusted to do. Mr Rorke would not do it, and he resigned.",88

301,Mr CURTIN,RE ORGANIZING UNITED STATES ARMY,"They had no authority to do so, and knowing the Chief Publicity Censor as 1 do, I am positive that he would not take instructions from any one who was not authorized to give them to him. The honourable gentleman must have known of Mr Bonney's qualifications for the office when the previous Government appointed him; and I am quite sure that he never worked for the kind of paper that I have worked for in my career as a journalist. Mr MEN/JES - He worked for the Argus, which is the chief Labour newspaper in Victoria.",88
302,Mr CURTIN,RE ORGANIZING UNITED STATES ARMY,Ah! But he also worked for other newspapers. It is no indication of any loss of professional stature for a man to be engaged on the staff of the Melbourne Argus.,88

309,Mr CURTIN,RE ORGANIZING UNITED STATES ARMY,"The regulations under which the censorship operates are the National Security Regulations which are laid upon the table of the House. Regarding broadcasting, I am not the Minister for Information and I am not very well acquainted with the functioning of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, but I point out that the present personnel of the commission was inherited by the present Government. In addition, the Australian Broadcasting Commission operates not under National Security Regulations, but under its own statute. Its powers are definitely defined in the act and it has complete control over programmes.",89

That reply was given in reply to complaints about broadcasts of a political nature.",89
313,Mr CURTIN,RE ORGANIZING UNITED STATES ARMY,"I have no doubt that is true. When I obtained a return showing the number of talks that had been broadcast by members of the previous Government, compared with those which had been given by members of the then Opposition, I at once realized that some ministerial direction must have been given to the Australian Broadcasting Commission, because the proportion in favour of government speakers was so overwhelming.",89

About a year ago, the previous Government agreed, at my suggestion, to appoint a parliamentary committee so that in formulating legislation to deal with broadcasting, we should have a detached for series of constructive recommendations as to how this extraordinary service to the community could be placed upon a fair and proper basis. The committee was set up. I have asked that the committee expedite its report, and I await, as I am sure the House as a whole awaits, the conclusions of the committee, because we need guidance in respect of the way in which Parliament shall legislate for the control of broadcasting activities.",89

322,Mr ANTHONY,RE ORGANIZING UNITED STATES ARMY,But only on matters of national importance.,89
323,Mr CURTIN,RE ORGANIZING UNITED STATES ARMY,"Some one must be the judge of national importance. I say quite clearly that, so far as the Government is concerned, the Australian Broadcasting Commission is operating und^i' its statute and will continue to operate under it, but I do hope that Parliament will have the opportunity to deal with the report of the committee, and I am confident, having regard to the personnel of the committee, that the report will be of use to Parliament. For my part I shall be prepared to give effect to substantive recommendations, because I am sick and tired of the wrangling between political parties about the way broadcasting shall be organized. The honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) directed attention to the state of affairs in Canberra in regard to air raid precautions. All I can say to him is that the matter is under proper examination. Advice has been tendered to the Government in respect of not only Canberra, but also a great number of other places in Australia. There is an order of priority in this matter, having regard to the capacity of the country to make provision, and I consider that members of Parliament are quite capable of j ha ring the risks of the community. With regard td 'the preservation of documents, v [ assure the honourable member that steps have already been taken. The honourable member for Reid (Mr. Morgan) referred to munitions and I am sure that the Minister for Munitions (Mr Makin), who heard him, will take that matter up. I tell the honourable member for Cook (Mr Sheehan) that I shall indeed look into the disabilities which are suffered equally by those who have volunteered for, and those who have been called into, the Military Forces as the result of their having to give up incomes much higher than can be got in the Defence Forces. Their obligations in regard to rent and hire purchase and the like are embarrassing. We shall do our best about that matter. "" With respect to the matter raised by the honourable member for Watson (Mr. Falstein), I have only to say that it looks to me as though it were a money lending transaction by the life assurance society, and. on the submission made by the honourable gentleman, it would appear that the society has acred harshly. That would be my judgment if what he has said represents the whole story, but, before I arrived at a decision, I should have to ask that the company itself should present its case. At any rate, it is a matter of great regret that this Parliament was not able to deal with life assurance in time of peace. A measure was introduced in the Senate and whatall its ever that chamber may have thought about the bill, it was a workable plan, and, I think, could have been passed. Question resolved in the affirmative. PAPERS.

Mr. Curtin - This is a matter which the normally devolves upon State governments. Interference with normal State functions is only justified on the grounds Seat of necessity for the effectual prosecution of of the war. Should such a necessity arise the Government will give the matter consideration, but due regard may then have to be paid to the financial position and obligations of each locaKg6wer.nment body.
