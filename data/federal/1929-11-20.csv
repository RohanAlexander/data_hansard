RILEY (South Sydney) [11.5] - I have much pleasure in movingThat the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin) do take the Ohair of the House as Speaker. I have known the honourable member during the ten years for which he has been a member of this Parliament. The more he is known the better he is liked. I have had the honour to sit under four Speakers, the late Honourable Charles MCDonald, the Honourable Sir Elliot Johnson, the Rt. Honourable W. A. Watt and the Honourable Sir Littleton Groom. Each of these gentlemen occupied the Chair with dignity and success, and it will be a difficult task to follow in their footsteps. But I have no hesitation in declaring that Mr Makin will uphold the best traditions of the office. He is a straightforward, honourable and upright man, and he has already filled many positions in the Commonwealth Parliament.. He has sat as a member of various committees of this House, and one can not but admire his steady adherence to duty and his constant devotion to the business which engaged his attention. He has acted as Secretary of the Parliamentary Labour Party with great credit to himself, and most acceptably to his colleagues. During the last seven years he has been a temporary Chairman of Committees, and on the many occasions on which he has presided in that capacity he has displayed full qualification for the duties of the office to which it is now proposed to elect him. He has represented the division of Hindmarsh in South Australia for the last ten years. At the recent election he was returned unopposed, and to be unopposed is a very great compliment to any man. When the seat has been contested he has been returned by a large majority, which shows that his constituents have the fullest confidence in him. He having so worthily represented his constituents in the Hindmarsh division, and having so satisfactorily discharged the other duties that have fallen to him as a member of the Parliament, I have no doubt that he will make a worthy successor to the gentlemen who have preceded him in the chair of this House.",12
1,Mr CURTIN,Unknown,"Fremantle) [11.9] I second the motion. Every member who has any knowledge of Mr Makin and of his Parliamentary services will, I am sure, agree with me that he is well fitted to occupy the office to which it is proposed to elect him. He has a strong judicial sense and a wide knowledge of parliamentary procedure. We have all admired the diligence with which he has devoted himself to his work, and I am confident that, if elected to this office he will fill it with credit to himself and in accord with the highest traditions of the Parliament, irrespective of party considerations.",13
2,Mr YATES,Unknown,"Adelaide) [11.10] - I support the motion. It is a compliment, to South Australia that yet another representative for that State should be proposed to fill the high office of Mr. Speaker. The first Speaker of this Chamber was a South Australian and two representatives from that State have had the honour of filling the presidential chair in the Senate. If the motion is agreed to I have no doubt that Mr Makin will justify the confidence reposed in him, and that he will uphold the best traditions of the Parliament. My principal reason for rising to speak at this juncture, however, is to say that, in my opinion, the time has gone by when the Speaker of this chamber should be chosen in this fashion. The remarks that I shall make on this subject are not spontaneous. They are the result of careful consideration over a long period of years. I believe that the presiding officers of the various Houses of Parliament in Australia should be paid officials and not some one who has been elected to represent a constituency. I held these views long before I had any aspirations to parliamentary honours or any' hopes of ever being a legislator. Many years ago I tabled a motion at a conference of the South Australian Labour party to the effect that the Speaker of the House of Assembly in that State should be a paid official of the House. I believe that the Speaker of. this chamber should also be an oflicial and not a member. I am fortified in this opinion by the recent occurrences in connection with the Speakership of the House of Representatives.",13
3,Mr GREGORY,Unknown,The honourable member would want to reduce the salary.,13
4,Mr YATES,Unknown,"That is beside the point at the moment. It is an anomaly that the Speakership of this chamber should be a party political plum. That has been the case in the past, and the best man for the position has not always been elected to it. Reference has been made by the previous speakers to the admirable manner in which the honourable member for Hindmarsh has represented his district in this Parliament. If he becomes the Speaker of the House, his knowledge and ability as a representative will, to a large extent, be lost to his constituents. The work he will be able to do in that regard will be negligible. If this occurs, he may meet with the same fate as Sir Littleton Groom, who, because he would not follow the dictates of the previous Government and vote for it, is now, to put it colloquially, "" on the outer"". That, I suggest, is a serious anomaly. The Speaker of this chamber should be free from party ties or political influence. I can recollect quite well occasions when the Speaker of this House was called into vote to save the Government. That is not as it should be. The Labour party is a party of reform. Consequently I feel that this is an appropriate occasion to refer to this subject. I suggest - and I maintain that the suggestion is reasonable-that the Speaker of the House of Assembly in each of the States should be the State Governor, and that the Speaker of the House of Representatives should be the Governor General of Australia. I look forward to the time when we shall dispense with many old customs, and get thoroughly up to date'in making practical use of the occupants of such positions. I make this suggestion in the hope that before long it will bear fruit. I repeat my appreciation of the selection of the nominee for the Speakership, and have no doubt that he will more than justify the confidence about to be reposed in him.",13
5,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"Cowper) [11.16). - I have no intention at this stage of entering into a debate on the subject raised by the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Yates) excepting to say that, in my opinion, it is proper that the elected representatives of the people should themselves elect the officer who is to preside over them. Nor have I , as a member of the Country party or of the Opposition, any intention to nominate another candidate for the office of Speaker. * I nize that the custom has always been for the most numerous party in the House to nominate the Speaker. Previous Speakers, irrespective of the party to which they belonged, have carried out their duties impartially. But the present seems the most appropriate time to raise a matter affecting the privileges of members and parties in this building. During the past few weeks, owing to the defeat of the last Speaker (Hon. Sir Littleton Groom), we have been without a Speaker. The result has been that, instead of the status quo having been observed, other arrangements have been made regarding the disposition of the rooms in this building. Unless some permanent basis for the allocation of rooms is arrived at we may, in the future, find that rooms have been so allotted as to cause personal friction-a situation which would be most unfortunate. When I brought this matter under the notice of the Prime Minister (Mr. Scullin) he met me with exceptional courtesy, and he has since done his utmost to provide suitable and permanent accommodation in the building for the Country party. Almost since the beginning of Pederation there have been three parties in this Parliament, and suitable accommodation has been provided for each of them. Invariably the greatest courtesy has been extended towards the members of all parties, thus enabling them to carry out their official duties in the most effective manner. I should like to secure from the new Speaker an assurance that the custom of the past will be followed in the future, and that ample provision will be made in this building for the Country party, which I have the honour to lead. I recognize the difficulty that has now been caused by the planning of this building. Hitherto the room occupied - by the Country party has been one facing the same balcony as the adjoining room occupied by Government members. That was a satisfactory arrangement when the members of the two parties occupying those rooms supported the same Government. Dr Earle Page. The difficulty, however, is not insurmountable ; it should not be impossible to devise some means of overcoming it.",13
6,Mr LACEY,Unknown,Some provision had to be recog- made for the overflow of the Labour party.,14
7,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,I hope that it will be possible to make arrangements satisfactory to both the Country party and the overflow of Government members.,14
8,Mr MAKIN,Unknown,"Hindmarsh) [11.19] I desire to thank the mover and seconder of the motion nominating me as the Speaker of this House, and I humbly submit myself to the House. Members of the House then unanimously calling Mr Makin to the Chair, he was taken out of his place by Mr. E. Riley and Mr Curtin and conducted to the Chair. Then Mr SPEAKER ELECT, standing on the upper step, said- I am deeply sensible of the great honour which honourable members have conferred upon me. I shall endeavour in all ways possible to uphold the high traditions of the office of Speaker, and to act with strict impartiality. It will be my constant aim to emulate the worthy example of those who have preceded me in this high and distinguished position. I am profoundly grateful to the House for the confidence and good-will that it has shown me.",14
9,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,"Yarra-Prime Minister, Minister for External Affairs and Minister for Industry) [11.20] - I regard it as a great privilege, Mr Speaker, to have the honour of congratulating you on your election to the high and honourable office to which the members of this 'House have unanimously called you. Permit me to say that you have won that high distinction by your own individual worth. You have been appointed to a position which you have earned during many years of devoted attention to duty and by your unfailing courtesy towards every member of this Parliament, as well as by an earnestness, sincerity and outstanding ability that marks you as a man worthy to occupy the high position you now hold. I congratulate you, a comparatively young man, on having attained the high office of presiding officer of the national parliament of Australia, aud I trust that you will have a long and successful career as Speaker of this House. In the name of the Government I offer you all the support that you may require in the impartial administration of your responsible duties.",14
10,Mr LATHAM,Unknown,"Kooyong) [11.22] On behalf of the Opposition I desire to add my congratulations to those so felicitously expressed by the Prime Minister (Mr Scullin). I congratulate you on your election to the Chair without a dissentient voice. As Speaker it will be your duty to guard the privileges of honourable members on both sides and to maintain the dignity and prestige of this House. We feel that we can, with confidence, leave those functions in your hands. I desire to assure you that in the discharge of your duties as Speaker you will have the full support of the members of the Opposition.",15
11,Dr EARLE PAGE,Unknown,"Cowper) [11.23]. - I desire to add the congratulations of the Country party and my own to those expressed on behalf of the Government and the Opposition. The Country party will do its utmost to support you in the onerous duties which will devolve upon you. Your experience as a temporary Chairman of Committees will assist you in fulfilling those duties. You have always been a keen student of parliamentary practice, and we feel confident that your aim will ever be to maintain the highest traditions of the office to which you have been elected. As guardian of the privileges of honourable members we trust that you will have a happy term of office.",15
12,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. Norman Makin) [11.24] - I desire to express my very cordial appreciation of the assurances of the Prime Minister (Mr Scullin), the Leader of the Opposition (Mr. Latham) and the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) that they will assist me.in the conduct of the affairs of this House. "" I appreciate, too, their kind references to me, and hope that in the discharge of my duties, I may justify the high opinion of my abilities which they have expressed. It. will be m,y constant endeavour to conserve interests, the rights and the privileges of every member of this House. The right honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) has referred to difficulties that have arisen in the allocation of rooms for the use of honourable members. I shall at the earliest moment give attention to the matter, and see that the comfort and convenience of honourable members are fully provided for and amply secured. I again thank the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page) and others who have spoken, for their kind remarks concerning me and their assurance that I shall have their cooperation and assistance in maintaining the dignity and the high traditions of the office that I now occupy.

As honourable members have copies of the speech in their hands, I presume that they do not desire me formally to read Motion (Mr Scullin) agreed toTliat a committee consisting of Mr Holloway and Mr Eldridge, and the mover, be appointed to prepare an Address-in-Reply to the speech delivered by His Excellency the Governor General to both Houses of the Parliament, and that the committee do report at the next sitting. CHAXEMAN OF COMMITTEES.",16
22,Mr COLEMAN,ACTS INTERPRETATION BIL L,"Eeid) [3.22] move That the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr MCGRATH) be appointed Chairman of mittees of this House. The honourable member for Ballarat has had a long public career in Australia, first as a member of the Legislature of Victoria, and then as a member of Commonwealth Parliament. He may be ranked as one of the fathers of this liament in that he has been a member of it for 25 years. He has had much experience of the Standing Orders-in fact he has come into conflict with them on some occasions. Consequently, he well fitted to discharge the duties of Chairman of Committees with tact, imbers partiality and sympathy. He is popular with honourable members of this House, and will preserve the dignity of his in conformity with the traditions estaban lished by the distinguished persons who have held it before him.",17
23,Mr YATES,ACTS INTERPRETATION BIL L,"Adelaide) [3.23] - I have much pleasure in seconding the motion of the honourable member for Eeid, and in endorsing his references the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr. MCGRATH). I have no doubt that that honourable member's long experience in this House, together with the since experience he gained as a memwas ber of the Victorian legislature, will fit him admirably for dischargable ing the responsibilities of his office. I do not agree that he has found himself much in conflict with the Standwealth ing Orders in the past; in fact, his haviour as a member has been exemwhich plary. I am confident, however, that there is anything in the Standing Orders conflict with justice he is the person I to set matters' right. A love of justice is characteristic of the man, so that if there is any part of the Standing Orders which it is necessary to scrap he will do ithis best to have it done. The duties which he will have to perform could not be in safer hands than his.",17
24,Mr R GREEN,ACTS INTERPRETATION BIL L,"Eichmond) [3.24] l- have listened to the honourable member for Reid (Mr Coleman) and the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr. Yates) hoping to hear from them some adequate reason why this choice has been made. We might have expected to J hear that the honourable member who has been proposed for this office had been a temporary chairman of committees, Comand in that way had qualified for the office of chairman. It is significant that neither the mover nor seconder of the motion could say that the honourable member for Ballarat had had any exthe perience whatever in the Chair. The only reason given for his fitness to adParminister the Standing Orders was that he had sometimes found himself in conflict with them. This reason does not seem sufficient for putting him into the Chair, his only qualification being, apis parently, that be has not obeyed the Standing Orders as other honourable memhave been wont to do. Another surprising thing is that no reference was made to an honourable member who was office Temporary Chairman of Committees in honorary capacity for a considerable time while Mr Bamford filled the office of Chairman. I refer to the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Watkins), and I am surprised that he has not been put forward as a candidate for this high office. The 25 years' parliamentary exto perience of the honourable member for Ballarat cannot be compared with that of the honourable member for Newcastle who has been a member of this House its inception, and who, prior to that, a member of the New South Wales State'Legislature. He is the only honormember of this House who has consistently represented the one constituency since the inauguration of the CommonParliament. As he has had conbesiderable experience in the office for the honourable member for Ballarat if has been nominated, one might have thought that he would have been given the opportunity of filling ft.",17
25,Mr STEWART,ACTS INTERPRETATION BIL L,The honourable member may nominate him now.,18
26,Mr R GREEN,ACTS INTERPRETATION BIL L,"I do not propose to go against the wishes of the friends of the honourable member for Newcastle, but I repeat, that I am surprised that an honourable member with such strong claims upon the office should have been overlooked. Question resolved in the affirmative.",18
27,Mr SCULLIN,ACTS INTERPRETATION BIL L,"Yarra-Prime Minister, Minister for External Affairs and Minister of Industry) [3.30] - I desire to offer a few words of congratulation to the honourable member for Ballarat. upon his appointment as Chairman of Committees. Por many reasons the honourable member is well fitted for that position. The qualification which has been emphasized is not the only reason for his election to a high and honourable office, although the fact that he has in the past broken the Standing Orders may cause him to deal leniently with future transgressors. Perhaps the honourable member for Richmond (Mr R. Green) particularly may have reason to be grateful that the occupant of the Chair is not a strict disciplinarian. I am confident that the honourable member for Ballarat will discharge his duties with impartiality, and will bring to bear ou the position, that force of character which is his outstanding characteristic and is necessary in one who presides over the committee proceedings of this Chamber. I recall with pleasure 25 years of close association him; through many trials and struggles the honourable member has remained true to his principles and his friends, and I am confident that he will be true to the best traditions of the office to which he has been elected.",18
28,Mr LATHAM,ACTS INTERPRETATION BIL L,"Kooyong) [3.32] - I offer the congratulations of the members of the Opposition to the honourable member for Ballarat upon his election to the Chairmanship of Committees. The honourable member is an experienced parliamentarian and a skilled debater, and he is further equipped for his new office by his personal experience of the operation of the Standing Orders. Many of us who now sit in opposition have come into conflict with him in debate, but. when he is presiding over the committees of this House we shall forget our past differences as, we know, he will forget them. We are confident that he will impartially administer the. Standing Orders and preserve the dignity and decency of our proceedings while at the same time protecting the rights of all honourable members. We wish him well during his term of office and offer to him our support in the administration of the Standing Orders. I hope that he will interest himself in bringing the rules of debate more up to date. An effort to that end was made in the last Parliament and I hope that that work will be carried to completion. In any endeavour to improve the Staudmg Orders, the Chairman of Committees will be assured of the cordial support of the Opposition. Again I promise the honourable member for Ballarat the assistance of honourable members ou this side of the Chamber in maintaining the traditions and dignity of his office.",18
29,Dr EARLE PAGE,ACTS INTERPRETATION BIL L,"Cowper) [3.34] On behalf of the Country Party I congratulate the honourable member for Ballarat upon his election and assure him of our support in carrying out his onerous duties. Because of the length of committee deliberations the position of Chairman of Committees is an exceedingly onerous one. During the period I have been a member of this Parliament I have come under the jurisdiction of three distinguished Chairmen, the late Mr Chanter, Mr. Bamford, and the honourable member with for Oxley (Mr Bayley). All discharged the duties of their office with conspicuous success, and I trust that the honourable member for Ballarat will be able to maintain the traditions and standards set by his predecessors. I congratulate him upon his recovery from a recent serious accident. All honourable members are glad to see him in this chamber again.",18
30,Mr MCGRATH,ACTS INTERPRETATION BIL L,"Ballarat) [3.36] - I am very grateful for the high honour that has been conferred upon me, and I thank my nominator and seconder for their remarks concerning my personal qualifications, and the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, and the Leader of the Country party for their generous references' and assurances of assistance. Although I have not previously occupied the Chair, I have been in touch with very often. I shall do my best to uphold the high traditions attaching to the office posal. to which I have been elected. I shall endeavour to hold the balance evenly tween all parties, and I hope that the myself. necessity will not arise for me to impose upon any honourable member the discipline to which I have been subject occasions. As a result of my recent accident I am very deaf in the left ear, but I assure the members of the Opposition that both eyes have their vision unimMinister paired. HOUR OF MEETING.",18
31,Mr SCULLIN,ACTS INTERPRETATION BIL L,"Yarra-Prime Minishours ter, Minister for External Affairs and Minister for Industry) move That the House at its rising adjourn tomorrow at half-past 2 o'clock p.m. It is the wish of the Government that from next week, the House shall meet Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and petent Fridays. The meeting on Tuesday rendered necessary by the many urgent measures to be dealt with in the short period available before the Christmas adjournment. I should like to have given honourable members longer notice of proposal to sit on Tuesdays, but I am sure they will realise that the circumthe stances are extraordinary. I had not opportunity to intimate earlier to the Leader of the Opposition the intentions of the Government because, until today, I was not aware who would be elected that office. I take this opportunity congratulate the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Latham) upon his election as Leader of the Opposition, and the orable member for Henty (Mr Gullett) on his appointment as Deputy Leader. assure them that they will receive from the Government every courtesy, and, knowing them well, I am confident that we shall receive the same from them.",19

W. J. MCWILLIAMS.",19
33,Mr SCULLIN,ACTS INTERPRETATION BIL L,"Yarra-Prime Minister, Minister for External Affairs and for Industry [3.40] - Since we last assembled in this chamber, death has claimed one of our former colleagues, Mr William James MCWilliams, who died at his home in Hobart on the 22nd October, within a few of the declaration of his re-election for the constituency of Franklin. [3.37] - I The late Mr MCWilliams was a native of Tasmania, and one of its most until loyal sons. The claims of the little island State were put before this Parliament by him earnestly and with consideron able ability. He was a zealous and comadvocate of the rights of his State, is which will mourn the loss of one who represented it well, as the Commonwealth will mourn the loss of one who rendered conspicuous service in this National Parliament. At the age of 33 the he was elected a member of the Tasmanian Parliament and held his seat in State House for seven years. He an was elected a member of the Federal Parliament in 1903 for the division of Franklin, and held the seat for nineteen years, until the general election in 1922. to For two years preceding his defeat to he was the Leader of the Country party in this House. He was re-elected for the same division at the general elechontion in 1928, and was again returned on the 12th October last. During his public I career the late Mr MCWilliams occupied many important and honourable positions. He was a member of the Select Committee appointed in 1910, and of the Royal Commission of the following year, to inquire into Tasmanian Customs leakage. He was also a member of the Pearling Royal Commission in 1913. In 1914 he served on the. Royal Commission - that inquired into the powellizing of Australian timber better and was a member of the Federal Recruiting Committee in 1917-18. The late honourable gentleman was also a member of the Select Comings mittee that inquired into the sea carriage of goods in 1920, and.was a member the Cockatoo Island Dockyard Royal Commission in 1921. In the discharge of his duties as a member of all these royal commissions and select committees, the late honourable gentleman gave of his best, as indeed he did as a member of aud the Tasmanian Parliament. Honorthe able members are aware that, he was robust. Yet, - although he suffered physically, he gave close attention to public duties. He was a man of very high character and personally was most likeable aud gentle in his nature. He always prepared to find something good even in the most critical moments of public debate. He will be much missed by honourable members. All who were associated with him for so many years will deeply regret the loss of one who their friend. I am sure that the House will join with me in extending the cerest sympathy to his widow and the members of his family. I therefore move (hy leave)That this House expresses its deep at the death of Mr William James MCWilliams, member of the House of places. Representatives for the Division of Franklin, and places on record its appreciation of his meritorious public service and tenders its found sympathy to his widow and family in their bereavement.",19
34,Mr LATHAM,ACTS INTERPRETATION BIL L,"Kooyong) [3.43] - I second the motion. . On an occasion such as this we all forget our party differences and our personal views and direct our attention to the man and his work. The late Mr MCWilliams had grown old in the service of the people. Indeed there are few who have served this country in the State and Federal Parliamentary spheres for so long a period as 27 years. The list of commissions and select committees upon which the late honourable member served, which has been read by the Prime Minister, will indicate to the House how energetic the late Mr MCWilliams was as a private member of this and the Tasmanian Parliament. He was as active as any private member could well be. He threw himself into his work with great thoroughness during his long association with this Parliament. We shall miss him very much indeed, and I am sure we all had the most kindly feelfor him. I join the Prime Minister in thinking that we should express to his of widow and members of his family our sincere sympathy with them in the great loss which they have sustained.",20
35,Dr EARLE PAGE,ACTS INTERPRETATION BIL L,"Cowper) [3.46] The Country Party desires especially to associate itself with the motion submitted this by the Prime Minister and seconded by Leader of the Opposition (Mr. not Latham). The late Mr MCWilliams was one of the founders of the Country Party his in this House. For over a year he was its first, leader, and for many years was closely associated with it. The Leader of was the Government has spoken of his long period in the public life of this country. His ripe experieuce well fitted him for the discharge of his Parliamentary duties.
