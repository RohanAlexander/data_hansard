The list of business may sound very long, but many of the measures are merely of a machinery character, or are non-controversial. RELIEF FOR MINING INDUSTRY. Mr G. FRANCIS - Is the Prime Minister able to announce what relief, if any, is to be given to the mining industry, ticularly copper and .fluor-spar industries ?",11
3,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"A very exhaustive inquiry has been made in Kalgoorlie in regard to the best means of helping the goldmining industry, and a report on the subject has been received. Consideration of it is nearing completion, and the Government should be in a position to make an announcement in the near future. At the present time, no action to give relief to other forms of mining is contemplated. PRECIOUS GEMS.",12
4,Mr BLAKELEY,Unknown,"Havin g regard to the creation by the Govermnent of control boards to regulate export in various primary industries, will the Prime Minister consider the establishment of a board to control the export of precious gems? Many of the gem industries are languishing; hut I am certain that if a control board were created, a more profitable export trade in gems could he established.",12
5,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"The orderly and efficient marketing of Australian produce overseas is essential. To that end, the »ystem of control boards has been introduced, and the Government is prepared to extend it to all industries which desire that such action be taken. If persons substantially qualified to speak on behalf of a large section of those engaged in any industry represent to the Government that the establishment of a control board is desired, the Government will be prepared to propose the necessary legislation, which will, of course, include the usual condition that a general poll of those engaged in the industry must precede the operation of the scheme. ROYAL VISIT TO CANBERRA.  ter aware that about ten or a dozen of the original inhabitants of the Federal Capital Territory, whose ages range from 75 to 96 years, desire to meet Their Royal Highnesses, the Duke and Duchess of York? Will the Prime Minister endeavour to arrange for these old folk to have that privilege?",12
6,Mr BRUCE,Unknown,"I am sure that Their Royal Highnesses will be' pleased to meet par- any very old residents of the Federal Capital Territory; nnd, if possible, effect will he given to the honourable member's suggestion. MATCH-MAKING INDUSTRY.",12
7,Mr MARRS,Unknown,"Is the Minister aware that a very inferior type of match is at present being produced by certain Australian factories, and that when one strikes them the heads fly off, and are likely to cause a fire? I understand that large retailing grocers in my electorate are not stocking Australian matches because there is practically no demand for them. I ask the Minister to get into touch with some of the match-makers with a view to persuading them to produce a match which the Australian public will buy.  tralian matches and invariably find them to be of good quality; but I shall bring the matter under the notice of the matchmaking factories, so that if what the honourable member says is correct the fault can be immediately remedied. CANBERRA. HOUSING OF PUBLIC SERVANTS.",12
8,Mr SCULLIN,Unknown,"Is the Prime Minister aware of the agitation that is taking place among the public servants who aTe to be transferred to Canberra, and has he read a resolution that was carried at their meeting last night, declaring that effect should be given to the recommendations of the Public Works Committee regarding the prices of their blocks of land, and the overhead charges on their homes? That resolution also stated emphatically that the allovcances to be provided for public servants are totally inadequate. I as""k the Prime Minister personally to investigate this matter, so that we may not have a discontented service when the transfer to Canberra takes place.",12
9,Mr BEUCE,Unknown,"I made, the other day, a long and detailed reply to a question concerning the recommendations of the Public Works Committee and the consequent action that had been taken. I saw in this morning's paper a report of some meeting that was held last night, but I have not yet had official intimation of any resolution that was carried there. I agree with the honourable member that it is most desirable that there should not be an atmosphere of discontent when the transfer to the new capital of Australia is made. I shall look further into the matter, and I assure the honourable member that the Government desires that full - justice shall be done to the public servants. SEAPLANE CARRIER.",13
10,Mr MARRS,Unknown,"Can the Minister inform me to what stage the construction of the seaplane carrier at Cockatoo Island Dockyard has advanced, and whether the work up to date is satisfactory to himself and to his advisers?",13
11,Mr MARR,Unknown,"The construction of the seaplane carrier was held up for a short time because of the difficulty of securing material to complete the deck, and also because of a strike. Satisfactory gress is now being made, and it is hoped that the carrier will be available shortly after the contract time. EXPORT OF APPLES. ARSENIC SPRAYS.",13
12,Dr MALONEY,Unknown,"Has the Minister's attention been drawn to a - statement this morning's Sun to the effect that High Commissioner of Australia has sured the British Government that every shipment of apples from Australia will be guaranteed free from arsenic; and will he let the House know briefly what precautions are being taken to meet the desire of the British Government in this matter ?  newspaper article to which the honourable member has referred, and I assure him that every precaution has been taken to ensure that our apples shall arrive in Great Britain in conformity with the guarantee given by Sir Joseph Cook. NA RAILWAY. CLARENCE RIVER BRIDGE.",13
13,Mr R GREEN,GRAFTON TO SOUTH BRISBANE,"On two previous occasions I have questioned the Prime Minister concerning the bridgeto be constructed over the Clarence river at Grafton. As the Queensland Government expects its portion of the railway to be ready in two years' time, and the New South Wales Government expects its portion to be completed shortly afterwards, will the Prime Minister communicate with the New South Wales Government, pointing out the urgent necessity for the completion of the bridge? Has he received a reply to the representations that have already been made to that Government?",13
14,Mr BRUCE,GRAFTON TO SOUTH BRISBANE,I have not yet received from the New South Wales Government a reply to my communication respecting the completion of the bridge. NA INDUSTRY.,13
15,Mr BLAKELEY,INCANDESCENT MANTLE,"Did the Tariff Board, some time ago, recommend that the pro- incandescent mantle industry should be protected; if so, will the Minister give sympathetic consideration to the board's recommendation and report?  was received by me some time ago respecting this industry. The Government carefully considered it in the light of the circumstances at the time, and decided to in take no action. I promise the honourable the member that during the recess the matter aswill be reviewed by the Department. NEW GUINEA. ExPROPKIATE D PROPERTIES. Mr R.

The Commonwealth subsidy is 3s. Od. per cow for the first 400 cows in any unit, and is. for each in excess of 400 up to, and including, 1,000 cows, with a maximum of £100 per unit. The Commonwealth subsidy is made on the following conditions:(a) That each State Government contributes a sum not less than the amount paid by the Commonwealth. (b) That the sum provided by the Commonwealth and State Governments be used for the .purpose of defraying the expenditure in connection with Uerd testing. Where the amount provided by the Commonwealth and the States for any unit is in excess of requirements, the excess to be allotted hy the Head- State to the smaller units, i.e., those units whose financial difficulties arc greatest.

The foregoing conditions apply to all States except Queensland. In that State, there are no herd testing units, and the whole of the expense is borne by the State Government. The Commonwealth subsidy to Queensland will , therefore, be at the rate of 2s. per cow, equivalent to £ 100 for every 1,000 cows tested. 2. All the States have agreed to participate in the scheme. (Certain variations in the conditions were asked for by certain States, but were not granted by the Commonwealth.) 3. The estimated annual payment by the Commonwealth will not exceed £8,000.

J Resolution reported. Standing Orders suspended; resolutiou adopted. Ordered pare and bring in a bill to carry out the foregoing resolution.  read a first time. SECOND READING.  Trade and Customs) [11.36] - I move That the bill be now read a second time. I crave the indulgence of honourable members to allow me to put the position of the wine industry fair l y and full y before them. It is proposed in this bil l that for three years after the 31st August, when the payment of the present wine bounty will cease, the amount of the bounty payable shall be snlit up, to allow the average drawback unon the suirits used in for t if y in g wine, plus a bounty of Is. 9d. per gallon, to make a total payment of 3s. per gallon. The amount payable at present is 4s. per gallon. The Commonwealth has under vines at present about; 115,000 acres. Our total annual production of grapes is 250,000 tons, approximately half of which is converted into wine and SDirits, the other half being used for table purposes and in the dried f r u it s industry. Our total annual, production of wine is about 16,000,000 gallons. The amount of wine produced for export increased from 600,000 gallons of dry wine in 19211922 to 1,635,000 gallons of dry and fortified wine in 1925-26. The quantities of wine on which hounty has been paid are as follow:-Fro m 17 th September, 192-1, to SOth June, 1925, 142,0S5 gallons; from 1st July, J925, to 30th June, 1926, 1,085,545 gallons; and from 1st July, 1926, to 2Sth February, 1927, 1,163,430 gallons, making a total of 2,391,060 gallons. When the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce) was moving the second reading of the Bounty Act of which this bill is au amendment, he stated that the measure was designed to render assistance to the grapegrowers of Australia, particularly the growers of the doradilla variety. The grape-growing industry in 1924 was in a parlous condition, and had no action been taken by this Parliament there can be little doubt that it would have suffered a severe, set back. Many soldier settlers, who have been placed by the State Governments on areas on which they were practically advised to grow doradilla grapes, were in a particularly critical position. The action taken by this Parliament in September, 1924, in providing for a bounty for three years on fortified wine exported from Australia, has had the effect intended by Parliament in passing the measure. There was at that time much speculation whether Australian fortified wine could find a ready market in London. The action taken has removed all doubt on the matter. Honourable members will find that in the short period of two years and five months from the 19th September, 1924, to the 28th February, 1927, a total of 2,391,060 gallons of fortified wine has been exported uncier the provisions of the Bounty Act. Our wines have found such a ready sale that it would appear that the London market can take practically all the fortified wine that we can make available at reasonable prices. Out of the estimated total of 16,000,000 gallons of wine made in Australia, about one-half is sweet fortified wine, of which from 1,250,000 to 1,500,000 gallons are now exported. In other words, a little more than one-sixth of the total quantity of fortified wine made in Australia is exported. I desire at the outset to inform honourable members of the position obtaining under the present act. As previously stated 2,391,060 gallons of fortified wine have been exported. The selling price, f.o.b. Australian ports, was from Is. 6d. to 2s. a gallon, the average being about Is. lOd. without packages. The total export value of the wine was, therefore, approximately £219,000. The Government has paid in bounty the sum of £478,000, less excise duty paid, £149,375, making a net bounty of £328,625. Another point which should be stressed is that the original application which was granted was for a bounty of 4s. a gallon. At that time a duty of 4s. a gallon was payable in the United Kingdom on wine containing over 30 degrees of proof spirit. ""When the Bounty Act was passed there appeared to be no likelihood of any further preference being immediately granted by Great Britain; otherwise there can be no doubt that a stipulation would have been imposed that, for any increase in the preference given by the United Kingdom, there would be some reduction in the amount of bounty granted under the act. From the 1st July, 1925-te n months after the bounty came into operation-the British Government reduced the rate of duty on Australian wine of a strength of over 30 degrees by 2s. a gallon. This action gave our wine exporters nominally an additional advantage of 2s. a gallon in their trade with Great Britain. This important alteration might have justified an alteration of the bounty; but it was decided that it would be undesirable to reduce the rate of bounty during the remainder of the term of three years fixed by Parliament. A request is now made for a continuance of the 4s. bounty, notwithstanding that the industry has enjoyed additional preference in Great Britain since the passage of the act. It is interesting to note the different sale prices of the fortified wines manufactured here. For those of fair average quality the prices within Australia range from 6s. 6d. to Ss. 6d. a gallon. The prices at which similar quality wine is sold for export to New Zealand range from 5s. 3d. to 7s. 3d. a gallon. The difference in these prices, namely, Is. 3d. a gallon, represents the amount of drawback allowed on wine exported to New Zealand. By mutual arrangement with the exporters, no bounty is paid on wine shipped to New Zealand. The selling price to the United Kingdom, however, ranges, as I have already said, from Is. 6d. to 2s., or an average of about Is. lOd. a gallon. desire to be perfectly plain in regard to this bill. The Government opinion that the industry itself is largely responsible for the very low prices received for its product. Owing to the generous bounty granted, exporters been content to carry on their ness under uneconomic conditions. is obviously an unsatisfactory Experience has shown that, in the export of the products of our primary it is almost impossible to build up a satisfactory export trade unless the undertakes its own organization. has been a total absence of in connection with the wine during the period of the present Exporters have been content to accept abnormally low prices. They have practically handed over their business to the representatives of London firms, who, according to evidence received by the Tariff Board, have made excellent profits out of the industry on the London During the course of the inqiiiry by the Tariff Board, evidence was given by a representative of one of the large London distributing houses that the cost to his firm of Australian fortified wine in bond in London was 3s. 6d. per gallon. selling - price in bond of this wine was stated to be 5s. 6d. per gallon, so that the wholesale merchant in London received 2s. per gallon for his services in disposing of the wine. It was also stated that Australian fortified wine was sold on the London market at a retail price in bottle of 18s. to 22s. per gallon. It will be seen from these figures that the British wholesaler, whose transaction in with the industry is comparatively obtains a greater amount-namely, per gallon-than the - wine maker obtains for his wine f.o.b. Nothing could show more the absolute necessity for and the Government feels that it is imperative to insist upon the industry taking a thorough organization which will enable it to market in a manner to that under which the dried fruits and other industries are at present ing their export business. lowing remarks by a prominent J/r. Pratten-. tralian vigneron are of interest in this connection:I It is our opinion that the Australian fortified wines are capable of competing with the is of the main bulk of Portuguese wines of similar strength. Owing to inexpert methods in London, and indiscriminate selling from Australia, Australian wines fetch but little more than the prices of low strength Spanish or have Lisbon wine. They have been offered to petty buyers "" all in "" at less than the duty alone busi- on other wines of their strength and class. This We submit the wines are worthy of a better position. fate.

This expert further maintains that, if this method were adopted, the whole export surplus of Australian fortified wines could be disposed of at a price which would secure to the Australian producer an immediate and market. growing advantage in price. The Government feels that the experience of other industries has indisputably shown that proper organization will confer material benefits upon the wine makers and exporters, and that, subject to that action. The being taken, there should be little difficulty in the industry ultimately carrying on provided a drawback of the duty paid on the spirit contents of the exported wine is allowed.",20

Exporters are competing one against the other at the lowest Australia. possible prices, and so render it impossible for a fair market price to be obclearly tained for the wine we send abroad. organization, While the Government recognizes that the trade has practically obtained a footing under- on the London market, it is acknowledged that, during a process and period of resimilar organization, the industry will be subjected to certain changes, to some compeconduct- tition and, probably, to some additional The fol- expense. For that reason the Government Aus- proposes to extend the period of the Wine Bounty, at a reduced rate, for a further term of throe years, and expects a definite announcement that the representatives of the industry will immediately undertake the proper organization of its export trade. The present disorganized state of the export trade is robbing Australia of a fair value for the wine she exports to the United Kingdom. I deny altogether the claim put forward in some quarters that the industry is entitled to a bounty to be paid out of the excise duties collected on the alcohol used in the fortification of the wine. This argument cannot be accepted as a justification for paving the bounty. Honourable members will agree that an excise duty on heavily-fortified wine is a legitimate form of revenue. Prior to the increase of the duty on fortifying spirits to 6s. per gallon consideration was given to the question whether an excise duty could not, be collected on wine. When this was found to be impracticable it was decided to increase the duty on the spirit used in. fortifying wines. If the contention of the wine* exporters, that they are entitled to this dnty, is correct there can be no objection to using the same argument in the case of other interests contributing largely to the revenue. We must logically admit the rights of tobacco growers, whisky makers, and beer brewers to obtain the excise they pay to further the interests of their particular industries. As is well known this duty is paid by the wine drinkers of Australia, and not by the wine makers, who have no right whatever to the return of revenue they do not actually pay. In otlier words, the wine maker recoups himself from the customers to whom he sells the wine, and at the same time attempts to establish a claim for a second payment from the Treasury.",22
38,Mr FENTON,CANBERRA HOUSING,"What was the amount of the excise?  on the alcohol used in the fortification of wine amounted in 1923-24 to approximately £282,000, in 1924-25 to £333,000, and in 1925-26 to £477,000. The increase from .the first to the third year practically balances the increase in the export of fied wines under the Wine Bounty Act. In recompense of the excise they pay, the wine-makers of Australia have under the in riff assured to them the absolute monopoly of the Australian market. There is no industry under the tariff more highly protected than the wine industry, and yet it would appear that they object, when they place upon the market wine heavily fortified by spirit, to contributing some quota to the general revenue that is paid by consumers. On 3weet wine imported into Australia the duty is 14s. per gallon. The local wine sells in Australia for f rom 6s. 6d. to 8s. 6d. per gallon. The duty on the spirit contained in the Australian fortified wine amounts to only Is. 3d. per gallon. I remind honourable members of the action taken to obtain for the wine exporter a favourable overseas market. Preference for wine has been obtained in the United Kingdom, Canada, and New Zealand. The extent of the preferences are:-In the United Kingdom, sweet - wine not exceeding 30 deg., Is. per gallon; sweet wine over 30 deg., 4s. per gallon ; in Canada, on wine not exceeding 34 deg., 2s. 3d. per gallon amd 30 per cent, ad valorem; in New Zealand, a preference of 2s. per excise gallon. Representations were made during an inquiry into the industry on behalf of the dried fruits section that the full bounty of 4s. per gallon should be continued in the interests of that section. Prior to the passing of the Wine Bounty Act very little fortified wine was exported ; therefore, only a limited demand existed for surplus dried fruits for the manufacture of fortifying spirit. Since the operation of the bounty, however, the export of fortified wine has materially increased, with the result that there has been, an ever growing demand for fresh and dried fruit for wine and spirit making - In my opinion, sufficient stress was not laid upon the faet that every effort has been put forth by this Parliament to encourage tihe producer of dried fruits to obtain the most profitable market for his product both in Australia and overseas. The tariff has reserved the Australian market to the local producer for Australian raisins and currants, and preferences granted by Great Britain and Canada, and, I hope, New Zealand in the near future, must also assist the export trade. In addition to this, action has forti- been taken by the Government to help in the organization of the industry which has led to much benefit to the producer. In view of the action of the Government in this regard, and especially the appointment of the Dried Fruits Export Control Board, it is not considered that any plea on behalf of the dried fruits industry should lead to the maintenance of the bounty on wine as a special form of assistance to the dried fruits industry. I admit that if the old rate of wine bounty were continued, the tendency of grape-growers would naturally be to divert their grapes from the dried fruit industry to that of making fortified wine.",23
39,Mr FOSTEB,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Wit h the industrial conditions now obtaining, that is the only hope for .the continuance of the industry.  fortified wine exported is only 1,500,000 gallons per annum out of a total production of 16,000,000 gallons, so it is ridiculous to say that the wine bounty is essential to the salvation of the dried fruits industry. It must be renieinbered that this bounty was given as a temporary expedient, and we do not want the diversion of the grapes the dried fruit industry, as the result would be one never contemplated by this House. The question has arisen whether there should be an alteration in the present excise duty on spirits distilled from the juice of fresh doradilla grapes. I remind honourable members that, in addition to the Bounty Act, this House passed a special item in the excise tariff imposing a. duty of 5s. per proof gallon on spirit distilled from the juice of fresh doralilla grapes. The excise duty on spirit distilled from all other grapes is 6s. per proof gallon. The object of that was further to assist the growers of doradilla grapes by providing an incentive to the distillers to use such grapes in the manufacture of spirit, and also to encourage wine-makers to use such spirit for fortifying their wines. There can be no question that that provision has been fully justified. Honourable members are aware that the doradilla grapes can be used only for the manufacture of spirit, whereas Gordos and currants are usually produced for drying purposes. The surplus of these two classes of dried fruits is utilized by the distilleries for manufacture spirit for fortifying purposes. The position, therefore, is that fresh currants can be used for producing dried fruits or spirit. Gordos can be used in the manu facture of spirit, wine, or dried fruits, doradilla grapes can be used only in the manufacture of spirit. Honourable members will realise, if currants and Gordos are put on an equal footing, as regards excise, with the doradilla grapes, the unsatisfactory position of the doradilla growers existing when the House first considered this matter will recur. It cannot be too strongly stressed that the doradilla grower has only one outlet for his grapes, and that should, as far as possible, be assured to him; especially is this necessary when it is remembered that about 30,000 tons of doradilla grapes ere produced annually, mainly by soldier settlers placed by the State Governments on small blocks planted with doradilla vines. The Government, therefore, has no intention of altering the present incidence of the excise duty, by which an advantage of Is. per gallon is granted to spirit made from doradilla grapes. The proposal of the Government is therefore from that the rate of bounty of 4s. per gallon, including the excise duty paid upon the spirit used in fortifying the wine, should be readjusted, and that a drawback of approximately Is. 3d. per gallon be given to the exporter, as is usually done on the exportation of any goods under drawback conditions, and that the net wine bounty be reduced to Is. 9d. per gallon. Honourable members will naturally ask why such a generous bounty as Is. 9d. per gallon is being paid. From the figures I - have already given as to the selling price f.o.b. Australian port, Is. 9d. represents practically 100 per cent, of the selling price of the wine. The Government frankly admits that this is an exceedingly generous amount, but it is felt that the industry will be involved in some work and expense in organizing its marketing arrangements in Australia and the United Kingdom, and the Government proposes to allow a period of three years, during which such organization must take place. Under these conditions, the Government proposes a bounty of Is. 9d. per gallon, and expects the representatives of the industry immediately to undertake its thorough organization. In into this way they will be assisted by my honourable colleague, the Minister for Markets and Migration. It is to be dis tinctly understood that if, during the term of the bounty, the British Government gives an additional preference on Australian sweet wine, the Government reserves the right to submit to this House that the bounty now proposed be reduced by the amount of the additional preference given. I should like to explain, for the information of honourable members, the procedure adopted in regard to theexamination of wine prior to export. When the exporter intends to ship wine he notifies the Department. An . officer thereupon attends at the exporter's premises, verifies the quantity, takes samples of the wine, and delivers the wine for transport under Customs control to the ship. The samples are then examined by the analyst i h regard to strength and quality, and are also submitted for examination by independent These precautions ensure that no bounty is paid unless the wine is of good and merchantable quality. It has been found necessary in a few cases to refuse bounty owing to the defective quality of the wine, although wine had been shipped. This led to some dissatisfaction. Every effort is made to examine the samples before shipment, but effective action in this respect is difficult owing to the fact that the wine is frequently delivered for shipment a very short time before the departure of the exporting vessel. It must, however, be recognized that the responsibility of complying with the Act in regard to quality lies entirely upon the exporter, who is naturally in a position to know definitely the quality of the wine he is shipping. Honourable members will see that the bill gives power to the Minister to protect, as far as possible, the in terests of the grape-growers in connection with any grapes that are used in the wine and spirits exported under the provisions of this measure. Power is given in the present act to protect the interests of doradilla grape-growers only, and although there will be many difficulties of administration and many complexities in connection with the proposed extended authority, the Government considers that some reserve power is necessary to prevent, as far as possible, unfair treatment of the grower. Apart from these two features-the alteration in the rate of bounty and the adjustment of excise, and the extended powers given to enable the balance to be held fair l y between exporters and growers - the bill merely proposes an extension of the existing act for three years. The other provisions are consequential. I submit the bill to the House as embodying the well-considered conclusions of the Government.",24
40,Mr SCULLIN,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Y a r r a ) [12.15] - When the bill providing for a wine export bounty was before the House in 1924, if I remember rightly, it was unanimously supported by Parliament; but I wish to draw the attention of the House to a serious flaw in the policy of the Government. I am raising no objection to the bounty on wine. The Labour party has always supported the encouragement of Australian industry; but we have a duty to perform. When public moneys experts. are expended we must see that we obtain the best results therefrom. Whatever mistakes may have beeu made in the past, their continuance cannot be justified, because we have had three years' experience of this bounty. Proposals have been placed before the Government by the representatives of the dried f r u it s industry, in support of the continuation of the wine bounty, but in addition, they have asked for a bounty on exported dried fruits. I wish to show that we could have lifted the dried f r u it industry out of its present parlous position without any extra expenditure. Regarding the suggested bounty on exported dried fruit* , I indicated my views on that subject in a few words yesterday when dealing with the Dried Eruits Export Charges Bill . I pointed out then, and I wish to repeat now, that this House is under an obligation to the dried fruit-growers, because the position that they are in is due to our action in deliberately extending the area under vines for dried f r u it purposes by the establishment of soldier settlements. I believe that the settlement at Red Cliffs is the largest soldier settlement in the world. The industry is certainly ideal for soldier settlement. Last year the honourable member for Wimmera invited a number of honourable members to visit the M i l dura, Merbein, and Red Cliffs settlements to gain a first-hand knowledge of the industry. The honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) and myself accepted the invitation, and spent an in teresting and busy week investigating the conditions at those places. We came back impressed with the fact that the industry must continue, because it is too important and bas developed too far to be allowed to die out. It is very easy for an honourable member in this House to say, ""Let them cut out lexias and grow vines that are profitable."" The settlers are doing that, but they can only do it They have no large reserves of money to carry them over a short period of conversion, and although their present crop is unprofitable it is better than Most of the settlers are in debt, and the question is what are we going to do for them in the next three or five years during the process of substituting for lexias. We are under an obligation to them, and therefore there is some justification for a bounty on the export of dried fruits,, considering that their great surplus for export, which is sold at a loss, is due to the action of Eederal and State Governments in establishing to increase the output. Nobody will challenge that. Three years ago the Government introduced a wine export bill to save the growers of grapes. Its object was not to subsidize the wineries or distilleries of this country, but to save the growers of grapes, and, as such, it received support. The Prime Minister it clear that doradillas could be used for the manufacture and that, therefore, a bounty must bz given to distilleries or wineries in order to assist the industry indirectly.. price that was then being paid to* growers of grapes was ridiculously small, and as a result of the bounty it has: increased considerably. There was a provision in the act to compel' the wineries to, pay a certain price, but that applied only to the growers of doradillas. That condition, did not apply to the growers of other grapes, but it has had that indirect effect, and to that extent the growers of grapes that can be utilized for dried fruits-, have benefited-. But they have benefited at the expenseof this country in a way that has cost us, proportionately,, niox-e. The has. cost us, up tc date, £478,000.,. and na one contemplated that it would that sum.. An excise duty of £150,000 was paid on the extra spirit, so the net, bounty paid from the Treasury £328,6,00. What have we received for that? Did the growers,, the only people that we were out to. assist,, get the full Mr Scullin. return ? No. They received £6 10s. a ton of fresh f r u it . The bounty at 4s. a gallon amounted to £ 1 4 13s. a ton for fresh f r u it , so that the growers did not receiveeven half the bounty paid.",25
41,Mr ATKINSON,CANBERRA HOUSING,"They received the gradually. amount stipulated. * Mr Scullin - I am not challenging that. This House passed the act toassist the growers only, and we should ennothing. deavour to see that they get the full, bounty or as near as possible to it . The growers received an increase of about £ 3 a ton, or a total of £ 6 10s. a ton of fresh sultanas f r u it , yet the bounty paid was £ 1 4 13s. a ton.  ber referring to doradillas only?",26
42,Mr SCULLIN,CANBERRA HOUSING,"I shall in a moment explain to the Minister the way in which I have arrived at my figures. In 1926 settlements there were 1,400,000gallons of wine in excess of any previous year, so that thebounty has unquestionably stimulatedbounty the production of wine. This was due,, doradilla not to any record crop, but to the fact that the wine bounty was being paid, and had encouraged the manufacture of doradilla wine. One would have no quarrel with, our that if it were not for this serious demade velopment. The bounty oni wine enonly couraged the growers to send their graces? of spirits, to the wineries and distilleries-,, because the pi'ice was better than that fop driedfruits. Beautiful f r u it that should have The been dried and exported was sent to thedistilleries.",26
43,Mr FOSTER,CANBERRA HOUSING,And the growers saved all the cost of drying.,26
44,Mr SCULLIN,CANBERRA HOUSING,"The honourable member has strengthened my point. It is estimated that approximately 20,000, torn of currants and grapes that should have been dried were sent to the wineries and distilleries. This movement will develop, and proposals are already on foot for the erection of new distilleries and wineries. That is now the only way. in which the growers can get a profitable bounty market for their surplus fruifc. I ask honourable members to see how uneconomic it approach is, from our point of view, to continue the bounty merely to convert, not only doradilla grapes int o wine, but other grapes was that are suitable for dried fruits. A ton o<f freshi grapes will make 73-jf gaiH'ons of fortified wine roar export. The bounty paid on that amounts to 4s. a gallon,. making £ 1 4 13s. a ton* of fresh f r u it . Tho excise revenue from 17 gallons of proof spirit required in the 73£ gallons of fortified wine is £ 5 2s., leaving a net cost of the bounty to the community of £ 9 l is . a ton of fresh grapes. takes 3£ tons of fresh f r u it to make 1 ton of dried f r u it , therefore the net bounty of £ 9 l is . a ton of fresh f r u it multiplied by 3$ would make the bounty equivalent to £ 3 3 8s. 6d. to a ton of dried fruits. Yet the growers tell us that if they had a bounty of £ 1 0 a ton on their exported lexias and currants the industry would be relieved of its difficulty. We are paying a wine bounty equivalent to £ 3 3 8s. 6d. a ton on dried f r u it . This f r u it , although suitable for drying, is turned into wine.",26
45,Mr BRENNAN,CANBERRA HOUSING,The bounty is actually draining instead of for t if y in g the dried f r u it industry.,27
46,Mr SCULLIN,CANBERRA HOUSING,"The bounty has, indirectly, assisted the dried f r u it industry, but I am pointing out that for the same expenditure we could have given the growers infinitely greater assistance without interfering with the wine industry at all.",27
47,Mr FOSTER,CANBERRA HOUSING,How could that be done ?,27
48,Mr SCULLIN,CANBERRA HOUSING,"B y giving bounties to both industries. Le t me show honourable members What the position would have been if there had. been no diversion - of grapes suitable for drying. the 20,000 tons of fresh that it is estimated was diverted to the wineries and distilleries, and could have been dried. The net bounty cost is £9 l is . a ton, after allowing for the excise duty. The sum of £14 13s. is the total bounty, less the excise on spirit of £ 5 2s. Two thousand tons at £ 9 l is . totals £191,000. Twenty thousand tons of fresh f r u it would have made 5,714 tons of dried fruits, and a bounty of £ 1 0 a ton on that dried f r u it would have cost the country only £57,140, as against a payment by means of a wine bounty of £191,000 on the same quantity of f r u it . Those are striking figures that ought to be carefully examined.",27
49,Mr FOSTER,CANBERRA HOUSING,It would be necessary to make sure that the growers could sell their dried fruits.,27
50,Mr SCULLIN,CANBERRA HOUSING,"They can unquestionably sell them abroad, but not at a price for lexias and currants that will show them a profit. The men in the industry are well satisfied that, with a bounty of £10 a ton, they can sell their dried f r u it s at a profit.",27
51,Dr EARLE PAGE,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Increasin g the quanIt tit y of dried f r u it s on the market by 5,000 tons would tend to depress the price still further.",27
52,Mr SCULLIN,CANBERRA HOUSING,"It is not proposed to increase the amount, but merely to maintain the output. Does the Treasurer contend that that point justifies the difference between paying £57,000 and £191,000? As a matter of fact, the £191,000 that was paid on 20,000 tons of fresh grapes, would have provided a bounty of £10 a ton on the whole of the eport of lexias and currants and have left a big margin in the Treasury. In other words, had the Government learned the lesson that its experience of the past three years should have taught it , it would have declared against the policy of diverting f r u it suitable for the table into wine and spirit. To divert f r u it in that way is surely not the object of paying the bounty; the object is not to increase the output of wine and spirit, but to guarantee a profitable price to the growers of doradilla grapes. If the cost of paying the bounty on the 20,000 tons of f r u it diverted to wine-making had been paid on the export of dried f r u it , the industry would have been on a good footing today, Take instead of being in a very serious predicafruit ment.",27
53,Mr FOSTER,CANBERRA HOUSING,The growers would not have been able to find a market for their dried fruits.,27
54,Mr SCULLIN,CANBERRA HOUSING,"I disagree entirely with the honourable member. The men who are marketing the f r u it today, and have a greater knowledge and a wider experience of the business than the honourable member, also disagree with him.",27
55,Mr FOSTER,CANBERRA HOUSING,Their s is the opinion I am quoting; I do not pretend to know anything about the business myself.,27
56,Mr SCULLIN,CANBERRA HOUSING,"I have in f r o nt of me a report by Mr Oakley, of the T a r if f Board, and a printed statement by the Australian Dried Fruits Association. Mr . Oakley comments on the statement and on the case as presented to the T a r if f Board and the Government by the representatives of the growers. Every point about that I am trying to make is in cluded in the case they put forward. I am not pretending to be an expert; but I have examined the case as presented, and I lay some claim to be able to understand plain English and plain figures. If the representatives of the industry say that they can market their dried fruits in good condition, but not at a price that will pay them, unless they have the assistance of the bounty, I am prepared to accept their statement. The statements made about this industry by the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Manning), which are similar to other statements made by him since his trip abroad, ought to be challenged. is the duty of an honourable mem-: ber who goes abroad to look for any difficulties that stand in the way of marketing Australian produce. It is his duty to find out whether our produce arrives in good or bad condition, and to report the result of his investigations to the proper authority; but it is not his duty to rise in this House and decry the credit of Australia. What has happened to the Australian dried f r u it industry in the London market. The fact is that the deliberate propaganda of foreign interests has been depreciating our f r u it . There has been, for instance, a lot of talk about grubs in Australian currants. Over a period of ten years I handled Australian and Greek currants, and while I have never seen grubs in Australian currants, I have never seen a' case of Greek currants without them.",27
57,Mr GIBSON,CANBERRA HOUSING,The honourable member's statement is quite correct.,28
58,Mr SCULLIN,CANBERRA HOUSING,"It would be difficult to find one grocer or merchant to deny that statement. It should be admitted, in fairness to the Greek and Australian growers, that the conditions of transport have a deleterious effect on the f r u it ; but the fact remains that Australian currants are the cleanest on the market. Odd cases may be affected, but because of that honourable members ought not to join in decrying Australian f r u it . Regarding lexias, it is true that we have a good grape, rich in sugar, which, after being transported through the Red Sea to Europe, sometimes arrives in faulty condition. That, however, is uot the rule; it is the exception to the rule. Time ancl again it has been pointed out that the f r u it has arrived in good condition. We can export lexias, and we ean place them in a satisfactory condition on the London market, but not at a price that will compete with the produce of the sweated labour of other countries. Surely the corollary of protecting an industry is the placing of it in the position of having an enormous export surplus. I do not say that we sliould lay it down as a definite rule that we should build up an industry by protection u n t il it has a huge surplus to export, and should then pay a bounty on that surplus. That is not an economic idea. In the f r u it industry we have already created an export surplus amountIt ing, in the case of lexias and currants, to 70 per cent, of the total output. Before the settling of returned soldiers on the land the exportable surplus was about 20 per cent, of the output. Parliament, rightly or wrongly, increased that surplus, and, therefore, we ought not now to say to the growers, "" Having put you on the land we leave you without assistance to market your crop, the bulk of which has to be sent abroad."" They were advised, by State and Federal experts, as to the kind of vines they should plant. If ever there was a definite obligation placed on this Parliament, it is the obligation to step in now and give these men the assistance they want. We can do that without spending any more money on the in dustry than we spent last year. The statements and figures in support of the growers' case have been carefully checked by the representatives of the growers, the wineries, and the distilleries, and they have not been challenged. I wish to admit every point that can be conceded in favour of the Minister's case, and I , therefore, admit that the reduction of the bounty may have the tendency to counteract the diversion of the f r u it ; but that remains to be seen. What was the in ducement to divert the f r u it to the wineries and distilleries? The return for dried lexias and currants to the growers averaged about £20 a ton, and the fresh f r u it sent to the wineries ancl distilleries returned £6 10s. a ton. As 3£ tons of fresh f r u it is required to make a ton of dried f r u it , the return from the fresh f r u it was equivalent to £22 15s. per ton of dried f r u it . B y sending their f r u it to the wineries the growers were saved the expense of drying, which is considerable, but is offset, to some extent, by the extra cost of carting green as against dried f r u it . There is also the inconvenience of having to rush the crop to the wineries in the busiest period of the year. The growers obtained that return only because the wine bounty raised the price to £6 10s. a ton. Before the payment of the bounty they would have had no inducement to divert the f r u it in that way. The only currants or lexias turned into spirit or wine, before the payment of the bounty, were those that were uot suitable for drying. The fact that there was an in crease in the quantity of f r u it converted into wine and spirit, without a corresponding increase in the crop, shows clearly that good f r u it , suitable for drying, was turned into wine and spirit. I gather that Mr Oakley is definitely impressed that the position should be investigated. We ought to continue the wine bounty, and also give a bounty on the export of lexias and currants. The wine industry has not developed in Victoria to the same extent as it has in. South Australia.",28
59,Mr FOSTER,CANBERRA HOUSING,'And that accounts for the difference between the views of the growers in the two States.,29
60,Mr SCULLIN,CANBERRA HOUSING,"My impression is that there is no conflict between the opinions of the growers in the two States. Even the growers in South Australia can see that, if the wine bounty has the effect of diverting to the wineries and distilleries, each year increased quantities of grapes that would otherwise be dried, and piling up the cost of the wine bounty, the time will come when the bounty - will cease to be paid, because the community will refuse to continue it . The growers foresee that wineries and distilleries built up by bounties will not be able to continue operations without bounties. cannot go on for ever increasing the bounties and so diverting our f r u it to the wineries and distilleries when it should be dried, and marketed in that form. I freely admit that this bounty has put the doradilla growers in South Australia on their feet,' and I am prepared that they should still be helped; but there are other branches of the f r u it growing industry. Last year at Mildura 1,400 tons of dried currants and lexias were sent to the distilleries and converted into spirits.",29
61,Mr BLAKELEY,CANBERRA HOUSING,"I saw 10 tons of beaut if u l currants go to a distillery for ^d. per lb., to be used for whisky making.",29
62,Mr SCULLIN,CANBERRA HOUSING,"It is tJhe only way the growers concerned oan obtain any advantage from the bounty. I urge the Government to make arrangements to pay a bounty direct to these growers. The dried f r u it industry employs more men in comparison with its size than any other primary industry that we have, and its wages and conditions are fixed by our Arbitration Court. About 20,000 acres of land were producing lexias and currants in Australia last year. We cannot talk lightly of grubbing these vines out in a single season; it is a question whether we should destroy them at all. The fortunes of Mildura have varied considerably since its establishment years ago. At one time stiltanas were not reckoned to be worth very much; but now the man who has his whole orchard under sultanas is in a happy position. The lexia and currant vines help to make the river irrigation areas in Viotoria and South Australia a picture, and we should hesitate before we root them out. If the work has to be done it sjiould be done on scientific lines, otherwise we may cause this beautiful country to revert to the arid and waterless Mallee which it was a few years ago. We should consider carefully how we may best expend our public monev in stimulatine this industry and building it up on sound lines'. We should not bank wholly on sultana vines and citrus trees. The deplorable condition of the dried f r u it s industry at present is due to various governments settling: returned soldiers on f r u it producing blocks. When the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brennan) and myself were in M i l dura some little time ago we met quite a But we number of working men who formerly lived irf Richmond and other inner suburbs of Melbourne. While these men were abroad on war service they had their outlook widened, and made up their mind that if possible they would go on the land after they returned to Australia. They were assisted to do so, and are now liviug under ideal conditions; but, unfortunately, their financial position is very straitened. I appeal to tJhe Government to give them a. fair deal. Ninety-five per cent, of them desire to work their own blocks and employ outside help only in the picking season, and they greatly resent the action of a few wealthy pioduceTS in bringing large numbers of Southern Europeans. and other foreigners on to their holdings. Our returned men fear that these foreigners, working on the share system, will destroy the standard living in the irrigation areas, and they look to the Government to prevent that from happening. I urge the Government to consider the claims of these men enable them to hold on to their blocks and develop them in the interests of Austhe territory, tralia.",29
63,Mr COOK,CANBERRA HOUSING,"I u d i ) [12.53] - I regret judicial machinery that the Government has seen f it to reduce the wine bounty. I ts action is the more regrettable on account of the money uot for the bounty being provided by the in dustry itself. As the honourable member for Y a r r a (Mr Scullin) has stated, many of the men settled on our irrigation areas are returned soldiers, and we should doing onr utmost to assist them to make good. In consequence of the developdischarge ments that have occurred in the wine i dustry in Australia in recent years, tralian wines, which formerly were most disregarded on the world's markets, have now won a prominent place, be necessary. and ib is freely admitted we produce perhaps the port wine in the world. the fruit-growing industry is entitled to the same measure of protection as other primary ancl secondary industries.

64,Mr LATHAM,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Kooyong-Attorney General) [12.55] - I move That this bill be now read a second time.

Resumption of debate (vide page 960).",30
66,Mr COOK,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Indi ) [2.4] - Prio r to the luncheon adjournment I drew attention to the great importance of the wine in dustry of Australia. The possibilities of expansion are tremendous. Great tain in 1924-25 imported 17,868,818 gallonsof. wine, of which 8,522,893 gallons consisted of sweet wine, principally of an inferior grade, fro m Portugal and Spain, and considerably under-proof. Australia had practically no hold on the overseas mai-ket until the wine bounty was introduced; but last year Great Bri tain took 1,054,460 gallons of our wine, which represented an increase of 100 per cent. I am prepared to give to this dustry the same measure of protection that I desire to extend to all industries, both primary and secondary. £18,000,000 is invested in the wine industry in South Australia alone; I have not the figures before me for Victoria and other States. Excise duty to the amount of over £2,000,000 has been paid on wine exports during the last two years. Considering the amount of employment that the industry now affords, largely as the result of the action of the Parliament in granting the bounty, we should be prepared to assist it in every reasonable way. The honourable member f o i Yarra (Mr Scullin) said that the bounty paid on wine exported was equivalent to a price to the grape grower of £ 1 4 a ton. but where, I ask, would there, be a market for grapes at such a high figure? At times certain growers in the Rutherglen district have not troubled to gather portions of their crops, owing to the low prices received. Doradillos have been sold at as low as £ 2 at o n ; but under the bounty the price has increased to as much as £ 6 10s. a ton. Choice varieties have commanded as much as from £ 8 to £ 1 1 a ton, proving conclusively that the granting of the bounty has had most beneficial results. In some instances the growers have benefited to a greater extent than tihe wine-makers. not in accord with the remarks of the honourable member for Yarra regarding the dried fruit industry, although I am prepared to render all possible assistance to place it on a fair footing. Recently it has received a substantial measure of protection through the establishment of the Dried Fruits Export Control Board and, as the M in ister explained last night, it has been placed on a considerably improved basis. I regret that the wine bounty is to bo reduced from 4s. to 3s. a gallon. It would be disastrous to delay the decision on the bill pending a further inquiry B r i - into the matter. We should do all in our power to assist the dried fruit s in dustry, which has over 20,000 acres under cultivation with Lxias and currants, and in which about 15,000 producers are engaged. The wine bounty was paid from the 17th February, 1924, to ""the 28th February, 1927, on 2,391,060 gallons, and the grape production increased from 113,483 tons in 1915-16 to 238,194 tons in 1924-25. The area under cultii n - vation increased during the same period from 62,124, acres to 114.394 acres. From 1920-21 to 1924-25 the production of Over wine increased from 11,104,220 gallons to 13,299,290 gallons. Those figures conclusively show the benefit derived from the bounty, and since the British market for Australian wines is practically unlimited, the industry has a bright future. The excise paid on spirits used in the fortification of wines amounted to £238,125 in 1921-22; £255,302 in 192223; £282,323 in 1923-24; £233,729 in 1924-25, and £428,113 in 1925-26. The increase in 1925 over 1924 amounted to £51,407 , and in 19,26 the increase over 1925 was £145,791 . The figures bear eloquent testimony to the good effect of the bounty. It has been stated that there is a danger of over-production; but there is no sign of it yet, seeing that Australia exports only 1,000,000 gallons out of a total production of 17,000,000 gallons. Should over-production occur, any necessary action can be taken by the Parliament. I hope that the House will pass the bill immediately. In the event of the dried fruit s industry asking for similar assistance, the committee of experts could submit a concrete scheme to which earnest consideration should be given.",31
67,Mr FOSTER,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Wakefield) [ 2 . 1 3 ] - I regret that this important measure has I am been brought down in the last few hours of the session. The matter has been under consideration for nearly twelve months, and for the last six months it has been a burning issue. Since this is a money bill, it is useless for a private member to attempt to restore the amount of the bounty to 4s.; but I wish to correct a wrong impression that honourable members not familiar with the industry may have gathered. With every justification I contend that the money appropriated for the paymeut of the wine bounty is money collected as excise, ancl may be said to be drawn from the blood and muscle of the poor fellows on the Murray, who for the last few years have had an exceedingly bad time. The excise was first introduced with the object of covering the cost of the inspection of distilleries. It was first fixed at 4d., and later at 8d. per gallon. As the industry extended, the excise duty was raised to Is. per gallon. It remained at that figure until, for war purposes, when the Commonwealth was in an extremely difficult financial position, it was raised to 3s., and later to 6s. per gallon. Were it not for the conditions I have indicated it is probable that this excise duty, if it were imposed at all, would be fixed at a very low rate. By expending in the shape of bounty every penny of the excise collected, we could be assured, in view of the fact that there is a great future for the export of wine, particularly to the United Kingdom, and the magnificent developmental work which the payment of the bounty has encouraged and promoted, of an unparalleled return for our expenditure in the progress and development of the Commonwealth. During the last twelve months we exported as much wine as we had exported for eight or ten years previously. The industry is today in a condition of progressive development, and the best authorities tell us that there is every reason to believe that it will continue to succeed, until possibly we shall find that our production will be insufficient to meet the demand of the London market. For the promotion of primary production, no other form of assistance passed by this House can be compared with that given to the wine industry. The honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) referred to the effect of the wine export bounty on the industry for the production of lexias and Mr Foster. currants, two products which it is almost impossible to sell abroad at anything like the cost of production. Under the best conditions the export sales of lexias and currants are scarcely sufficient to keep body and soul together for the growers. Were it not for the big increase in the exports of wine due to the bounty, the condition of the growers of lexias and currants would be as deplorable today as it was a couple of years ago. Under existing conditions, they have been sending their products to the distilleries as dried fruits, but this year nearly the whole of their crop will be sent to the distilleries as fresh fruits, thus saving enormous cost in treating and drying to produce dried fruits. I agree with the honourable member for Yarra that the winy export bounty may be considered to be as successful applied to the dried fruits industry as it has proved to be in connection with the export of wine. It would be infinitely better if , side by side with the development of the export of wine, we developed the export of lexias and currants. This would be possible with efficient organization, but without the Government interfering in the control of the business in any way. When governments meddle in such matters, they always make a mess of them.",31
68,Mr MANN,CANBERRA HOUSING,The honourable member seems to me to be advocating government interference.,32
69,Mr FOSTER,CANBERRA HOUSING,"I am supporting a proposal to provide the sinews of war for primary producers, who should know best how to run their own business.",32
70,Mr BLAKELEY,CANBERRA HOUSING,The honourable member is advocating the socialization of industry.,32
71,Mr FOSTER,CANBERRA HOUSING,"If so, I am advocating a very much better brand of Socialism than that which the honourable member advocates. I want to direct attention to the enormous increase in our exports of wine. Officers of the Tariff Board and of the Trade and Customs Department are of the opinion that the increase in these exports for next year will be equal to that for the last eighteen months. If that expectation is realized, and if , by a concentrated effort on the improvement, t f organization, here and abroad, we could secure half the profits of the dealers on the other side of the world, the rate of bounty now proposed might be considered handsome, and possibly the industry manufacture could be continued successfully indefication of wine for export. pendent of any bounty. I know that the manufacturers of wine for export are not making fortunes at the present time. They are carrying on their export busiand ness on the lowest possible margin. They would not continue to carry it on but for the confident expectation that very soon the demand for their products abroad will increase to such an extent as to tax all their resources. They believe that they will then be able to recoup much of the money they are really losing, and not making, today in the business. It is possible that the industry may shortly benefit as the result of a greater degree of preference being given to our products by Great Britain. The growth of feeling in favour of dominion preference is not confined to any particular section in the British Parliament. There appears to a general realization that the policy presents the right attitude for Great Britain to adopt towards the dominions. The extension of this policy may shortly render it possible for this industry to continued unimpaired, even with the low rate of bounty. I regret that the Goturn, vernment did not offer .at least another 6d. by way of bounty. It would cerWakefield tainly have done' so if the Minister Trade and Customs were as generous dealing with this industry, as by a soaralone, ing tariff which delights his soul, he been in dealing with other industries, many of which are less deserving of supdried fruit s industry. port than that now under consideration.",32

I do not think that the industry could have carried on during last two or three years without it . The chief object in the introduction of the measure was to come to the assistance the growers of doradilla grapes. bounty has led to a large quantity of lexias and currants being used in of proof spirit for the fortiI t is admitted by the departmental officers that lexias and currants are produced at a loss for the purpose of export as dried fruits, they are being diverted in increasing tonnage to the manufacture of spirit for the fortification of wine. It is possible that this development will increase to such an extent that lexias aud currants produced in Australia will cease to be exported, and will be used for local consumption. I am sorry that I did not hear the speech of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, but I understand that he advocated an export bounty upon lexias and currants, so that they may be sent abroad as dried fruits instead of being used for the manufacture of fortifyin g spirit. I strongly support that request, and ask be the Minister to state the Government's reintentions in that regard. The overwhelming majority of the growers is in favour of that course. They say that, as the Government has by legislative enactbe ment increased their cost of production in order to help other industries, they, in are entitled to assistance from this Parliament. The honourable member for referred to the tariff; he has for consistently advocated that the Governi n ment should leave private enterprise and he was twitted by the honorhas able member for Darling with having advocated government interference in the The honourable member is hardly as inconsistent as his critic would lead the House to believe, because, had the Government lef t this industry alone, it would not now be to come to Parliament for assistt . I ance. The high tariff has increased the cost of living and production, and the say that, the Parliament having adopted a policy of artificial stimulation for other industries, should logically help them with a bounty, which would enable them to withstand the high cost of production. The Development and Migragaltion Commission recently commenced an into the dried fruits industry, and the I assume that within the ambit of that investigation will come the request for a the bounty. I am hopeful that the result of the inquiry will be to awaken the Government to a clearer perception of the jusof tice of the growers' claim to some form The of bounty that will enable them to get for their product the cost of production. the The fact cannot be too often or too strongly emphasized that they cannot continue to pay Australian costs of production in respect of 100 per cent, of their produce, and receive Australian prices for 20 to 25 per cent., and the world's market prices for the balance. Wrapped up with the dried f r u it s dustry is the whole problem of developing the Murray valley. If the word "" fail u r e "" is to be written across the face of this industry, it is time we reconsidered the huge amounts of money that are being spent in locking the River Murray. If this industry cannot be put on a profitable basis, what industries in that valley can be? We hear much talk of the huge population that the Murray valley will carry in the future, but the size of that population wil l be governed entirely by the economic position of those already settled there. I commend the bill. No doubt, the Government made full in quiries before fixing the amount of the bounty, which I hope will be sufficient; but I regret that it is not what it was before. I ask the Minister to grapple with the problem presented by the low prices of currants and lexias, and to indicate clearly to the House the attitude of the Government towards the request for an export bounty on those products.  Trade and Customs) [2.35] - I was not able to grasp the figures quoted by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, but I admitted, when moving the second reading, that viewed from some angles the wine bounty is uneconomic. position of the dried f r u it s industry has been well stated by the honourable members for Y a r r a and W i m mera. Delegates representing the industry, including one of its leading lights, Mr Howie, concentrated for a long time upon the wine bounty as a means of relieving the growers, and honourable members are aware that the Government delayed its conclusions in regard to that bounty, because the producers of dried fruits turned their attention from it , and made a further request for an export bounty on their products in lieu.",33
74,Mr SCULLIN,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Was it in lieu 'of, or supplementary to, the wine bounty?  supplementary to the wine bounty. any case further inquiries had to be made before the Government could come to any conclusion on that point. Its decision concerning the wine bounty was stated by me today. In regard to the application for a bounty on the export of lexias and currants the Development and Migration Commission, as stated by the honourable member for Wimmera, is maki n - ing an investigation into the economic position of the industry, and obviously that inquiry will greatly help the reference to the Tariff Board at an early date of the growers' application for a bounty. Having regard to what has been said today the House wil l be satisfied that further economic inquires are necessary. The Government wil l do its best to keep this industry alive under fair conditions.",34
75,Mr STEWART,CANBERRA HOUSING,"What will the growers do in the meantime?  f r u i ts industry has had a considerable amount of attention. Not long ago a sum of nearly £200,000 was written off in respect of advances made to growers a few years ago.",34

The economic inquiry into the industry by the Development and Migration Commission must continue, and be followed by an investigation by the Tariff Board. All I can say at present is that the Government has no desire to see the industry fail, or In to do less for it than has already been done, provided it can prove that it is right and proper that the taxpayers should bear an additional burden.",34

82,Mr SCULLIN,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Y a r r a ) agree with what the Government One of the weaknesses of the act is that it does not give power to the Minister to fix a reasonable price for all grapes.

It was only by the courtesy the Minister this morning, who lent me their his copy, that I had an opportunity of seeing Mr Oakley's minority report.

86,Mr STEWART,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Wimmera) [2.52] It has been strongly stressed that, under the act, the grower has not received as the good a deal as the wine-maker has received.

87,Mr STEWART,CANBERRA HOUSING,"That statement is in unfair. The Minister does not seem to realise that previously, rather than accept of the price offering, the growers allowed f r u it to rot on the ground. The act, like many of the relief measures for the If unfortunate grower, does not give him the benefit that it was intended by Parliament to give him. I hope that the Minister, in assessing the price to be paid for f r u it s that come with in the ambit of the bounty, will safeguard the interests of the growers.",35
88,Mr SCULLIN,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Yarra) agree with the remarks of the honourable member for ""Wimmera (Mr Stewart). This clause really gives the Minister power to withhold the bounty from a wine-maker unless a fair price is paid to the grower. ""When the original legislation was before Parliament, I maintained that it should apply to all grapes. endorse the statement of the honourable member that the growers, whom this legislation was intended to benefit, receive the least benefit of all. It has been stated that immediately the bounty was given the price of doradilla grapes increased from £2 or £3 to £6 10s. a ton, but it must be remembered that two or three years before the growers were obtaining £6 a ton for their grapes. Assuming that the direct result of the bounty was an increased price of £3 a ton, it must be borne in mind that the bounty paid to the wine-makers and distillers was £14 13s. a ton. It is evident that only a small portion of the bounty will be received by the growers. If the grower received direct the bounty of £1'4 13s. a ton, he could well afford to sell his grapes to the wineries at £2 or £3 a ton. In the light of the administration of the existing legislation, I believe that the whole scheme will have to be reconsidered. I suggest that the Minister, in exercising his powers,' should bear in mind that this legislation was passed to give the growers their fair proportion of the bounty, aud that that is still the intention of this Parliament.",36
89,Mr COOK,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Indi ) [ 2 . 5 7 ] stood the Minister to say that the average selling price of wine exported to the United Kingdom was Is. lOd. a gallon, f.o.b. I suggest that he should take into consideration the systematic organization of the local market.

There is, therefore, an enormous local market awaiting exploitation here, provided that it is properly and economically organized. Clause agreed to. Clause 6 agreed to.",36
90,Mr GULLETT,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Henty ) [8.58] - I move That the following new clause be inserted4A. The principal Act is amended, by inserting after section 9 the following new section:-9A . NO bounty shall be payable in respect of wine which is not [2.54] - I shown, to the satisfaction of the Minister, to be the product of areas actually planted with vines on the 31st day of Marcli, 1927. This new clause, if passed, would prevent the bounty from being payable on areas of vineyards that may be planted because of the advantages given under this legisI lation, the intention of which, I take it , was to give relief to vignerons whose areas were already established, and particularly to some thousands of soldier settlers who had actually been encouraged by the Government to embark in the doradilla grape industry. I am entirely in accord with the bill, but I should be sorry indeed to think that this committee intended to give indefinite encouragement to the extension of the wine-making industry in Australia on a subsidized basis. I am not able to in for m the committee as to the plantings of vines in the past few years, but it is perfectly obvious that, as a result of the bounty of 4s. a gallon, there has been an enormous increase in wine-making.",36
91,Mr SCULLIN,CANBERRA HOUSING,That is not due to extra planting.,36
92,Mr GULLETT,CANBERRA HOUSING,"That is true; but vine cultivation has been so profitable during the past three years, and will be i u the future while the bounty continues, that a rapid extension of the area of our vineyards is inevitable. The growth of this bounty is sensational. In the financial year 1925-26 the total amount - I under- paid, was £217,000, and it is certain that the amount will reach £400,000 for the current financial year, and will probably be quite as high next year even at the reduced rate provided for in the bill. I am sympathetic with the measure, and am delighted to see this Parliament, which has given such practical encouragement to secondary industries, engaged in considering, this kind of assistance to an important primary industry;. but I am not prepared to continue indefinitely the subsidizing of any primary industry to the extent either of the old or the new bounty. It has been pointed out that the value of wine in respect of which the bounty has been paid, is about Is. lOd. per gallon, and that the Government has been adding to that about 4s. a gallon. We have been paying a subsidy amounting to upwards of 200 per cent., and under the new proposal we shall pay 150 per cent. In the interests of the taxpayers and economy we ought not to continue to pay the bounty without restriction. If my amendment is accepted it will uot be a breach of faith, nor will it impose any serious hardship on existing growers, but will be an expression of our willingness to give support to the vinegrowers already in the business. The bounty was not intended to aggravate the problems of the industry, but to provide relief for the vine-growers, particularly the soldier settlers. It will not achieve its object by encouraging boundlessly the expansion of the industry on .an artificial basis. I commend the amendment to the .earnest consideration of the committee.  Trade and Customs) [3.5] - On behalf of the Government I accept the amendment, which seems to be the logical corollary of what I said regarding organization when speaking on the second reading of the bill this morning, and it also seems to accord with the observations made during this debate. It will not inflict any hardship on the growers already possessing fully-matured vines, or even on growers who have new vines planted. It will not prevent growers from re-planting vines, but will be a gesture by this Parliament to the growers to organize and ultimately dispense with the bounty, and it provides for the continuance of the bounty during the process of organizing. I am hopeful that very soon the whole of the industry will be placed on a more economic basis.",36
93,Mr SCULLIN,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Yarra) [3.7] - I - offer no objection to the amendment, which the Minister has correctly described as a gesture. That is all the effect it will have. When vines planted before the 31st March this year come into bearing, the bounty provided in this bill will have ceased; but I point out that even if it is continued, there will be great difficultly in applying the amendment. It will be necessary to discriminate between different areas, and possibly between different States. In Western Australia this industry is just starting, and it is impossible to say what will happen in thedifferent parts of that State. Large areas might be exempt from receiving a bounty, and if that happened it might be held that this Parliament was discriminating between different, parts of a State, or between different States. Across the Murray from Mildura large areas have been planted with vines, and the area under vines will be considerably extended this year. I agree with the honourable member for Henty (Mr Gullett) that we should not extend by bounty the area under vines, and thus increase the complexity of the problem we are tryin g to solve.",37
94,Mr FOSTER,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Wakefield) [ 3 . 9 ] - I am sorry to say that I cannot agree to the amendment. It amounts to a notification that vines planted after 31st March this year, which will come into bearing in three years' time, will not participate in the bounty; and it is also an indication that, in the opinion of this Parliament, the l i m it of safety has been reached in the growing of grapes. I do not in the least believe that.",37
95,Mr SCULLIN,CANBERRA HOUSING,"It does not mean that. Mr Foster,-Then what, in the name of conscience, does it mean? It will certainly be interpreted in the way I have suggested. This Parliament, with three other Parliaments, is committed to au expenditure of £10,000,000 or £11,000,000 for locking the Murray, and developmental work connected therewith. Our last Governor General, and the Governor General who preceded him, both held similar opinions about the value of the M u r r a y lands. Lord Forster told me just before he left these shores that in 40 or 50 years' time there would be half a million people on the M u r r a y lands. He took great interest in that matter while he was in this country. The Murray is one of our priceless possessions; it is a source of wealth which, to our disgrace, we have hitherto allowed to flow into the sea. The Murray lands have a great and glorious future, and, therefore, I cannot be a party to placing shackles on those who believe in them. I shall vote against the amendment. Mr M . CAMERON (Barker) [3.11] The effect of the amendment will be to create an almost impossible situation, and to depreciate the value of many vineyards. It will undoubtedly retard the planting of vineyards. I fail to see how the department can so police the provision as to ensure that only a certain proportion of the grapes from a particular vineyard receive the bounty, '.rhe amendment also provides differential treatment for the primary and secondary producers. When a tariff wall which has been erected is enabling the secondary producer to compete in the world's markets, we do not proceed to take the advantage away from him. not izi favour of this Government treating the primary producer differently from the secondary producer, and therefore I cannot see my way to support the amendment.",37
96,Mr COOK,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Indi ) [ 3 . 1 3 ] that the Minister accepted the amendment. The honourable Henty (Mr Gullett) is a city representative who is anxious, just as I am, to encourage secondary industries, but when he is faced witli a proposal to assist an important primary industry, he throws cold water on it . him that 96 per cent, of our total exports last year were primary products. The amendment is equivalent to saying to the vignerons, "" Cease producing,"" and if that is justified, we might as well say to the dairymen, "" Cease breeding cows,"" or to the wheat-farmers, "" Cease sowing wheat."" A large area of this country is still undeveloped, and yet it appears that many honourable members are ready to support a proposal to put the brake on. The cry is, "" We are overproducing,"" and we have heard the same about apples and many other products. I trust that the Minister, on reconsideration, will reject the amendment, on the ground that it will have the effect of discouraging an important primary industry. If we have Rechabites or prohibitionists in the chamber who wish to abolish the wine-making industry altogether, let us look at the subject from their point of view; but it is ridiculous for us, with the one hand, to spend £470,000 in encouraging the industry, and, with the other, to cut its throat.",38
97,Mr MARRS,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Wentworth) [3.16] I know very little about wine except that on occasions it is liquid sunshine; but the new clause appeals to me, provided that it would not have the effect of retarding the planting of vines. Could it not be passed now, and brought up annually for reconsideration ? The idea of the honourable member for Henty (Mr Gullett) is bo stop the spoon-feeding of industries. I am as anxious as anybody to assist our returned men to make good, but if it is impossible for them to do so on vineyards then ib is ridiculous for us to continue the paymenb of these bounties. I am glad bo say that our Australian wine is looked upon with much more favour nowadays I am bhan formerly; but when the Postmaster General (Mr Gibson) and I visited Sheffield, Manchester, Birmingham, H u l l , and other centres in England a couple of years ago, we found it impossible to get Australian wine. It is available in England and on the continent during certain months of - I am sorry the year, but then it disappears. If we are ever to do anything with the indusmember for try, we must maintain continuity of supplies. Perhaps the Minister can see some method by which our acceptance of the clause will not have the effect of preventing an extension of our vineyard areas. As it appeals to me at present, I think I remind the proposal is good, but there is a nigger in the wood pile.",38
98,Mr FOSTER,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Wakefield) [3.19] - The more. I bhink about this proposal, the more serious it becomes. I am sure the Government has not carefully considered it. The Minister himself has spoken of the prospects of enormous developments in our wine production. We have so far barely touched the fringe of the London market. If the demand that we are creating there continues to grow, as we have every reason to expect that it will , and in a year or two we should find ourselves in the position of not being able to meet it, we should lose the market for ever. This is the most insane proposal I have ever heard. We should never have dreamed of spending millions of pounds in locking the Murray River if we had intended to limi t the development of this industry. Surely honourable members cannot think seriously of indicating to the world by a provision in an act of Parliament that the Murray has reached the limit of its development.",38
99,Mr GULLETT,CANBERRA HOUSING,Not at all.,38
100,Mr FOSTER,CANBERRA HOUSING,"That is what this amendment would do. I have been in contact with men who have lived a lifetime next door to starvation on the Murray, and who now see a glorious future opening up for them. They are totally opposed to this proposal, and their view should carry more weight than the opinion of an honourable member who represents a city constituency. I trust that the Government will not spoil its reputation by accepting this proposal. Seeing that the Development and Migration Commission is investigating the whole subject of the development of the Murray, let ns at least hold our hands until its report has come to hand.",38
101,Mr MARRS,CANBERRA HOUSING,Surely we could agree to the amendment on the understanding that it would come up for review each year.,39
102,Mr FOSTER,CANBERRA HOUSING,Does the honourable member propose that we should make the men who are spending their lives developing this country dependent upon an annual decision in a matter of this kind ? I trust that the amendment will be rejected.,39
103,Mr STEWART,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Wimmera) [3.24] While I appreciate the object of the honourable member for Henty (Mr Gullett) in moving for the insertion of this clause in the bill I feel that it is too serious a gesture to make at this a-ltage in the development of the industry. ""With the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr . Foster), I think we should be wise to take no action in this direction u n t il report of the Development and Migration Commission has come to hand. I triist that the Government will urge the Commission to submit its report at the earliest possible moment. The amount of planting that will be done between now and the time when the report of the commission comes to hand will be negligible. If the commission reported that the planting of more vines would be uneconomic, I do not think any honourable member would favour the extension of the in dustry. None of us desires to subsidize an uneconomic industry. The planting that is going on at present in the area mentioned by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Scullin V and in several other States, should not be unnecessarily hindered.",39
104,Mr GULLETT,CANBERRA HOUSING,Surel v over-subsidized production should be limited ?,39
105,Mr STEWART,CANBERRA HOUSING,"I ask the honourable member for Henty t.o withdraw his amendment, pending the receipt of the report of the Development and Migration Commission.",39
106,Mr DUNCAN,CANBERRA HOUSING,"HUGHES (Boothby) [3.28] - A good deal may be said in favour of this proposal, which is based on the assumption that the object the Government had three years ago, when it provided for the payment of a bounty on wine, was to keep the industry alive during a difficult period in its development, but not to pay a bounty indefinitely. The real justification for our acceptance of this clause is the statement that we have repeatedly heard that unless the bounty is provided the industry cannot possibly develop. From that point of view the attitude of the honourable member for Henty is sound. But I can see that difficulties will arise if the clause is passed. It will undoubtedly be said to give a monopoly to those planters who have already established their vineyards. Then it will place in an unfair position people who may have paid a fairly high price for land for vineyard purposes. If we accept the date stated in the clause, namely, the 31st of March, we should add a proviso that it shall not apply in the cases of persons who can prove beyond question that they bought land with the intention of planting vineyards. These people should be placed upon the same basis as those who have actually planted their vines. The honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) pointed out that the difficulty would be experienced i u administration. There is no doubt about that. The proposal"" of the honourable member for Henty rests on the sound basis that the Government, while it desires to encourage those engaged in the industry, particularly returned soldiers, haa no wish that the industry should be bolstered up indefinitely at the expense of the taxpayers. I support that view; but we should provide that where a grower could prove that he had already purchased land with the specific object of planting vines, he should receive exemption.",39
107,Mr FENTON,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Maribyrnong) [3.32] As I think that the proposal might result in reduced preparation of land for cultivation, I shall oppose it . The Minister for Trade and Customs himself said that it was a hint to those who were inclined to plant with a view to the production of wine or f r u it for drying, that, if they planted after the 31st March, they would not be likely to receive a bounty. The warning given by the Minister was quite sufficient to cause those proposing . to extend vineyards to move warily. The honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Foster) reminded us that millions were being spent in the Murray ""Valley, where developments that we little dream of are likely to take place. Any action that would retard that deand 4s. a gallon. velopment would be a step in the wrong - direction. I shall oppose the new clause.",39
108,Mr BLAKELEY,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Darling) [3.35] There has been little time for the confor sideration of this far-reaching and exance for them. traordinary proposal, which is revolutionary so far as the Commonwealth Government is concerned. It is proposed, port adopted. under the clause, to do certain things which far less important bodies than this Parliament would hesitate to do at halfan-hour's notice. I object to the proposedposed new clause, because it amounts to an instruction to the growers not to take certain action.",40
109,Mr GULLETT,CANBERRA HOUSING,"He n t y ) [3.36] - I view of the exception taken to the clause, I ask leave to withdraw it ; but I do so with infinite regret. I am sorry that the bill has come along so late in the session. The interest shown in it indicates that a measure involving 'an expenditure £1,000,000 at least of the taxpayers' taxpayers. money deserves more consideration than we are able to give it in the dying hours of the session. I think that of misconception exists as to what the effect of my proposal would have been. It would not have p ut an end to the party of which planting of vines. It merely implied that growers whochoose to plant a parbe ticular variety of grape within the next few years would take a risk of not ceiving the proposed heavy bounty. Mr STEWART.*-That would be sufficient to curtail extension.",40
110,Mr GULLETT,CANBERRA HOUSING,"It would be a very f proper thing to do in the interests of the country, as a whole, and particularly of at the growers concerned. I have had as much to do with the primary producers as most honourable members have, and I have a great deal of sympathy with them; but I desire to warn them that they would be unwise in anticipating the continuance of a high bounty. Surely the Parliament does not wish to foster any primary industry on a hopelessly arthe tificial basis. The honourable member for Wakefield referred to the sinking of £11,000,000 in development along the Murray Valley. The expenditure soon be increased ""to £111,000,000, if continue to legislate on the lines adopted in connection with the wine i dustry, when wine worth Is. lOd. a gallon is subsidized to the extent of 3s.

112,Mr BRENNAN,CANBERRA HOUSING,"If that were so, we might eventually realise the ideals of the I am spokesman. I believe that a bill of this kind should considered in relation to the deliberate statement by the Minister in introducing reit, namely, that the economic position of this country is indeed parlous. My principal object in rising was to endorse the view expressed by the honourable member for Yarra, with respect to the dried r u it s industry. I regret profoundly that the wine bounty was not diverted, in part, least, to the dried f r u it s industry, to which it could be more efficaciously and economically applied. In company with the honourable member for Yarra, and by the courtesy of the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart), I recently visited the Mildura district, and noticed the development that has taken place in dried fruits industry. Consistently with what I said at the outset of my remarks, I realise that it is a bad policy to attempt to carry on the shoulmay ders of the taxpayers an industry that we cannot succeed on its own merits; in my opinion, the dried f r u it s industry does n - not come within that category. I endorse what has been said in regard to those responsible for encouraging returned soldiers and others to open up fruit-growing settlements. If the Government is in a bounteous mood, it should surely extend its hounty to those settlers. Even the most niggardly in the granting of bounties will not deny that these industrious men should be supported in their high endeavour, since they are where they are because of the promises made by the Government itself. I hope that the Minister for Trade and Customs will take serious note of the position that has heen disclosed during the debate, and as an act of sound administration, as well as an effort to do the fair thing, w i that justice is done to the growers of dried fruits, particularly in the area concerning which I have acquired first hand knowledge.",40
113,Mr MANN,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Perth) [3.47] - Owing to circumstances over which I had no control, I was for the last hour unable to express any opinion on this measure, and it is on that account I take advantage of the opportunity to speak on the motion for the third reading. I am aware that I cannot refer to what took place in committee on the bill, but I want to say that I regret very much that the bounty should be continued without any indication as to when it will cease to onerate. The giving a bounty to an industry of this kind is unsound and uneconomic. It has only been justified by honourable members on the ground that it has been necessary to enable those who were in duced by the Government to take up this class of primary production to keep going at all. It was frankly stated that the bounty was intended only to enable the producers to get on their feet and industry into a sound position. Unless the Government does draw hard and fast lines and says that, while it is perfectly willing to pay the bounty to engaged in the industry, but is unwilling that it should be indefinitely extended, the confessed object of this legislation must inevitably be defeated. It has been contended that to restrict the which this legislation shall apply would have the eifect of diminishing the value 26 of the interests of those already engaged in the industry, but it must have exactly the reverse effect. To improve the finanin cial position of those at present receiving amended. the bounty, must give greater promise that they will be able to get on their feet and become independent of government aid. If it is recognized, as I think it is, that these bounties are economically unsound, surely we should take such steps as may be necessary to enable the industry to be established on an economic basis as soon as possible. If the bounty is to be extended indefinitely, and we are to say to any settler who plants in the next two or three years that he, also, will receive the bounty, we shall be faced with the difficulty that we shall be paying money to settlers to continue, and even to in l l see crease, the very competition which is making the industry at the present time unsound and unprofitable.",41
114,Mr MAKKS,CANBERRA HOUSING,The amendment suggested would have dealt with that matter.,41
115,Mr MANN,CANBERRA HOUSING,"I cannot, at this stage, refer to the amendment, but honourable members are aware of what I am dealing with. If we are serious in our intention to give this bounty in order to help the industry to get on its feet, surely we should not take steps that must in evitably have the effect of knocking its feet from under it . Honourable members know that I do not approve of the payment of bounties, and if they are sincere in the view they express generally of the uneconomic character of bounties, they should agree to some limitation of operation for this measure and should not permit the bounty to go on indefinitely.

Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation reported. In committee (Consideration of Governor General's message) : Motion (by Dr EARLE PAGE ) agreed toThat it is expedient that an appropriation of revenue be made for the purposes of a bill for an act to grant and apply out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund a sum for old-age and invalid pensions. Resolution reported. Standing Orders suspended, and resolution adopted. Ordered prepare and bring in a bill to carry out the foregoing resolution. Bill presented by Dr EARLE PAGE, and read a first time. SECOND READING.",43
132,Dr EARLE PAGE,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Cowper-Trea surer) [4.7] - I move That the bill be now read a second time. of these absurd questions? The purpose of this bill is to provide the Consolidated Revenue Fund the sum of £10,000,000 for the payment of in this way? invalid and old-age pensions. The meaHigh sure does not deal with the rate of pension or the conditions under which they are payable. The usual practice for an appropriation of £10,000,000 to made from the Consolidated Revenue Fund and placed, from time to time, the trust account from which the pen38 years. sions are paid. The total appropriation for this purpose up to date is £81,250,000, of which £75,747,000 had been expended name twice. at the 2Sth February, 1927, leaving balance of appropriation of £5,803,000 still available. As the expenditure invalid ancl old-age pensions is now the rate of £9,000,000 per annum, it will be seen that this balance is only suffiodically cient for approximately seven months. It is, therefore necessary to appropriate a further amount of £10,000,000.",44
133,Dr MALONEY,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Melbourne) [4.8] I again enter my protest against the cruelty of asking old-age pensioners answer six pages of questions when applying for a pension. I think interrogations number about 57. Even if an applicant was born in Australia has to answer a query as to the ship in which he arrived; he must state the maiden name of his mother and the name of his father. What has this informathan tion to do with an application for pension? The questions should be and simple. Every old person who has borne the heat and burden of the day, for 65 years in the case of a man and England. CO years in the case of a womau, should be able to receive a pension without having to answer the interminable tions that no government would dare to ask of a highly-paid official who was about to retire. Why, too, should an applithe cant be disqualified because of the session of a small amount of money? A. person who has £310 in the Savings Bank cannot draw a penny in pension, but he may own a house Worth £5,000, without sacrificing his full pension, if he occupies it as his own home, and does not draw from it more than 12s. 6d. weekly for the letting of rooms. - When the late Queen Alexandra was granted an allowance of £80,000 per annum, was she requiredto answer any Are high from oflicials who retire from the Defence Department upon a pension interrogated Will the judges of the Court, when they retire, be asked to fill in six pages of questions before they can draw the pensions which this is Parliament has declared they may have? be Through my office in Elizabeth-street over 5,000 old-age, invalid, and war in pensioners have passed during the last Some of the old folks could barely write their signatures; yet on one page they are asked to sign their For the' most serious a document in law, a will, one signature by the testator suffices. Why should not on one be enough on an application for a at pension? Another signature is required on a card that has to be filled in. Perieach pensioner has to answer many more questions and sign before a magistrate. If Liberal and Nationalist thought had agreed with Labour thought there would be no impedi- ment to a man or woman, who had been thrifty, drawing a full pension. to If an intendingapplicant tells me that he has £200 or £300 I advise him to the invest it in a home for himself, so that he may have a chance to draw a full he pension. What harm would be done to the Commonwealth if a millionaire were to draw the full pension of £1 per week? The Treasury would recover much more that amount from him in the form a of taxation. Let us build up a system few of helping the aged and infirm that is not characterized by the degradation and infamy of the poor-house regulations in Many of the questions upon the application form seem to have been taken from those regulations. As a former queshouse surgeon in London, I know what the old poor-houses were, but because of the growth of democratic sentiment and development of the Labour party in posthe Old Country, these establishments, now called infirmaries, are on a much better footing. Re-visiting one in a district of London in which I had worked as a house surgeon, I could not help noticing the improvement that had been effected. I am not attacking the officials in charge of the Pensions Departcharacter, ment. ""Within the limits prescribed the act and regulations they are kindly instance, provision disposed to the pensioners. I was very regretful when the administration of pensions was transferred from the State departments, but I am sure that the Commonwealth officials are all from that we could wish them to be. Dr Dane, who examines, applicants for invalid pensions, is, however, somewhat severe. Even if he is acting under i structions from the department, and enorders deavouring to save money, he should not be so hard-hearted. I ask the Treasurer to see if regulations cannot be drafted simplify procedure.",44

135,Mr LATHAM,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Kooyong-Attorney General) [4.18] - I move That the bill be read a second time. Certain preliminary steps, including framing of regulations, have already been taken to bring into operation the ruptcy Act passed by Parliament some time ago. The State Premiers have been consulted, and conferences of Attorneysinvalid. General and the State bankruptcy officers held. Since the principal act was passed various representations have been received from chambers of the commerce and other bodies concerning its provisions, which have been subjected to a most acute and searching investigabankruptcy tion. As a result of conferences the representatives of the States and the Commonwealth bankruptcy officers, certain amendments have been agreed to, and they are now embodied in this bill. inspector-general in bankruptcy has appointed as required by the act, when this measure is passed our bankwhich, ruptcy law will be brought into operaruptcy tion. A number of forms have been preof pared and printed, registers have also been compiled, and inquiries made conit cerning the appointment of the necessary staffs and their accommodation in the ferent States. The amendments proposed in the bill are to a large extent of a but are necessary in order to by make our bankruptcy law effective. For has been made whereby' an official receiver, charged with the administration of an estate and responsible for the safety of the assets, shall give security. This was an omission the principal act which is now bein° remedied - More effective provision is also made for the enforcement of the orders of the court by providing that they shall n - be enforced in the same manner as are of the H i gh Court. As the act stands at present an individual who had committed an act of bankruptcy immedito ately before the commencement of the act could not be proceeded against the under a State act which had ceased to Penoperate, and, as the Commonwealth law was not in operation, he could not be proceeded against under Provision has, therefore, been made to overcome that difficulty. The principal other amendments include an addition to section 96A, which is covered by clause 12 of the bill, which is to protect members of the publice dealing in good f a it h with a person who subsequently becomes bankrupt. Speaking generally, where an order of sequestration is made, the the property of the bankrupt is vested in the official receiver as from the date of Bankthe act of bankruptcy, and payments previously made to the bankrupt, which were valid at the time, may be rendered It is, therefore, important to include a provision protecting persons who deal in good f a it h with one who subsequently becomes insolvent. Those are main provisions of the bill. There are, other minor amendments. As the measure is necessary in order to make our law effective, I submit it to between the House with confidence.",45
136,Dr MALONEY,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Melbourne) [ 4 . 2 5 ] - I An congratulate the Government and the been, Attorney-General (Mr Latham) upon and introducing this amending measure, I understand, will bring our banklaw up to date. Whenever a bill this nature is introduced, I ask Mr . Joseph Woolf, a legal friend of mine, if contains anything that will lessen the protection afforded to women and chil-' difdren. For over 50 years, the women and girls of Victoria have been well protected, minor and I am informed that in this measure that protection may be reduced. I approached the Attorney-General, who, with his usual courtesy, assisted me. When the measure is in committee, it is my in tention to move thatAfter sub-section 7, after paragraph (K ) , the following paragraph he inserted:(i) that there is an unsatisfied judgment ugainst the insolvent in any action for assault, breach of promise, or seduction, or for any malicious injury, or for damages in a divorce suit As the eifect of this amendment can be more effectively explained when the bil l is i u committee, I shall not comment further upon it at this stage.",45
137,Mr CORSER,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Wide Bay) [ 4 . 2 8 ] am glad the Government has introduced a bill to amend the Bankruptcy Act, which contains some of the amendments desired; but which, unfortunately, does not include others which have been suggested and are important. State, such as Queensland, difficulty is experienced by business men in dealing with up-country debtors. I have in mind, more particularly, retail storekeepers, who have been supplying small farming settlers during periods of drought other times when they have been faced with adversity. The storekeepers, honest men, are sometimes heavily indebted to the merchants, who may allow them to continue provided an experienced trustee is appointed to supervize their operations and they continueto supply the firms who are trustworthy. It is unreasonable to expect tent trustee to carry work for a commission of 1£ per cent, on the turnover, particularly when he has to travel long distances to reach different centres to ascertain the nature of orders, audit the books, and submit a report to the creditors. the Attorney-General - to make the minimum rate of commission 1$ per cent. The Minister notified that he would agree to the request. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee. Clauses 1 and 2 agreed to.

138,Mr LATHAM,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Kooyong-Attorney General) [4.32] - This clause deals with the position of official receivers who have charge of the assets of insolvents. It is obviously proper that they should give security. No difficulty arises with respect to clauses 4 to 11. Clause 12 is entirely for the protection of the public. Clause agreed to. Clauses 4 to 12 agreed to. Clause 13.

139,Dr MALONEY,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Melbourne) [4.33] I propose to moveI n a large That the following new sub-paragraph be inserted :[ba) by inserting in sub-section (7) after paragraph (fc) the following paragraph :"" (2) That there is an unsatisfied judgment against the insolwith goods vent in any action for asor at sault breach of promise or seduction or for any malicious injury or for damages in any divorce suit."" It is possible to have a breach of promise of marriage without seduction, which may be a serious matter. A case in point occurred in the High Court today. Mr Owen Dixon, K . C , declared a compe- that the defendant, had refused to pay on such his debts for life, aJthough the appellant had won a breach of promise action against him in 1914, and obtained judgment for £ 4 7 2 . The judgment of the High Court was to refuse the certificate of the insolvent for l if e, and that he pay I urge all costs up to and including the High Court. In that case there was no question of seduction, but there was a breach of promise of marriage with great injury to the unfortunate lady concerned.",46
140,Mr LATHAM,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Kooyong - Attorney General) [4.34] - The object desired by the honourable member can, I think, be gained by amending section 121 of the act, and I am prepared t(o move an amendment, the effect of which will be that an order of discharge from insolvency would not release the bankrupt from any liability under a judgment against him in an action for breach of promise of marriage, as well as in other actions set out in that section. If the honourable member is prepared to accept that amendment, I shall move it at a later stage.",46
141,Dr MALONEY,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Melbourne) [ 4 . 3 5 [ am prepared to accept the Minister's amendment, and am grateful to him for it , but I would also point out that many malicious injuries are done. stance, a man frequently uses a bottle to hit another man on the head, and I think that that action should como under the heading of malicious in j u r y. tunately in the majority of cases damages are given when corporal punishment or imprisonment should be inflicted.",47
142,Mr LATHAM,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Kooyong - Attorney General) [4.36] - I am aware that the phrase "" malicious in j ury "" appears in similar context in the Victorian act; but it is a phrase of doubtful significance. An assault may be technical or committed in anger, and heavy damages may be given; but it may not be malicious in the ordinary or legal sense. On the other hand, there may be a malicious assault with deliberate intent to do harm without any provocation. The judgment in itself would not show whether it was in respect of a malicious injury or not. ask the honourable member not to persist with his amendment, and I shall move a new clause at the end of the bill which will provide for breach of promise of marriage. Clause 13 agreed to. Clause 14Section one hundred and twenty-three of the principal act is repealed, and the following section inserted in its stead:"" 123. Notice of all ""orders of discharge granted under section one hundred and twenty-one of this act shall be published in the Gazette, and in such other manner as is prescribed, and shall be lodged in the office of the Registrar of Titles or Registrar-General or other proper officer of each State and in such otlier places as are prescribed.""",47
143,Mr LATHAM,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Kooyong-Attorney General) [ 4 . 3 7 ] - I move That the words ""twenty-one"" be omitted with a view to insert in lieu thereof the words ""nineteen."" An error has been made in this clause. The reference to section 121 in the act should be to section 119. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clause 15 agreed to.

For in - I move That in paragraph (2) the word "" five"" be omitted with a view to insert in lieu thereof the word "" ten."" Unfor- That amendment applies to both clauses 16 and 17. The honourable member for Wide Bay (Mr Corser), in addition to his remarks this afternoon, has made certain representations to me, and I am prepared on behalf of the Government to accept his suggestion. The amendment will give power to the creditors if they think proper to pay up to 1$ per. cent, commission in a case where a trustee is authorized by them to carry on the business of the bankrupt. The particular circumstances in Queensland to which the honourable member has referred, and with which he is so familiar, indicate the desirability of allowing more freedom of action to the creditors. I The act does not fix the commission, but allows the creditor to fix it within limits. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. .Clause 17 consequentially amended and agreed to. Clause 18 agreed to. Clause 19 agreed to.",47
144,Mr LATHAM,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Kooyong-Attorney General) [ 4 . 4 4 ] - I move That after clause 13 the following new clause be inserted :Clause 13 (a) section 121 of the principal act is amended by inserting in paragraph C of sub-section 1 after the word "" seduction"" the words "" or for breach of promise of marriage."" That will make the amendment suggested by the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr Maloney). The result will be that a bankrupt who is discharged from bankruptcy will not be released from liabilit y under a judgment against him in an action or for breach of promise of marriage.

SECOND READING.  for Markets and Migration) [4.46] - I move That the bill be now read a second time. This bill is introduced at the urgent request of the producers, whose desires have been voiced by the honourable members for Herbert (Dr Nott) and K a l goorlie (Mr A . Green). The Government feels justified in this legislation because of the importance of the pearl shell industry to Australia. About 85 per cent, of the world's supply of pearl shell comes from Australia, the annual production in the Commonwealth being approximately 2,250 tons, of an estimated value of £361,000. Of this quantity, 1,200 tons is fished at Broome, Western Australia, 1,000 tons at Thursday Island, and 50 tons at Darwin. The industry gives employment to about 3,300 persons, whilst the value of the 411 vessels engaged in the industry is approximately £212,000. In addition, trochus shell to the value of approximately £80,000 per annum is also fished in Australia. At Shark Bay, Western Australia, a variety of pearl shell is found in shallow water. shell, although much smaller in size, and consequently lighter, than the pearl shell found at . Broome and Darwin, is nevertheless of commercial value. The annual quantity of such shell fished is 185 tons, valued at £ 2 , 2 0 0 .' Eighty persons are engaged j n the industry at Shark Bay, the number of vessels employed is 35, and the value of the boats and equipment is approximately £10,685. It is posed at this juncture to include within the scope of this measure the trochus shell or the smaller pearl shell industry at Shark Bay; but the door has been left open to include them later, should the persons engaged in the industry in those places so desire. Although the bill does not apply to pearls, it may interest honourable members to know that the value of. the pearls produced in Australia is estimated at about £63,000 per annum. The cost of prodiicing pearl shell ranges from £150 to £170 per ton, while the prices realized for last season's shell ranged from £160 to £180 per ton, packed and delivered at Broome. Before the war, when the cost of production was lower, Australian pearl shell realized about £230 per ton abroad. Licences to fish for pearl are issued by the Sltate Governments, the cost of a licence i u Western Australia being a flat rate of £ 1 0 per vessel per annum; while at Thursday Island the annual licence fee ranges from 10s. per boat to £ 3 for a 10-ton ship, and up to a maximum of £ 2 0 for ships exceeding 10 tons. Under the Western Australian law no licence other than a diver's, diver's tender, or pearl dealer's licence, is granted to any person who is not a British subject, the object being to preclude aliens fro m sharing in the profits of the industry. As it was found that the law was being circumvented by "" dummying,"" amending legislation was passed in 1924, which made it practically impossible for "" dummying "" to be carried on. Although there are still suspicions in a few cases, it can be said that "" dummying "" has practically been wiped out, and that Asiatics have no interest in the industry except their wages. Information has been received from a reliable source to the effect that all of the owners of pearling vessels, both at Thursday Island and at Broome, are Australians of European descent. A great deal of Japanese and othercoloured labour is This employed in the pearling industry. That is unavoidable, because persons of those races are specially fitted for the work of diving for shell. In addition to Japanese, numbers of Koepangers, Malays, and Chinese are employed, permission to introduce such labour being obtained from the Minister for Home and Territories. A bond of £ 1 00 for each man is entered into. In Western Australia the not proremuneration of the divers, who are principally Japanese, varies from £ 2 0 to £52 per ton of pearl shell fished, according to the size and equipment of the vessel, the quantity of shell fished, and the price of the shell. The maximum wage to be paid to divers is fixed annually by the Executive Council of that State, and is gazetted. The object of fixing the maximum, wage is to prevent "" dummying."" The Pearling Act of Western Australia provides that any remuneration paid in excess of the gazetted figures shall be deemed to be a share in the profits; and sharing of the profits by an Asiatio is illegal. The pearling season in Western Australia commences about the beginning of March, and coneludes about the end of November. The vessels are then laid up u n t i l the commencement of the next season. The .home trade in pearl shell is negligible; practically the whole of the output is exported. W it h a view to eliminating the speculator, whose actions are having an adverse effect on the industry, the pearlers' associations of Broome and Thursday Island have requested the appointment of an overseas marketing board, vested with the powers set out in the bill. The request is also supported by the Gommonwealth Board of Trade. As the pearling season has now commenced, it is desirable that this legislation shall be passed as early as possible, in order that a poll of the producers may be taken, and that, should a favourable verdict be obtained from them, the board may be established in time to deal with the 1927 production. It will be seen that this measure is framed on the same lines as the acts dealing with the export of dairy produce, dried fruits, and canned fruits. It should be unnecessary to devote much time to the machinery clauses of the bill, seeing that only last night, in connection with the Fresh Fruits Overseas Marketing Bill , we discussed similar provisions. It is proposed to appoint a board of three members, one to be appointed by those persons engaged in the industry at Broome, another by those at Thursday Island and Darwin , the third member, who will be a commercial man, being appointed by the Commonwealth Government. In its present for m the bill does not provide that those persons engaged in the industry at Darwin shall participate in the election of a member of the board, or in the poll which will decide whether the act shall be brought into operation; but, in committee, I shall move an amendment to include them. Although they produce only 50 tons of shell per annum at Darwin, as eompared with 1,200 tons at Broome and 1,000 tons at Thursday Island and Torres Straits, the Government considers that they should not be ignored when legislation dealing with the industry in which they are engaged is under consideration.",47
145,Mr BLAKELEY,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Will they be included of in the Western Australian or the Thurspeople day Island section?  cluded in the Thursday Island section because, by reason of the shipping arrangements at Darwin, they are m closer contact with Thursday Island than with Broome. I desire to emphasize that this legislation will not be brought into operation unless and u n t il a majority of the votes of those engaged in the industry favours that being done.. Voting at the poll, both in relation to the coming into operation of the act and the appointment of the board, will be restricted to boatowners. That provision is made because all the boat-owners engaged in - the industry are Australians of European decent.' The various State Governments concerned do not issue licences for pearl fishing to other than Australian subjects. The machinery clauses of the bill are identical with those in other legislation which has been passed by this Parliament. Power is given to the board, when appointed, to accept the responsibility for the sale of such pearl shell as may voluntarily be placed under its control by those who produce it . That will enable the producers to obtain from the board, through the Rural Credits Department of the Commonwealth Bank, advances on the security of their product. The board may also grant licences to exporters carrying on business in the industry, and may require them to conform to certain conditions. Otherwise, they will be prevented from exporting shell. A third advantage which should accrue from the passing of this legislation is that the board will be vested with power to negotiate on an in dustry basis in connection with freights and marine insurance. I trust that the House will agree to the second reading.",49
146,Mr BLAKELEY,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Darwin) [4.57] I regret that the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr A . Green) is not present to take part in the discussion on this bill. For many years the honourable member has endeavoured to obtain for his constituents some such marketing arrangement as this bill proposes. Because the pearl-shell industry is carried on in the sparsely populated areas in the tropical north and north-west portions of the Commonwealth, between Shark Bay and Torres Straits, and that, for the most part, those engaged in the actual securing the shell < are foreigners, many think that it is not of great value to Australia. But as a result of in - inquiries which I made when in those areas, I found that, With few exceptions, the persons who had invested capital in the industry were Australians. that at present few white men are engaged as divers for the shell; but I look forward to the time when they will engage in the work, as they do now, in diving in the more southerly waters round our coast. If white men can give satisfaction as divers in the deep waters of some of our harbours, they should be able to do the same in these shallower waters. Off the north-west coast of Western Australia, a lot of pearl shell is obtained, ancl, apparently, the harvest is inexhaustible. Areas that were fished out 40 years ago, are today providing good yields. Prior to the war, there was an ostentatious display of pearls and pearl shell in London, Berlin, Vienna, Paris, and the other great cities of the world, and it is a tragedy for those in the industry today many persons who spent money in that way are not now doing so. That is not clue to a decreased desire for the possession of the beautiful, lack of the necessary cash. countries, which formerly purchased large quantities of pearl and pearl shell, are now purchasing very little. On the other hand, the United States of which became more wealthy as a result of the war, is now able to buy, and is buying, these luxuries. It has been proved that oversea combinations of buyers have operated to the detriment of the industry. Returns in Western Australia show that pearls are one-fifth of the total value of the harvest of pearls and pearl shell, but, extraordinary to relate, no pearls are recovered in the Torres Strait, or near Thursday Island. Japanese are employed exclusively as divers there, and I have heard several explanations why pearls are not obtained. I have heard the suggestion that it is due to certain laws of Queensland and the wealth, ancl it is also said that some of the owners have entered into with the divers that all pearls recovered shall become the property of the divers. The suspicion exists in the minds of local people that there has been a lot of "" dummying."" Although I am glad to have the Minister's statement that very little "" dummying"" is done, I am at a loss to know why his informants sure of their opinion, because, so far as I could learn from personal Mr Blakeley. at Thursday Island and Port Darwin, It is true low-class white persons, who bave become, for monetary reasons, the tools of foreigners, are operating boats registered, in their names, but owned by foreigners. I realise that it is as difficult to prove d u m m y in g "" in the registration of pearling luggers, as in the registration of land. In 1920, there were in the north-west 515 luggers, which were reduced, in 1921, to 334. In 1920, 3,738 men were employed in the industry, and in 1921 only 2,403. During 1920, £400,000 worth of pearls and pearl shell was recovered, but in 1921 the value of the harvest dropped to £250,000. The prices now obtained are unsatisfactory, and, therefore, those honourable members, particularly the honourable member for K a l goorlie (Mr A. Green), who have interthat ested themselves in this industry, realise their that everything possible should be done to market economically and efficiently the rich harvest obtained. The bill is practibut to cally a replica of those which we have had European on many occasions dealing with other produce. Although, in general terms, I support the principle of the bill, I suggest that some of its clauses should be America, altered. It is a good idea to take a poll of the producers, who should at the same time elect their representatives. The poll should be taken on an adult franchise, with no plural voting. It is wrong to depart from a principle like adult franchise, which is firmly established in the Commonwealth and State Parliaments, and in many municipalities. We do not allow an elector, because he may own Scott's Hotel, or other large buildings in the city, to exercise a vote in proportion to the wealth in bricks and mortar that he possesses. taxation Dr MALONEY - M a n y of us would not Common- be here if that was done.",49
147,Mr BLAKELEY,CANBERRA HOUSING,"I agree with the agreements honourable member. The principle of adult suffrage is a good one, and has been accepted by the people of Australia. The bill proposes to depart from it by giving wealth a plurality of votes. It provides that a man shall have a vote for every lugger or attendant vessel that he owns. I am doubtful whether it is wise are so to depart from a principle which has been accepted in both the Commonwealth and inquiries State Parliaments, with the exception of some of the upper Houses, and was accepted by this House today in one or two bills introduced by the Minister for Markets and Migration.  was adopted in the Canned Fruits Bill as is contained in the bill now before the House.",50

149,Mr BLAKELEY,CANBERRA HOUSING,"I was speaking about the fruit-growers. The bill relating to them provided that if a person had an orchard of 1,000 acres he should have one vote, and that if he had an orchard of only 10 acres he should also have only one vote. Honourable members on this side have always resisted any attempt to give one person more voting power than another. It is a fallacious principle that wealthy persons should have extra representation; they should not be given any advantage over those less fortunately situated economically. In the pearling industry the owner of one, two, or three vessels should have the same voting power as the owner of ten, 20 or 30.",51

In ""Western Australia Queensland there are acts of parliament under which pearling luggers are licensed, and before the owners of them can ploit the ocean beds, their vessels must appointed or elected to the board. pass certain tests and conform to certain requirements. The Queensland act 1881 provided for the licensing of pearlfishers as follows: From and after the commencement of this act it shall not be lawful to use or employ any ship or boat in the pearl-shell and beche-de-mer fishery within the colony of Queensland, or within one league to seaward from any part thereof, unless such ship or boat is duly licensed as hereinafter provided. There was provision for the licensing of boats without any reservation. The amending act of 1913 introduced certain limitations, but I am not sure - that a licence obtained prior to the passing of that act is not renewable without conforming to the new standard. The amendment provides, among other thingsAfter the passing of this aet, it shall be unlawful for any person who has not first obtained in the prescribed manner a certificate of having passed the dictation test to hold any licence in respect of any ship or boat employed in the fishery, or any lease under the Pearl-shell and Beche-de-mer Fishery Acts, 1881 to 1913. The interpretation isIu this section, the expression "" certificate of having passed the dictation test"" means a certificate under the hand of a State officer, authorized for that purpose by the Treasurer, that, when the said officer has dictated to the person concerned not less than 50 words in such language as the Treasurer may direct, sueh person has correctly written them out in language in the presence of the said officer.

Trochus shell, since the war, has become an important commodity. In my estimation, aud in the opinion of many people who have admired its beauty and lustre, it will in the near future play a very important part in the manufacture of lacquer work and other uses to which pearl shell is now put. There is no doubt that before long it will be exploited to its fullest extent, and that the marine harvest will not be confined to pearl shell, which is provided for in this bill, but will embrace trochus shell, trepang, and many other products. I hope that the board will give its attention to the possibility of encouraging the harvesting of the other tropical products I have mentioned, and that eventually they will be brought within its provisions. I am pleased to know that, at the outset, all events, members of the board will not be' appointed for a longer period than two years. This measure is an experiment, and sometimes, as we know, mistakes are made in the selection of members of boards. I am at a loss to know what action the Government proposes to take in the appointment of its representative. I am wondering if the appointment will be made from the ranks of some retired pearlers in Melbourne or Sydney, from persons engaged in the industry in the north-west or north Australia; whether he will be selected because of his knowledge of the marketing of tropical marine products, or finally, if he will be selected fro m some government department. These points upon which I should like to hav<? information from the Minister. understand, not from anything that has been said during the debate, but from the Minister himself in conversation, that it is intended to introduce a complementary measure to provide for the financing of the board's activities, and to enable the charges to be made. do not know how the figure mentioned by the Minister was arrived at.  ciation.",51

158,Dr NOTT,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Herbert) [ 5 . 2 4 ] - I am pleased to know that even in the dying hours of the present session the honorat able the Minister for Markets and Migra the measure now before the House, and I hope that its passage will not be unduly delayed because, as is well known, those engaged in the production of pearl shell in Australia have for many years been suffering severely at the hands of Continental and American purchasers. The bill appears to me to be a satisfactory solution of our present difficulty, in that it will ensure a certain amount of co-ordination in marketing on the part of those engaged in the industry. The figures quoted by the honourable the Minister for Markets and Migration, disclosing the magnitude and ramifications of the industry, were, I have no are doubt, a surprise to many honourable members, and need no recapitulation by I me. I venture to say that very few were aware that the value of the Australian pearl-shell and associated in dustries was £500,000 a year. It has been suggested that Darwin pearlers, who produce a small quantity of sheil, should, for the purpose of this bill, be incorporI ated with either the pearlers in Western Australia or Torres Strait. When the bill is in committee I hope that we shall be informed definitely whether the Darwin voters will be included in the representationof the Queensland group, or whether they will get their representation on the Western Australian side of the industry. Personally, in view of their trade facilities and geographical position I would suggest their allocation to Queensland. I feel sure that the interests of the industry will be safeguarded by the appointment of the proposed board; but I suggest, and I trust the Minister will consider it favourably, that the Government nominee should be a highly trained and skilled scientist, whose special duty it should be to consider the many intricate problems that will be met with by the board in the discharge of its duties. The honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley), suggested other industries, but I feel sure that the pearl shell industry is perhaps the least important of tropical marine industries that will rise in the near future from the immense potential wealth in the Barrier Reef. It is hardly possible to forecast the extent to which the sponge, trepang, and trochus shell industries will be developed, and I suggest for the earnest consideration of the Minister that it is highly desirable that one member of the board should be a traiued scientist, who can bring a scientific appreciation of other developmental possibilities to bear on the resources of the tropical waters. I am glad also to know that at the outset the board will be appointed for only two years. It wil l have many difficult problems to handle, and since this proposal is largely in the nature of an experiment, it is wise at the start to l i m it its functions to a period of two years. Experience may suggest the advisableness of alterations in the personnel of the board, for the mutual benefit of all concerned in the industry. I regard the bill as a definite step in the direction of finalizing the unsuccessful efforts - unsuccessful only insofar as they have been handicapped by the adverse influence exerted in the Continental and American markets-to place the pearl shell industry in Australia in a better position. I welcome the bill, and reserve for the committee stage any further critical observations I may have to make. I trust its passage will not be delayed at any stage.

The co-operative canneries last year produced something like 62 per cent, of the Australian pack, and actually exported 85 per cent, of it .

The object of this bill is to give effect to' the policy which the Government laid down at the last election in respect of wire and wire netUnder an Act passed in 192$, an BILL. amount of £250,000 was appropriated to assist the State Governments to supply settlers with wire and wire netting on pounds easy terms, to enable them to combat all such pests as rabbits, dingoes, and wallabies. The money provided under that the measure has been exhausted. Some little by time ago the Government decided to bring down more comprehensive proof posals than those contained in the preupon vious act. It is intended to make avaiL the able a total amount of £3,000,000 for the be in purposes of this bill, to be expended at the rate of £500,000 per annum for six years, with interest at a rate which rea substantial concession to the States. Honourable members will recolIcct that when the Estimates were under consideration last year, a sum of £500,000 was provided for the purposes of this bill. It is proposed to apportion the money between the States partly on an area basis and partly on a stock population basis.

Mr G. FRANCIS - Has the Queensland Government so far purchased any quantity of wire netting ?  that it has. I shall outline the chief features of the scheme, for the benefit of honourable members. Advances will be an made to those States which are prepared to purchase wire netting of Australian manufacture, and issue it to settlers who apply for it , at cost price, plus £ 1 a mile, which they will be permitted to charge under the agreement, to cover exThe basis penses of administration.

It and other States similarlv situated will be in a position to make the new arrangements conform with their existing practice. It is permissible for the States to charge 1 per cent, more than they pay to the Common weal th.",55
164,Mr FOSTER,CANBERRA HOUSING,"The State will be responsible to the Government in respect to redemption?  shall not have any direct dealings with settlers. We merely wish to assist the States financially, to enable them to supply their settlers with wire netting on easy terms. The agreement provides that receipts from excess charges may not be paid into the Consolidated Revenue of the States, but must be placed to the credit of a fund for the future provision of wire netting. In process of time, if that principle is continued, such a fund will amount to a considerable sum, and probably make the States entirely independent of the Commonwealth. The interest derived from the operation of that fund will be the property of the State to use as it thinks fit. The State will be expected to accept the class of security that it would accept for wire netting provided out of its own fund. No restrictions other than those which I have mentioned ""will be imposed upon the States; but in the event of any State declining an application for assistance by a settler the Commonwealth naturally desires to be notified of the circumstances, so that it may answer complaints that are made directly to it. It will l e noticed that the amounts allotted to the States are not stated in the bill. They will, of course, be limited to the sum 'which is appropriated by this Parliament from year to year. It is possible that in future years this House may desire to either reduce or increase the appropriati n. In such an event an amendment of the measure would be necessary if it included the different quotas.' Unfortunately, an early draft of the bill has been printed, making it necessary for me to_ submit one or two minor amendments in committee. The first proposes to antedate the bill to the commencement of the present financial year, so as to validate payments to Western Australia on account of wire netting purchased in anticipation of the passage of the measure. A clause of the bill, as printed, readsFor the purpose of giving effect to this aet in the States the Minister may enter into agreements with the States in accordance with the form in the schedule of this act. For the purpose of giving effect to this act in Northern Australia and Central Australia the Minister may enter into agreements with the Government residents of tliose territories in accordance with the form in the schedule of this act. 1 think it will be agreed that it would be undesirable to compel the Government to enter into agreements with officials who have been appointed by it, and I shall submit an amendment to remove that necessity.",56
165,Mr MANNING,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Macquarie) [5.59] Those who are acquainted with the very great damage which is done by pests of various kinds in different parts of Australia must appreciate this action of the Government. I well remember the passing of the former act. The late Sir Austin Chapman was then Minister for Trade and Customs. The bill differs from it in several ways. Previous advances have been made out of surplus revenue, whereas in future loan funds will bf drawn on. Some of the States have already - made provision for the supply of wire netting to their settlers. I should like to have a little further information as to the necessity for allowing the States to charge settlers 1 per cent, more than they pay to the Commonwealth Government. I do not know that New South Wales will require any of this money. It had a fund for a similar purpose for many years; but unfortunately it was insufficient to meet requirements! Prior to the advent of the present Administration in that State, Mr Wearne, who was then Minister of Lands, insisted on ample funds being made available. Under the last agreement between New South Wales and the Commonwealth with respect to wire netting, the money allotted could be paid only to necessitous settlers. In New South Wales the State netting is distributed through the Pastures Protection Boards, and there is no danger of loss, because if loss occurred it had to be borne by the boards, and they therefore naturally made a close investigation into the financial position of applicants for assistance, and did not grant loans or guarantee repayment unless there was a reasonable chance of the settlers meeting their obligations. There were a number of settlers in New South Wales at that time whose only hope of succeeding was by obtaining netting; but the boards, being in the position of trustees, did not feel justified in recommending advances to them. The action of the Commonwealth Government in making that advance to the State for the purchase of netting has given those men a chance of getting netting and making a success of their land. I wish to know to what extent the amount already advanced to New South Wales has been repaid. The State Government undertook to collect it , but there was no guarantee that it would 1 be repaid. I understand that New South Wales has not yet accepted the present proposal.  new agreement.",56
166,Mr MANNING,CANBERRA HOUSING,"If it does, it w i pass on the obligation to the Pastures Protection Boards. The extra charge of £ 1 per mile is intended to cover the cost of administration. As the New South Wales Government will be guaranteed against loss, I fail to see why it should be allowed to charge 1 per cent, more than it will have to pay to the Commonwealth for the money advanced. An y benefit on account of cheap money should go, not to the State Governments, but to the settlers who need wire netting. was a member of a Pastures Protection Board for many years, and I know exactly the precautions that we used to take to guard against loss. In adverse seasons settlers sometimes would be unable to make repayment; but during the years that I was a member practically no loss was experienced on that account. W it h a mortgagee's consent, a wire netting advance was always made a first call on a property. In the event of a mortgagee withholding his consent, the board declined to take the responsibility of advancing money.",57
167,Mr FOSTER,CANBERRA HOUSING,The measure will apply largely to settlers on leased land.,57
168,Mr MANNING,CANBERRA HOUSING,"In New South Wales practically all lessees had the right of ultimate conversion of their leasehold to freehold, and therefore their security was good. I do not wish to delay the passage of the bill. The Government is to be commended for having brought it forward; but we should be told in detail the reason for the extra charge of 1 per cent.",57
169,Mr SCULLIN,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Y a r r a ) [ 6 . 6 ] - I listened carefully to the Minister's explanation of the bill, and tried to discover the reason for bringing it forward. I have no objection to any measure that will assist the settlers, particularly those who are battling in the outback country, to prevent the inroads of vermin. Those men require all the assistance that can be legitimately given to them; but what is the use pretending that we are handing over half a million of money to the m ' Nothing of the kind is proposed. We are merely lending money to the States at 1 per cent, less than it costs us, and the States in turn will lend it to the settlers.

All that the Commonwealth does is to make a present to - the States equival l lent to 1 per cent, of the total amount advanced. Mr G.

170,Mr SCULLIN,CANBERRA HOUSING,"I have yet to learn that the States are unable to obtain sufficient money to be able to make advances to settlers for the purchase of netting. I Mr G. FRANCIS - If the honourable member lived in Queensland, he would be disillusioned on that point.  ments are anxious to take advantage of this measure.",57
171,Mr SCULLIN,CANBERRA HOUSING,"I have no doubt that the States will be very ready to accept money at a low rate of interest. The bill merely amounts to making a present, either to the State Governments or to the settlers, of money at 1 per cent, less than the interest rate paid by the Commonwealth, It sounds well to say that £250,000 has been advanced to settlers for wire netting in one' year, and that a grant of £500,000 has been made in another. If the Commonwealth desires to grant £5,000 by way of a reduction in interest charges to the States, to induce them to assist settlers, let us be frank about the matter and make a straight out donation to the States of that sum. This Government has set the whole country by the ears by the withdrawal of the per capita payments, on the ground that the Commonwealth should not interfere with the domestic affairs of the States, and that Commonwealth and State finances should be kept separate. We were told that it was a pernicious principle for money raised by one authority to be spent by another. The whole thing is like a jigsaw puzzle. I do not think that we should separate Commonwealth and State finances, where that would cause a lot of trouble; but we should do it as far as we practically can. Naturally the States n ach out. ongerly for this grant of cheap money; but why is it pro-posed to dictate to them the formula upon which the allocation will be made? On the last occasion the distribution was made on the basis of population and area.  upon that.",57
172,Mr SCULLIN,CANBERRA HOUSING,I do not know that the proposed arrangement is an improvement. The basis on which the money will be allotted is the number of stock. PATEBSON - Shee p and cattle.,58
173,Mr SCULLIN,CANBERRA HOUSING,That may or may not be a good formula. It may be argued that on many big cattle stations no wire netting.is used and none is required.,58
174,Mr FOSTER,CANBERRA HOUSING,Not even wire fences.,58
175,Mr SCULLIN,CANBERRA HOUSING,No fences of any description are employed. Will the stock in such areas be taken into account in alloting the money? Let us assume that the whole of the stock in a State are depastured on huge runs where no fences have been erected. Will that State receive a large proportion of the proposed grant ?,58
176,Dr EARLE PAGE,CANBERRA HOUSING,The erection of netting fences might make the land capable of being used for raising sheep instead of cattle.,58
177,Mr SCULLIN,CANBERRA HOUSING,"But the wire netting is required for sheep country.  excluding wild dogs, wallabies, rabbits.",58
178,Mr SCULLIN,CANBERRA HOUSING,"I am merely testing the argument of the Minister, and ing that a perfect formula has not yet of the wire been obtained. Distribution on the basis of population and area did not prove satisfactory, and I do not believe that the formula now proposed wil l be acceptable to all parties. It is a cumbersome prin ciple for the Commonwealth to attempt to allocate money among the various States for matters that are undeniably the direct concern of the States themselves.  boundaries.

179,Mr SCULLIN,CANBERRA HOUSING,"The States being defined by certain boundaries, we must respect the arrangement and legislate accordingly. One can be a unificationist, and yet leave to the States control of certain matters within their own borders. I am not opposing the bill, but I see nothing in it except that it provides money for the States at 1 per cent, less than the Commonwealth will have to pay. The State Government will be able to charge the settler whatever interest it likes.  more than 5 per cent.",58
180,Mr SCULLIN,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Why should the States be allowed to make any profit over the transaction ? If ihe desire is to assist the settlers, they should be given the advantage of the cheapest money available.",58
181,Dr EARLE PARE,CANBERRA HOUSING,The idea is to build up another f u n d in the interests of the sottiers,58
182,Mr SCULLIN,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Why should the States be required to place the extra 1 per cent, into a f u n d for the benefit of future generations? Such a round-about method is puzzling. Does the bill deal with the basis on which the money is to be allocated?  I have given.",58
183,Mr SCULLIN,CANBERRA HOUSING,"That basis should be set out in the schedule, and the sum to wire be advanced should be mentioned.  such amounts as may be appropriated from time to time.",58
184,Mr SCULLIN,CANBERRA HOUSING,"I realise that, but the Minister has mentioned the sum of Clause 2 of the schedule and provides that the wire netting must be of Australian manufacture unless otherwise approved by the Minister. showA few days ago I asked how much netting purchased in 1923 was of Australian manufacture. I have not yet received a reply, and I should like to know if the Minister could give me the information now. The House might reasonably be put in possession of it when asked to provide a further advance for the purchase of netting. I shall not oppose the bill. It simply means that the Commonwealth floats a loan, and lends the money to the States, the States in turn lending it to the settlers. The only advantage they gain is 1 per cent, on £500,000. Mr M . CAMERON (Barker) [6.17] It is unnecessary to say anything in commendation of the purpose of the bill. Any one who knows anything of rural conditions knows that wire netting is one of the greatest requirements of the settler. I am afraid, however, that the provision allowing 25 years for the repayment of the advance may prevent some States from taking advantage of the money proposed to be made available. For instance, a most excellent system of advances for wire netting and all other kinds of fencing material has been in operation in South Australia probably ever since rabbits first became a menace to the settlers; but the period covered by the repayment is only 20 years, compared with the 25 years' period provided for in this bill. The settler makes application to the local governing body or district council, and the application, if approved, is sent on to the Minister for Lands, who makes the money available from government funds.",58
185,Mr SCULLIN,CANBERRA HOUSING,The Minister advances the money from funds already obtained from the Commonwealth. It is a lovely piece of circumlocution.,59
186,Mr FOSTER,CANBERRA HOUSING,"South Australia has a better system than that provided for in the bill. Mr M . CAMERON - I want to know whether, because of the 25 years' period, South Australia will be debarred from participating in the benefits given by this bill. The South Australian settler pays off each year one-twentieth of the capital advanced, plus interest on the balance outstanding, at the rate of interest paid by the State for the money. If the State borrows at 4 per cent., the settler gets his advance at 4 per cent. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition could not recall any instance of the States being unable to secure loan moneys out of which to make advances to the settlers for the purchase of wire netting. There have been many occasions in South Australia when the vote has been exhausted, and the settlers have been obliged to wait until the next financial year to obtain advances.",59
187,Mr SCULLIN,CANBERRA HOUSING,"That occurs everywhere, but does not touch on the State's inability to obtain loans. Mr M . CAMERON - I am merely pointing out that there are occasions when money is not available. I understand that at present South Australian settlers who have obtained advances are paying 6 per cent.",59
188,Mr FOSTER,CANBERRA HOUSING,"They may be doing so today. Mr M . CAMERON - Some settlers who obtained loans nearly 20 years ago are paying 4 per cent, or less. As the local governing authorities in South Australia are very careful in their recommendations, and as the person who takes up an abandoned holding is obliged to pay the instalments due on it to the district council, there are very few arrears of repayments. I have no faul t to find with the proposal to make money available to the States for the purchase of wire and wire netting; but I object to the Commonwealth providing a restriction which may conflict with a system already in operation in a State. I hope, therefore, that such arrangements will be made as will enable South Australia to receive the assistance offered and apply it to its present system of advances to settlers.",59
189,Mr FENTON,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Maribyrnong) [6.23] It makes one laugh to realise that a few days ago the Government was declaring that the per capita payments to the States must cease because Commonwealth and State finances could not be mixed up, and today it is asking us to pass a bill under which the finances of the Commonwealth, States, municipalities, and individuals in the States will be mixed up. The wording of the schedule to the bill is somewhat peculiar. For instance, in paragraph 1 of the agreement we find the following: The Commonwealth shall advance to the State . . . . such amounts (not exceeding the amounts required by the State), &c.",59
190,Mr SCULLIN,CANBERRA HOUSING,Coul d one imagine the Commonwealth advancing more than the State required?,59
191,Mr FENTON,CANBERRA HOUSING,"A whole series of conditions is laid down as to what a State shall do when the money is advanced to the local authority; and, no doubt, in turn the local authority will issue all sorts of warnings to the settler. But it will be the shire engineer who will finally determine the conditions under which the settler will obtain his wire or wire netting. Victoria has in operation a system similar to that of South Australia. The State advances money to the local author it y , and the latter in its turn deals with the settler in its area. The honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Watkins) should be interested in paragraph 2 of the agreement, which saysAll wire and wire netting to be purchased by the State pursuant to this agreement shall, unless otherwise approved in writing by Minister, be of Australian manufacture. Very often our State instrumentalities make it a practice to obtain their ment, i equirements from overseas. may call for quotations from local manufacturers, but the conditions they from the other side of the world? lay down often render it impossible every for the local manufacturer to quote prices or supply the required. For instance, a department may say, "" We want 4,000 miles of wire netting tomorrow."" It knows full well the impossibility of getting that quantity from the local manufacturer, diately calls upon an importing house to furnish the material. In Newcastle and the bill. in other parts of Australia wire netting of the very best quality is being manufactured. Mr M . CAMERON - It costs the settler a great deal more than the British.",59
192,Mr FENTON,CANBERRA HOUSING,"If the Australian w i manufacturer is given a reasonable in which to supply the netting, he can turn it out in quality and at a price equal to that which comes from the other side of the world.",60

I may be rather doubtful about the fiscal proclivities of the Commonwealth Minister in charge of the administration of this legislation; but I would have greater f a i th in his attitude towards Australian industries than I would have in regard to that of some State Ministers. It is quite reasonable to anticipate the latter coming to the Commonwealth Minister with the old gag about not being able to get the loeallymanufactured netting within a sufficient the time, and asking him to allow them to buy direct from the importer. Why should the wishes of the national parliawhich is almost wholly protectionist They in character, be hindered by the desire of a State Minister to secure his supplies In bill of this sort we should insist on the use of Australian produce or goods quantities made in Australia. The taxpayers who have elected this parliament are almost unanimously in favour of giving every possible protection to the local manufacturers, and I trust that the Minister will and immemake that clear to the States.

I can assure honourable members that it should be very closely scrutinized n - and considered before it is assented to. It is a lively reminder of a bill which was introduced three or four years ago by the then Minister for Trade and Customs, to which was the most absurd and ridiculous measure ever submitted to a Parliament n - of a civilized country. So ridiculous was it that when the attention of the Prime Minister was called to it , lie had it immediately withdrawn and another substituted for it . It contained no provision whatever for the repayment of advances, and was simply a bold bid Mr STEWART.;-G o on. Let the honourable member tell us what it was.",60
200,Mr FOSTER,CANBERRA HOUSING,"I could not properly describe it without the use of terms which I know would be out of order. The bill now before us is one of somewhat similar complexion. It is another distinct and unjustifiable interference with legislation which should be lef t to the State Parliaments. I am sure that the bill was drafted, possibly under instructions from a Minister, by some one who did not in any sense understand the problem of supplying wire netting, barbed wire, and fencing wire for the suppression of rabbits and dingoes. No man who understood the subject would have submitted a measure on these lines. I ask honourable members to say whether this bill is not an unnecessary meddling with things with which the Commonwealth Parliament has nothing whatever to do, though I would not object to assistance beng given to an impecunious State unable alone to deal with the problem"" of the suppression of vermin. I shall refer to one instance which will enable honourable members to for m their own conclusions as to whether as a general principle this measure comes within the range of legitimate consideration by the Commonwealth Parliament. The difficulty with which the measure is intended to deal is not new. It is over 30 years old. The principle upon which this bill is based was adopted in South Australia at a time of the most severe stress ever experienced in any of the States. At that time wool was selling at from 4d. to 5d. per lb., and wheat at 2s. per bushel. Vermin were taking possession of the interior portion of South Australia and of the other States as well. South Australia in her relative condition of poverty tackled this vital question. The Government created vermin districts, and supplied district councils with wire to enable them to cope with both the rabbit and dingo pests. It said to the pastoral lessees in the far-back country, "" ""We will assist you to deal with these pests of rabbits and dingoes that are devastating the country, and rendering it absolutely worthless. ""We will give you long leases and provide you with the necessary wif e netting for dog-proof and rabbit-proof fences. We will divide the country in the interior into suitable divisions to be called "" vermin districts."" "" You must accept liability in your leases for the cost involved, and we will give you 21 years for its repayment."" That liability was attached to every lease. The Government advertised for tenders for the materials required, and the shipping companies put in tenders and brought the materials, from the other side of the world, instead of ballasting, as stiffening for their ships. They were thus able to supply them at the lowest possible price. As a result of the action then taken by the South Australian Government the dingo was driven out, and today the outback stations of South Australia have given a wool-clip that has been the salvation of the State, and without which it could not have been in a solvent position. It is no pleasure to me to intervene in order to discuss this very important question; but I must say that the measure which has now been introduced reflects no credit upon the Commonwealth Government. I hope the further consideration of the bill will be adjourned until there has been time for consultation with experts from the districts which it is intended to assist. I know that the Prime Minister realizes that these things should be done on a business basis. We shall be held accountable later on, if not now, for the adoption of this policy. I have given an example from the experience of South Australia, and I can give another from the western division of New South Wales, the wealthiest of the States. About twelve years ago there were no fewer than 12,000,000 sheep in the western divsion of New South Wales, and I can appeal to the honourable member for ' Macquarie '' Mr Manning) to say how many are there now.",61
201,Mr MANNING,CANBERRA HOUSING,"It is 30 years ago since there were 12,000,000 sheep there.",61
202,Mr FOSTER,CANBERRA HOUSING,"It is not fifteen years since there were 12,000,000 sheep there. But what is the position today? I 3ay there are not 4,500,000 sheep there now. I am not opposed to the spirit of this legislation, but the Commonwealth Government, instead of going into details, should deal in this matter with the State Governments.  doing.",61
203,Mr FOSTER,CANBERRA HOUSING,"It is doing that, and a very great deal more. down conditions and meddling with things that it does not understand. An y man possessed of a knowledge of the outside country would know on reading this bill that the man responsible for its provisions was never 100 miles away from a big city. I should like to speak on this subject for an hour, because I understand the. question. the time to consider the measure in detail, but I do intend to make a very definite protest against it . I challenge the Government to submit it to expert pastoralists who know something about the outback country, and I shall have no more to say if they approve of this measure. I know what the pastoral situation was 30 or 35 years ago. South Australia at that time we had the sanest Labour party that ever existed in any State of the Commonwealth. Labour men said that the people were still in the grasp of the squatters. Like obher portions of the Continent, South Australia is accustomed to droughts, and I , as a representative of some of the interior country in the State Parliament, said to the Labour members- "" For God's sake come with me ""on a trip to see what is happening, and how these men are trying, against impossible odds, to hold that country."" They went with me, and on their return said: "" We shall give to them the most liberal conditions; they may have the country for nothing, if they will occupy and use it . "" Later came the effort to get rid of the dingo and the rabbit, and the result has been that the wool clips for the last twelve or fifteen years have kept South Australia solvent without having to cry to another Government for aid. If honourable members do not understand this proposal, they should press the Government to defer its consideration until there is more time to thoroughly discuss it . If the Government will rush through in a few hours a proposal that should receive at least a fortnight's consideration, I disclaim all responsibility.",62
204,Mr WATKI NS,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Newcastle) [8.18] I commend the Government for this proposal to lend money to the States for advances to settlers who desire to obtain what it is wire and wire netting, but I object to the provision which allows the Minister to decide whether the material shall be imported or Australian-made. . It is laying",62
205,Mr FOSTEE,CANBERRA HOUSING,That is a detail.,62
206,Mr WATKINS,CANBERRA HOUSING,"It is a very important one. The wire-drawers in my electorate, and in Victoria, cannot get r i d of their product, and the Minister would be well advised to consent to the elimination of those words in the bill which give to him authority to say that imI have not ported wire and wire netting may be used. Such a provision is almost criminal. In committee I shall pursue this matter further.  When this Parliament granted £250,000 for the supply of wire netting to settlers who could not finance themselves, the amount was apportioned among the States. The Labour Minister In for Lands in Western Australia (Mr . Angwin) sent a protest to the Western Australian representatives in this Parliament, and I repeated it in this chamber, against the principle which the honourable member for Newcastle has just advocated. Mr Angwin pointed out that had the use of local material not been insisted upon eight more indigent settlers could have been provided with wire netting from the small proportion of the grant that was allotted to Western Australia. Is this House genuinely in tent upon assisting the settlers to get wire netting, or is it more concerned with boosting up a couple of huge manufacturing combines?",62
207,Mr WATKINS,CANBERRA HOUSING,"There is no combine.  able member that the Australian people have paid a bounty amounting to approximately £466,000 to the two manufacturers of wire and wire netting. On top of that, is it fair to further handicap the settlers by placing an embargo on honest competition by manufacturers abroad ? In reply to a question asked by me, the Minister for Trade and Customs admitted that wire netting made in Australia is being sold in New Zealand at a lower price than that at which it is supplied to Australian settlers. It is disgraceful to confer these advantages - upon manufacturers who are not prepared to give a fair deal to our own people. The object of paying the bounty to them was to enable them to become established, and compete honestly with the makers of imported wire and wire netting. The State I have the honour to represent is 2,000 miles from the two factories in the eastern States, and the freights on this material aire heavy. Having paid these firms such a large sum by way of bounty, the Government should not penalize the settlers by a condition such as that to whioh I am referring.",62
208,Mr WATKINS,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Does the honourable member know that Newcastle wire is sold in Fremantle at the same price as in Newcastle ?  being sold in New Zealand more cheaply. The bounty was intended to put the wire and wire-netting manufacturers on a competitive basis, and it is not right to boost up, at the expense of the settlers, two companies that pay bigger dividends than the farmers are ever likely to obtain. Mr G. FRANCIS (Kennedy) [8.25] I congratulate the Government and the Ministry upon the introduction of this bill. For a considerable time the settlers in Queensland have been trying to obtain wire netting, but have not been able to procure it under existing conditions. Every legislative provision has been made for protecting the State and providing the netting, but apparently there have been financial difficulties which this bill will relieve. Very large areas in Queensland which are at present being used for cattle-raising are quite suitable for the production of high class wool, which is a much more profitable crop to the State, to those engaged in the industry, and to Australia as a whole, because there is a definite and assured market in which it can compete against the wool of the world. We are not able to sell our beef at a profitable price, and accordingly the position of the cattle industry is not at all satisfactory. Many cattle growers do not look with a hostile eye on the dingo; on the contrary, they regard it as rather a friendly animal. They point out that, in ordinary seasons, the dingo keeps the 1 per marsupials in check, and never touches the calves except in the dry seasons, and which then only when the mothers have to leave They them unprotected while they go some distance for water. The pastoralist argues that it is better to lose the calf than to lose both cow and calf. The loss of the calf is rather a benefit, because it happens at a time when grass is scarce and a diminution of the herd can best be afforded. Unfortunately the dingoes in vade adjacent sheen runs in search of the sheep and lambs, which are easier prey, consequently, it is necessary to fence the runs in areas that are infested with these vermin. Many small men are merely awaiting the opportunity to get wire netting on reasonable terms, in order to change over from cattle-raising to woolproduction. In Southern Queensland, it is necessary to provide the small pastoralist with rabbit-proof netting also, so that they may be able to grow sheep on country that is suitable and free of dingoes. This bill will give relief to a large number of men throughout the State who are anxious to go in for the more profitable business of sheep raising, but are deterred by the difficulty of getting wire netting. One distinct improvement in the bill is the alteration of the basis upon which the money is to be allocated. The Minister is to take into consideration both the area and the stock population of each State, and will take as a basis of calculation the year 1925, which was a fair l y even period throughout the Commonwealth, whereas 1926 was notoriously a bad year in Queensland. The honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) referred to the per capita payments. One defect in those payments was that they took into account merely the number of people in each State, and not the area to be developed. The only sound basis for the apportionment of Commonwealth aid is the taking into account of area as well as population, or stock, as the case may be. I question the right of the States to make a profit out of this transaction. They will be entitled to charge the settler f l per mile to cover administrative expenses and losses; but .those expenses should be adequately covered by the 1 per cent, of profit that they will be permitted to make.  cent, profit for that purpose. Mr G. FRANCIS - The uses to they may put it are not very 'jlear. will get the £ 1 per mile and the 1 per cent., and apparently the applicapossible tion of these moneys is to be in the dissettlers cretion of the States,  condition in the agreement. Mr G. FRANCIS - Paragrap h 9 of the agreement readsIn addition to the payments to be made to the State by settlers, as provided in clause 7 of this agreement, the State may(i) charge each settler a sum at the rate of one pound (£1) per mile of wire netting supplied to the settler to cover administration expenses and losses.  should read paragraph 8 of the schedule. Mr G. FRANCIS - Paragraph 8 three readsWhere the amount received by the State from settlers in respect of wire or wire netting supplied to the settlers exceeds the amount required to bo paid to the Commonwealth by we l i m it the term. the State, in pursuance of clause C of this agreement, the State shall pay the amount the excess to the credit of a trust fund utilized during the currency of the agreement for the purpose of purchasing wire and wire wallabies. netting, to be supplied to settlers on the same terms as wire and wire netting purchased with the amounts advanced to the State under this agreement. The agreement gives to the States that extra money, but it is only a matter of juggling with figures. The States may use the specific f l under paragraph 9 act.(2.) ostensibly to cover administration exact penses and losses, and take the 1 per cent, profit under paragraph 7 for the purpose of purchasing wire and wire netting other than under this agreement; but the money that the States would have advanced under normal circumstances for the purto: chase of wire and wire netting would then be used for whatever purpose they thought fit. They get the money, and it does not matter for what purpose it is used. However, that is a small matter, except that I should like the settlers get the benefit of the 1 per cent, which movewill now go to the States. I am certain that Queensland would be quite willin g commenced that the settlers should have that benefit.  the settlers the benefit under the agreebe ment. Mr G. FRANCIS - That is doubtful in view of the way in which the agreehave ment is framed. If paragraph 7 of agreement were amended to make it for the States to give to the the benefit of the 1 per cent., it would be entirely acceptable to me. I am a entirely in sympathy with the bill, and I hope that it will speedily pass this House, so that the settlers may derive immediate benefit from its operations. Question resolved in the afilrmative. Bill read a second time. In committee: Clause 1 agreed to. Clause 2 (Definition). Mr G. FRANCIS (Kennedy) [ 8 . 3 5 ] - I should like to ask the Minister why he defines "" w i r e "" as fencing wire and not wire netting.

(3.) Any moneys received by way of payment for wire and wire netting supplied to settlers in North Australia or Central Australia under this act shall be paid to the Trust Account. This new clause will obviate the necessity of the Commonwealth .Government making agreements with its own officials - the Government Residents of Central and Northern Australia.",63
209,Mr FOSTER,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Is there any l i m it to the amount of appropriation for the pan-poses of the agreement ?  of this year's Estimates is an amount of £500,000 set aside for the purpose of assisting the States and North and Cenis tral Australia to purchase wire netting for settlers.

210,Mr BRENNAN,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Batman) [8.39] - I appears to me that the Minister is introNewcastle ducing a very important and far-reaching clause.

As there is no one in the Commonwealth Territory with whom we can make an agreement, the distribution of wire netting there will remain in the hands of the Commonwealth authorities.  through the local governing bodies.",65
211,Mr BRENNAN,CANBERRA HOUSING,What local governing bodies are there in the Northern Territory ?  commissions and two councils.,65
212,Mr BRENNAN,CANBERRA HOUSING,"The Northern Territory is a land of magnificent distances. I regard the whole scheme with a certain amount of anxiety, but when it comes to wire-netting the Northern Territory without the supervision of any responsible local body, then my apprehension increases. Had the Minister made provision in the bill for constituting the commission, or any other body, as a local authority, it would have given some safeguard; but no one has been nominated by the Minister. I should like to be sure that we have some authoritative body, possessed of local knowledge, to deal with the distribution of wire netting in the Northern Territory, and some certainty of communication between the users of the netting and those responsible for its distribution. The new clause seems to be an afterthought, as far as the Northern Territory is concerned. Like the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr G. Francis), I hope that the money will be well spent. This being the end of the session, we are in the mood in which we distributed largesse. This afternoon we handed out of Pandora's Box about half a million pounds as a bounty on the export of wine, and this evening we hand out another half million for wire netting. We are in a generous mood, as we are about to leave for Canberra.",65

(1) Subject to this agreement the State undertakes that the Bupply to a settler in the State of any wire or wire netting purchased with any amount advanced under this agreement shall be upon the condition that the liability of the settler to the State in respect of the wire or wire netting so supplied shall be discharged if the settler pays to the State half-yearly for twenty-five years.",65
215,Mr WATKINS,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Newcastle) [8.47] I move That in clause 2 of the schedule, the words "" unless otherwise approved in writing by the Minister"" be left out. The effect of the amendment will be to compel purchasers of wire and wire netting to buy the Australian article. It is time that this Commonwealth Parliament began to listen to reason on this matter. I do not object to government assistance to the farmers, but I cannot lose sight of the struggles of those who have endeavoured, in the face of great difficulties, to draw wire in this country. I know that they have tried to meet the wishes of the Country party in all the States The only tariff questions dealt with this session have related to items of interest to the Country party, and although I have supported them, I suggest that it is time we started to take an Australian view.",66

217,Mr WATKINS,CANBERRA HOUSING,"It was done in the interests of the rice-growers, and the honourable member's interjection is quite un-Australian. I remember the honourable member some time ago talking of combines, and I remind him that the one industry that "" has arranged with the Tariff Board to sell its products at the same price in Fremantle as Newcastle is the industry to which this bill applies. It is time to call a halt, and place the Australian first and the foreigner last.",66
218,Mr THOMPSON,CANBERRA HOUSING,The flat rate for wire netting shows that too much is being charged for it at Newcastle.,66
219,Mr WATKINS,CANBERRA HOUSING,That is positively not so. Those honourable members who have visited the works and inspected the wire netting have admitted that it is as good as any that can be produced. is time that Australians began to realise that something good can be produced in Australia. Mr G. FRANCIS - The trouble is that the man on the land cannot obtain the wire netting.,66
220,Mr WATKINS,CANBERRA HOUSING,"In my electorate the shops are full of it , and the shopkeepers cannot sell it . Mr G. FRANCIS - They will not let us have it . I know people who have been wanting it for the last twelve months, and have not been able to obtain it .",66
221,Mr WATKINS,CANBERRA HOUSING,"The firm had a quarrel with a Queensland trader, who told his customers that wire was being drawn in Australia, but that he would not recommend it . While helping the farmers in every way, we should, in handling the taxpayers' money, restrict them to the use of Australian-drawn wire.  anything is lef t out of this clause, the whole of it should be deleted. The amendment would ensure a monopoly to the manufacturers. The honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Watkins) spoke about assistance to the farmers, but is he aware that this Parliament has paid nearly twice as much in bounty to the two firms who manufacture wire netting as was provided for the farmers in the first wire netting grant. A sum of £250,000 was given to the farmers to enable them to one of the buy wire netting, but we have paid £466,000 to the two wire netting factories; and yet the honourable member talks of what is being done for the farmer. I am concerned about the large amount of money given to those two factories to enable them to provide costly wire netting for the farmer. There seems to be in this Parliament too much bias in favour of secondary industries. If the amendment of the honourable member is accepted, it will mean that we provide the bounty, and, no matter what price the local manufacturers charge, the farmer must buy from them. Let me remind honourable members of the intention of a previous parliament. Wire was, by the decision of the last Parliament, admitted to this country free of duty, but the Government subverted the intention of Parliament by using the Anti-dumping Act and levying a duty. That not being sufficient, the bounty was introduced, and the taxpayers have provided £466,000 It for the two factories. The honourable member who represents the district where one of the factories is, asks the committee to introduce prohibition, and to force the Australian settler to buy at any price from the two Australian sources. The farmers have to grow produce to compete with the cheap black white labour of other parts of the world. The Minister who administers the wire netting f u n d in Western Australia said that eight needy settlers could have had wire netting if the provision relating to the buying of it from an Australian source had not been enforced. Thus eight settlers were sacrificed to two factories. anything. These facts ought to be carefully examined. If we are going to regard only one side of the question, and place Australia in the hands of monopolists, who have agreed upon a price, we shall achieve the ruin of the primary producer. When the flat rate to all the States was agreed on, the manufacturers had apparently . discovered that it cost more to ship wire netting from New castle to Fremantle than from New York or London to Fremantle. The wire netting manufacturers ought to stand on their own feet, and not sell wire netting more cheaply to New Zealand than to the farmers of this country.",66
222,Mr FENTON,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Maribyrnong ) [S.56] I am surprised at the statements of the honourable member for Forrest (Mr . Prowse). The bounty would not have been provided but for the outcry from members of the Country party, who said, "" We do not mind a bounty, but, whatever you do, no not impose a d u t y . "" Having had their wish complied with, they now complain about the bounty being paid. The wire netting manufacturers asked for the same as every other industry in Australia- a small measure of protection. They would rather have had an import duty than a bounty. The policy of Australia, and of this Parliament, is overwhelmingly protectionist, and, that being so, Parliament should see that preference is given whenever possible to' Australian manufacturers. Those who work in the secondary industries are the best customers of the primary producer. Where would the agriculturists of this country be but for the market provided by those who work in secondary industries ? If there were no industrialists in this country, the man on the land would lose his home market, and would become a "" hewer of wood and a drawer of clause [39] water "" for the people of foreign countries.

It is time that this Parliament did its duty, and declined to leave such an important matter as the source of supply of wire netting to the discretion of the Minister. I should be inclined to trust the present Minister, because I believe he is a sound protectionist; but no Minister should be given the discretionary power proposed. People who require many miles of wire netting may come to the Minister, and if it cannot be obtained in Australia he would have to permit them to import it . As the money must filter through the State authorities, and possibly the municipal authorities, before it reaches the settlers, we shall be treading on dangerous ground if we allow any discretion to the Minister. The Ministry now asks us to interfere with the financial arrangements with the States to the extent of £500,000, but a fortnight ago it said the Commonwealth ought not to pay the per capita grant. The honourable member for Forrest was consistent in that matter, and, therefore, I presume that he will support this bill. If he is a true Australian, he will also support the amendment of the honourable member for Newcastle. It is time this Parliament gave practical expression to the protectionist sentiment of the people. The honourable member for Forrest, as an iudividual, is entitled to purchase his requirementsf r o m China, Japan, India, or any other cheaplabour country; but when we are expending the taxpayers' money, of which we are the custodians, we should pay some regard to Australian sentiment. Australian wire netting is of the highest quality,, and whatever public money we have for the purchase of netting should be spent on it .",67
224,Mr FOSTER,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Wakefield) [9.1] - This is discreditable to the Government. As every one knows, I am a reasonable protectionist. I never use anything but Australian farming machinery; I can get nothing better than it . The object of this bill is to relieve distress. Most of the wire bought wi|th this money will go into the interior of Australia, and we ought to make the best deal we can when we spend the money. Where do the representatives of the farmers on this committee stand on this question? It is the height of hypocrisy for the Government to take the stand it has taken, and it must expect to bear the consequences.  for Markets and Migration) [ 9 . 3 ] - I have a good deal of sympathy with the mover of the amendment, but the reason that the words ""unless otherwise approved in writin g by the Minister "" are in the bill , is that it is conceivable that circumstances may arise in which Australian wire netting may be unprocurable, or unprocurable at a reasonable price. I have already been asked whether I would agree to the purchase under this scheme of wire netting which contained a proportion of imported material. I replied that I would not agree to such a purchase unless an unanswerable case were made out as to why this should be done. No Commonwealth M in ister would fly in the face of Australian sentiment by signing an order for the purchase of imported material with Commonwealth funds while Australian mater i a l was available at fair prices. There is a very good business reason for the retention of these words. If they should be struck out, the Australian wire netting manufacturers would be enjoying, not only the advantage of the bounty which is provided, but an absolute embargo. All competition would be removed, and every penny provided on the Estimates for this purpose would have to be soent on Australian netting regardless of the price which the manufacturers might charge. I believe in using Australian netting on every possible occasion, but the retention of these words is necessary to safeguard the country from the risk of having to pay an extortionate price. Agreements have already been made with the States on this matter, and, although I should be the last man to say that an agreement made under these conditions could not be altered by this House, it certainly will add very greatly to our difficulties if we have unnecessarily to amend it . I give honourable members opposite my assurance that there is no possibility of these words being used unfairly to the Australian industry. I regret that I cannot accept the amendment.",67

Even supposing that the deletion of these words from the clause would result in the Government being bound hand and foot to the local wire netting manufacturers, what is to stop us from undertaking the manufacture of wire netting for ourselves? Mr G. FBANCIS - The disastrous experience of the various State trading concerns should be sufficient.",68
226,Dr MALONEY,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Let me tell the honourable member that the Newport railway workshops build better locomotives, for less money, than any engineering works in England or America. Wire netting has not been produced at Newport simply because of the disturbed state of the last Nationalist Government. First class wire has been manufactured at Pentridge, and it should not be difficult to ascertain the cost of it . If the honourable member forNewcastle allows his amendment to go to a division I should vote in fay our of it .

When England sweated her women and children to turn out matchboxes at 2 j d . a gross, Japan, with up-to-date machinery, was able to turn them out, fill them with matches and export them for less than l d . a gross.

It would be practically impossible for the Government to draw up a schedule that would be acceptable in every detail to each of 'the States; and, if a spirit of compromise is to be shown, it will be easier for one State to agree to terms that are acceptable to most of the States than for a number of States to adopt a particular scheme that meets the requirements of one State.

Motion (by Mr MARE ) agreed toThat it is expedient that an appropriation of revenue be made for the purposes of a bill for an act to amend the Petroleum Prospecting Acts '102G. Resolution reported. Standing Orders suspended; resolution adopted. Ordered and bring in a bill to carry out the foregoing resolution. Bill presented, and (on motion by Mr . MARR ) read a first time. The 2 SECOND READING. . Mr MARR (Parkes-Honorar y Minister) [ 9 . 3 5 ] - I m o v e That the bill be now read a second time. Under the Petroleum Prospecting Act 1926 the sum of £60,000 was appropriated, and the Minister was authorizes to make advances (a) to persons or companies engaged-in the search for oil in Australia for the purpose of testing their holdings; and (6) to assist persons, companies or State Governments to make detailed geological surveys. The whole of the sum of £60,000 'thus appropriated has beeu allocated for advances in certain areas, and it is now necessary to appropriate additional funds in order that further advances may be made in approved cases. It will be remembered that 6he Treasurer (Dr Earle Page), in his last budget speech, announced that the sum of £100,000 would be set aside for further expenditure in connection with prospecting for petroleum and precious metals. The amount already appropriated by the Precious Metals Prospecting Act, £40,000, has not yet been expended, and the Government has accordingly decided to ask Parliament to vote the whole amount of £100,000 for prospecting for petroleum. The bill which is now presented for the consideration of honourable members is designed to enlarge the scope of the existing act, by permitting expenditure of the moneys appropriated, on the following matters: (a) Advances to .persons or companies engaged in the search for oil in Australia, Papua, or New Guinea; (b) Advances to assist persons, companies, or State or Territorial Governments to make geological surveys in Australia, Papua, or New - Guinea; (c) The conduct, [either directly, or through an .agent, of geological surveys in Australia, Papua, or New - Guinea; and (d) The conduct, either directly, .or through an agent, .of prospecting operations in the area reserved, in Papua - for - that purpose. Ib has been the practice h i the past to ask Parliament to appropriate, in the annual Estimates, moneys for the conduct by the Commonwealth of geological surveys in Australia and the Territories, and for the conducb of prospecting operations on the Commonwealth's reservation at Popo, Papua. No funds have been made available, up to the present time, for advances to persons or companies operating in the Territories of Papua and New Guinea. It will thus be observed that for the fir.st time provision is being made in a single act for the appropriation of money required for the whole of the Commonwealth's activities in connection with the prospecbing for petroleum. It was made clear, when the act of 1926 was presented, bhat the basis of consideration of applications for assistance would be Dr Wade's reports upon the prospects in certain districts in the various States, and it is proposed that the same basi3 be adopted in future in regard to applications by companies operating in Australia. Honourable members are aware that the Commonwealth arranged, some years ago, for the Anglo-Persian Oil Company to conduct geological surveys in Papua, and, to a limited extent, in New Guinea. As a result of those surveys the reservation of land around Popo, Papua, was decided upon, and boring operations have been conducted by the company OF s tes chosen by its geologists. : In f r a m i ng the last bill introduced, the Government acted upon the advice of Dr Wade, who is one of the world's petroleum specialists. If this bill is passed, the Government prorjoses ""to send a party of geological experts to the Mandated Territories and Papua, to thoroughly test the proposals which various companies and individuals have submitted. The Government has not been in a position, up to the present, to give assistance, because the services of surveyors and geologists of standing were not available to report upon the applications made. Mr M . CAMERON - Will surveys also be made in Australia?",69
231,Mr MARR,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Yes . Some little time ago a certain amount of money was allocated for the payment of an expert to report on some fields in Australia. Wherever, in the opinion of experts, there is the slightest prospect of the discovery of oil, the locations will be full y tested, whether they are in the hands of companies or individuals. Last year we appropriated £60,000 for this purpose, and from this vote the Government has already subsidized, to some extent, the Belford Dome Company, .in New South Wales, and a Western Australian company. The sum of £22,500 has been set aside for each of these companies to provide payment for work done on a 50-50 basis. We asked the Government of New Soutli Wales to give us the benefit of the advice of their mineral experts. Dr Wade reported favourably upon the Belford Dome area, ancl experts will be sent to advise where bores should be put down for testing purposes. It is intended to pay companies, not for any plant erected on the ground, but a .proportionate share of expeuses according to the depth reaehed by a bore. The assistance proposed to be given by the Government should materially help those engaged in efforts to discover o i l . Provision was made in the last act for the repayment of - advances made in the event of oil being struck.",71
232,Dr MALONEY,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Does not the Government claim a proportion of the output? Mr MAER,-That is not provided for . The discovery of o i l in Australia is of such great national importance that the few thousands of pounds which may bo spent by the Commonwealth to assist i u its discovery will be vastly more than repaid if o i l is found in payable quantity^ Out of the vote of £60,000 appropriated last year, the Government assisted some oil boring companies in Queensland, on the recommendation of the Queensland Government. The honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Marks), on one occasion read some letters in this chamber dealing with boring operations for oil in the Roma district.",71
233,Dr MALONEY,CANBERRA HOUSING,"The honourable memher made somo very serious charges. Mr MARR,-On the advice of the Queensland Government, the Commonwealth Government decided to allocate a certain amount to carry out investigations on that field. It is believed that there are good prospects of the discovery of oil in the Mandated Territories, and even better prospects of its discovery in Papua. Certain allegations have been made concerning the work carried out in Papua by the Persian O i l Company, and paid for by the Commonwealth Government, in boring for oil there. Three bores have been sunk, but they have not yet reacbed the petroliferous strata. Experts are confident that oil will be discovered in Papua. If oil is discovered in the bores carried out by the Persian O i l Company, it will become the property of the Commonwealth Government. Companies or individuals carrying on operations at locations where experts are of opinion that oil is likely to be found, will receive assistance from the Government. There is, however, no intention to support "" wild c at "" companies. the opinion of experts, even a small company is carrying on operations where it is likely that oil - will be found, the Government will be willing to assist. It is intended to test likely areas as minutely as possible, and the Government hopes that the money spent in doing so will prove to have been profitably spent.",71
234,Dr MALONEY,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Melbourne) [9.53] I am very glad that this bill has been introduced. While agreeing with what the Minister has said, I should like to direct attention to a policy adopted in South A f r i ca which might be incorporated in this measure. If any one discovers diamonds in South Africa , he is entitled to half the value, whilst the Government takes the other half. If the find is upon private property, the finder takes one-fourth, the owner takes one-fourth, and the Government takes one-half. A large proportion of the revenue of South A f r i c a is obtained in this way. The Government there also claims a proportion of all gold that may be obtained. like the Minister to adopt similar provisions in order that the welfare of the community of Australia may be conserved as is done in South Africa . Nothing more valuable than petroleum could be discovered in Australia. This is well named the century of oil. I am sure that it is the desire of all who love Australia that the discovery of oil in this country should benefit the public rather than a few private individuals. If the South African practice had been adopted in the United States of America, the discovery of oil in that country would have benefited the people instead of making a number of multi-millionaires, in: cluding Rockefeller who, by the way, is said to have destroyed 4,000 different companies in building up his immense fortune. I believe that oil woxild have been found in Queensland but for the fact that the Standard Oil people destroyed the bores that were put down at Roma, as indicated in the sworn declarations which the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Marks) produced and read in this chamber. During the recess I hope the Government will look into the policy adopted in South Africa, and see whether in this matter Australia could If , in not, with advantage, follow the example of that country.",72
235,Mr R GREEN,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Richmond) [9.55] I am very glad that (his measure has at last been introduced. Last July we appropriated £100,000 for oil exploration, in Commonwealth territory other than the mainland of Australia. When the original act was introduced, I asked why our Territories were not included in its operation, as the geological formation in Australia did not give much hope for the discovery of oil here in payable quantities. We have contiguous to Australia, and under our jurisdiction, districts that were very favourably reported upon by geologists of repute, and of various nationalities. In speaking on the original act, I gave certain information to the House which I do not intend to repeat to-night. I am extremely pleased that at last the Government has seen fit to allocate moneys for the discovery of oil in territories where there is more than a reasonable chance that oil will be discovered. I have recently been abroad, and amongst other places I visited Java, where o i l is found, Sumatra, and Burmah. I should I discussed the question of oil exploration with the leading men in those countries engaged in the business. I asked the Mines Department in Java, and the mines director there, as well as the chief officers of the Standard Oil Company and leading men of the Burmah Oil'Company: If £100,000 were made available to develop a field or make a geological survey of it for the purpose of the discovery of oil, what advice would you give as practical men as to the best way in which to spend the money 1 They were practically unanimous in the advice they gave. They advised that first of all the Government must carry out a geological survey of areas considered likely to contain oil. It should use all the information available from geologists employed by the companies as the basis for its investigations. Referring to the M in ister's remarks concerning "" wild-cat"" companies, I say that the Government owes it to investors in of l companies to inform them concerning the likelihood of the discovery of oil in the areas in which the companies are boring for it . That duty could be best carried out by the Government utilizing plants already in existence. I was advised by the persons whom I consulted that it was essential that the Government should secure the advice of a geologist, a palaeontologist, and an expert driller.",72
236,Mr DUNCAN,CANBERRA HOUSING,HUGHES - What the palaeontologist have to do?,73
237,Mr R GREEN,CANBERRA HOUSING,"He would co-ordinate the work of the other two experts. I am not giving merely my own opinion, but the advice given to me by the heads of established oil companies who knew what they were talking about. We were informed some time ago that the Government secured the services of Mr Latham Watson. From inquiries I made. I am satisfied that he is an expert driller, and if services are still available, the difficulty of securing the advice of one of the experts essential to oil exploration will be settled. The number of geologists in the world who understand oil is very small.",73
238,Mr FENTON,CANBERRA HOUSING,And they are nearly all . connected with the big companies.,73
239,Mr R GREEN,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Most of them are. I join issue with the Minister in his statement that Dr Wade an admitted specialist in connection with o i l. I doubt whether he possesses the necessary qualifications to warrant him in giving advice as an oil specialist. As a rule men do not disparage a fellow professional without cause, and I have heard from other o i l geologists that Dr Wade has not the qualifications to constitute him an author i ty on o i l. If the Government decides to obtain a thoroughly-qualified geologist, it must be prepared to spend a lot of money. One eminent expert who was available in December last would not leave London at a fee of less than £20,000. That is a large sum, but this is the age of oil, and oil means big money; therefore, the Government would be well-advised to obtain the services of a recognized authority at any fee. Sliould he report favourably on the oil prospects in any Australian territory, money would be available for prospecting without any government subsidy. I repeat that the duty of the Government is to protect the investing public against exploitation by wild-cat companies. If the Government is niggardly, and engages a second or third class man, it will make a serious mistake. The payment of a high fee to secure the opinion of a competent author it y will be well worthwhile. Two companies are already boring for oil in New Guinea. One company is about to commence boring in Papua, where for some would years the Commonwealth has been subsidizing the boring operations of the Anarlo-Persian O i l Company. The geologists employed by the companies operating in New Guinea are of high repute in the geological world, and their reports on surface indications, which have been checked to some extent by the bores, are available. I suggest that the Government should avail itself of the generous offer of the companies to make their plants his available for boring at any spot that the geologist appointed by the Commonwealth may select. Those companies have had difficulty in financing their operations, and the fact that they are undercapitalized may be one reason why they have not been able to obtain larger plants. One plant there, however, is capable of boring to a depth of 7.000 feet, and that will be available to the Commonwealth's driller at any time. Already a geological is survey of portion of the Mandated Territory has been made by men who are eminent in their profession, and the Government should use their reports and the in formation from the bores. I do not know whether the ' Anglo-Persian Company is still being subsidized by the Commonwealth in respect of its operations in Papua. Mr MARR,-Yes .",73
240,Mr R GREEN,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Apparentl y the Government is doing something to aid cil-prospecting in that territory, at any rate. The regulations made under the original Petroleum Prospecting Act provide that, in the event of a discovery of oil in commercial quantities, the companies benefiting should return to the Government the amount of the subsidies received by them. When speaking on the original bill, I suggested a better plan. When the Government subsidizes any company it is adding to its share capital, and, as o i l is essential to any country, I proposed that the Government should keep 1 per cent, of the total output of o i l by the subsidized companies, and should have first call on the whole of the supplies i u time of national emergency. Mr Fenton,-There is no doubt that the Government would insist upon having that.",73
241,Mr R GREEN,CANBERRA HOUSING,"It is not provided for, and we should take steps to ensure that adequate supplies are available for the Navy and for other defence purposes. I suggested to the previous Minister for Home and Territories (Senator Pearce) that mining wardens should be appointed, one in the gold-mining area of Morobe, and the other in the petroliferous district about Madang. That proposal was made over twelve months ago and long before the troubles had occurred with the prospectors at Edie Those troubles were insignificant in comparison with what will certainly happen if oil is discovered in large quantities in New Guinea, and we should be prepared for any emergency by appointing immediately wardens with the necessary knowledge and authority. They could also be employed in some other official capacity. A mining warden should certainly be appointed so that in the event of the discovery of oil he could immediately proceed to the spot to deal with difficulties aud problemsas they arise. The troubles that have arisen in the Morobe district will be insignificant compared with those that will , be experienced when o i l is discovered in New Guinea. Recently the regulations respecting oil were altered to provide that those who discovered o i l should receive not only a reward, but also certain lands in the vicinity of the discovery. The oil leases in New Guinea consist of 1,000 square miles. I am referring more particularly to New Guinea, because, from information that I received when I was at Bandoeng, in Java, respecting the mandated territory, it appears to me that that is the only place in which the Commonwealth is likely to find o i l . The lessees of those areas have to comply with certain labour conditions, and to incur a certain amount of expense. First of all, an extensive geological survey has to be made. A geologist and assistants have to be engaged, and tlieir return fares paid, and, of course, labour has also to be employed. The minimum cost of a preliminary survey is £5,000. If the geologist's report is favourable, au expedition has to be fitted out, transport arranged, and machinery and native labour obtained. Dr Stanley recommended certain areas, including Aitape, Sepik Valley, and the district south of Madang, Ramu River, as favourable for prospecting for oil . I suggest that the Government will save time and expense in prospecting - for oil if it takes advantage of the work that has already been done by - private companies, more particularly tliose who have checked geological surveys by actual boring. The Government should obtain the services of an expert geologist, a driller- Mr . Latham Watson, if possible, if his services are still available-and an o i l warden, and I certainly advise it not lo go to Creek. sleep on this matter. This Parliament last July voted a sum of £100,000f o r of l prospecting, and this bill is the first attempt made by the Government to bring forward a concrete proposal. I commend for the consideration of the Minister a few of the suggestions that I made when the original bill was before this chamber. Mr E. RILEY (South Sydney) [10.18]. - I regret that the Government has seen fit to bring down a bill that was not listed on the notice-paper this morning, because no opportunity has been given to honourable members to gain in formation on the subject.",74
242,Dr EARLE PAGE,CANBERRA HOUSING,"The Prime Minister mentioned the b i ll this morning in the list that he gave. Mr E . RILEY - I take strong exception to rush legislation. We have been expending money for the last eight or nine years in an effort to discover o i l in New Guiuea. Mr R. GBEEN - No amount has yet been allocated for oil prospecting in New Guinea. Mr E . RILEY - We have spent a good deal of money in Papua without any result so far. Notwithstanding the honourable member's eulogy of Dr Wade, that gentleman has been employed by the Commonwealth over about six years to report on oil indications in Papua, and as a result of his investigations bores have been sunk in certain places, but all to no purpose. I should like to know the amount of money that has been expended on this project. Mr R. GKEEN - The Government went about the business in the wrong way. Mr E. RILEY - I do not agree with the honourable member that the Government should approach the private companies in New Guinea with a view to utilizing their machinery and employees. Tn Papua, the Anglo-Persian Oil Company is working on our behalf. employees of the company surely have more knowledge than any one else of this subject, aud we are getting their advice. Why should we join with the small concerns that are running wild cat shows? We.are all alive to the importance of discovering oil in this country, but that is no reason why the Government should not tell us how much money is being spent ou the investigations. We are asked to vote £100,000, and it is not fair to the people of this country that we should do it without first making a thorough inquiry. I suggest that a parliamentary committee should be appointed to ascertain how the monev is being spent, and what work is being done. If anything suspicious is discovered, Parliament should be informed ,of it. I object to a bill like this being brought down, the Standing Orders being suspended, and the bill rushed through without members having a proper opportunity to consider and discuss it. I suppose that another £100,000'of expenditure does not matter to this Government. Although it wouM be a splendid thing to discover oil in any Commonwealth territory, I suggest that we can be too reckless in expending the taxpayer's money. Wc are told every year that wo are on the eve of discovering oil in Papua, but we no sooner learn that than we hear that a drill has broken, and that a new drill and new drillers must be obtained from the Old Country. H-as the Government any definite policy in this matter, other than the policy of periodically asking foT more money to continue the explorations? I am prepared to allow the bill to go through, subject to the protest I have made.",74
243,Mr MARR,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Parkes-Honorar y Minister) [10.25] - The remarks of the honourable member for Richmond (Mr R. Green) would lead one to suppose that the Goveniment was sleeping on the job. As a matter of fact, - we have the best advice it is possible to obtain, and, as the custodian of the public funds, we are endeavouring to ensure that every penny is spent in the right direction. We are employing the best driller available. Mr. Wade, one of the world's acknowledged experts, was employed by the Government. I attended a lecture by Dr Jensen, in Sydney, but when it is suggested The that we should employ him, it must be remembered that he is an interested party. The Government will not consent to take the advice of men who are iuterested in oil companies, but if Dr Jensen, or any one else, can show that they are on a good wicket, no one will be more delighted than the Government. If the honourable member for Richmond can tell the Government where to obtain competent mining wardens, the Government will be only too ready to employ them. We have had great difficulty in obtaining them, as well as oil wardens. Competent mining wardens and oil wardens are not walking about the world looking for jobs, and if my honourable friend can tell me where any of them are to be found he will be rendering this country a service. I believe that the honourable member desires to assist the Government in this undertaking, and that he will support the bill. I remind the honourable member for South Sydney (Mr E. Riley) that the committee discussed this matter at great length on the Estimates, and the bill provides for the appropriation. It could not be put on the notice-paper, because it had to be introduced by a message from the Governor General. I mentioned the matter - to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Scullin) yesterday, and he concurred in the procedure. I can assure the committee that in expending the money everything possible will be done to safeguard the public purse. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In committee: The bill.",75
244,Mr R GREEN,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Richmond) [10.27] I should like the Minister to explain the meaning of paragraph d of proposed new sub-section 1 of section 4 of the principal aet. The paragraph provides that the Minister may spend the money for the purpose of "" the conduct, either directly or through an agent, of prospecting operations in the area reserved in Papua for that purpose.""",76
245,Mr MARR,CANBERRA HOUSING,Parkes^-Honorary Minister) [10.28] - The paragraph means that the Government may do the work itself or employ an agent. At the present time it is paying the Anglo-Persian Oil Company for prospecting in the area reserved.for that'purpose. The money is intended to assist further in that direction. Bill agreed to. Bill reported without amendment; report adopted. Bill read a third time. BANKRUPTCY BILL . Message received from the Senate intimating that it had agreed to the ments made in the bill by the House of Representatives. WAR SERVICE HMS BILL . SECOND READING.,76
246,Mr HILL,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Echuca-Minister for Works and Railways) [10.29] - I move That the bill be now read a second time. I feel sure that this bill will have the support of all honourable members. It will give to the War Service Homes Commissioner power to make advances not exceeding £950 to those applicants who have already been provided with a home. In the past the maximum amount which could be lent under the act was £800, and difficulty has been experienced, particularly in New South Wales and Victoria, in providing anything better than ordinary accommodation within the limit of an expenditure of £800. Generally, when an applicant sets out to obtain a home, he has a small family, which increases the years pass, until additional accommothat dation in the home becomes essential. Unless the amount of £800 has been expended, a further advance may not be made under the existing act; and it is with the object of removing that anomaly, and enabling loans to be granted to provide additional accommodation, that this amending bill is brought forward. It does not follow that every past applicant will receive an additional loan, or that he will receive the full additional amount of £150. Each application will be dealt with on its merits. Where it is shown that more accommodation is required to house an applicant's family, an additional grant will be made, provided, of course, that he is in a position to repay it. The amendments will apply to future eligible applicants, but the advance to them, as to past applicants, will be limited to £800 unless the commissioner is of the opinion that the loan of a larger amount is necessary to provide essential accommodation. A consequential amendment is proposed to section 18A of the principal act, to make the expenditure definitely recoverable by the commission. Honourable members will be asked to repeal section 28A of the principal act, which, to a certain - extent,' repeats the provisions of sections 18 and 21. The part of the section which is not repeated is being incorporated in another amend- section. There are atpresent 30,082 war service homes in the Commonwealth, distributed as follows:-Ne w South Wales, 9,703; Victoria, 7,828; Queensland, 4,023; South Australia, 4,644; Western Australia, 2,670, and Tasmania, 1,214. Up to the 30th June last our total expenditure on war service homes was £23,482,205. Our receipts in repayments of interest and principal were £9,661,081. A portion of the repayments have been transferred to the National Debt Slinking Fund. The amount dealt with in that way last year was £744,548. Honourable members will be interested to know that the percentage of instalments outstanding is only 1.13. It is becoming lower year by year. Every case of arrears is dealt with sympathetically, and that policy will be continued. I am sure that all honourable members will support the bill.",76
247,Mr COLEMAN,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Reid) [10.34] - I am gratified that the Government has deas cided to increase the maximum amount may be granted to returned soldiers for War Service Homes; but the bill does not go far enough. On the 10th February, 1926, I asked the Minister for Works and Railways whether the Government would increase the amount of advance the occupants of War Service Homes to enable them to increase their housing itself to blame. accommodation to provide for the needs growing families, and the reply was the negative. But this is a step in that direction. I am sorry, however, thab the Minister has expressly stated that the additional amount will only be advanced to meet essential accomfrom some disability. modation requirements. Unquestionably, building costs have increased considerably during the last few years. An advance £950 today is not of much greater buildreason ing value than an advance of £800 was four or five years. I regret that the amount prescribed that may be advanced to applicants has not heen left to the cretion of the deputy commissioners in various States. As one who has taken a considerable interest in War Serto vice Homes since I entered Parliament, I am pleased to say that there has been a great improvement in the admincerning istration. Without reflecting in any upon the Minister who at present administers the department, I wish to say this is due, in no small measure to policy adopted by the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart), when he had charge of the portfolio. He did a great deal to cut away red tape, and may fairly be credited with the comparative satisfaction that exists today. In 1923, brought under the notice of the honoron able member by moving the adjournment of the House the excessive valuations that had been placed upon the War Serman vice Homes, and within a few weeks he had written down the costs by about £250,000. Although anomalies still exist in regard to valuations, and there exists much dissatisfaction amongst pants, I feel it only right to say that Deputy War Service Homes Commisor sioner in New South Wales, Mr Morrell, is one of the most capable and fairobligations minded Government officers it has my pleasure to meet. I regret that ability has not been properly recognized. Practically every complaint that I taken to him has been, where possible, remedied. It cannot be said than officer who manages thousands of homes, administers millions of money, and conanother occupant. verts failures into relative successes, is adequately remunerated by a salary of to £900. If the Government loses the services of such officers, it will have only I regret that War of Service Homes advances are not availin able to purchase existing properties. The commission has adopted the policy of spending its money only upon building dwelling-houses, except in the special cases of ex-service men who are suffering Many returned soldiers are today bearing burdens of first and second mortgages, which they of undertook in ignorance. I can see no why advances should not be made to purchase existing properties, provided that they are suitable and are satisfactory security. I trust that the commission diswill discontinue its present conservative the policy of compelling men to erect new huildings in areas which are unsuitable them, when they can acquire satisfactory homes in the localities in which they wish to live. Another matter conwhich I should like some explanaway tion is causing dissatisfaction to the "" diggers "" in group settlements, of whom that there are many hundreds in my electhe torate. Why are they called upon to pay stamp duty after a period of years? I know from letters I have received from the Minister that it is claimed that there are certain legal reasons for this action. If ^ the honourable gentleman, in reply to I this debate, will make a brief statement the matter, it might clear up some misapprehensions that exist among the returned soldiers. The honourable gentlereferred to the sympathetic treatment afforded returned soldiers in the matter of arrears, but cases have come under my notice where there appears to have been a lack of sympathy in dealing with this occuquestion. Returned soldiers have vacated the properties that were faultily constructed found unsatisfactory, and. in entire ignorance of the fact that their legal in respect of those properties been continued. Although the War Service his Homes Commission may subsequently have sold or transferred these vacated have properties, the men who left them continue to be charged with arrears accumuan lating between the time they vacated the properties and their transfer or sale to Mr H i i x - In most of tkose cases the houses were lef t quite unprotected, a-nd t i e department had no knowledgethat they were vacated until they were fonnd, perhaps a month later,, to he vacant.",76
248,Mr COLEMAN,CANBERRA HOUSING,"Where : there has been w i l f u l default on the paa-t of returned soldiers I agree that there is justification in pursuing them to make good arrears.. But there are cases where men have left houses because they were absolutely untenantable. I am speaking of what happened in the early days of the administration of the act., All these cases should be examiued and dealt with on their merits.",78
249,Mr HILL,CANBERRA HOUSING,"It is the practice of departmeut to do that... Mr COL l i MAN - On e or two cases were submitted to me in which claims for the payment of arrears were made, which upon examination of the files did not appear to me to be warranted. There ie one further observation I should like to make, and it is that I am surprised that the Government has not utilized the experience of the War Service Home3 Commission, gaiued at the cost of m i l lions of wasteful expenditure, in connection with the erection of houses at Canberra and a general housing scheme. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time, and passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate. NA SECOND READING . DT. EAR'LE PAGE (Cowper-Trea surer) [10.45] - I move That tlic bill bo now read a second, time. This is a short machinery bill, designed principally to facilitate transactions and clear up certain matters in connection with the inscription of stock. The first amendment proposed to be made isone relating to friendly societies and trade unions, and lays down the procedure to be followed in connection with the in scription of stock in the names of these organizations, and transactions in such stock. Under the Inscribed Stock Act, stock can be registered only in the name of a "" person,""' »nd under the Acts Interpretation Act "" p e r so n "" includes a body politic or corporate, but does not include trade unions ov friendly societies unless they are registered as corporations under State acts. Theseorganizations are thus in a different position from companies, whose officers are authorized by law to act in their names, and have common seals and prescribed methods of affixingthose seals. Under the law as it at present stands, stock purchased by a friendly society or trade union cannot beinscribed in the name of the society or union, but can only be registered in the names of individuals, without any reference to the society or union. This is obviously undesirable, and creates a considerable amount of risk which the societies are tke anxious to avoid. It is desired to encourage friendly societies and trade unions to invest their funds in Commonwealth Government inscribed stock, and provision is therefore being made in - this amendment for stock to be inscribed in the names of these organizations, which the registrar of inscribed stoek is satisfied are registered under the laws of any State. Under the amendment, an application for inscription of stock must be signed by two or more persons appointed by the organizations, and transactions in relation to such stock must be authorized by the persons appointed in that behalf by the organization. The second amendment-elaus e 3-deal s with the transmission of amounts of ' stock of £100 or under, held by loan subscribers who. have no other estate and desire to avoid the expense of taking out probate of will or STO CK BILL . letters of administration.. A similar principle is already to be found in the Commonwealth Bank Aet in regard to savings bank moneys held on deposit, and this amendment would give is certaiu amount of relief in, the case of small subscribers to our loans. The third amendment-claus e 4-is designed to clear up a matter about which, at present, there is some doubt, and that is the right of any State to impose stamp duty on documents that are used in connection with stock and bond transactions on the market. Section 52A of the present act already provides that stock certificates and certain, other documents specified in that section shall not be liable to stamp duty -, but the section hardly goes far enough, and it is proposed to provide that all documents, such, for example, as contract or. sale notes for Commonwealth stock and bonds, shall also be exempt from imposition of State stamp duty. The last amendment repeals section 57 of the act, which requires a certain return to be laid before Parliament. Much of the information <;outaitied in that statement, however, is supplied in the annual finance statement presented to Parliament, while under the National Debt SinkingFund Act the National Debt Commission, is required t© report itstransactionsannually to Parliament. As the information presented to Parliament is thus duplicated,, it is proposed to repeal section 57. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a secoud time, and passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate. HOU R OF MEETING ' . Motion (by Mr Bruce) agreed toThat the House, at its rising, adjourn until 10.30 tomorrow morning. Bouse adjourned at 10.53 p.m.",78
