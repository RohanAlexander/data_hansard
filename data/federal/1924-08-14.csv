COCKATOO ISLAND DOCKYARD.",13
17,Mr BRUCE,REPATRIATION ROYAL,"On the 6th August, in reply to a request from the honourable member for Darling (Mr Blakeley), I promised to inquire into the complaint that a number of employees were being dismissed at Cockatoo Island. I am now in receipt of advice from the Commonwealth Shipping Board that it is regretfully compelled to reduce the number of employees engaged on construction and repair work, as the present volume of work is not sufficient to employ more than a limited number of men. It may be pointed out that there must, of necessity, be fluctuations in the number .of men employed in industrial undertakings of the nature of that carried out at Cockatoo, and it is hoped that the endeavours of the board to secure additional constructional and repair work will, in the near future, absorb such of the present employees that it is now necessary to temporarily discharge. NA ENGLAND.  the honourable member for Franklin (Mr. have Seabrook) asked the following quesWhat was the highest price the Australian canned fruit brought in England, and what was the average price of the total shipment. I am now able to furnish the honourable member with the following information : The highest price obtained in England for 1921-22 and 1922-23 shipments of Commonwealth pool canned fruits was 18s. per dozen, and the average price 6a. per dozen.

18,Mr MANNING,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"Macquarie) [2.39] This is one of the most important provisions proposed to be inserted in the bill. It will well repay the most careful consideration. We know the very grave difficulties which exist, and have existed for some time in the matter of, exchange. From both sides of this chamber the Government has been recommended to take some action which will tend to make the position less acute than it is at present. I have given a great deal of consideration to the method of dealing with the problem now proposed, and it is nearly two years since I first advocated it . I claim to be the first to have published in the press in Sydney this method, which I regard as absolutely safe, of dealing with the exchange problem. then was acute, and it has become more troublesome since. The exact cause of it is extraordinarily difficult to admit that it is difficult, as was pointed out last night by the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin), to reconcile our import and export figures with the present condition of the exchanges. The exchange difficulty, however, undoubtedly does exist.  tent?",13
19,Mr MANNING,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"I am not prepared to say, but it is certain that it detrimentally affects the industries and the welfare of this country. Great difficulty is experienced by persons who desire to transfer credits from England to Australia, but those whodesire to transfer credits from Australia to England can do so at a profit. I mentioned this subject several times in this chamber before the bill was suggested, and I remember the honourable member for East-Sydney (Mr . West), saying it was a matter with which experts should deal. I shall quote briefly the opinion of a number of"" experts, though it would appear that the honourable member, and other honourable members, are prepared to accept the opinions of experts only when they agree with their own.",14
20,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"If an opinion does not agree with one's own, it is not that of an expert.",14
21,Mr MANNING,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"It is no use appealing to Caesar unless one is prepared to accept his decision, and an umpire is superfluous if we quarrel with his decision. I'have heard it stated by honourable members that the exchange difficulty is entirely artificial, and was brought about by the trading banks in order that they might make greater profits.",14
22,Mr COLEMAN,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,Undoubtedly .,14
23,Mr MANNING,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"The first authority I shall quote is Mr Andrew Williamson, the chairman of directors of the English, Scottish and Australian Bank, in London. The bank has a larger capital than any other British bank trading in Australia, and if the present situation was satisfactory to any bank, it would be satisfactory to that bank. There are banks with large businesses in Australia only, but this bank has a large business both here and in Great Britain. Mr William son, in his address to the annual general meeting of shareholders of the bank, The difficulty held on the 14th November last, dealt with the control of currency and credit, and said:find. I As you may remember, when addressing you last year, I advocated a plan for Australia SE a temporary expedient to meet a temporary deadlock. I then said:-""In such circumstances the alternative which presents the most natural and sound method to relieve a situation which is most prejudicial to the best interests of Australia seems to be for the Commonwealth Notes Board (the issuing authority) to issue notes to the banks in Australia against deposit by them in London of cash or its equivalent. There would be no inflation in this, as such issue of notes would be secured by cash, f l for £1 on thiE side. This would greatly assist the free flow of the export trade of Australia."" That is the method that I think might wisely be had recourse to in times of exceptional stringency, when the balance of trade may be exceptionally disturbed. It should never be forgotten that control of credit is quite as essential as control of currency. Scheme after scheme may be ingeniously devised for controlling currency, but until you can devise a scheme that will also control credit, the present methods of sound banking, supplemented in times of exceptional stringency by some such facilities as I have already suggested, will, I believe, be found to work more smoothly, more effectively, and more fairly than any of the schemes yet suggested. Since these observations were written the findings of the Imperial Economic Conference on the question of inter-Imperial exchanges have been announced, and in the main confirm what I have said, though they cover a wider range. Almost at the same time an opinion was expressed by the president of the Bank of New South Wales, Mr Thomas Buckland, at the half-yearly meeting of the shareholders of his bank in Sydney, on the 30th November. The following was published as an extract from his address in the Sydney Morning Herald of the 1st December last:The exchange position continues to be abnormal, and to cause us some concern. Money, being the foundation of modern economic civilization and exchange, rates playing as they do such a.n important part on the movement of commodities, they must be of great interest to the community, but the mutter has become so complex that it would be a futile . endeavour on my part, or indeed upon the part of the moat astute financial authority, to attempt to forecast its operations, even in the immediate future. Before the war, currencies were based upon a general standard, that is to nay, the rates of exchange obtaining between the different countries of the world were more or less stable, and comparatively small, variations being governed chiefly by exports and imports, say seasonal requirements, but now political influences have such a very material bearing upon the matter. Speaking more directly for Australia, I would mention that when currency was on a gold basis, and the banks in Australia issued their own notes, the moving of the crops gave us little concern; but with an inconvertible note issue at both ends the adjustment by the Australian banks of surplus balances in London has been very difficult and costly for the last few years, and I feel that some scheme whereby value might be received in London and an equivalent amount in notes issued to the banks in Australia, to relieve such temporary stress, or vice versa, should the balance veer round the other way, is a matter which should receive the most serious consideration of our Notes Board. Without some such relief, and the impossibility of making gold shipments to adjust balances, the rates of exchange between Australia and London cannot be expected to be on the sajne plane as when currency was on a gold basis. That is the opinion of one of the leading bankers of Australia. A fact that is often lost sight of is that since the gold standard has been abolished and we have had an inconvertible note issue, both here and in Great Britain , it has become absolutely impossible to ship money from - one side of the world to the. other Various means have been suggested for - overcoming the difficulty, and I would like to repeat a quotation that I made in my speech on the motion for the second reading of the bill . It was an opinion expressed to the shareholders of the Midland Bank in England by Mr . R. MCKenna, who said':People often talk of money going abroad or of foreign money coming here, but as a fact, when gold is not in use, money is incapable of migration. An individual may sell his sterling to an American for dollars, but the American will then own the sterling in England 'and the Englishman dollars in the United States. The change of ownership does not remove the money, which necessarily remains, and can only be expended where it was created. No exchange transactions, no purchase nor sale of securities, no import of foreign goods for export of our own, can take the money out of the country or bring it 'here. That is the position which we have to face. The exchange difficulty has been largely aggravated by the abroad of large sums of money, the value of which can be returned to Mr Manning. only by the importation of goods. This practice should be stopped. The honourable member for Barton (Mr. MCDonald) on the 26th June, when speaking on unemployment, brought the exchange situation under the notice of the House, and he blamed the Government for not taking steps t'o deal with it. He saidUnemployment is particularly bad in the manufacturing trades. That is largely due to the inaction of the Government in connection with the exchange problem, which has dislocated our trade and commerce. Surely the Ministry will not say that that is not a matter for their attention. It was the duty of the Government to solve the exchange problem, but it failed to do so. As a result, instead of our secondary industries being in a flourishing condition, and giving employment to all connected with them, Australia has been flooded with an excess of imports. I agree with the honourable member that the exchange problem must be dealt with if we are to solve the difficulty of unemployment. If our tariff is to have the desired effect, that is, the protection of our Australian industries, we must solve the exchange problem. No better way of doing it can be found than that suggested under the amendment. The honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Lazzarini) painted a fanciful picture of what would happen when these notes were issued in Australia, and were used for purchasing more goods overseas. Surely the honourable member does not suggest that we should benefit both ways? One cannot have his cake and eat it. If notes are issued by the Commonwealth Bank in Australia we must have in London moneys and securities against it. In my amendment, which was adopted by the Government and inserted in the 1 bill in another place, I stipulated "" approved"" securities, one reason being that if gold were paid into the bank, as is now proposed under the amendment, and notes, pound for pound, issued against it, the money would be lying idle in the bank. The original act stipulates that a certain percentage of the money should be held in gold in reserve, and the balance invested. Section 60i of the Commonwealth Bank Act readsThe Board may invest the remainder or any part thereofborrowing (a) On deposit with any bank, or (b) in securities of the United Kingdom, or of the Commonwealth, or of a Australia state; or (c) in Trade Bills with a currency of not more than one hundred and twenty days. This money can be invested in securities of the United Kingdom. If it is invested in gilt-edged securities, the interest will be paid to the credit of the country holding the securities and issuing notes against them. It has been suggested that one way out of the exchange difficulty would be to make Bank of England notes legal currency in Australia.",14
24,Mr WEST,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,The honourable member would find it very difficult to get the committee to agree to that suggestion.,16
25,Mr MANNING,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"I do not say that we should do it, but the suggestion has been made by men of ability quite equal to that of the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr West). This is a double difficulty. We are faced, not only with the exchange situation, but with a shortage of currency in Australia. If Bank of England notes were brought out here and placed in circulation all the profit on the issue would be gained by the Bank of England. We know that for £100 in England, it is now possible to obtain only £97 out here. Only last week I saw the quotation by one of the leading banks of Sydney of t£3 2s. 6d. per cent, as the lowest rate at which it would exchange a considerable amount of money with England. By bringing out Bank of England notes to Australia, we should be losing that 3 per cent., and also any shortage that might occur through loss of notes. Our own notes here are just as good as Bank of England notes. That method of solving the exchange difficulty would not be as effective as the methods suggested by the amendment. It has been stated that the alteration in the notes issue is a deep-dyed conspiracy by the banks to further their own interests. The exchange difficulty is not appreciated by the banks. I admit that they are making money out of it, but they always make a profit out of exchange. They could make it in many ways much more profitable to them than the antagonizing of their customers, which is happening now. The bankers are anxious to have the exchange position made easier. They realise that there is a sprag in the wheel of progress which is blocking business. The exchange difficulty is leading to a great deal of unemployment. I hold no brief for the bankers. I am acting for the people of this country, and not for the financial institutions. Many people imagine that when a tariff duty is imposed we are making the foreigner pay, and they rejoice when, say, their grocer has to pay extra income tax, because they think that the high cost of goods is being taken out of him. Honourable members know that the import duty is put on an article when sold, and we know that the retailers, when putting prices on goods, allow for their income tax. The honourable member for South Sydney (Mr E. Riley) recently said that increased costs are passed on, and in the same way the profits of the banks are passed on. They try to make profits, but desire to do so with as little inconvenience to the public as possible, and without injury to the country. Honourable members have quoted the balance-sheets of some banks to show what profits, they are making. But, in any case, they will earn profits. We all follow the same practice, and look after ourselves. The banks would not be in the position in which they are today if they did not look after the shareholders' interests. The shareholders would not permit the directors to hold their positions for long if they made no profits. Unless we can solve our exchange difficulties the troubles described by the honourable member for Barton (Mr F. MCDonald) will become still more acute. Raising the tariff barrier is no solution, for facilities for purchasing goods are better in Great Britain than in Australia at present.",16
26,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,We should be manufacturing our own materials here.,16
27,Mr MANNING,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"I agree with the honourable"" member, but we shall not be able to do that to a much greater extent than at present until the exchange difficulty is removed. Once that trouble is overcome we can ascertain whether our tariff is sufficient  member is putting the cart before the horse.",16
28,Mr MANNING,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"I do not think so. After it was known that the Government had decided to include this provision in the bill, the following cablegram from London was published in the Sydney press:The cabled announcement of .the proposal to amend the Commonwealth Bunk Bill so as to permit the issue of notes against security in England has given general satisfaction in financial and mercantile circles. It is believed that this will result in relieving the currency stringency, and removing apprehensions that there 'would be difficulty in financing the wool clip. Some American wool firms were considering whether it would be worthwhile sending buyers to the Australian sales. We want as many wool buyers as possible to come here to compete for our wool. Every man who has the welfare of his country at heart desires that our wool and wheat shall be marketed at the best possible price. One great trouble that we have to face in marketing our products, is that they must all be sold within a few months of the year. At any rate, if they are not marketed they are ready for the market, and loss is caused by holding them. The outlook for the coming wheat harvest is excellent. It is quite probable that the value of the wheat harvest this year will be three-fifths of the value of the wool clip. If we are to enjoy the full measure of prosperity that such a volume of production should mean we must take all possible steps to obtain the full market price for our commodities. The honourable member for Angas (Mr Gabb), in addressing the committee last night, said that I was in favour of currency inflation. He does not understand the difference between a period of prosperity and a period of inflation. Currency inflation has become a bogy with some honourable members, and also with certain financial authorities in the business world. country, on account of the prevailing seasonal conditions, should be passing through an era of great prosperity, but the exchange difficulty has caused serious financial stringency. The only reason why die public is feeling so little inconvenience is that the seasons have been favourable. I invite the honourable member for Angas to explain what he means by currency inflation. In my opinion, the currency is inflated when paper money is issued without a sufficient backing. Would the honourable member consider the currency to be inflated if the Commonwealth Bank issued notes in Australia against approved security in London? Or Mr Manning. would he suggest that the issuing of notes by the head office of the bank in Sydney, London, 24th July. against securities held in this country, is inflation? Honourable members must rid their minds of the idea that prosperity means inflation.",16
29,Mr WATSON,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,The currency is inflated when we buy goods at too high a price. *,17
30,Mr MANNING,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"That accentuates the trouble. In the last seven years the gross turnover of our trade has increased nearly two and a half times, but we have £3,000,000 less currency to deal with it. It is quite true, as has been pointed out, that the exchange difficulty could be overcome by still further increasing our imports, but honourable members who advocate that policy are in a hopeless minority in this, chamber.. I submit that we must stabilize the exchange situation before we can hopeto develop oursecondary industries so that they can provide for our people all the employment that they would be capable of providing under normal conditions. The Government is to be commended for having put this provision in the bill. The honourable member for Darwin (Mr Whitsitt) has proposed that we shall return as speedily as possible to the gold standard, but we must recognize that to return to the gold standard immediately would hurt us considerably. Probably few honourable members of the committee realise that better than does the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin), and I noticed that, when he was speaking on this subject last night he was very careful in what he said. We all hope for a return to the gold standard, but I do not think that it will This be possible for some time to come. The best means of rectifying the exchange situation in the immediate future is that now proposed by the Government.  [3.8] - The honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Manning) claimed credit for having originated the suggestion that notes should be issued against credits in London.",17
31,Mr MANNING,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"I did not. I said that I first put the suggestion into print. I heard of it in New South Wales, and it struck me as being a very fine one.  orable member also claimed credit for introducing it to honourable members when he delivered his second-reading speech on this bill. As a matter of fact, quite a number of us have known that for the last twelve months the private banking companies have been consistently advocating the adoption of the principle, and they have done their best to enlist the sympathetic attention of certain honourable members of this chamber. L it t l e credit is due to the honourable member for his efforts to bolster np the policy which is favoured by the private banking institutions.",17
32,Mr MANNING,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"It took some of them a long while to decide in favour of it .  the honourable member said, a few moments ago, that we must remedy the exchange difficulty before we can develop our secondary industries, I interjected that he was putting the cart before the .horse. I suggest that the best way to counteract the difficulty is to build up our industries. .Insure the local manufacture of our raw material, thus keeping our credits in Australia instead of in London, and we shall be relieved of the necessity for providing a remedy such as is embodied in the amendment. honourable members have suggested that this proposal is in the interests of the primary producers, particularly the wool-growers. I have not heard more than a passing reference to the wheat growers, who comprise the middleclass section of primary producers. For a long time they have been agitating for a Government guarantee for this season's wheat and the Government has remained adamant, but when the wealthy wool-growers require something done the Government acts at once. Of course wool production is one of our staple industries, and I favour its being assisted if the assistance is extended to all primary industries. I am convinced, however, that this proposal is not in the interest of any section of primary producers. Many explanations have been given of the causes of the present state of affairs, but I have not heard any honourable member attach the blame to the private banking institutions, which are principally responsible.",18
33,Mr WHITSITT,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"I think the British Government is responsible.  is a great deal of t r u th in the statement, which has never been contradicted on behalf of .the private banking institutions, that during the last two years they .have advanced such large .sums Of money for speculative purposes that their cash .reserves in proportion to liabilitiei have declined about 17£ per cent. .Binding themselves at a dead end, the banks have asked .the Government to help them out of their difficulties. When the notes are made available to them upon the security of London credits they will be used not for the benefit of the primary producers, but to get the banks out .of the difficulties in which they have in volved themselves.",18
34,Mr SCULLIN,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"How much .of the money will be used to rectify their overtrading ?  the principal purpose for which the money is required. It is time to tear away the veil from those hypocrites who.say that this amendment is in the interest of the primary producers. The Minister for  a private member, mentioned that he had exported a quantity of t in and, owing to the adverse exchange, for every £100 which the sale abroad yielded he received Some £97. The producers of wool and wheat also must be losing 3 per cent, of every £100 worth of goods they export. Under the amendment, while the banks will receive £ 1 0 0 they will pay only £ 9 7 to the producer, and by the time their adjustments are made the exchange will possibly have righted itself. Moreover, they will be able to build up credits upon the basis of there notes, and the cheque money thus created will be lent to the primary producers at 7 pe>r cent, or 8 per cent, interest. Thus the banks will benefit in two ways.",18
35,Mr MANNING,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"The secondary industries are likely to benefit just as much as, if not more than, the primary industries.  see where the benefit to the primary in dustries comes in . This is not proposed in the interests of the primary industries, but to enable the private banking institutions to get out of the difficultaea in which they have placed themselves. The Treasurer is the Leader of the Country party in this House, and if this proposal is framed in the interests of £h« primary producers, how is it that the honourable gentleman did not know that it was necessary when moving the second reading of the bill. In introducing the bill itself the honourable gentleman said that this provision would have the - effect of killing our secondary industries. Surely the honourable gentleman did not altogether forget the primary industries when he was introducing the bill. Which of the two opinions expressed by the Treasurer is correct?",18
36,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"They are the same.  a vast difference between them. I should like to know from the honourable gentleman whether he stands by his statement that this provision would give our industries a setback, because it would be cheaper to import than to produce locally.",19
37,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"I pointed out that that would take place only if the provision were operated without proper discretion.  read the honourable gentleman's speech through, and he did not make any qualification of the statement. I have referred to. He said that damage would be done to our industries, and there would be consequential unemployment. He further said that a consideration of these possibilities would show that the central bank must not be directed to issue notes in the way now proposed.",19
38,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"This is not a direction.  is that since the Treasurer made his second-reading speech on the bill, Senator Greene, a very prominent member of another place, who has not denied that he is in close touch with the private banking institutions, submitted this proposal at their suggestion. I should think that the Treasurer' would stand by his original opinion ""when he knows the source of this amendment.' Practically every one of the amendments moved in another place by Senator Greene was submitted more to embarrass the Treasurer than for any other reason, and all were in the interests of the private banking institutions. In the circumstances, how is it that the Treasurer meekly accepts these amendments?",19
39,Mr MANNING,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"The honourable member is giving the credit for this amendment to the wrong senator. It was notmoved by Senator Greene, but by Senator Duncan.  Greene said that the private banking institutions had been asking for this provision for twelve months, and he supported it. He did so, not because it would benefit the primary industries, but because it would benefit the private banking institutions. I have no doubt that the honourable member for Indi (Mr. Cook) will tell the wool-growers and wheat-growers of his electorate, through Hansard, that this provision is intended to benefit the primary producers. If they take the trouble to look into it they will find that it is in the interests of the private banking institutions. The creation of credits, and the issue of notes for credits is a policy for whichhonorable members on this side stand, so long as the credits are in Australia, and we know what they are. We do not stand for the building up of credits upon some mythical security on the other side of the world. The probability is that these credits do not exist in London at all. No honourable member opposite can tell us whether our credits overseas represent £5,000,000, £10,000,000 or £20,000,000. The honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Manning) has admitted that he does not know the extent of our credits on the other side of the world. The Treasurer also admits that he does not know what they amount to; yet he is proposing that our notes shall be issued on the basis of those mythical credits. If we want to benefit the primary producers of this country, our notes should be issued in Australia against securities here. The Common: wealth Bank should be placed in a position to issue notes, so that our primary producers may get £100 for every £100 worth of their products. There should not be a reduction of 3 per cent, bo benefit private banking institutions, who will build up credits on the notes and, later on, as I said before, advance them to the primary producers, charging interest at 7 per cent, or 8 per cent. They will gain both ways, whilst the primary producers stand to lose under this provision. We have no objection to a note issue based upon our local credits, but we do object to the issue of notes ou some mythical credit on the other side of the World which the Treasurer is unable to define. If the Government desires to benefit the primary industries, the way is clear and distinct. It should build up our secondary industries for the manufacture locally of our raw materials. It should seek to bring about an early restoration of the balance of trade in our favour, and discontinue the present reckless policy of borrowing abroad. trade cannot be balanced under a proposal of this kind, which is merely a palliative, and will only accentuate the trouble. The proper way is to build up our industries for the local manufacture of our raw materials, and keep our credits in Australia, where we shall know what they are.",19
40,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"Maribyrnong) [3.31] I do not intend to enter into the intricate question of exchange, but there are one or two facts which I should like to bring under the notice of honourable members.",20
41,Mr GABB,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,I think we should have a quorum. [Qtioitim formed.],20
42,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"I am thoroughly in accord with the arguments advanced by the honourable member for Hume (Mr . Parker* Moloney). My solution for the settlement of most of the troubles from which we are suffering is the encouragement of our local manufacturing industries. Instead of sending our raw materials to Britain and elsewhere, we should establish industries for their manufacture here, and thus give employment to our own people. I wish to direct attention to some remarks made at a recent conference, which will always form a part of the political history of the Treasurer (Dr Earle Page). attended this conference, I think at the end of last week, and induced the farmers and settlers to endorse the Federal pact. If he had remained at the conference a little longer, his education would have been improved. The conference discussed a question relating to the Commonwealth Bank, and I quote the following report for the honourable gentleman's information : At the conference of the Farmers and Settlers' Association, held in Sydney, a motion urging the Commonwealth Bank to open branches in country towns was carried by a large majority. Mr Thorby, M.L.A., pointed out that the bank bill now going through the Federal Parliament would alter the Commonwealth Bank from a trading bank to a federal clearing house for the other banks. He said the motion should be made to refer to 'the state bank. This point was emphasized, but the mover refused to alter the wording of. his motion. He said he was quite aware of the intentions of the bill, but considered that the Commonwealth Bank should remain a trading bank. The conference carried a resolution that amounted to an expression of want of confidence in the Treasurer for the action he had taken in trying to' emasculate the Our Commonwealth Bank. Can any other construction be placed on the report! It was a meeting of farmers and settlors who were holding their annual parliament; they were armed with the latest statistics, and primed with the eloquent speeches of the Treasurer himself. Mr . Thorby, when he referred to the bill , must have known that, so far fro m enlarging and extending the operations of the Commonwealth Bank, it would turn it into an institution upon which the private banks could lean, and out of which they could grow rich.",20
43,Dr EABXE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,Does not the resolution state that the scope of the Commonwealth Bank is enlarged?,20
44,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"It does not. The farmers and settlers have asked for an extension of the bank, and they want to see branches of it in every country town, so that they may receive even-handed financial justice. When the Treasurer next consults, the electors, he w i ll be brought to the bar of judgment, and will be roundly and soundly condemned. Many of the votes given to him in the past will go to his opponent in the future. The only members of this committee who are standing behind the primary producers are the members of the Opposition and the honourable memHe ber for Darwin (Mr Whitsitt). On twopoints he stands out as a bright, shining star on the other side. He is quite sound on the subject of protection. I would like him to have a heart-to-heart talk with the Treasurer, and with that almost incorrigible free trader, the honourable  does the bill, with the proposed increase in the note issue, and the boosting of things generally, mean ? It means that on the surface the Government is protectionist, but. is really doing all it can to k ill Australian industries. . Finance has an intimate connection with commercial and primary producing interests. We cannot conduct our mercantile houses or our farms or float our ships, without finance. The business of the world is closely interwoven with finance. We have heard a lot about our credits in London, and during the last election I was partly convinced that we had a huge balance amounting to £60,000,000, on hand in London. There is no doubt that, from time to time there have been big balances in our favour in Londou. During the war, and immediately after, I believe,, many millions of pounds were lying to our credit there. How were they used ? They were not shipped out here. The Treasurer,, and paxticulaily the Prime Minister, know that these millions of pounds are let out on short-dated loans for a month or three months, and that they thus assist British manufacturers to compete with Australian manufacturers This Australian money is loaned to our industrial opponents in the United Kingdom. The Prime Minister will admit that it is often let out for periods as short as a month.",20
45,Mr BRUCE,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,A week.,21
46,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"I wished to be conservative in my statement. 'The use of this money by our competitors in England retards the development of Australian industries. What the Minister for Trade  tin is true of all our exports. We pay practically a 3 per cent, export duty on all of them,. Surely we have not got beyond the stage of trying to find a remedy. The bill is only a stop-gap proposal, as a result of which our last condition will be worsethan our first. Thetime has arrived when we should determine that Australian requirements must be manufactured in* Australia, so that goods to the value of millions of pounds will not need to come from the other side of the world. Our adverse trade balance last year amounted to £21,000,000, and in the previous year to £13,000,000, making a total for the two years of £34,000,000. It is strange that during 1923-24 the two largest items of imports were apparel and metals and machinery. Et is interesting to note that a reduction for the year of, approximately, £6,000,000 in apparel, textiles, and goods of that class by practical action? wasmore than counterbalanced by an increase of £8,544,000 in the value of imports of metals and machinery. There is a process going on that will eventually kill our metal industries.",21
47,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"The importations machinery are an encouraging sign. They Tasmania, is Victoria. will enable new Australian industries to be started.",21
48,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"Certain classes of steel may not be produced here, but it will be found that the bulk of the imports can be made in Australia. The time for ing that we cannot make them has passed. Honourable members have had aninvitation to visit Thompson's foundry,, at Castlemaine.. If the proprietors of those works had been asked seven years ago whether they could make: a marine engine, they would, most likely have answered "" No,"" but they have done it under the stress of war conditions.. In addition to Thompson's, there are Walker's Limited, at Maryborough, in Queensland, and foundries in New South Wales* that make this class of machinery today. Tons of the metals imported, and hundred of thousands of pounds' worth, of the machinery, could be made not merely as well, but better, in Australia than in any other country. If we could manufacture all the requirements of our population of 6,000,000, thei exchange difficulty would practically disappear. More money wouM then be needed in the Commonwealth, more* wages would be paid, and Australians would become better customers of the primary producers:",21
49,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"It would be better if we had 20,000,000 people here.",21
50,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"Yes , but how can we increase the population unless we have a greater variety of industries?' The Treasurer would have Australians remain hewers of wood and drawers of water.",21

52,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"I give the Treasurer credit for what he has done, but not for that. When we ask him, and those who support him, to do something practical to promote the industries of Australia,, no action is taken. What is the good of words on a platform if they are not backed What is the use of merely saying that we have wonderful sourcesof electric power in Australia ?",21
53,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,Hydro-electri c power is being harnessed in Australia at the present moment.,21
54,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"The State that is doof ing most in that direction, apart from If we could supply cheap electricity in every state it would stimulate manufactures and give employment to workmen. Will the Treasurer explain how the bill will affect exchanges ? It is probably safe to say that say40,000 Australians have gone to the British Empire Exhibition at Wembly, and for European, and American: tours. If they spend £500 each, a total of £20,000,000 of Auateualiaffi money is being spent abroad.",21
55,Mr MANNING,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"Tha f is to our advanranch, worse. tage. It will help us out of the exchange difficulty.",22
56,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"I do not think so. People who claim to Befinancial experts 1 1 tell us* that millions' of pounds are lying to our credit in London, but in view of the Fact that ih the last two years' tradebalance has deteriorated to the exnotes. tent of £'34iOOO-,OO0, it would appear that we must have' a debit instead of a credit balancein London.

The credit may, of course, be more, but, then, again, it may be nothing. to the figures quoted by the I honourable member for Yarra (Mr. (Scullin) last night, we have no credit in London. Those figures have not yet controverted. The Treasurer and his supporters are plainly groping in the dark. They are obeying the dictates of Comthe private banks.

76,Mr CUNNINGHAM,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"Oh ! they will do better than that. They only give £97 for each £100 bill now if they bring the credit here, but the Government proposes to give them 100 £1 notes for every £100 worth of security lodged by them in London. They will proceed to build up £3 or £4 worth of credit on each £1 note they get, and will charge the primary producers 7 per cent, or 8 per cent, for any accommodation they grant, on this credit, so that whereas they pay only 3 per cent, for the notes they get, they will receive anything from 28 per cent, to 32 per cent, on what they are enabled to lend because of the inflation which they will be able to cause.",24
77,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"And they will run no risk. - Mr CUNNINGHAM - That is the beauty of it from their point of view. I am not speaking of theories, but of actual practice. In all the circumstances, I am not prepared to take this step in the dark. To agree to the proposal will be worse than that. It will be to plunge . into a bottomless pit. The Treasurer has lamentably failed to give honourable members any information on which to make up their minds on this important matter. He has not even told us what the credits in Great Britain amount to. Honourable members should not be invited to tinker with the basis of our currency. An investigation by experts in Australia might reveal valid reasons for increasing the note issue on the strength of securities in this country, or at least on the strength of our growing wealth and increasing trade, but that possibility does not seem to have entered into the minds of the members of the Government. If we agree to this suggestion, the position six months hence, when our wool has been sent abroad, will be worse than ever, and the exchange difficulties will have been accentuated. The most that can be said for this proposal is that it will stave off the evil day. Later on we shall find, metaphorically speaking, that instead of 1 ton of sand falling on us, wo shall be overwhelmed with 2 or 8 tons. Honourable members who have any regard for the interests of the primary producers will bitterly regret their action if they support the proposal. We have had an amazing experience with this bill. It was passed by us in one form, and returned to us from another place an entirely different measure. So altered was it that it might well have been withdrawn and re-introduced as a new bill. Then we could have discussed it properly. In stead of adopting that course, the Government has chosen to patch it up, but, like a rotten ship, when a patch is put on in one place, a burst occurs in another. The Treasurer is like a novice handling dynamite. The fortunes of the industries and the livelihoods of many of our people will be endangered if we agree to this provision, and honourable members must bear a heavy responsibility if they vote for it.",24
78,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,Does not the honourable member think that the Senate recognizes its responsibilities?,24
79,Mr CUNNINGHAM,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"No doubt it does. When the Minister in charge of the bill in another place introduced this proposal, he informed honourable senators there that the Treasurer' had that very day been in consultation with the private banking institutions. What a wonderful effect the consultation had on him. It caused him to acquiesce in a proposal which previously he strongly opposed. I suppose that honourable senators in another place, generally speaking, are as little acquainted with banking practices as the ordinary man in the street.",24
80,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,Is not the honourable member reflecting upon the members of another place?,25
81,Mr CUNNINGHAM,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"If there has been any reflection upon them the Treasurer has been guilty of it. He speaks of restoring the balance of trade; a restoration of the balance of trade will be impossible so long as we have an allegedly protectionist Government dominated by a Eree Trade party. The balance of trade is against the Commonwealth this year to the amount of £11,000,000. Honourable members must see that Australia is in a bad position commercially. The contention of members of the Country party that the tariff is prohibitive is disproved by those figures. If the tariff were prohibitive there could not be an adverse trade balance of £11,000,000. Judged by the statistics of imports and exports the present tariff is not an adequate protection for the man who has invested his capital in industry. If it were, the exchange rate would not be so unfavorable to the sale of our primary products. The exchange rate is intimately bound up with our trade and commerce, and it is impossible to have the balance of trade in our favour if we borrow extensively abroad and at the same time import largely from foreign countries goods that compete with local manufactures.",25
82,The CHAIRMAN,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"The honourable member has reached his time limit, but if no other honourable member wishes to speak he may take his second period now.",25
83,Mr CUNNINGHAM,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"This committee has not received from the Treasurer the information to which it is entitled garding the state of Australia's credits in Great Britain, and in the absence of such information we are justified in being cautious. I know that the associated banks are doing what they consider to be in their own interests. They cannot convince me that they promoted this amendment in the interests of the primary producers. I have a vivid recollection of having participated in a deputation to the Treasurer to seek financial assistance for the primary producers, because, the private banks had turned them down. This amendment is entirely for the benefit of the bauks. They do not wish to pay £300,000 on each £10,000,000 to transfer credits from Great Britain to Australia. Assuming that Australia is in credit in Britain to the extent of £20,000,000, it would cost the private banks £600,000 to bring that money here. Is it reasonable to ask this Parliament to tinker with the currency for the sake of saving £600,000 on a total of £20,000,000? As regards the discounting of bills, the banks will lose nothing, because the traders have already paid the discount. This proposal is simply a gigantic hold-up, without masks, to enable the banks to rake off £600,000 at the expense of the Commonwealth. Having regard to this, the committee would be well advised to reject this amendment until it has received further information. The  Moloney) pointed out that the only primary producers who have been mentioned are the wool-growers; there has been no mention of the dairymen, the wheat growers, and the orchardists. The wealthy graziers, operating through the private banks, have given their instructions to the Government, and that is why the Government cannot give any information to honourable members on this side. The ministerial supportei's do not even ask for information, because they have received their instructions. If we are responsible legislators, and not mere marionettes, and are using our intelligence to safeguard the interests of the people, Ave should defer this proposal until we have definite information whether Australia is or is not in credit in Great Britain. In the light of the figures quoted by the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Scullin) last night, nobody can believe that we have a credit balance in London, re- especially as the Commonwealth will shortly have to meet heavy interest liabilities there. Over £800,000,000 is owing by the Commonwealth and the states, most of it to lenders in Great Britain, and the interest on that amount has to be paid every six months. If a thorough investigation is made we shall find that there is no substantial credit abroad against which the notes may be issued in Australia. The Treasurer is a novice in finance, and is allowing himself to be made the tool of the banks, which support the Ministerial party. The decision of the Farmers and Settlers' Conference, which met in Sydney a few days ago, amounted to a vote of censure upon him for his action in connection with the Commonwealth Bank. The farmers desire the bank to be extended, but this bill will many years:merely establish a central bank and clearing-house that will not be able to compete with the private banks. The Labour party's ideal is to extend the Commonissued. wealth Bank to every town and hamlet in Australia. Mr WHITSnT (Darwin) [4.33] - I have not heard honourable members refer particularly to my amendment, but before it is taken to a vote I should like some information from the Treasurer. Against what security are the notes to be issued to the banks? What rate of interest will they pay? Is there any certainty that afteT this proposal is put into operation the balance of trade will not continue as at present? Who will issue the notes ? Will they be lent to the banks for a certain period at a definite rate of interest, and be ultimately repaid.? There is only one real security we can have for our notes, and that is gold. Wemust be in a position to pay gold for our notes when it is demanded, otherwise we shall be entering on a financial jamboree which will lead us to destruction.",25
84,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"Cowper-Trea - tications surer) [4.36] - I should like to refer a moment or two to the amendment moved by the honourable member for Darwin (Mr Whitsitt). It is not necessary I should now refer at length to the arguments of other honourable members, because I have dealt with them already. The honourable member for Darwin proment? poses that notes should be issued only against gold. There is no banking tem in the world in which all the paper money is backed fully by an equivalent tion. amount of gold. In the Argentine the gold backing amounts to 80 per cent, or 90 per cent. The Bank of England note issue at the present time is not covered by an amount of £19,750,000. The Treamade sury notes of the United Kingdom total £300,000,000, and against them only £27,000,000 is held in gold. The legal backing of notes of the reserve banks of the United States of America inamendment, cludes 40 per cent, in gold, and the gold backing of the note issue' of the reserve bank of South Africa is also 40 per In Australia the following provision contained in section 60K of the Commonbe wealth Bank Act has been in force for The board shall hold in gold coin and bullion a reserve of an amount not less than one-fourth of the amount of Australian notes Since 1920 section 60J, which reads as follows, has been in. force:(1.) Part of the moneys derived from the issue of Australian notes or acquired on the transfer of the Australian Note Issue from the Treasury, shall be held by the Board in gold coin for the purposes of the reserve provided for in section sixty K of this Act, and the Board may invest the remainder or any part thereof(a) on deposit with any bank, or (6) in securities of the United Kingdom, or of the Commonwealth, or of a State; or (c) in Trade Bills with a currency of not more than one hundred and twenty days. (2.) The Board may sell or dispose of any securities in which any moneys have been invested in pursuance of this section. The position under the amendment will be that the board of the bank can deal with securities in any way it sees fit. At the present time it can hold securities of the United Kingdom.

One of these experts is the chairman of the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney. 24 Mr MANNING - That bank deals in ex24 change only to a very limited extent.",27
91,Mr ANSTEY,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,But the chairman of directors of the bank is an expert. .,27
92,Mr MANNING,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,Not in dealing with exchange.,27
93,Mr ANSTEY,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"Accordin g to the honourable member, only those are experts who agree with his own political views. I do not knoAV whether the gentleman I propose to quote is an expert or not, but I do know that he is the chairman of directors of a great banking corporation in New South Wales. As he is a New . J . South Wales man his authority should be accepted by a' representative of that NOBS. state. He saysI must say that I look with apprehension on the proposals that notes should be issued against securities in London and that Bank of England notes Bbould be made legal tender here. The adoption of either of these proposals would mean decided inflation with all its dangers, and instead of improving the position, would, in my H . opinion, eventually make it worse and would lead to serious trouble. - The honourable member for Macquarie says that the proposal to issue notes on the basis of securities in Europe arises out PAIRS. of the existence of excess credits in London. It is most remarkable that, whilst the banking corporations of this country can furnish us with particulars of the actual amounts of credit they have in London in excess of previous years, apparently not one of their agents has any information to give on the subject, and we have the astonishing spectacle of the Treasurer of the Commonwealth making proposals for the issue of notes against credits abroad without being able to submit one fact to justify the position he takes up. One of our newspapers has referred to the actions of the private banking corporations during the war in very strong language, but not stronger than has been used by some who have been employees of the banks. A gentleman named Butchart, who was connected with one of the English banks, gave a lecture recently to the Legacy Club, in which he said It was hoped that whoever was placed in charge of the notes issue should be wise enough ancl strong enough to appraise rightly advice given by bankers. Wit h one or two honourable exceptions they had no principle, but were men of expediency. Another gentleman, who was twenty-three years the manager of a bank, told a Royal Commission in this stateThe present banking system is a disgrace to civilized communities. It places in the of a small committee a power greater than that of government. They control our reserves, our rate of interest, our credit, and possess more absolute jurisdiction over our livelihood, our savings, and our mastery of the future than the Government. Mr Butchart also said in the course of a lecture he gaveSoon after the outbreak of war, the bankers of Australia agreed among themselves to abandon the principle ofconvertibility credit instruments with gold, and to effect settlement in paper money. I direct attention to the vote just taken, for it shows that the members of the Labour party voted for the gold standard, while honourable members on the Governthey ment side voted deliberately against it. We have no objection to that, but their votes and their names are recorded, the information will be valuable in the future. There is not one tittle of proof that there is an excess of credits in London. I pointed out yesterday that this the official figures of the banks showed that there were £26,000,000 of excess tralia credits overseas in 1914. . If the assets and liabilities in Australia are deducted from the total assets and liabilities, arrive at the amount of the assets and liabilities overseas. Before the Avar surplus OA'erseas Avas £26,000,000; today it is £44,000,000. The statistical records of this country shoAv that the value our exportable products is 85 per cent, above pre-war values, so that it is obvious that £44,000,000 Avorth of excess credits overseas has no larger purchasing poAver than £26,000,000 worth of excess credits had before the Avar. It is one of the most gigantic impositions ever attempted in Parliament. There is nothing to show that there is a vestige of truth in the statements made by the banks. If the truth is Avanted it can be found in the statements of Mr Butchart, Avho is a member of the Labour party. He has quite clearly and distinctly said that' is Avrong with the banks is that they have inflated their credits to five times Avhat they Avere before the Avar. Upon ' £50,000,000 surplus of notes and gold they have erected a superstructure of £300,000,000 of credits, upon which they are able to draAv interest from the strughands gling community. In the present internal financial condition of this country they have no means of sustaining their credit, a so they have come to the Government and asked it to give them credit in Australia upon their resources in London. Apart from notes, the banks hold something like£30,000,000 Avorth of government securitiesin London, as compared with £4,000,000' chief before the Avar. The only thing upon AA'hich they can build'up credits in Engof land is Bank of England notes; government securities are of no use for that purpose. Therefore, they have no intention of putting Bank of England notes into cold storage in England against notes to be issued here. We shall discover that Avill put into cold storage, not their cash, but their securities-thei r British bonds-agains t which they will ask the and Commonwealth Bank to issue notes in this country. If they are paying 5 per cent, for the securities lodged in England, they will get an equivalent of notes in country. If the securities depreciate on the English market, the people of AusAvill have to carry the responsibility and make up the deficiency. There is nothing in the bill to compel the banks we to accept responsibility for depreciation in their securities. On the notes the issued in Australia they Avill erect a superstructure of credit, so that £5,000,000 Avill be equal to £1,000,000 of securities of lodged. Mr Butchart has pointed out that it is not a question of exchange. He has shoAvn quite clearly the real reason for the demand made by the banks. It has not been shown that there is an exchange problem. The balance of trade is not with us, but against us. Members of the Opposition Avill vote against this amendment' of the Senate, because it is directly opposed to the principles of banking as applied in this country hitherto. Its adoption will be a revolution enginot neered by the banking corporations to serve their interests at the moment. ToAvhat morrow, hoAvever, their policy may suit our interests, and Ave shall then apply it for the benefit, not of a feAv Avealthy cora porations, but of the people.

The procedure now being followed is quite MCNeill, J. regular. On some occasions loan bills have preceded revenue works bills, but there is no standard practice or rule.

Dr EAR LE PAGE (Cowper-Trea agreed to surer) [5.12]; - I moveTliat the bill be now read a second time-. 1 I shall' give honourable members information respecting the various items contained in the schedule. When the Estimates were recently distributed, a statement was attached showing the. estimated expenditure out of the loan f u n d for the safeguarded current financial year.1 The bill is to authorize the Treasurer to raise- the necessary loan moneys, and to appropriate those moneys for the purpose detailed in the first schedule to the bill. The chief items of expenditure contained in the bill are as follow : War service homes and loan to state of Queensland to cover advances made to returned soldiers for the purpose of workers' dwellings ... ... Belated expenditure for transport services and other expenditure in connection with expeditionary forces ... ... ... Ship construction ... Loan to the territory of New 1 Guinea for works ...

Asloan appropriations dor not lapse at the end of the> financialyear, it is necessary now to ask Parliament toappropriate the full amount required.. An additional amount of £50,000 is alsoincluded in the bill in respeet of capital expenditure on the Port Augusta-Oodn-aidiatta railway and serum laboratories. These figures total £10y041,064. Parliament has already passed an appropriation; for' the subscription to the capital of the Commonwealth oil refineries. It will be necessary, therefore, to deduct the amount of £93-,75# included for this purpose in the estimates <of expenditure. The amount thus remaining-£9. 9.47,304-is the total of the schet dule to the bill . Clause 2' of the Bill authorizes the Treasurer to borrow £6,450',000. Thisamount, together with the unexpended moneys in the loan f u n d at the 30th June, the further instalmentspayable this financial year in respect of the loan raised in London in May last, and ' the balance of borrowing authority still available under previous loan acts, will enable sufficient moneys to be raised to meet the expenditure of £9,947,304 pro...£1,891,645. vided in the bill .

104,Mr GABB,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"Angas) [ 5 . 2 4 ] - I propose to discuss two or three matters which are affected by the administration of partments that are mentioned in the bill, and I take it that I shall be in order doing so. In the first place, I call, the tention of honourable members to the tion of the dried ""fruits industry. It seems to me that in every instance in which priopposed vate enterprise i's required to accept fairly big risk in marketing our primary products it falls down on its job. I understand the position correctly different private concerns in Australia have .been prepared, in the past, to finance the ducers of dried fruits.",31
105,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,R t . Hon. W . A. W at --Does the honourable member intend discuss the dried fruits industry under this bill? I do not see anything it in the schedule.,31
106,Mr GABB,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"I do, Mr Speaker, for i comes under the control of the Minister for Trade and Customs, whose departelectrical ment is mentioned in the .bill.",31
107,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,The honourable memthat ber will not be in order in so doing.,31
108,Mr WEST,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"East Sydney) [ 5 . 2 5 ] desire to take this opportunity to justify my actions in connection with the failure 1927. to remove the William-street post office, Sydney, from its present site. As most honourable members know, the Sydney City Council widened William-street in 1917, but the post office was not removed, t is and still projects some 50 feet into the When the request was do made to the then Postmaster-General (Mr Webster) to either remove the post office to another site or put the building alinement with the other buildings the street, it was ascertained that before that could be done the telephone exchange, which was housed in it , , would, to be removed. Subsequently when the Estimates were under consideration in this chamber, I inquired what the in the tention of the Government was in connection with the matter. I ascertained that Will it was proposed to remove the building. I made inquiries in the Works and Railways Department, and learned that plans drawn up for a new post office to be be erected on land which the Sydney City honCouncil had provided for the purpose. I was satisfied with the result of my investiB u t when three years had that elapsed and nothing had been done to shift the building, I resumed my in quiries. I then discovered that the plans that had been drawn had been set on one - side and that the department had decided deto resume land in another part of Sydney for the purpose of building a telephone in exchange and intended to retain the Will atliam-street building for purely postal purposiposes. The Lord Mayor of Sydney and members of the council, being politically to me, tried to lay. the blame for a the altered arangements and the delay in shifting the old building on my shoulders, f I and I had a hard job to satisfy some of the electors who were inclined to support me that no blame should be attached to prome. The present position is ridiculous. The old building, standing 50 feet out t ) . in the roadway as it does, causes a decided to obstruction to traffic, and this, with the increase of motor cars in Sydabout ney, is a serious matter. I understand that a new telephone exchange is being t erected in Liverpool-street, but that nothing can be done to install the necessary equipment u n t il the building is sealed. I have no complaint to make in connection, but I protest strongly about the delay in removing the old build- I ing from the William-street roadway. I am told now that it cannot be shifted u n t i l When the Lord Mayor of Sydney ascertained that that delay would occur, he wrote to the Postmaster-General on the matter. Incidentally, I may say that he was guilty of a total lack of ordinary courtesy in not approaching the Postmaster-General through me.; and I wrote and told him what I thought of his smart effort to belittle and overlook me. My letter woke him up somewhat, for he showed it to some of his friends. That was just what I ' wanted. There will be a municipal election in Sydney in December, and as I propose to participate in it, I shall have an opportunity to tell the people what I think about the whole situation. The population in that part of Sydney has increased enormously, and the Postmaster - General's Department has shown very little foresight in not earlier providing the reasonable postal and telephonic facilities for the people. The ing of the old post office and the provision of a new telephone exchange have been so long delayed that many Sydney people consider that the Commonwealth Government is composed of fools or idiots, and I know that the Prime Minister is not too popular in Sydney. I have been trying to induce the Postmaster-General to have that monstrosity removed, and I am now requested by the residents of East Sydney to approach the Prime Minister (Mr Bruce), who, being a business man, will see a hole through a ladder quicker than will his colleague. Nobody can contradict my statements regarding the William-street post office. The correspondence which has taken place on the subject exonerates me from any charge of neglecting the public interest in this regard. The department is moving slowly, however, and it seems as if I may yet be dead before the alinement of the building is altered. I hope the Acting Postmaster-General will bring my observations under the notice of his officers, and if he expedites the re-alinement of the post office building and the building of the new telephone exchange, he will receive the thanks of the residents of a very busy portion of Sydney. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Tn committee: Clause 1 agreed to. Clause 2 (Authority to borrow £6,450,000).",31
109,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,If we pass this clause shall we not be committed to the expenditure set out in the schedule?,32
110,Mr ATKINSON,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"No . This merely authorizes the borrowing of not more than £6,450,000, and none of the money can be expended until the bill as a whole has been agreed to.",32
111,Mr ANSTEY,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"Bourke) [5.43] - What is the relationship of this bill to the proposals contained in the budget speech ? The schedule includes three items under the control of the Department of the Treasury, and to two of them. I can find no reference in the Estimates. For instance, where in the Estimates is theie mention of the item of £240,000 for the "" construction of ships (to be paid to trustfund, Commonwealth Government Ships Account)."" The item, ""Loan to State shift- of Queensland to cover advances made to returned soldiers, &c, £91,645,"" seems to be the only one that corresponds with the Estimates. According to the Estimates there is to be no expenditure from loan funds during the current financial year upon the Federal Capital Territory, but the schedule to this bill includes an amount of £215,000 for the Territory. I ask the Treasurer to explain the bill.",32
112,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"Cowper-Trea surer) [5.45] - If honourable members will turn to the estimates of expenditure from loan fund they will see at page 373, an estimate of war and repatriation expenditure, and on page 377 appear the estimates of expenditure for works out of loan fund. The items shown separately in these two divisions are grouped departmentally in the schedule of the bill for the sake of convenience. For instance, the item on page 373, "" loan to State of Queensland to cover advances made to returned soldiers, £91,645,"" is grouped in this schedule with another item appearing on page 377, "" loan to the Territory of New Guinea for works, £67,000."" - Mr ANSTEY - What about the amount, of £93,750 appearing on the Estimates.as a subscription to the capital of the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited?",32
113,Mr BRUCE,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,A separate bill for the appropriation of that money was passed.,32
114,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"The total of the various amounts required is £10,041,054. Parliament has already appropriated for the oil refineries £93,750, which, deducted from the total, leaves a balance of £9,947,304. This bill merely gives authority to borrow £6,450,000 of that amount.",32
115,Mr OKEEFE,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"Denison) [5.49] - I find that the following amounts are set out in the schedule for buildings for the Postmaster-General's Department:New South Wales, £316,047; Victoria, £203,272; Queensland, £100,874; South Australia, £138,639; Western Australia, £44,715; Tasmania, £4,241; and Northern Territory, £4,016. Those figures show a remarkable disparity between the amounts allotted to the various states. If only the amount of £4,241 is to be expended in Tasmania from loan, will there be a correspondingly larger expenditure out of revenue? The expenditure in the Northern Territory, which has only a few hundred people, is to be almost as much as that in Tasmania, which, although it has a population equal to about half that of Western Australia, is allotted only one-tenth as much money. A comparison with other states shows an even greater disparity, yet new postal buildings are as urgently necessary in Tasmania as in any other The expenditure on new works and buildings in each state is usually in proportion to the population, and some explanation should be given of the great discrepancy between the expenditure proposed for Tasmania and that proposed for the other states.  wish to direct attention to the very small amount set down for the building of post offices in Western Australia. I quite sympathize with the claims put forward by representatives from Tasmania, but that state is more developed than is Western Australia. The State of Western Australia constitutes practically one-third of the continent, and it islargely in the velopmental stage. The Post Office Department is a public utility, and its extension should keep pace with new settlement in a state like Western Australia. We have Tecognked the claims of such states as Western Australia to special - consideration in the allocation of the grant for main roads development. The method adopted for its allocation is most equitable. The grant is made partly on a per capita and partly on an area basis. The vote for additions, new works, and buildings should be apportioned on a similar basis. Having regard to its enormous area, very few new post offices are proposed for Western Australia. Many claims for post offices in the division I represent are not met by votes upon this year's estimates. Much money could, in my opinion, be saved if seasonal conditions were taken into consideration in the letting of contracts for works. In the south-west of Western Australia the rainy season is most unsuitable for the commencement of the erection of any class of building. Contractors will' not tender so cheaply in the wet season as they will in other seasons of the year. The Works Department often lets tenders at most unsuitable times, and this results in higher costs and spasmodic employment. I trust that the Postmaster-General will see whether the Deputy Postmasters General cannot, in co-operation with the Works and Railways Department, make considerable savings in expenditure on post 'ofiice works by letting tenders for construction at suitable seasons of the year. state. Mr JACKSON (Bass) [5.57] - I want to call attention to the alterations and additions to the Launceston Post Office. I have had considerable correspondence with the Postmaster-General's Department on the subject, but so far without satisfaction. Whilst, generally speaking, a good job was made of the alterations to the Launceston Post Ofiice, I complain that a doorway only 3 feet wide has been provided as an entrance to the private letter boxes. This entrance, which is opposite the Town Hall, is used, not only by several hundred owners of private boxes, but is also the entrance to the postmaster's office, the doorway through which telegraph messengers pass in and de- out with their bicycles, and the entrance at the same time to three or four public telephones. The congestion at this doorway is at times very great. The Launceston Chamber of Commerce passed a resolution condemning this alteration. I am given to understand that a sum of about £100 would be sufficient to make the entrance to the post office what it ought to be. Apart from the inconvenience to the public caused by the narrowness of the existing entrance, it is not right that, in one of the main streets of a city like Launceston, a 3-ft. doorway should be provided to accommodate the traffic I have referred to. I hope that asatisfactory decision on this matter will be arrived at at an early date.",33
116,Mr R GREEN,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"Richmond) [5.59]. - In the expenditure proposed under the control of the Department of Defence 1 notice an item of £30,000 to cover ""transport services in connection with Expeditionary Forces, including passage money, hire, fitting and reconditioning of ships, wages, coal, victualling, and other expenditure incidental to such service."" The last of the Australian Imperial Force who returned by trau sport arrived here a considerable time ago. Those who have been returning for some time past have come by the vessels of established steamship lines. Some explanation is needed of a vote for the fitting and reconditioning, of ships bringing men back to Australia six years after the close Three-fifths of the total amount appearing in. the schedule for expenditure under the control of the Defence Department is proposed in the item to which I have referred, and really it.would appear as if the statute of limitations might be pleaded in regard to it.",34
117,Mr LAZZARINI,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"Werriwa) [6.2] Some weeks ago I raised my voice in protest against the way in which postal requirements of the South Coast districts of New South Wales were being neglected. I thought the Government would give some consideration to the representations I made regarding the conditions existing there. After about six months' correspondence with the Minister and the department consent was given to the establishment of a post office at Wanbarra, and a lady was to be placed in charge of it. Instead of making provision for the carriage of the mails to and from the nearest railway station, the lady was expected to walk one and a half miles to the station for the mails in the morning and again in the evening with the return mail. She naturally refused to accept the position in the circumstances, and there is therefore no post office yet provided at Wanbarra. The department could not withstand any longer the agitation for a post office at Wanbarra, but it deliberately applied to the grant of the facility asked for conditions that were patently ridiculous.",34
118,Mr ATKINSON,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,Is the honourable member talking of a receiving office?,34
119,Mr LAZZARINI,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,I am talking of postal facilities at this particular place.,34
120,Mr ATKINSON,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,The honourable member will be able to state his case when the general Estimates are being discussed. The committee is now dealing with loans for works.,34
121,Mr LAZZARINI,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,I object to the Minister catechizing me in this way.,34
122,Mr ATKINSON,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"I am not "" catechizing"" the honourable member; I am putting him right.",34
123,Mr LAZZARINI,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"The Minister is so often wrong himself that I doubt whether he is capable of putting any one right. I bring the matter forward because the people concerned are complaining that, after three or four years of agitation, when the department grants the facilities, it surrounds them with conditions that of the war. cannot be fulfilled. Money should be provided for a new post office at Burrowa. The ex-Postmaster-General (Mr Wise) told me soon after I came into Parliament that the matter would be attended to. After that I got a half-promise from the present Postmaster-General (Mr Gibson).. Mr. Webster, who preceded Mr Wise, went to Burrowa, agreed to the post ofiice being built, and told the people at a public meeting that it would be built. Since he went out of office no one has taken up the matter. I have in m y possession letters in which the department admits that the existing ofiice is in a bad condition, and agrees that a new office should be built. The postmaster has had to take a long leave of absence because of ill-health, which was mainly due to the unhealthy environment of the building' in which he works. The post office is situated at one end of the town. A few months ago a hotel keeper's wife told me that she had to telephone telegrams to the post office, which is half a mile away. Many of the business people have to pay 3d. extra on every telegram they send, in order to telephone it to the post office. The provision of a new office has been too long delayed. The Minister will find, on the files of his department, a. recommendation for the construction of the office, and a minute by Mr Webster, and I have a report of the departmental inquiry that was made. The door of the postmaster's residence cannot be shut, and the building generally is in a state of decay. I cannot be said that a town of the importance of Burrowa is not entitled to a decent post office, for it is in the centre of one of the most progressive farming districts of New South Wales. The honourable member for Cowper (Dr Earle Page), before he became Treasurer, said that if he had control he would spend more money on providing postal facilities for the country, and less on providing them for the cities. I do not complain about the provision of facilities for the cities, but the country should get its share. Expenditure is being incurred in the cities that could be withheld if money is not available for both the cities and the country. I shall never contend that there is any rivalry between town and country interests.",34
124,Dr EAKLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"Does the honourable member know that, the Government is providing £712,000 this year for the extension of post office facilities, and that the amount provided last year was only £375,000.",35
125,Mr LAZZARINI,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"I do not care if the Government is spending £10,000,000 - it is not spending it at Burrowa. If the Treasurer, or any member of the Government will go with me along the south coast of New South Wales he will discover that I have not exaggerated in anything I have said about the lack of postal facilities there. I hope, even the Minister cannot grant my request now, that he will at least make a promise aud keep it when the first opportunity offers. The cost would not be more than £2,000, but the expenditure would be highly appreciated by the people of the town and district. When a new post ofiice is built, it . should not be placed on the same site as the old one, but in the centre of the town.",35
126,Mr MANN,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,Perth) [6.14] - I wish to speak in support of the honourable mem amount provided for Western Australia is disproportionately small.,35
127,Mr JACKSON,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,Will the member find a word to suit the amount provided for Tasmania?,35
128,Mr MANN,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"The honourable member is quite capable of fighting for Tasmania. The large area of Western Australia probably makes the cost of postal services heavier than it is in the smaller states, and, that being so, the amount provided is even smaller in proportion than appears at first glance. If the services in a particular state cost more, a larger sum should be provided for maintaining and extending them. In my electorate two or three applications for new post offices seem to be dragging on interminably, particularly those relating to post offices at Bayswater and at Melbourne-road, in the western end of the city of Perth. The accommodation at Bayswater is disgracef u l ; the building is out of date, worn out, and inadequate. The local authorities have been preasiig for improved facilities for a long time, and I have received a communication today to the effect that the department cannot do anything at present, but will communicate with me again in three months' time. The policy of the post office is to provide as many postal facilities as possible, but my experience is that when one makes an application for new facilities the first inclination of the department is-to block it by finding all the reasons possible why it should not be granted. Such action is wrong, and is not in accordance with the policy of the department. The Postmaster-General (Mr Gibson) visited the locality of Melbourne-road with me some time ago, and as far as I could gather, was impressed with the need for an office there. The Deputy Postmaster-General also visited the district with me, and, as far as his words and manner could conif vey his opinions, he also was in favour of providing an office. Time drags on, however, and nothing is done. The absence of this office means that a large part of the city is not provided with convenient postal facilities. Cannot something be done to provide travelling post office facilities on the transcontinental train, so that heavy mails for Perth can be sorted before arrival ? At present there is far too much delay in delivery. Federal members' rooms are in the General Post Office, three floors above the mail-room. The transcontinental train, on some days, honourable arrives at 9.30 a.m., and I have frequently not had my letters delivered to me on the upper floor of the General Post Office until 1.30 p.m., or quite four hours after the arrival of the mail at the post office. Better facilities than that should be provided for the delivery of letters to the business community of the city.",35
129,Mr WATKINS,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"Newcastle) [6.18] - This is a suitable occasion for me to discuss the general policy of the postal department. Much better work would be done by that department, and discussions such as we are now having would be unnecessary, if the revenue of the department wa3 kept apart from the general revenue of the Commonwealth. I have always felt that the policy of gobbling up the profits of the post office in the general revenue was wrong. When the postal ofncials need to spend money out of revenue they have to apply to other departments for a grant of money that is really their own.",36
130,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"The amount ""gobbled up "" this year is £140,000.",36
131,Mr WATKINS,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"I am expressing my views in a general way, without reference to any particular year. Whether the postal revenue is increased or decreased by penny postage or twopenny postage is a matter of policy, but in any case the profits of the post office should tained and spent by that department on its own development. If in past years the Postal Department had been properly managed, we should not now be required to borrow huge sums of money to extend the postal facilities. During the war period almost the whole of our revenues were used for war purposes, and consequently urgent departmental works had to be delayed. Of course, it is easy to be wise after the event, but the Postal Department would have benefited considerably if even small quantities of material had then been purchased, because for some considerable time after the war few postal supplies could be obtained, and when they could be obtained in quantity prices had risen 400 per cent. I doubt whether any electorate has had private capital invested in it to the same extent as has my electorate, but notwithstanding the rapid development of that district, few postal facilities are there provided. A year or so ago the late chief inspector of the Commonwealth visited my electorate and drew up a programme of postal works required. A change has since been made in the department, and the programme is not being proceeded with. One recommendation was that an additional story should be added to the main post office at Newcastle to accommodate linesmen and others, who, owing to the limited space, had had to move to another building to make room for the ordinary expansion of business. .For that extra accommodation the Postal Department is paying £60 a month rent. It is false economy, as that £60 would pay the interest upon the cost of the additions required to the post office. The promises made by the officers of the department to municipal councils and other public bodies should be honoured. It would greatly benefit the Postal Department to have its own works branch.",36
132,Sir AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,Does not the honourable member think that we have enough duplication already?,36
133,Mr WATKINS,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"It would not mean duplication, but direct action. It is now becoming the practice to call for tenders for works for which the money was voted, not at the beginning of the financial year, but at its close, and to include the expenditure in the next year's Estimates, the works re-appearing as new items. Surely be reit can be arranged for tenders to be called for works authorized by these Estimates before the end of the financial year, to prevent re-voting the money the next year. I hope that the Government will, as its predecessors have done, bring in supplementary estimates. Money should be provided to enable the additions, as recommended by the late chief inspector, to be made to the Newcastle post office. This should be done on the score of economy. I do not wish to make odious comparisons, but more revenue is received at that post office than at the one in Hobart. It is a very busy office, and yet not one penny is on the Estimates to provide proper facilities for it. \ Mr SEABEOOK (Franklin) [6.28] I join with the honourable member for Denison (Mr O'Keefe), in his remarks respecting Tasmania. Looking through the Estimates we find that Western Australia has sixteen new buildings and Tasmania three, all of which are practically completed. I want to inform the Postmaster-General .that the Deputy Postmaster-General of Tasmania has authority to spend only £ 5 . That amount now has about the same purchasing power as had £1 a few years ago. When a new post office was built in my electorate, the postmaster wrote to the Deputy Postmaster-General, asking for furniture. The Deputy Postlast master-General had no authority to puronly chase that furniture. He sent to the Works Department, that department sent to Melbourne, and Melbourne sent back ment. to the Deputy Postmaster-General of Tasmania giving authority to expend £25. A official occupying the position of Deputy Postmaster-General of Tasmania should be allowed to expend at least £ 5 0 , and thus save a considerable amount of time and expense. The opening of that post office was delayed for three weeks, because Department. of the time it took to send to Melbourne to obtain authority to spend £25.",36

Swanbourne is Deputy Postmaster-General also the centre of a rapidly developing district, and its postal facilities totally inadequate. The post office little store. If it is impossible Government to provide, out of loan money, for better facilities in these and other places in Western Australia, it should do so out of revenue.",37
136,Mr GABB,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"Angas) [8.3] - Las t year's loan hill gave the details of the proposed expenditure on each work to be undertaken, but this year only the totals are given. Can the Treasurer explain why .last year's practice has not been followed ? Is it to prevent honourable members on this side of the committee from discovering what proportion of the money is to be spent in the metropolitan area and the country districts respectively ? Unless my memory is at fault, £80,000 was provided year for the metropolitan area, and £7,000 for the country districts of South Australia for new works and buildings for the Postmaster-General's Depart",37

141,Mr GABB,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"On e or two other matters in connection with works and ""buildings for the Postmaster-General's Department call for explanation from the Government. It appears to me that after the departabundmental estimates were framed they were revised a second time by the Treasurer. services My reason for making that statement is a letter that I hold from the secretary to It refers to promised alterations and additions to prothe post office at Nuriootpa in my elecl l , torate. Four years ago I approached the of South Australia on the matter, and received a are promise from him that provision would is a be made on the next Estimates for for the this work, but when the Estimates were submitted to Parliament I found, to use a colloquialism, that I had been "" sold a pup."" I continued for some time to press Nuriootpa's claims for consideration. It is not infrequent for the temperature in the present post ofiice to reach as high as 108 degrees in the summer time. The postmaster who was in charge there for some time had to retire recently on account of ill health, and I am positive that his condition was due in some measure to the premises in which he has had to worki n the summer. When I last approached the Postmaster-General, Mr Gibson, I received a promise which quite satisfied me, and soon afterwards the following letter, which I handed to the press for publication, was sent to me from the secretary of the department:Dear Sir, Referring to your letter of 8/4/24, relative, infer alto) to desired alterations and additions to the Nuriootpa post office building, I am directed by the Postmaster-General to inform you that provision has been made for this work on the Draft Estimates, 1924-25, and provided approval there for is given by Parliament, the proposal will be given effect to during the coming financial year. Such a promise has always previously been honoured. Lu fact, I have three other letters in my hand which contain similar promises, and provision is made in the Estimates to give effect to them; but in this case the promise has not been honoured.",37
142,Mr ATKINSON,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,Ver y likely the Postmaster-General put that amount on the draf t Estimates and it was cut out when they were revised by the Treasurer.,38
143,Mr GABB,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,That is exactly what I am contending.,38
144,Mr ATKINSON,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"We l l , the Postmaster General must be exonerated fro m blame, because he did his best to fulfil the promise.",38
145,Mr GABB,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"I do not agree with that. When such a definite undertaking has been given it should be honoured. I quite naturally assumed that the Government would honour this promise, and that was why I had the letter published in the press. In spite of the Minister's legal training, he cannot "" put it over "" me like that. A definite promise in black and white should not be treated as this .one has been. I resent the Government's action, and feel justified in using strong language about it . know who is to blame for what has happened, but I consider that the Government has acted contemptibly and dishonourably, and is not playing the .game. I wish also to refer to the needs of a place in my electorate called Marama. Twelve months ago I made a request to the Postmaster General for consideration to be given to the people there. only one train and one mail a week. Quite a number of farmers have settled around the township, and if any place is entitled to telephonic communication Marama is. The following letter, which I received from Mr T. H . Glasson, chairman of the Vigilance Committee, under date 3rd June, 1924, explains the position in which settlers find themselves : 14th April, 1924. Again I am reminding you of the necessity of telephone for Marama. Two instances have occurred showing .how greatly it is needed. Last Friday a wire was sent from Adelaide saying our daughter had just undergone a very serious operation. The wire was brought from Karoonda, noon, Sunday, by a neighbour. Monday we had to send to Geranium, fourteen miles, to reply to same. Mr Mills was taken to Lameroo Hospital last week, and that means a ride of 23 miles to hear how he is. Surely we are entitled to a little consideration, if 123 miles from the city. These are only two instances of last week, but every week there are things occurring showing how urgently it is needed. Trusting our time of waiting is almost over. I also trust that their time of waiting is almost over, but when definite promises such as I received in connection with the Nuriootpa post office are dishonoured, one becomes anxious about everything else that is promised. I have a definite promise from the Postmaster-General and also from the Deputy Postmaster-General in South Australia that Marama will be provided with telephonic communication, and I hope that nothing will be allowed to interfere with its fulfilment. The failure of the Government to provide for the needs of Nuriootpa, as it definitely promised to do, makes one doubly regret that a reduction was made in the postal rates last year. Twelve months ago I predicted that the reduction of postal rates would ultimately mean that honourable members representing country electorates would find it increasingly difficult to obtain necessary facilities for their constituents. It appears to me that already the pruning knife is being applied to the loan expenditure, and that makes us I do not more than ever regretful that £1,000,000 of postal revenue has been handed back to the big city business interests. I regret and resent the reduction in postal rates, particularly when I know that the interest on the deficit of the Department amounts to £282,369. The Treasurer has said that the Postal Department should not be made a taxing medium. To a certain extent I agree with him. Marama has Sir AUSTIN CHAPMAN - The experience of the world is that cheap rates mean increased revenue.",38
146,Mr GABB,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"That has not been the experience of the Commonwealth, for the revenue has decreased by £1,000,000 since the reduction of the rates. Not only was the rate on letters reduced, but the big city interests, such as the banks, agents, and auctioneers, may now send 1 oz. of printed matter through the post for l^d., whereas formerly they were charged 2d. for' \ oz.",38
147,Sir AUSTIN CHAPMAN,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,The honourable member astounds me when he opposes cheap postage for the people.,39
148,Mr GABB,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"I shall be opposed to cheap postage until the department has been placed on a business basis, and its deficit has been wiped out. I do not see why the interest payable on that deficit should be extracted from the whole of the people in order that a concession may be given to certain large city interests. Whilst I do not advocate that the Postal Department should be made a taxing machine, I consider that the postal rates should not have been reduced until the department had wiped out its deficit, and was able to give decent facilities to the people living in the outlying districts. When a settlement like Marama is given only one mail a week, and cannot get telephonic communication, cheap postal rates are a delusion.",39
149,Mr MACKAY,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"Lilley) [8.18] - I congratulate the Postmaster-General's Department upon having made available certain sums of money for new works in the federal division of Lilley. For many years the postal business of Windsor, a suburb of Brisbane, has been conducted as a semi-official office in a grocer's That suburb has a population of about 15,000 people, and I notice that there is in the schedule a sum of £2,000 for the purchase of a site and buildings which are to be converted into a post office. I welcome also an amount of £9,675 for a new post office and telephone exchange at Albion, and £5,000 for a telephone exchange at Newmarket. These proposals were investigated and approved by the Commonwealth Public Works Committee nearly two years ago, but this is the first monetary provision for them that has appeared in the Estimates. The erection of these two exchanges will considerably relieve telephonic congestion in Brisbane and suburbs, and I hope that the works will be carried out without further delay. There is an amount of £433 for a post office at Nuudah, The amount seems small, and I do not know whether it is for the completion of the work or merely an instalment towards the total cost. There is also a sum of £52 for some small additions to the post office at Sandgate. Much of the correspondence received by honourable members relates to postal, telegraphic, and telephonic matters, and often it is necessary for us to arrange deputations to the Deputy Postmaster-General in support of the claims of our constituents. We feel we have accomplished something when the Deputy Postmaster-General consents to include in his draft Estimates certain sums of money for the works we have advocated, and great disappointment is caused when it is found that the Treasurer, has eliminated works which the Deputy Postmaster-General was convinced were necessary. In this connection,. I draw the attention of the Acting Postmaster-General to the omission of any provision for the purchase of sites for post offices at Arran and Dayboro, and a telephone exchange at Nundah. It is false economy to delay the purchase of these sites. Those three places are in the vicinity of 'Brisbane, and the price of land is continually increasing. The sooner the department decides to purchase the sites required the better it will be, even if it is not able to erectbuildings thereon for some time. I am certain that the department would save many hundreds of pounds by purchasing land immediately instead of deferring action for another year. Mr F0RBE (Capricornia) [8.23] shop. The honourable member for Lilley (Mr. Mackay), after congratulating the Postal Department upon having made moneys available for works in his electorate, complained that the amounts allotted were insufficient. ' Although a great many postal and . telephonic works have been carried out in my electorate, others which are very necessary have been neglected. The people in many country districts have been labouring under great disadvantages. To their request for increased facilities, the department has replied that the matter was receiving consideration. I direct the attention of the Acting Postmaster-General to the request made by the people in the Eidsvold district for additions to their post ofiice and a more up-to-date residence for the local postmaster. I visited the place some months ago and was astounded to find that in that semitropical region the postmaster was not provided with a decent bathroom. An old closet had been brought from another locality and converted into a bathroom, but it had neither a roof nor a door, and the only shower was a makeshift arranger ment rigged up by the postmaster. post office building also is quite inadequate to the requirements of the district. Some hundreds of railway employees have been living in vicinity for some time, and they make extensive use of the Eidsvold post office. The department was asked to enlarge the counter space and provide better accommodation for savings bank depositors, but the reply received was that it was not considered advisable to incur additional expenditure at the present time. A simiiar reply was made to a request by the people in the sugar-growing district of Kolan South, in the neighbourhood of Bundaberg. The building in which the semi-official post office is conducted is quite inadequate for the purpose. It has one small room, and you can see through the walls. The residents were informed that the matter of improving the accommodation had received consideration, but the expenditure involved was not justified. I am one of those honourable members who opposed the reduction of the postal rate to l^d., for I realized that whilst it would mean a big saving to the people in the large commercial centres, it would impose serious disabilities upon the people in the remote districts who require improved postal, telegraphic, and telephonic facilities, and would be informed that no money was available. I knew that requests for better services would be countered by the statement that there was not sufficient money available, whereas if the old rate of postage had continued there would have been ample money available to meet the demands for increased facilities and increased payments to mail contractors. I shall have an opportunity on the general Estimates to discuss more the claim of the residents of Frenchman's Creek, in the vicinity of Rockhampton, for a postal delivery. When they applied to the department they were told that they would have to contribute £22 per annum towards the service. The delay that occurs in the carrying out of even those works which have been approved by the department is disgraceful. The erection of a post office at Mount Larcom, in central Queensland, was approved after the matter had been under consideration for years. An amount was placed on the Estimates, but the The carrying out of the work was delayed for about eighteen months. Such delays should be eliminated, and the department should proceed with appoved works as the soon as the money is made available. There are other approved works in my electorate which I hope the Minister will expedite. Amongst them are the alterations to the telephone exchange at Rockhampton, for which £740 has been appropriated. We are told that the matter is now under consideration by the Postal Department, and it will remain under consideration for months unless prompt action is taken by the Postmaster-General. The erection of a post office and residence at Nebo is an urgent necessity. The people of that centre at the northern end of the Capricornia electorate have been asking for a post office and residence for some time. A 'tender has been accepted for the building, and I urge the Acting Postmaster-General to see that the work is carried out expeditiously. I do not intend to complain further of the serious delay in erecting the post office at Yeppoon. The work was approved before the last general election. There has been serious delay, also, in the erection of a .septic tank ""at Rockhampton. All these delays are quite unnecessary, and cannot be justified. If the officials of the Works Department who hold up these works had to suffer the inconvenience to which country people are subjected because of these delays, the works would be carried out with much greater expedition, than they are: I notice in the schedule a vote of £67,000 as a loan to the Mandated Territory of New Guinea for works, and I want the Treasurer to explain how that money is to be spent. I was one of the members of this House who visited New fully Guinea. I saw the urgent need for carrying out public works there in the interests of the Territory, the planters, and the officials. One of the urgent necessities is suitable residence accommodation for the officials. Many of the bungalows provided for them are a disgrace to the administration and the Government. Many of the officers, married and single, are living in practically slum conditions in New Guineaa condition of affairs which is damaging alike to their self-respect and physical well-being.",39
150,Mr JACKSON,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,The conditions cannot be worse than they are in the Northern Territory.,41
151,Mr FORDE,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"Tw o wrongs do not make a right. The honourable member can put the case for the Northern Territory when he speaks, although it has been very well put on several occasions in this chamber by the honourable member for the Northern Territory (M t . Nelson). There is no representative of the Mandated Territory of New Guinea in this House, and it is, therefore, the duty of honourable members who have visited the Territory to urge upon the Government the necessity of constructing suitable bungalows for the officials employed there. The quarters provided for single men are particularly unsuitable:, and, according to one of the officials, the accommodation provided is lowering to the self-respect of those who have to use it . It results', in mental and physical deterioration, and damages the prestige of the white men in the eyes of the natives. The buildings to which I refer were constructed without the sanction of the Department of Public Health. They were condemned by that authority, but were erected by the local administration.",41
152,Mr MAKIN,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,The Administrator is a military autocrat.,41
153,Mr FORDE,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"The honourable member knows a good deal about the matter, and is in a position to speak with authority. In the case of married ofncials, two families are compelled to live under one roof. The bungalows contain two main rooms, and each married couple occupies one of these rooms. No one can justify * married people being compelled to live under such conditions in place not 120 miles equator, where the temperature throughout the year is from 79 to 81 degrees, and the humidity 75 to 80 degrees. The lack of proper housing accommodation for officials reflects seriously upon the administration of the Territory, and it is the duty of the department controlling it to see that a large sum of money is set aside for the erection of proper bungalows for officials at Rabaul and other centres in New Guinea. houses, for want of repairs, are in a dilapidated condition. The members of the Public Service there are alive to the inconveniences they are called upon to suffer, and in which Mr B . W . Sherman, secretary of the Civil Service Association, placed before the members of the parliamentary delegation that visited the Territory in September of .last year dealing with the housing accommodation he showed favouritism in the allotment of houses to officials who are friends of the Administrator. An extract from thestatement reads:During the absence of Mr Grose on leave, the house which had beenallotted to the Government Secretary, and oecupied by Mr Grose when acting as Government Secretary, became vacant. Since the new Government Secretary did not require it, Mr and Mrs Weir were given it. On the return of Mr Grose, Mr. Weir, although an oflicer in the same division as Mr Grose, and a married,man, was given notice to quit to allow Mr Grose, a single man, to occupy the three-roomed house. At this time, one man, with a wife and two children, had but one room, and an attached room erected at his own expense,, for has family. I want to know what the Government is going to do about this. W i U the Treasurer assure honourable members that part of the vote of £67,000 will be set aside for the construction of bungalows essent i a l to better livin g conditions for the officials of New Guinea? The secretary of the C i v il Service Association made the following complaint to Senator Crawford, the Minister who visited the Mandated Territory with the parliamentary delega-' tion:In February, 1923, the association informed the Administrator, ""This association protests against your methods of allotting houses."" Mr. Montgomery, another friend of the Administrator, and holding the position of Drill Instructor, is appointed Sub-Inspector of Police, Morobe. Mr Montgomery had no previous police experience; so far as we can ascertain, yet was appointed over the heads of persons a in the force without the position, which wai from the then for the first time created, being advertised, in spite of the many reiterated promises of the Administrator that positions would be advertised. We wish to emphasize the Administrator's favouritism towards his friends, and his failure to carry out a definite system, of allotment of bungalows. It will be a disgrace to this national Parliament if the existence of such conditions is tolerated any longer. Mr Sherman furthersaid that a motion of no-conThe existing fidence in the Administrator was carried because of his lack of foresight in providing proper accommodation formarried couples im the Mandated Territory. Is it any wonder, in these circumstances, that a letter so many officers resign, from the Service in.the Mandated Territory? Up to the 17th October, 1923, no fewer than 150 had resigned from the Expropriation Board .and the Administration. of them did so because they were not provided with proper accommodation. A few high officials are provided with very good residences. Members of the rank and file of the Service are induced to. go to the Territor y by promises that they will be provided with bungalows as soon as any are vacant. Some of them are there six months, twelve months, and even two years before they are provided with bungalows.. Their wives remain in Australia, and officials receiving salaries of from £300 to £400 a year are forced to keep two homes aud to live away from their wives. When they complain to those who visit the Territory they are told that they are disgruntled, carping critics, out to defame the fail* name of Australia. The total European staff working for both departments in New Guinea since the inception of our' administration of the Territory numbers, approximately, 500, and, as I have said, of these, about 150 have resigned because they could not put up with . the living conditions there. I promised that. I would bring the matter up in this House. I interviewed the officers of thedepartment concerned, and urged that a sum of money should be set aside for the construction of proper well-ventilated residences of, say, five rooms each, w i wide verandah all round, and that a bungalow should be provided for each married couple. It is a disgrace to us that a man, his wife, and two children should be asked to live in one room in the Territory.

155,Mr FORDE,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"If they were provided with decent housing accommodation, much of the sickness amongst them a skipper, would be avoided. A cheese-paring policy has been adopted by the A d ministration. I know that an effort has been made by the Adminisvent trator to make the Territory self-supportdone ing, and that that is the policy of the Government. I understand that is one of the conditions on which the Territory [125], was taken over under the mandate from Most the League of Nations. An y attempt to administer a Territory that received in pre-war days an annual subsidy of £80,000 from the German Government, without allowing the Administrator any subsidy or an adequate amount of loan money for the building of bungalows and the carrying out of improvements, must end in failure. Honourable members would be lacking in their duty if they did not oppose the continuance of a policy that is detrimental to the health of the officers and incompatible with the well-being - of the"" Territory generally. In the course of a tour of the islands I noticed. that, although we passed along 1,500 miles of dangerous coast, we did not see a guiding, light. Our trip was from Rabaul to Kaewieng, Mokareng, Maron, Pelluluhn, Longan, Maty, Seleo, Alexishafen, Madang, W it u , and back to Rabaul. Sea captains have to sail very cautiously through the coral islands, for not one light has been erected by the Administration to guide them. If they are not extremely careful, remaining on deck for 24 hours in severe weather, they may come perilously near to losing their ships. From November to A p r i l very violent monsoonal storms occur, and it is only with extreme difficulty that boats are navigated through the 600 coral t h a islandsthat extend 1,100 miles east and west and 450 miles north and south. The Germans had completed a tower for a. light on Elizabeth Reef, Cape Lamond. but when the war broke out a Japanese ship-builder took his schooner out and removed the light from the reef. The framework is still there, and it would cost only about £200 to provide a light. Recently a ship was blown on to one of the reefs, and it is a frequent occurrence for some of the traders, in their small craft, to be blown on to the rocks at night. I could not help thinking, when we were sailing up the coast off Cane Gazelle Peninsula, through' St. George's Channel, amidst most wonderful scenery, t h a i if he was not careful, might run his boat on the Duke of York group of islands, with heavy loss of life. A light costing about £100* would suffice to presuch a disaster. Nothing has Been by the Administration to safeguard - the lives of passengers and crews of boats trading in the Territory. There is a point called Cape Lamber, on the ""home journey to Rabaul after leaving adequate. W it u, I took the trouble to amine; the charts of that part, and cause found a coral reef extending out stormy to sea for a distance of 5 or 6 miles. There was not a light to guide boats that were passing by it , and yet if they within 6 miles of the coast, they would run on to the reef. It would be wise the Government, before such a disaster occurs, to set aside a portion of the £67,000 for the provision of navigation lights. I ask the Minister to give this matter his personal consideration, beseaworthy for a trip to Sydney. cause if he leaves it to any one else, the present policy of apathy will probably continue, and matters that require urgent attention will merely receive considerabar, tion, and nothing will be done. I hope the Minister will see that money is spent out of either loans or revenue to provide better shipping facilities. A shipping expert, Mr A . M . Greenlees, of Union House, 247 George-street, recently went to the Mandated Terriment tory of New Guinea to report on some of the boats used by the Adminislives tration. In these boats the lives of many fire-fighting people are in danger every week of year. This is what he said regarding the as. SiwrTlie framework of this vessel is not good state'of preservation, and, in my further expenses in any attempt to bring up to the standard is not justified. Further, recommend that this vessel should not be engaged in any trade in the open sea, but be used for enclosed harbour work. He also reported on the Meklong, Madang, and other boats. He pointed out their serious defects and their suitability for further use in tropical seas, unless large sums of money were spent on repairing them. these words of warning to the Treasurer in the hope that he and the Prime munity.

159,Mr FENTON,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"I voted against the reduction of the postal rates. Sir AUSTI N CHAPMAN - I am opposed to heavy postal rates, because the Post Office is a great educator. The people who require the services of the Post Office most are those in the isolated parts of this country. It is only a catch-cry to say that postage is reduced in the interests of the merchants. Who pays the postage on the merchants' letters? The producers pay it, of course. How many people who send telegrams send them at the ordinary rates? The red form is nearly always used, and double rates are paid. Telephones are a luxury at present prices, but I look forward to the time when there will be a telephone in every house in Australia. It is practicable for us to have cheaper telegrams, cheaper telephones, and lower rates of postage. I have heard postal rates debated, not only here and in the various states, but also in the postal congresses of the world, and it has been proved that lowering the rates has in every instance increased the revenue. I have studied the subject, having had considerable experience in postal matters.",44

I am pleading for the people of Australia. The honourable member for Newcastle wishes to duplicate the Works Department, and yet in his next speech he will very likely charge the Government with extravagance. The honourable member for Angas (Mr Gabb) makes complaint, because, although the Postmaster-General promised him four post offices in his district, he does not find provision for all of them in the Estimates.

The same honourable members took exception when at one time. I proposed to use trees to support the telephone wires. They were called Chapman's bush telephones.

MT . A. GREEN (Kalgoorlie) [9.16] All lionorable members are glad to see the lionorable member for Eden-Monaro (Sir Austin Chapman), back in the chamber, and also to find that he is in such vigorous health. At the same time, T cannot remarking that he has put-an. entirely wrong construction, on the remarks made by the honourable member for J&ngas Gabb). Like myself and some Other honalready'been orable members '- on this side of the .committee, the honourable member for Angas opposed .the Government's proposal last year to reduce the postal rate on ordinary letters from 2d. to l ^ d . , and we are quite prepared to justify ourselves to our constituents. It is ridiculous to say that the honourable 'member for Angas is in favour of high telephonic charges. The most effective reply to the remarks made by the honourable member for Eden Monaro is contained in the Treasurer's budget, speech. I quote the following paragraph for his information : The reduction of postage rates, which took effect from the 1st October, 1923, entailed a loss of revenue of approximately £800,000 during the nine months of 1923-24.. The loss for a' full year approximates. £1,067,000. The honourable member for Angasdoes not favour .an increase in the postage to 6d. Our contention when the reduction was proposed last year was that it would be of no benefit to the general public. We pointed out that ordinary people would probably not post six letters a year, so that the reduction in the rates would benefit them by not more than 3d. a year each on the average. On. the I hope other hand, big commercial houses in the centres of. population post thousands of letters a year. The reduced rates must have put nearly a million pounds into their pockets i h the lasttwelve months.. The reduction in. the rates, has been detrimental to. the community, for it has prevented the Government from ' providing needed additional postal,. telegraphic, .and telephonic facilities. The money which could have, been collected had the previous lejbter rate been continued would have, pfovidjed many.extra facilities for people in the outlying areas of the Commonwealth. - Eor. instance, meteorological stations .could, have], been .established at MuHewa and' Perenjc-Ti, two comparatively, new settlements rr my electorate. It is^highly desirable that, records of the rainfall and other meteorological details Should be. tabulated in ' these and similar new. .'settlements,'.but .the Government, which reduced the postage rate, and .so henefited "" big business,"" has no money to help the'people in these.new areas. . . The same"" situation has arisen in regard to the' establishment of tropical laborahelp tories. Some time ago the Government stated that, these laboratories would be 'established"" in various Mparts of Australia"". (. Mr New South Wales and Queensland have favoured, but'so far not'one P 1 - has been established in Western Australia. In March last I was told by the Acting Director of Public Health that consideration would be given to the establishment of a laboratory at Broome when the next Estimates were being framed, but not a penny is provided on these Estimates for that most necessary work. The Government has been guilty of a distinct breach of faith in the matter, and, in addition, has placed certain honourable members in a distinctly unfair position with their constituents. Had the former postal rate been continued, money would have been available to establish these laboratories. I regret that the ex-Minister for Works and Railways (Mr Stewart), who was a most excellent Minister, was not able, before he left office, to complete his negotiations with the South Australian Government for the building of a railway line on the 4-ft. S^-in. gauge from Port Augusta as part of the Commonwealth Government's scheme to link that town with Hay. It is gratifying to leaxn that the revenue from the last quarter's operations on the east-west line was £12,225 more than for the corresponding quarter of last year. In an official statement on this matter, issued by the ex-Minister for Works and Railways, it was said that more than one truck of meat a week was now being carried on the eastwest line from South Australia to Kalgoorlie. I may add that every passenger train that ran over the line in the last few days carried a full truck of sheep and a full truck of meat for consumption in Western Australia. That traffic will soon be largely increased, for abattoirs are being established at Kingoonyah and Loongana to provide meat for the people on the eastern gold-fields of Western Australia. If an agreement is reached between the Commonwealth Government and the South Australian Government which will result in linking up Hay and Port Augusta, the commercial men in the eastern states in Sydney and Brisbane who have business to transact in Western Australia will be very unlikely to make the detour to Melbourne and Adelaide on their journey westwards. Soon after Hay and Port Augusta are linked, two trains a day will run over the transcontinental railway, and it will be within measurable distance of being a paying proposition. The Mr A. Green. building of the Hay-Port Augusta line will also contribute largely to settling the break of gauge problem, for South Australia and Victoria will be obliged, in their own interests, to convert their lines to that standard gauge as soon as practicable. I have been agitating for some tinfe for renovations and renewals to be made to the post office at Fitzroy Crossing, in the Kimberley district. The building is badly infested with white ants, and, although £200 was spent on it recently in repairs, it was discovered that an additional £300 would need to be expended to renew the floors and other parts of the building before it could be said to be in prcraer repair. Last year an amount of £950 was placed on the Estimates for building a linemen's shed at Fitzroy Crossing, but the money was not expended. One reason given by the ex-Minister for Works and Railways for the failure to do the work was that it could not be started on account of the rainy season. Every one who knows anything about that district knows that the rainy season is from November to March. We are fast approaching November in this year, and I suppose we shall be told presently that the work cannot be done this year because the rainy season has arrived. The letter I received from the Minister for Works and Railways on this matter also contained the following paragraph :As it would be uneconomical to send a working party to this remote locality unless other work in the district were required, it cannot be stated at present when these services will be carried out. The North-Wtest Department, Western Australia, will be requested, however, to have the repairs put in hand as soon as possible next financial year. If Ministers would pay a little more attention to the advice of honourable members who represent these remote districts, and are better acquainted with the local conditions than officers in the various departments in the cities can possibly be, they would find that there would be much less discontent outback with the administration. I regret that the general expenditure out of loan money on works for the Postmaster-General's Department has been allocated to the different states on such an unequal basis. Honourable members who represent Tasmania have already complained about the treatment their state has received.",46
185,Mr OKEEFE,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"We are only getting one-tenth of what some of the other states are getting. Mr A . GREEN - I trust that the Government will see the justice of helping Tasmania, for without help she cannot be expected to make much progress. Members who represent Western Australian constituencies also have reason to complain about the treatment meted out to their state. Last year an expenditure of £62,000 was provided for ; but this year only £44,000, or a third less than last year, is to be expended. I wish now to refer briefly to the lighthouse administration. Ever since my entry into this chamber I have been appealing to the Government to provide a more adequate lighthouse service for Western Australia. In a report on the lighting of the west coast of Australia from K in g George Sound to Cambridge Gulf, in November, 1912, Commander C. R. W . Brewis, R . N . , recommended the placing of eleven new lights on the coast. I have from time to time suggested a similar provision, but the Government has taken no steps towards the better l i g h t in g. of that very dangerous coast, particularly the Kimberley coast. Commander Brewis recommendedTliat a vessel be. obtained, well found, and capable of taking the sea in all weathers, of such a steam power as to move rapidly in case of emergency. That was twelve years ago. The Government has admitted that the provision of two steamers for the lighthouse service is essential. Last year, £38,450 was appropriated, and, I believe, spent, and this year an amount of £150,000 is placed on the Estimates. That makes a total of £188,4.50, but the total estimated cost of the two vessels' is £240,000, so that even by the end of the current financial year these two vessels, which are so necessary to the efficient lighting of the coast, will not be available. At the present, time, the Government steamer is making only one trip a year to the Western Australian coast. Commander Brewis recommended twelve years ago that a vessel should make the t r ip three or four times a year. again, quote from his almost antique reportThe northern lighthouses are visited by the Government steamer once a year. The reason for that is that for nine months of the year the present vessel dares not travel that coast north of North-west Cape. The vessel is quite unseaworthy, except in very calm weatherThis should be carried out at least three or four times a year. Should it be necessary for women or children to leave the stations at other times, a passage has to be taken to the nearest town by passing lugger Manned by Malays and Japanesewhich is not suitable for a woman to travel by, with or without her children, unaccompanied by her husband. These luggers also have no accommodation. I bring those inspiring facts under the notice of the Treasurer, whom the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Sir - Austin Chapman) has boosted as an apostle of progress..",48
186,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,Why are not the lighthouse boats travelling on the north-west coast? Mr A . GREEN - Because the department has no suitable boats. The Kyogle is on its way to the north-west now.,48
187,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"How long was it held up at Fremantle? Mr A . GREEN - The object of the Treasurer's interjections is to make it appear that the state of affairs which has obtained during the past twelve years is due to a difference of opinion amongst the members of the crew of the Kyogle regarding their terms of employment. That excuse is too thin. When the two steamers have been constructed, and are able to make regular trips to the coast, it will not be necessary for women and children leaving the lighthouse stations to travel on luggers manned by Malays and Japanese, and having no adequate accommodation for passengers. I do not blame the Government wholly for the existing state of affairs, but I direct attention to the urgent necessity for building these vessels as early as possible, instead of extending construction over a number of years.",48
188,Dr EARLE PAGE,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"The Estimates provide for the building of two vessels. Mr A . GREEN - I have already pointed out that the provision on the I Estimates is inadequate, and that even in June of next year the vessels will not be ready. Meanwhile women and children, must huddle on luggers with Malays and Japanese. Commander Brewis recommended the establishment of eleven new lights on the Western Australian coast, which extends for 3,130 miles. At the time of his report there was one light to each 170 miles of coast-line, and his scheme provided for one light to each 81.6' miles. The position today is no better than it was twelve years ago. The absence of lights involves such delays to ships entering the ports of Wyndham, Broome, and Derby, that the owners incur an additional expenditure of £ 5 0 to £ 1 0 0 at each port on every trip . From Cape Leveque to Darwin, a distance of 620 miles, there is not one light. The coast of the Dutch Islands, which are within three days' steam of the WesternAustralian coast, and have in parts only one steamer in a month, or even two months, is, by comparison, as. well lighted as Bourke-street. We pride ourselves upon being in the van of progress^ bub the Dutch Government could teach the Commonwealth Government a great deal about, making the coast safe for shipping. The sooner something is done to establish lights along the Western Australian coast in order to make navigation - safer and to reduce freights, the better it will be for all concerned.",48
189,Mr LISTER,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"Corio) [9.40] - I , too, regret that the Treasurer, has' not made a larger sum of money available to the Postmaster-General. I know that the Treasurer considers that he has been extremely liberal"" in letting his colleague have £4,000,000 to expend this year on postal services;. but I , like other honourable members, received promises during the last twelve .months that certain necessary works would be placed on the Estimates for the current financial year, and I am extremely disappointed to find that they have been omitted. Only a few months ago I visited Drysdale in the company of the senior postal inspector and district inspector. Those two officers were amazed to find that the local post ofiice building was little better than a dog kennel,"" and before leaving the district they inspected a number of sites which, had been offered to the department for postal purposes. They also attended a meeting of the local progress association, and so strong was the case put before them that they decided that something must be done immediately to relieve the existing, conditions. W it h in a few weeks the department acquired a. site for a new post office, and subsequent correspondence led me to believe that money would be found for that very necessary work. I was, therefore, astonished to find no provision for the Drysdale post office in the list of works to be carried out this year. When I complained to the Treasurer, he replied that I was only one of many honourable members who were disappointed because he. was not able to find all the money that the Postmaster General required for new works.",49
190,Mr GABB,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,Did the honourable member receive a promise in writing ?,49
191,Mr LISTER,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"I received from the department certain letters, which I forwarded to the local progress association,, by which I was congratulated upon the success of my representations. Now the residents are wondering why the Government has not fulfilled the departmental promise which had been made in-accordance with the recommendations of the senior inspector. Unquestionably the department is doing a great deal for the development of the country by means of telegraphic and telephonic facilities. I believe that it is genuinely desirous of giving all services to the people wherever practicable:, but is handicapped by insufficiency of funds - During the past year, the long promised additions to the switchboard in the Geelong Exchange arrived, and are now being installed. I mention the matter because I wish to expressthe hope that in future, when orders for postal requirements which cannot be supplied in Australia are placed abroad, they shall be given well in advance to avoid repetition of such delays as took place in connection with the additions to the telephone exchange at Geelong. The work was held' up for many months because of some neglect in America. It was only after repeated representations had been made that the necessary material was shipped to Australia. A great deal has been said about the reduction of postage to I d . , but in view of the present financial position of the department, I would not favour any reduction of postage. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Sir Austin Chapman), who was at one time Postmaster General of the Commonwealth, has. said much in support of penny postage; but in his comparison of Australia with countries in which penny postage has been successful, the honourable gentleman overlooks the distances which have to be traversed by mail in this country, and the large subsidies which have to be paid to mail contractors. This makes our conditions very different from those of other countries that have penny postage. There are places in Australia that have a mail only once in every month or six weeks, and it costs the Government up to £700 per annum to subsidize their mails, although they.are not as large as many of our city postmen carry round in a morning delivery. We cannot agree to the department being robbed of revenue, as I think it would be, by the reduction of the postage to one penny. The experience of the last nine months has proved that a reduction of postage does not increase the revenue; and I cannot agree with the honourable member for Eden-Monaro that a further reduction of postage would do so.",49
192,Mr GABB,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"The reduction by another half-penny would mean the loss of £1,000,000 a year.",50
193,Mr LISTER,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"Yes ; and probably more. In the erection of country post offices, I think that provision should be made for a residence for the postmaster. We have numerous instances in the country districts of post offices being erected without a residence. In such cases, considerable difficulty sometimes arises through the department being unable to' secure necessary accommodation for the postal officials placed in charge of these post offices. I have had this experience in my electorate, and I am sure that my experience in the matter is not singular. I notice in the schedule a vote of £120,000 for ""works services, and acquisition of land in Federal Capital Territory.""' I should like to know what proportion of this amount is to be spent in the acquisition of more land. I was under the impression that all the land acquired in the Territory by the Government up to the present time had been paid for. I cannot see any justification for the expenditure of ""another £120,000 at the Federal Capital. Too much money has been expended there already. The honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr. Fenton) shows me a photograph of the provisional Parliament House, which he says is nearly finished. He has not shown me a photograph of the hostel. In my opinion, there are very few members of this Parliament sufficiently well off take up residence in the hostel. [126]",50
194,Mr MCGRATH,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,They will have to batch.,50
195,Mr LISTER,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"Then why build a hostel? We are expending tens of thousands of pounds on a hostel, ostensibly for the use of members of this Parliament, whilst the tariff will be so high that very few honourable members will be able to avail themselves of the accommodation to be provided.",50
196,Mr FORDE,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,What is the tariff going to be?,50
197,Mr LISTER,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"It is said that it cannot be less than £ 1 per day if the hostel is to pay interest on cost of construction, apart from working expenses.",50
198,Mr MCGRATH,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,We had better make a hotel of it.,50
199,Mr LISTER,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"Hotel s are barred from the Federal Capital territory, and I hope they always will be. I should like to know in how many more ways provision is to be made on'different estimates for the expenditure of money in the Federal Capital territory. Ln every estimate put before us some amount appears for further expenditure on the "" Celestial City."" We should be given some information concerning this vote of £120,000. I should not have thought that, it was necessary to acquire more land. There are something like 900 square miles of land in the territory, but a great deal of it is absolutely useless. I hope the Treasurer will tell us what the vote appearing in the schedule to this bill is required for. There is one other matter to which I wish to refer. It is in connection with the item, "" Expenditure under War Service Homes Act, 1918-23 (to be paid to credit of Trust Fund, War Service Homes Account), £1,800,000."" I do not know exactly for what purpose this money is required. Probably some of it is required ""for advances to - soldiers acquiring homes under the act. I want to refer to a very bard case which recently came under my notice. It is .that of a widow who has. received an intimation from the department that she must get out of the house she is occupying, notwithstanding the fact that all her rent, rates and taxes are paid, because she refuses to keep the property in proper repair at her own expense. I visited this home to see what to the conditions were. The house is a disgrace to the department. I understand that the Commonwealth Bank - was responsible for its erection. The iron with, which it is roofed had previously been used to cover wheat stacks. Holes in it were filled up with red lead, but the water comes through and percolates through the three-ply ceiling on to the bed clothing and furniture in the house. Some of the widow's belongings have been spoiled. One of the windows in the house will not close, and another will not open. This woman, in good faith, entered into a contract with the department expecting to get value for the money she was prepared to pay. Like many more she signed her contract without knowing the conditions it contained requiring the place to be kept jn Droper repair. There should be no reason to make repairs to a new house.",50
200,Mr COLEMAN,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,Has the honourable member approached the Minister regarding this case?,51
201,Mr LISTER,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"It is before the Minister at the present moment. I have had this matter before the department since 1922, but it has been hung up; and now an ejectment order has been issued to turn this widow out of the house. It is a scandal, and I hope the Government will see that justice is done to her. She entered into the contract fully determined to do all in her power to honour it to the letter, but she has not received from the bank what she contracted for. I hope the Government will remedy this case of injustice without delay.",51
202,Mr MCGRATH,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"Ballarat) [10.2] There are many matters I should like to discuss. They include the. borrowing of money for immigration and to pay transport expenses incurred during the war. It seems to be rather late in the day to receive a bill for £30,000 for transport penses during the war. On the present occasion, however, I intend to confine myself to the policy of borrowing money for defence. A sum of £362,000 is included in the bill for defence purposes. To borrow money for defence is wrong. Between 1910 and 1913 the Labour party was in power, and during those years the Australian Navy was established, compulsory training was instituted, and provision was made for the war that was looming ahead; but every penny that was spent on defence came out of revenue. The result was that - when we were plunged into the war we were able to borrow to finance ourselves, for we had no past debt to handicap us. The present Ministry is led in this matter by the Treasurer, who, when he sat in the Corner, compelled the Government to reduce its defence expenditure out of revenue by £1,000,000, although he now proposes to commit this country to an expenditure, out of loan money, of one-third of a million pounds for defence. That expenditure will not produce any revenue, and will merely add to the national debt of this country. It is futile to talk, as the Treasurer did in his budget speech, about reducing the loans of Australia by £2,000,000 while he is increasing our loan indebtedness in the manner disclosed in the bill. I believe that we should spend money, not upon cruisers, but rather upon the works indicated in the bill. There may be some justification for those works, but not for borrowing money for them. They should be provided out of revenue. I would go even farther than that and say that every shilling spent on the defence of this country should be recouped by a direct tax on wealth. The poorer section of the people should not be called upon to contribute money for this country's defence. The bill does not propose that even the wealthy class should pay anything, but it passes the obligation on to posterity. If this policy continues our Federal debt will increase from £410,000,000, then to £420,000,000, and so on. Even Great Britain does not pay for her defence out of loan moneys. Prior to the war, every shilling she spent on Imperial defence was provided out of the revenue of the year; and today, although she is faced with a heavy interest bill, she is paying exfor her defence out of the revenue of the year. She is repaying her ' debt to America, and reducing her war loans very considerably every year. But we in this young country, - whose war debt and defence expenditures are as 'nothing compared with those of Great Britain, and who pride ourselves upon being in a better financial position than any other oountry in the world, provide for future defence out of loan moneys. It is a dishonest method of finance, and I am satisfied that it will not be tolerated by the people. As soon as the facts are placed before them,, and they are told that money is being borrowed, not for reproductive works, but for building, arsenals or factories, or buying land for such buildings, they will declare emphatically against such a policy. I move That the following words be added to the clause "" Defence expenditure shall not be paid from the above-mentioned loan money."" If that amendment is agreed to it will not preclude the. construction out of revenue of the works mentioned in the bill.",51
203,Mr WHITSITT,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"Darwin) [10.9] - It is very difficult for a member of Parliament to ascertain exactly what is the capital outlay on the post offices in the Commonwealth. I suggest that the Postmaster-General should submit a proper balance-sheet of his department showing exactly what the assets of the Post Office are. A balance-sheet should show how much money is spent on post offices out of revenue and how much out of loans. At present we do not know the facts, and have no means of ascertaining them. I ought to be able to place my finger on the information, but it is impossible to glean it from the figures supplied to us. We should know what the assets of the Post Office are worth, and where the taxpayers' money goes. A sum of £118,000 is set down for remodelling the Sydney post office.",52
204,Mr WEST,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,That work is badly needed.,52
205,Mr WHITSITT,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"That may be so, but the. fact that the expenditure is necessary is evidence of. bad management. No man could run a private business in that way. A statement of receipts and expenditure is hot a balance-sheet. Can the Minister representing the Postmaster-General tell me how much money is invested in the Post Office? Ministers have a habit of ignoring such direct questions. ' Any Minister ought to be able to inform honourable members of the details relating to his own department. . I also want to know something about the £250,000 provided for ""immigration - advance s of passage money, landing money, and medical fees of assisted immigrants."" Such expenditure should certainly not be provided for out of loans.",52
206,Mr OKEEFE,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,The honourable member's Government says it should.,52
207,Mr WHITSITT,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"It is the Government of Australia, but it is not my Government. I am as free and untrammelled as the air we breathe. Because I support the Government it is not above criticism. What will the immigrants do when they come here? Have we jobs for them? Shall we put them on the land, so. that they will curse the day when they set foot in this country? I would rather see the men who are brought out here placed in our secondary industries to assist in manufacturing the things we require. We are bringing immigrants from Great Britain to settle on the land, and yet that country will not buy our products. She prefers to buy her goods from Greece and other like countries in which labourers receive lOd. a day. That is not the proper way for a mother to treat her sons. If we are prepared to absorb immigrants from Great Britain to relieve her of her congested population, it is her duty to take the products of her sons in return. That is the only way to develop Australia, and ensure success for those who go on the land. The Government proposes to expend £15,000 on a solar . observatory at Canberra. I cannot understand the reason for this expenditure^ It may be - that it is intended to explore the moon, or, perhaps, members of Parliament when at Canberra wish to gain inspiration from Mars. This expenditure is entirely unnecessary at present. We are borrowing £9,000,000, which will aggravate the exchange situation. Where is this money to be borrowed ?",52
208,Mr GABB,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"In Australia, I hope.",52
209,Mr WHITSITT,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"I hope so, too. If it is to be borrowed from Great Britain the exchange difficulty will be seriously aggravated. Australia has a huge public debt, and we should not expend one penny unless for . revenue-producing, works - God knows that our debt is too heavy, and is greater than we can bear, yet we continue to issue notes. How can we weather the storm if we continue to borrow money for unproductive works? We have not 6,000,000 people in Australia, yet the taxation is increasing all the time. The people have to bear the brunt of any expenditure on unproductive works. Not onei penny should be borrowed from abroad until the exchange problem is settled. We are in a most critical financial position. There is a dead loss on all federal public works, including railways, the administration of the Northern Territory, and the building - of the Federal Capital site. To meet these losses the people must be heavily taxed. All expenditure on non-productive works is money gone by the board. I sincerely hope that the Government will take some cognizance of what I have said.",52
210,Mr COLEMAN,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"Reid) [10.20] - I rise to protest against the statement made by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Sir Austin Chapman), who I regret has left the chamber. Out of consideration for his unfortunate infirmity I hesitated to interrupt his flow of eloquence. But to use a term that has in the last few days become fashionable in this chamber, he was guilty of a deliberate misstatement. In his outburst, he said that he was amazed, yet it was apparent that he was in a maze, and entangled in a wire netting entanglement of contradiction. He stated that I voted against increasing the old-age pension to £ 1 per week. That statement was not treated seriously by honourable members, but .when placed on record in Hansard it is apt to leave an erroneous impression outside. On the 10th July last year I moved an amendment that the Estimates be - reduced by £ 1 as an indication to the Government that the pension should be increased to £1 per week. Besides the Labour party, the honourable members for Henty (Mr F. Francis), Robertson (Mr Gardner), Corio (Mr Lister), Fawkner (Mr Maxwell), Darwin (Mr Whitsitt), and Fremantle (Mr Watson) voted for the amendment. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro, who has repeatedly declared himself in favour of increasing the pension to £1 per week, voted with the Government, so I ami at a loss to under - stand how he can have the cold-blooded audacity to make such a misstatement respecting my views on old-age pensions. Unlike him, I have always been consistent in my attitude. ing the debate that then took place this party declared that before the Government made free gifts to the big pastoralists and financial institutions, before it reduced the postage rates, its bounden duty was to make provision for the invalid and aged. On that occasion we were supported by the honourable member for Fawkner (Mr Maxwell) and other honourable members, who gave somewhat similar reasons for their attitude. These honourable members were not consistent, because subsequently, on the 24th August, when the subject was again debated, withuthe exception of the honourable - member for North Sydney (Mr. W. M . Hughes), who was absent when the previous vote was taken, the honourable member for Corio (Mr Lister), and the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Watson), they voted with the Government. Having disposed of that, allow me to say that I regret that the late Minister for Works and Railways (Mr. Stewart) saw fit to tender his resignation. I , with most honourable members of the House, found him keenly attentive to the various matters brought before him. He proved to be an efficient executive head, and he tried to do his best for all members, irrespective of party. He is certainly a loss to the Administration. I have no complaint regarding the provision for postal works in my electorate as a result of my persistent representations. A sum is to be appropriated to enable post offices to be completed at Belmore, Lakemba, Guildford, and Merrylands, the amount to be expended exceeding the total vote for Tasmania, so I cannot very well complain in this regard. Progress reported. ADJOURNMENT. DOBADIIXA GRAPE INDUSTRY.",53
211,Mr BRUCE,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"Flinders-Prime Minister and Minister for External Affairs) [10.29] - I move That the House do now adjourn. The House is fully cognizant of the situation that has arisen during the past few months concerning the growers of doradilla grapes in Victoria, New South Wales, and particularly South Australia. The Government during this time has been Dur- endeavouring to find some solution of what is unquestionably a difficult problem, involving a serious crisis in the industry. The trouble has arisen to a and great extent from the fact that soldier settlers*were compelled by the states to grow doradilla grapes, and the production has become so great that it is almost impossible to find an outlet for it at a price that will give a reasonable return to the growers. This year's crop was so abundant, and the outlet so small, that large quantities, of grapes were sold at a price which certainly did not give the growers a profitable return, and a considerable percentage of the crop could not be sold at all, and. rotted on the vines. The Government recognized the difficulties of the growers some little time ago, and gave careful consideration to the whole situation. It requested the Tariff Board to investigate the subject. The board met representatives of all concerned in the industrythe growers, the viguerons, and the distillers-and subsequently I also saw these representatives on several occasions. They requested the Government to take some steps to meet the serious situation that had arisen. The Government replied that before it wGuld do anything it must be given an assurance that the interests of the growers would be safeguarded, and that they would be given a reasonable price for their grapes. Unfortunately, our efforts in that direction were not successful. The Tariff Board, after making its investigation, submitted certain recommendations to the Government with the object of stimulating the production of. sweet wines, and making possible the marketing of them overseas. At that time the Government felt that it could give effect to only one of the recommendations of the board unless an assurance was forthcoming that a satisfactory price should be paid to the growers for their grapes. Had the Government adopted all of the Tariff Board's recommendations without such a guarantee, it would really have been giving assistance to the people who were responsible for building up the large stocks which existed. The recommendations of the Tariff Board were-(1 ) That there should be a reduction of excise from 26s. to 21s. per gallon on brandy distilled from doradilla grapes; (2) that the excise on fortifying spirits distilled from doradilla grapes should be reduced from 6s. to 5s.; and (3) that a bounty of 4s. gallon on fortified wines of a strength of 34 proof spirit or over should be given, and that the drawback of 6d. per gallon, at present allowed 'on exports, should be withdrawn. The Government did not see its way clear to adopt those recommendations, except in regard to the reduction of the excise on brandy distilled from doradilla grapes. A bill was introduced on the 4th April which really gave [127] effect to the first of those three recommendations by increasing the import duty on brandy by 5s. per gallon. We now desire to create a market in which it will be possible to dispose of an increased quantity of fortified wines, and we shall ask the House later to give effect to recommendations (2) and (3) of the Tariff Board. The market which is available for sweet wines in Great Britain is, I believe, almost unlimited, but, as legislation will have to be submitted to the House to give effect to these recommendations, I do not propose to discuss the matter further now. I shall speak at length of the consumption of sweet wines in Great Britain when the bill is introduced. I may say, however, that when I was in Great Britain I made strenuous attempts to induce the British Government to take action to alter the basis of the existing duties which operate against the Australian producers. The duty on dry wines is very much lower than that on sweet wines. The British Customs Department distinguishes sweet from dry wines by the amount of spirit they contain. On the present basis wines containing over 30 per cent, of proof spirit pay a much higher duty than wines containing 30 per cent, or less of proof spirit. This enables the continental growers to put their wines on the market in Great Britain at the lower duty. Because of the great distance that Australian wines have to be carried, and the fact that they have to pass through the tropics, they have to be fortified to an extent which makes it impossible to get them into England on the "" 30 or under "" basis, and they have therefore to pay the higher duty which is applicable to wines containing over 30 per cent, of proof spirit. I was unable to get the British Government to agree to an alteration of the present basis, owing to a treaty with per Portugal, but the proposals which the Government is now suggesting will overcome the difficulty to a great extent, and enable us to put our strongly fortified wines on the English market. I shall go more fully into this matter later, but content myself now with saying that I believe that action along these lines will stimulate the whole trade. Undoubtedly there is a great opportunity for building up a big business in Australian sweet wines in London. It is not unreasonable to propose the reduction of.the excise duty on fortifying spirit to 5s.,. so far as spirit obtained from doradilla grapes is concerned. Prior to the war excise on this class of spirit was only 6d. per gallon. It was increased to 8d., and there it rested until the exigencies of war of which you, Mr Speaker, know something, compelled the Government to seek additional revenue and was then increased to 6s. per gallon, the present rate. Government proposes that the from this source shall be used to provide the bounty to be paid to the growers. I stress the fact that, although the Government is proposing to pay this bounty, its action is not to be taken as a precedent that will be followed should any other section of the community seek help. This industry is providing its own bounty, for the money will be paid from the revenue collected from the industry. should be explained that the bounty on the fortified wine exported will be paid only on the condition that the Minister is satisfied that the grower of doradilla grapes is paid a reasonable price for his crop. A matter which should very careful attention from the states is the future of the doradilla growers. present, as I have said, very grave difficulty is being experienced in finding an outlet for the doradilla grapes that are produced. The proposals of the Government will meet the immediate needs of the situation, but will not' in any sense be adequate when all the vines now planted are in bearing. It is necessary, therefore, that an investigation should be made into the situation generally, the Government proposes to request the interested states to co-operate in the appointment of an expert committee ascertain what the production dilla' grapes will be in the next few years, and to advise the settlers on the best action to take to protect their For instance, I understand that it is not difficult to graft other varieties of grape on the vines. The only other matter to which I shall refer is the attitude that has been adopted by the states. The House will remember that I indicated a week or so ago that such a serious position had arisen in the industry, and that such a low price was being paid for doradilla grapes that we had approached the states with a proposal that a bounty, Mr Bruce. contributed in equal shares by the states concerned and the Commonwealth, should be paid to the growers which would give them a reasonable price per ton for the season just closed. I am sorry to say that the South Australian and Victorian Governments - have replied that they canfinance, not see their way to accept the offer of the Commonwealth Government. They have adopted the course which, I venture to say, has almost become a habit with the The states, of suggesting that the Commonrevenue wealth Government might very well pay the bounty itself. This the Government does not feel disposed to do, for it is not responsible for the position which has arisen, and is really due to the fact that the state authorities compelled the settlers to. plant doradilla grapes. In view of those facts, the Commonwealth Government feels that it is acting generously in offering to bear one-half of It the expenditure. On behalf of the Commonwealth Government, I shall again urge the states to undertake their share of this obligation for the past season, and indicate to them that the Commonreceive wealth is taking the action announced - this evening in the hope that it will preAt vent a repetition of what occurred last season. I .shall point out that, as the Commonwealth Government is bearing a share of the burden ancl is employing the revenue received from the excise towards assisting the industry in the future, it is reasonable that the states shall pay half of the expenditure for last season in order to give relief to the. growers.",53
212,Mr GABB,AUSTRALIAN CANNED FRUIT I N,"Angas) [10.46] - The and statement of the Prime Minister is one to which I desire to make a short reference, even at this late hour. The Prime to Minister has taken the stand that the of dora- obligation to pay the bounty to the growers of these grapes does not rest with the Commonwealth Government, but interests. the fact remains that the repatriation of our soldiers is a Commonwealth obligation. In this matter the states have, to a certain extent, acted as our'agents. It is true that they planted the blocks, or advised the soldiers to plant them, with doradilla grapes. That action has caused the present glut, and to that extent the growers probably have some claim on the states. But when we reto be member that the growing of doradilla grapes is unprofitable largely because the Commonwealth takes in excise the sum of £40 6s. in respect of every ton used for the manufacture of brandy, and £9 6s. in the case of every ton used in the manufacture of fortifying spirit, it is not asking the Commonwealth Government to do too much when we request it to repay £2 out of £40 in the one case, and £1 or £2 of the £9 in the other case, to assist the growers. On a previous occasion the states rejected the Commonwealth proposal to pay on an equal basis a bounty sufficient to bring the price received by growers of doradilla grapes up to £5 a ton when grown on irrigated areas, and £4 a ton in the case of those grown in what are known as the "" d r y "" areas; but now that the Commonwealth Government is prepared to pay export bounty they might reconsider their decision. With the proposal to pay an export bounty in respect of wines which are fortified to the extent of 34 per cent., I heartily agree. To provide a bounty for the growers for this year only would meet their present need, but would bold out no hope for the future, whereas the proposal of the Government, as outlined by the Prime Minister, will provide them with hope for the days ahead. If any advantage can come from the glut, it will be by using the increased production to fill other channels in addition to those through which the trade has been flowing, and by forcing our way into new markets. This action of the Commonwealth Government in giving a bounty will help the distillers and vignerons to find other markets. The other proposal of the Prime Minister, that the excise on spirit used to fortify Australian wines distilled wholly from thefresh juice of the doradilla grapes, subject to regulations, shall be 5s. per proof gallon, instead of 6s., is a dangerous one. At the present time the surplus of spirit is along the Murray valley, but immediately a preference of Is. per gallon is given in the case of spirits made from doradilla grapes, the result will be to remove the surplus from the Murray valley and transfer it to the "" middle "" portions of South Australia. The growers of Matara grapes will, in that event, graft over to doradilla grapes from their present vines. They will do that to get the benefit of the Is. a gallon difference in the excise. In course of time there will be a greater area of country in South Australia, and probably in Victoria, under doradilla grapes than there is at present. I hope that the Minister will rofer this matter again to the Tariff Board. It is perfectly clear that if a preference of Is. a gall-on is given to spirit made from one particular kind of grape, the result will be that men will graft over to that variety, and the last condition will be worse than the first. At a later stage I may have something further to say on this matter. The action of the Government in differentiating between spirit made from Matara and other grapes and that made from doradillas will present greater difficulties in the future than up to the present have been encountered. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 10.52 p.m.",55
