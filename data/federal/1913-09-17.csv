The information with which I have been furnished is thisThe statement in regard to the supply of about 60,000 jarrah sleepers, and the powellized karri sleepers not being due until November, is correct. A draft agreement was prepared by the Federal Crown Solicitor and forwarded to the State Government for approval and signature, but that Government, desiring a different wording, prepared, signed, and forwarded an amended draft agreement. The Commonwealth could not agree to the amended draft, and after some telegraphic communication the State Government intimated that it was willing to agree to the Commonwealth wording. cipated that a fresh draft would be prepared and signed in Western Australia, as asked in the Engineer-in-Chief's telegram, but some misapprehension seems to have arisen as to whether the State or Commonwealth should bave the fresh document prepared for signature.

14,Mr SPEAKER,SITE FOR NEW QUARANTINE STATION,The honourable member is anticipating a question on the notice-paper.,14
15,Colonel RYRIE,SITE FOR NEW QUARANTINE STATION,"I desire to ask the Minister of Trade and Customs he is prepared to receive a deputation consisting of the mayor and of Manly in regard to the removal of the quarantine restrictions there; and, if so, can he fix an approximate date for the reception of that deputation 1",14
16,Mr GROOM,SITE FOR NEW QUARANTINE STATION,The honourable member mentioned this matter to me some time *go,14
17,Mr FISHER,SITE FOR NEW QUARANTINE STATION,All well arranged.,14
18,Mr GROOM,SITE FOR NEW QUARANTINE STATION,"As a matter of fact, the honourable member mentioned it to me when I was passing through Sydney the other day. At that time it was found that it was impossible to make an Arrangement to receive a deputation.",14
19,Mr TUDOR,SITE FOR NEW QUARANTINE STATION,Is there any necessity to ask a Minister whether he will receive a deputation ?,14
20,Mr GROOM,SITE FOR NEW QUARANTINE STATION,"I then told the honourable member that I would be glad to receive a deputation, and I assure him now that, on the first occasion that I visit Sydney, I will be only too pleased to do so.",14
21,Mr TUDOR,SITE FOR NEW QUARANTINE STATION,"Following up the quest i on which was asked by the honourable member for North Sydney of the Minister of Trade and Customs, I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether any new procedure has been adopted under which it is necessary to ask a Minister on the floor of the House whether he will receive a deputation ? Mr JOSE PH COOK: - No different method has beeu adopted so far as I am aware.",14
22,Mr TUDOR,SITE FOR NEW QUARANTINE STATION,Is there any necessity to ask whether a deputation will be received ? Mr. JOSEPH'COOK - May I suggest that that is a matter entirely within the discretion of the honourable member who chooses to ask a question. May not any honourable member upon this side of the House ask a question ?,14
23,Mr WEBSTER,SITE FOR NEW QUARANTINE STATION,"the Prime M i nister, upon notice I. In view of the escape of small-pox patients from the quarantine station, Sydney, is such offence a contravention of State or Federal laws? 2. Are the offenders being prosecuted by the Federal authorities? 3I f so, on what charge is the prosecution based ?",14
24,Mr GROOM,SITE FOR NEW QUARANTINE STATION,"The answers to the honourable member's questions arei . Whether any offence has been committed is a matter to be decided by the Court. 2 and 3. The matter is in the hands of the Law authorities. whether In reply to another question which the honourable member for Gwydir put to me representatives yesterday, I may say that on receivingthe Hansard proof this morning I found that what the honourable member asked was whether I contended that all contacts had been isolated in Sydney. I desire now to say that all contacts were not isolated.",14
25,Mr WEBSTER,SITE FOR NEW QUARANTINE STATION,I thought so. That is just the evil of the whole matter.,14
26,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,SITE FOR NEW QUARANTINE STATION,"the Minister of Trade and Customs, upon notice I. Is it a fact that the quarantining of Sydney is causing great inconvenience and loss to all sections of the community ? 2. Can he say whether the present situation of the quarantine ground at Manly is a menace to the people or objectionable in any way? 3. Is it true that, quite recently, some of the persons quarantined there left the quarantine grounds and freely mingled with the holiday crowd and residents of Manlv, and, if so, what steps have been taken to punish these offenders? 4. Will he ascertain if a suitable site in a more isolated position can be secured for purposes of a quarantine station ? 5. Has his attention been directed to a letter in the Sydney press objecting to the present position of the quarantine ground at North Head, Manly, and as to the present system of quarantine? 6. Is it not possible by some system of isolation to alter this state of things?",14
27,Mr GROOM,SITE FOR NEW QUARANTINE STATION,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are1. It is a fact that inconvenience and loss is being experienced in Sydney as a result of the present epidemic of small-pox in that city. The object of the Federal Regulation is to prevent the spread of the disease to other States and the possibility of a similar condition of affairs as exists in Sydney arising in other parts of Australia. 2. The present situation of the quarantine ground at Manly is not considered to be a menace, or open to objection. 3. It is true that five persons quarantined at the station escaped from the station and visited Manly. The matter is now in the hands of the Law authorities. 4. Representations have repeatedly been made to the Department, and various alternative sites suggested; but no suitable site is obtainable within a reasonable distance from Sydney. 5. Several letters appeared in the press. Perhaps the honourable member will be good enough to give me a reference to the particular letter to which he refers. 6.

29,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SITE FOR NEW QUARANTINE STATION,"I am very glad that the honourable member has asked this question, because it enables me to refer to a statement which appears in this morning's newspapers, and which emanates from the Premier of New South Wales aud some members of the Labour Party in that State. I wish to say that at least as much courtesy will be shown to the Parliament of New South Wales as the Government of that State showed to this Parliament in connection with the recent banquet which they held. To that banquet, I believe, only the Prinie Minister was invited.",15
30,Mr GROOM,SITE FOR NEW QUARANTINE STATION,I was invited.,15
31,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SITE FOR NEW QUARANTINE STATION,"I think that my honourable colleague was invited and attended in my stead. Where there is any room for complaint on their part I fail to see. I hope that we shall treat them much better than that. I understand that the Whip has ascertained that there will be a large number of honourable members journeyiug to New South Wales to witness the arrival of the flagship Australia and her consort, and if they will let us know exactly what are their requirements we will take steps to see that they are made comfortable.",15
32,Mr FISHER,SITE FOR NEW QUARANTINE STATION,I presume that the quarantine will be raised before then ?,15

Mr JOSE PH COOK - I do not knowwhether the vessels are being taken into* the danger zone. No doubt all on board* have been vaccinated, and are ready t c face anything-eve n an enemy of that, kind. PERSONAL EXPLANATION .",15
37,Mr KING OMALLEY,SITE FOR NEW QUARANTINE STATION,"I desire t c make a personal explanation. While the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs wasspeaking yesterday, he said that I was a. justice of the peace for South Australia. I want to say that I am not. The lateRight Honourable Charles Cameron K in gston made me a justice of the peace, but I refused to pay the 10s. to take out the-commission, because I recognised that I was a partisan, and, therefore, in thecapacity of a justice, could not act fair l y to my opponents.

40,Mr FINLAYSON,SITE FOR NEW QUARANTINE STATION,"May I put m y question in this way: As Ministers areanxious to get on with business, will they protect the House from such pugnaciousreferences and buffoonery as were indulged in last night by the Assistant M in - ister of Home Affairs when introducing a measure ?",15
41,Mr SPEAKER,SITE FOR NEW QUARANTINE STATION,"The question is not properly allowable. Our standing orderr provides that, after notice has been given, questions may be put to Ministers of the Crown relating to public affairs, and, according to May, questions addressed to Ministers should relate to the public affairs with which they are officially con- . nected, proceedings pending in Parliament, or to any matter of public importance for which they are responsible. I have called attention to this matter before, but the honourable member may not have been here at the time.",15
42,Mr WEBSTER,SITE FOR NEW QUARANTINE STATION,I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether it is a fact that the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs has been severely admonished by the Cabinet for his conduct of yesterday?,16
43,Mr SPEAKER,SITE FOR NEW QUARANTINE STATION,Order !,16
44,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SITE FOR NEW QUARANTINE STATION,"All I have to say on that point is that if admonition is necessary, it is doubly necessary with regard to the Opposition for the scandalous way they treated him. I have never seen a Minister so treated before.",16
45,Mr FINLAYSON,SITE FOR NEW QUARANTINE STATION,"I ask the Prime Minister if it is .true, as reported, that Ministers have introduced a new system of party government, and have abandoned their Caucus meetings for that which they call a Ministerial party meeting?",16
46,Mr SPEAKER,SITE FOR NEW QUARANTINE STATION,That is not a proper question.,16
47,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SITE FOR NEW QUARANTINE STATION,"On e portion of the honourable member's question related to the conduct of public business last evening, and, if I am in order, sir, I would like to answer it .",16
48,Mr FINLAYSON,SITE FOR NEW QUARANTINE STATION,I object. I was not allowed to get in my statement.,16

54,Mr BAMFORD,SITE FOR NEW QUARANTINE STATION,"Yesterday afternoon I drew the attention of the Minister of Trade and Customs to certain allegations made in connection with carrying out the agreement between the ex-Prime Minister and the Premier of Queensland, and he replied that if I would give him a definite assurance regarding non-compliance with the conditions of the agreement, he would make inquiries. I desire to know if he has taken any steps in that direction.",16
55,Mr GROOM,SITE FOR NEW QUARANTINE STATION,"Las t night the honourable member gave me definite information in telegrams.

58,Mr SPEAKER,SITE FOR NEW QUARANTINE STATION,"The honourable member asked me a question on this subject a few days ago, and my predecessor, the honourable member for Kennedy, explained pretty full y what steps' had been taken to improve the ventilation of the chamber. I do not know that it is necessary for me to elaborate that statement more than to say that large sums have been expended in the effort to improve the ventilation, and certainly the ventilation has been improved by comparison with what honourable members in previous Parliaments have experienced here. I have asked our own engineer to inquire into a scheme which is proposed by a recently-established firm here for ozonizing the atmosphere of the chamber. Whether that will be effective or not, I do not know, but I propose to take advantage of the opportunity afforded by the presence of the British Parliamentary visitors to inquire as to their experience of the experiment of the House of Commons under the same system; and, later on, I shall be able to give the honourable member and the House the benefit of the information obtained.

90,Mr SPEAKER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"The Clerk has just called my attention to the fact, which had escaped my notice, that this discussion anticipates a notice of motion set down by the honourable member for Gwydir on fÂ£ie business-paper for tomorrow in the following terms: That-wit h a view to putting an end to the suffering, sacrifice of human life, and the commercial, industrial, and domestic stagnation in Hie State of New South Wales, resulting from the proclamation and administration of the laws governing small-pox epidemics-this House is of opinion that the proclamation should be cancelled, and that isolation, combined with tary reform, the true enemy of small-pox, should be substituted for the present injurious methods. Both motions, it seems to me, have reference to an identical subject.",19
91,Mr WEST,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"I am not ignorant of what appears on the notice-paper, but I am now asking the House, as a matter of urgency, to deal with the action of the Health Board of New South Wales.",19
92,Mr FISHER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,I think the motions are different.,19
93,Mr SPEAKER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"If it is desired to discuss the subject today, it would be more regular, I think, if the honourable member for Gwydir were to temporarily withdraw his motion.",19
94,Mr WEBSTER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"In view of that suggestion I should like a little advice. If I withdraw the notice of motion today, can I reinstate it for discussion toSYDNEY. morrow.",19
95,Mr SPEAKER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,The honourable member will have to give fresh notice of motion tomorrow.,19
96,Mr FISHER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"He could give notice, by leave, to-night.",19
97,Mr SPEAKER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"B y leave of the House, yes.",19
98,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,We do not desire two discussions on the same subject.,19
99,Mr SPEAKER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"At present, it seems to me that the motion before us is out of order, because it covers practically the same ground as that covered by the motion of the honourable member for Gwydir.",19
100,Mr FISHER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"I am not at all anxious that a motion of the kin d should be brought on now; but, with all due deference to you, sir, I doubt whether the two motions really deal with the same subject. The motion of the honourable member for East Sydney has reference to the act of a body altogether apart from the Commonwealth.",19
101,Mr GROOM,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,But in consequence of that act the honourable member is asking for a repeal of the proclamation.,19
102,Mr FISHER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"The urgency, I understand, arises out of something done by another body, altogether apart from the Commonwealth.",19
103,Mr GROOM,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"That is only urged as a reason for repealing the proclamation; both motions ask for a repeal, but on different grounds.",19
104,Mr FISHER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"This , of course, is quite a non-party question. If the placing of a general motion on the notice-paper in reference to a big subject like this can presani- vent the discussion of, perhaps, a proposal of much greater importance than the original motion, the functions of Parliament could be abrogated by merely f i l ling up the paper. I think, Mr Speaker, that, strictly, your ruling is too narrow, and might be disastrous in its effect.",19
105,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,I do not thin k thing can possibly he said on the subject port the Chair. that could not be said under the motion that appears on the business-paper.,20
106,Mr RILEY,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,But when shall we reach that motion ?,20
107,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,It is down for tomorrow. I should not have the slightest objection to a discussion today if that notice of motion were not on the paper for tomorrow.,20
108,Mr TUDOR,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,There are other motions before the motion referred to.,20
109,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"But those other motions could, I presume, be postponed. In any case, it is a well-known rule in Parliament that when there is a notice of motion on the paper, the subject of that motion cannot be made the subject of another oue. In the present case it is, after all , only a minor branch of the subject that is touched by the motion of the honourable member for East Sydney, and I think the matter might well wait until tomorrow. We shall facilitate its discussion tomorrow in every way we can.",20
110,Mr FENTON,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,On the point order,20
111,Mr SPEAKER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"I am quite prepared to give my decision. I have been looking carefully through the motion and also through the notice of motion given by the honourable member for Gwydir, with the result that it seems to me that the subjects are practically identical, so that the same range of discussion will cover both. That being so, I have no option, under the Standing Orders, but to rule that the discussion of this motion at the present time would be out of order. Standing order 117 provides thatNo motion or amendment shall anticipate an Order of the Day or another motion of which notice has been given The motion of which notice has already been given by the honourable member for Gwydir practically covers all the ground covered by the motion which the honourable member for East Sydney has just handed in .",20

113,Mr FINLAYSON,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"May I proceed to refer to this matter, Mr Speaker, without giving notice of motion to disagree with your ruling ?",20
114,Mr SPEAKER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,No .,20
115,Mr FINLAYSON,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"I hesitate very much to give notice of a motion to disagree with, anyyour ruling, since I always desire to sup",20

117,Mr SPEAKER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"An audible remark was just made by an honourable member, although I cannot say that it was intended fco apply to me, that this was an attempt fco "" burke "" discussion. I may say that I am only ruling i u accordance with the Standing Orders. Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear !",20
118,Mr FENTON,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"If I am the member to whom you refer, Mr Speaker, I can only say that I had no intention whatever of reflecting on your decision. Looking across the chamber to the Ministerial side of the House, I said that the giving of a notice of motion of a general character might be resorted to in the future as a ineans of "" burking "" discussion. Whafc of I meant was that an honourable member could be debarred from bringing forward some urgent and important matter because of the appearance ou the business paper of a general notice of motion relating to the same subject.",20
119,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,This is a speech to which there should be a reply.,20

That being so, I shall not move that your ruling be disagreed with. ELECTOR AL BILL. SECOND READING . Debate resumed from 16th September (vide page 1240), on motion by Mr . KELLYThat this Bill be now read a second time.",20
121,Mr FISHER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"Wide Bay) [3.19] - I agree with the statement made yesterday way of by the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs that no more important matter could be dealt with by this House than that of the franchise, and especially the franchise of a country which is ruled on a democratic basis, and controlled by responsible government. The speech delivered by the honourable gentleman was, however, .singularly free from evidence of any abuse of the rights and privileges of the electors during the last general election. before and after that election, Liberal organization, and many supporters, echoed and re-echoed out Australia the cry-and, statement was made where it could be heard overseas-that the conduct of the election was immoral and wicked. suggestion was made that a large number of the electors of Australia were so immoral aud so corrupt that they had voted more than once. The Minister of Home Affairs, in moving the Second reading of this Bill yesterday, ever, had not a tittle of evidence, nor did he make even a suggestion, that there was any ground for such an assertion. He was content to say that Ministers were going to extend the franchise. orable members will search through this Bill for any indication of au extension. They will find alterations of the law, and proposals to embarrass the electors in every way, but little else. Minister actually had the audacity to say that the Goverument had not changed their attitude since they first made allegations regarding the conduct of the elections. He said that the Opposition had not made any complaint until after the investigations had taken place. orable gentleman is entirely wrong. cannot believe that he wilfully desired to mislead cue public. . But, as a matter of fact, immediately after Parliament ou the very first day, when the allegations were still ringing in our ears, and members of the Government porting them, I said in my place, speaking for the Opposition, that I believed there was not a tittle of evidence in support of tliose allegations, and that, as far as I was concerned, I believed that the people of Australia were the most honest and upright people in the world in the matter of electoral conduct. vation can be found recorded in Hansard, and ought to be known to the It was thought that the General wanted an investigation, immediately accepted the We also had a desire for an Some of my friends thought that the Government had exceeded their public in announcing that an investigation be made before they had met after being constituted as a But many of us felt-I, afc any rate, felt Ur. Fisher. strongly, as a result of a long public life in Australia-that there was ample reason Both for trusting in the sound common sense every and honesty of our people. I therefore conLiberal sidered that these allegations demanded through- the most serious investigation, and that indeed, the the completest evidence should be brought forth. What is the position now ? There is not a single suggestion that anything The was wrong at the elections. According to public statements made, there were thousands of duplications in one electorate. It was alleged that at Ballarat Assistant the cemetery gates had opened, and the dead had voted, and voted more than once. We hear nothing of that kind now. howThe investigations that have taken place, both publicly and privately, have demonstrated that there was less duplication in Ballarat than anywhere else. There was only one case amongst 33,000 voters; and But hon- I understand that there is reason to bein vain lieve, according to the reports of those who know most about that individual, that he is not likely to belong to the Opposition party. Even, however, if we The take our half-share of that one case, surely the whole people of Australia are not to be condemned because one person in 33,000 in one electorate committed an offence.",20
122,Mr WEBSTEK,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"He may have made a The hon- mistake. I Mr FISHER - I am taking the most extreme view when I say "" he may have committed an offence.""

Minister. Attorney- Mr W . H .

Parliament, There can be no analogy between the ofGovernment. fences committed by those persons and offences under our Electoral Act . If that be the evidence on which the Government wisli to alter the whole basis of our electoral law, I can only express my conviction that the people of Australia will not be willing that this Parliament shall do what the Government desire it to do. As regards the question of the amount of duplication which took place, and the number of fraudulent votes that were given, I should like to ask the M i nister whether he has any evidence to give us now, while this debate is proceeding, regarding the conduct of the investigations from the time when they were in augurated until the present time? have been unable to find an official statement to justify any of the allegations made by the Minister himself. This is a matter upon which there ought to be no holding back of information by the Government. It is a matter that ought to be dealt with in the fairest and most open way. It is not even a party question.",21
123,Mr KELLY,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,H as any information been withheld from the honourable member?,22
124,Mr FISHER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"If no information has been withheld, evidently there is none to give.",22
125,Mr KELLY,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,We have given all thab. the Opposition have asked for.,22
126,Mr FISHER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"I understood from statements made by the Minister in answer to questions, and from statements made by other Ministers, that this Government were determined to make the fullest possible investigation into duplicate voting. Have they done so? They have had ample time. Is it true that they have employed private detectives in some electorates and have discovered nothing? We know that it is true that they have had a legal investigation under the superintendence of scrutineers, and discovered nothing by that method. Not only did they discover nothing sensational, but they discovered nothing in the nature of evidence against the honesty of the ordinary voter. If there is other evidence, I hope that it will be forthcoming.",22
127,Mr FENTON,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,The Government acted on the instruction of the leagues outside.,22
128,Mr FISHER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"I do not care what they acted on. I speak for this side of the. House when I say that the more complete the investigation is the better we shall be pleased. This House ought to be given the whole of the evidence upon vvhich the Government rely to justify this proposed alteration of the law. This matter of electoral irregularities was used as a political cry. It was aimed at the Opposition. Unfortunately, it has in jured the good name of Australia outside this country. The Government are responsible for that ; but their tactics are not different from those of the so-called Liberal party in this House since the present Parliament first met. Thoy were always denouncing the people of Australia, decrying the White Australia policy, and our social reforms for the amelioration of the conditions of the struggling masses. These tactics not I now being available to them, they raise the cry that the electors are not to be trusted.",22
129,Mr KELLY,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,Does not my right honourable friend say that the electors are not to be trusted with the postal vote?,22
130,Mr FISHER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"I have always held that, whenever it is possible to increase the facilities for voting, it should be done.",22
131,Mr FENTON,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,When it can be done with safety.,22
132,Mr FISHER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,Yes .,22
133,Mr KELLY,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,Why is it not safe to in trust the people with the right to vote by post?,22
134,Mr FISHER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,Because evidence shows that the postal system of voting lends itself to the worse f r a u d and deceit.,22
135,Mr KELLY,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,I gave the full record of the Commonwealth cases yesterday.,22
136,Mr FENTON,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,The Honorary Minister left out the most serious.,22
137,Mr FISHER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,The honourable gentleman gave a few Commonwealth cases.,22
138,Mr KELLY,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"E very case, according to the Chief Electoral Officer.",22
139,Mr FISHER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,Posta l voting has been in operation in the States as well as in the Commonwealth - One of the States has abandoned it because it was found to be absolutely subversive of individual freedom.,22
140,Mr BENNETT,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,Is it not being reintroduced by that State?,22
141,Mr FISHER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"I shall come to that. Queensland abandoned postal voting because, in the opinion of a Liberal Ministry, it was impossible to get the true record of the postal voter's views.",22
142,Mr KELLY,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,W as the Queensland Act identical with what we propose?,22
143,Mr FISHER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"Practically . This is what was said by a Queensland Minister in 1905, when it was proposed to abolish postal voting. The Hon. P. Airey, Home Secretary, speaking in the Parliament, saidtie must emphasize his previously expressed opinion that the introduction of justices of the peace into this particular provision might possibly lead to a great deal of mischief. might do a great deal in the way of vitiating the validity of elections. In August, 1907, speaking on the second reading of the Elections Act Amendment Bill , which wiped out the postal vote in Queensland, the Home Secretary, Mr . Hawthorn , referring to the previous elections, saidNo less than 1,302 postal votes ne\er reached the returning officers, with the result that these 1,302 voters lost their votes.",22
144,The PREMIER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN," They were lost because they voted for the wrong man. That was the o p in i o n of the Mr H a w t h o r n also said There were cases where justices of the peace were going round where there were two candidates contesting an election. We will say the candidates were Thompson and Williams. They were not supposed to know how the paper was going to be signed, but they were asked if Thompson spelt his name with a "" p."" A very innocent way in which represenwere tatives of political organizations could law. discover how an elector was going to vote.",23
145,Mr BURNS,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,They used to carry blotthat ting paper.,23
146,Mr FISHER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"M a n y of them practhe tically carried a bludgeon, saying, effect, to the wives and daughters of employees, "" Your bread and butter depend upon the way in which you vote."" Mr . Cowap, who is not a Labour man, saidThey told the women of Mount Morgan to be very careful how they spelt the name.",23
147,Mr HAWTHORN,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"Some carried round a piece of blotting paper, which they handed to the voter when she was signing the voting-paper. . . . They would see the name of the candidate voted for on the blotting paper. Mr Kidston, speaking on the Sth August, 1907, said If we continue our Elections Act with this blemish in it, we abolish the protection of the ballot so far as women are concerned, and certainly so far as the majority of women are concerned. There are plenty of women in such a position that they can protect themselves. . . . But there are a large number of women who are not in that happy position, and it is chiefly for the protection of them that it is sought to remove this blemish from our Act without any delay.",23
148,Mr BRUCE SMITH,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"When honourable gentleman f o u n d that there was a good deal of f r a u d in connection Queensland with the Maternity Allowance, he did not propose to abolish the allowance.",23
149,Mr FISHER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"We discovered that there was very little f r a u d in connection with the Maternity Allowance; so little It that it is the marvel of the time, though undoubtedly some persons are prepared to act criminally in connection with it to gain a pecuniary advantage. I hope thab no Government will propose the abolition of the Maternity Allowance because some persons may act criminally in connection with it . It must be remembered that the misuse of the right to vote by post really deprives electors of the privilege of exercising that right, and, indeed, puts themi in a much worse position than if they had not the right, because it permits them Premier. to be victimized unless they vote for certain candidates. On the other hand, the persons entitled to the Maternity Allowance cannot be injured by anything fraudulent that may be done by other persons.",23
150,Mr SAMPSON,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,Is there any parallel between the Queensland and Commonwealth postal voting systems? There no safeguards i u the Queensland,23
151,Mr FISHER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"If the proposals of this Government are likely to pass, I hope the honourable member will assist me in imposing the safeguards that exist in Queensland Act . Mr Kidston, speaki n ing on the 29th August, 1907, saidWhen they tampered with the secrecy of the ballot they struck at the vitals of Democracy. Since he came to Queensland he had seen mere men frightened to vote than ever he saw in the Old Countiy, when the electors voted openly. He had seen the most contemptible expedients resorted to to influence votes in Queensland. If members . . . wanted to do their duty to Queensland they would strike out the postal vote root and branch. He defied honourable members to show how they could give a postal vote and not open the door to a wholesale interference with the secrecy of the ballot. The great objection to that vote was lhat when an elector took his ballot-paper to some place away from scrutineers and the returning officer, political agents . . . and employers' agents would be after him to see he voted in the right way^ Whenever they allowed a man to vote outside the ballot box they destroyed the secrecy of ihe ballot. Honourable members will notice how eager Ministers are to have voting done away from the polling booths. How eager they are to get as many persons as possible to vote in their own homes, surrounded by the right Liberal and influential ladies and gentlemen willing to assist in the process of voting. The Democratic principle always Las been that voting should be done at the ballot-box, in the presence of responsible officials, and of the scrutineers of the candidates, not behind the scenes, where influence can be brought to bear. I have been asked what are the provisions of the Queensland law at the present time. Let me read one or two of them. The Queensland Elections Act 1913 provides that 1. Any elector residing within the electoral district, and at least 5 miles by railway or by the nearest practicable road from the nearest polling place appointed for the district for which such elector is enrolled; or 2. Who by reason of age, infirmity, or health will be unable on polling day to attend at a polling place to vote; or j . Who believes that on polling day he will be absent from the electoral district for which he is enrolled, and will not be within a distance of 50 miles by railway or by the nearest practicable road from any polling place appointed for such district, may, after the issue of the writ for the election and before polling day, apply to the Returning Officer for a postal vote certificate. In the case of a sick or infirm elector, however, the application must be attested by a duly qualified medical practitioner or by a qualified nurse, who is in attendance on such elector. Further, no candidate, or agent of a candidate, or agent of an organization, is permitted to attest, or take charge of, or post, any envelope containing a postal vote. Severe penalties are imposed for non-compliance with this provision.",23
152,Mr SAMPSON,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"It is a postal vote all the same. Mr FISHEE , - I did not say that it was not a postal vote, and I have never said that it is not the duty of Parliament to make it possible for the sick and in firm to register their votes. But it must be done in such a way as to allow them to be perfectly free to vote just as they may desire and not as some other person may wish them to vote. Honourable members will search in vain for any utterance of mine to the contrary. I had always been a strong advocate of the postal vote. I was however compelled, on the evidence adduced, to conclude that the postal vote was more mischievous than beneficial, and it was with reluctance that I consented to its abolition. One would have thought that, because of the action of the late Government in bringing about the repeal of the postal vote, the number of electors who voted at the last election would have been considerably reduced. The Assistant Minister of Home Affairs told us yesterday that, because this privilege had beeu withdrawn, no fewer than 77,000 electors had been prohibited from voting at the last elections. What are the facts? At the elections held in 1903, 46.86 per cent, of the electors upon the roll voted; in 1906 the percentage had risen Â£0 50.21; in 1910, it had increased to 62.16; and at the last election it had still further in creased to 73.66. There was a larger increase in the number of votes recorded at the last election as compared with the previous election than is to be found in a comparison between any two precedi l l - ing .elections. Indeed, the percentage of those enrolled who voted at the elections during the present year was nearly double that of tliose who voted in 1903.",24
153,Mr BRUCE SMITH,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"Has the honourable member the number of males and females who voted, because the voting power of women has enormously increased?",24
154,Mr FISHER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,Goo d luck to them.,24
155,Mr BRUCE SMITH,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,I say the same. But can the honourable member say whether the increase in voting power has not been more in the case of women than in the case of men?,24
156,Mr FISHER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"I think that the percentage of increase has been about the same in the case of women as in the case of men; but, of course, I am speaking entirely from memory. I am very anxious that all women who are entitled to vote should exercise the franchise. This is a matter of greater importance than that a particular political party should benefit by it . In dealing with this question yesterday, the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs skipped very lightly over the fact that, under this Bill , it will be necessary to ask each elector to sign the butt of his or her ballot-paper on polling day. I believe that that is an absolutely impracticable, proposition. I believe that it is entirely unnecessary. The point which the Honorary Minister endeavoured to make was that this proposal would assist in the identification of the voter. To my mind that point was of little value. So far as the cry raised by the Government is concerned, this proposal does not touch it at all. It will not help to identify the voter in any way. It may be of value in identifying the vote",24
157,Mr KELLY,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,That is all that was suggested.,24
158,Mr FISHER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"B y his remarks the Honorary Minister conveyed more than that to most honourable members. However, I think he merely intended to say that the signing of the but t would enable the vote to be identified. The identification of the vote, however, will be established by the number which appears on the other part of the butt, and not by the signature.",24
159,Mr KELLY,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,Whether a man who represents himself as Tom Jones is really Tom Jones will be discovered by comparing the signature on the butt.,25
160,Mr FISHER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,That remark is based on the assumption that the person who wishes to impersonate will sign himself as Tom Jones.,25
161,Mr KELLY,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"If he is impersonating Tom Jones, will he not sign the name Tom Jones? The writing could then be compared.",25
162,Mr FISHER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"How can the writing of a false hand be compared ? Unless the person himself, and not the vote, can be identified, how can Bill Sikes be identified as Tom Jones?",25
163,Mr KELLY,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"But when it has been found out that a man has falsely signed a name his vote can be traced, and cast out.",25
164,Mr FISHER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"I admitted that at once. But the Honorary Minister went further, and said that the signature would enable us to identify the voter. I say that it will not. Can the Government tell me of any country in the world in which this system prevails? I shall be very glad if the Honorary Minister can give me that information.",25
165,Mr KELLY,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,There is a more rigid provision in operation in the United Kingdom.,25
166,Mr FISHER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,The system in operation in the United Kingdom is not more rigid. There is no signing of names required there.,25
167,Mr KELLY,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,But the ballot-paper which the voter gets is numbered with his number on the register.,25
168,Mr FISHER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,And the proposal of the Government is that there shall be a number on the ballot-paper in addition to the signature.,25
169,Mr KELLY,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,We can do without all this if we restrict the facilities for voting and have only one polling booth for a subdivision.,25
170,Mr FISHER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,That would suit the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs.,25
171,Mr KELLY,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,It would not; and that why we are submitting this proposal.,25
172,Mr FISHER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"We require to be given more information than we were given yesterday, although that was not entirely the fault of the Minister. Whether there are few or many polling booths does not affect this question one iota. The fewer the polling booths the more difficult will it be to identify the voters. Where only a small number of persons vote at a polling place, almost every elector knows every other elector, so that impersonation is difficult. This proposal is a bastard one, which has been attached to a provision that obtains in Canada. There they have a system in book form, with duplicate butts and a counterfoil attached to the ballot-paper. Upon the counterfoi l is placed a distinguishing number and the initials of the Returning Officer. That is held until the ballot-paper which the elector has marked is brought back to the ballot-box and the initials and number are compared. The ballot-paper is then put into the box. The presiding officer thereupon takes the counterfoil which he has initialed and tears it up in the presence of the elector. In a poll-book a poll clerk keeps a record of the elector's distinguishing number and the fact that he has voted. That is not what is proposed here. I am convinced that the proposition is ill considered, that it is not protective, and that it will not discover the fraudulent voter or impersonator. Under such a system one can imagine an election continuing for a week. It is no reflection on people to say that they very much dislike signing their names when going to the ballot. Quite a number of electors find themselves very excited when they go to vote, and as a result they make errors. The idea of handing out a but t and requiring every voter, in the presence of the Returning Officer, to sign it ! Why, the signing of it would probably occupy two or three minutes in most cases, and certainly one minute in the quickest case. What is to be done in the meantime? Everybody else will be kept waiting. Tho result will be that we shall require very many more presiding officers and considerably more polling places. In a big centre, one Divisional Returning Oflicer is fa r more competent to manage twenty presiding officers than each presiding officer is competent to manage a separate polling place. Therefore, under this proposal, large polling places would requireis to be established in big centres. Upon that ground alone I hope that the Government will not proceed on the lines which have been indicated. There is another matter upon which the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs enlarged, and in regard to which I entirely disagree with him. The Bill provides for the abolition of the 5s. deposit which is required to accompany objections to the presence of any name upon the roll. I can remember the time in my own State when it was necessary to have some protection against the elimination of names from the electoral rolls.",25
173,Mr KELLY,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,We have very great protection under this Bill .,26
174,Mr FISHER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"The proposal of the Government is one to enable interested parties and organizations to give information to the officials, so that they may, on that information, strike the names of persons off the roll. In theory, that may seem admirable and useful, but in practice it has worked disastrously to the toiling masses. The honourable member for Maranoa knows very well that this system was used prior to 1892, and up to 1896, in such a way as to disfranchise whole electorates; and, because of that, the electorates were wrongly represented for years and years. Even a distinguished member of Parliament, and a justice of the peace-w e had possession of his original letter-sen t word to all the justices of the peace and Electoral Registrars in his own district to take care to purge the roll of Labour voters. There was no deposit of 5s. required at that time; it was enough to make the suggestion that the purging should be done. It could not be done very well by this man, rich as he was, by means of a deposit of 5s., because they were dealing with Labour voters, not by hundreds, but by thousands. it suggested by the Minister, or the M in istry, that the officers of the Electoral Department will not take advice fro m ordinary persons regarding persons who have l e ft a district, and so on ? They can get all the information they want without the 5s. If a deposit of 5s. is made, it simply means. that if a person wishes to make a specific objection against a person who he believes is not entitled to be on the roll, he can do so, and if he is right he can get the money back.",26
175,Mr KELLY,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,In one place which was brought under my notice recently- I forget the name-the presiding officer re' fused point-blank to accept any specific suggestions of that k in d ; he wanted 5s.,26
176,Mr FISHER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"Honourable members have now obtained the strength of this proposal! It is that the Minister has heard about one person who, at some time or other, refused to take the statement of another person.",26
177,Mr KELLY,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,That only came to my ears very recently. I was merely showing that your statement is not correct.,26
178,Mr FISHER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,Surely honourable members will not admit that that is sufficient evidence to make a fundamental alteration of the law! The suggestion is,26
179,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,We ought not to do as you did with the postal vote.,26
180,Mr KELLY,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,This alteration is the suggestion of the Electoral Office.,26
181,Mr FISHER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,The Prime Minister in tervenes at a convenient time with his usual red herring.,26
182,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,It is no red herring. That is exactly why you abolished the postal vote.,26
183,Mr KELLY,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"I pointed out yesterday that, so fa r as these particular provisions are concerned, they have the concurrence of the Electoral Office, and are designed to facilitate the work of that office.",26
184,Mr FISHER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"I am glad to hear t h at statement repeated, though I can assure the Minister that it was quite unnecessary. There was nothing he emphasized so much yesterday as that these proposals have the official sanction of the permanent officers. Few Governments, to my knowledge, have leant so much on the permanent officials as the present Government are doing. Either this is a matter of policy, or it is nothing at all. Why should the Ministry draw the permanent officials into the discussion ? W hy do they shelter themselves behind men who canIs not speak ' n self defence here?",26
185,Mr KELLY,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,Surely it is an administrative matter!,26
186,Mr FISHER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"We had to listen to the Minister repeating that statement over and over again. If this is an official Bill , let the officials come in at the Bar and look after it , instead of the Minister.",26
187,Mr KELLY,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"T a k in g the whole Bill as an officials' Bill , different proposed sections deal with partly policy and partly administrative reform.",26
188,Mr FISHER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,Exactly .,26
189,Mr SPEAKER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"Order ! It is almost impossible for me to hear the honourable member for Wide Bay on account of the continuous flow of interjections, and in terruptions, and also conversations across the chamber. The honourable member is entitled to make his speech without such interruptions.",26
190,Mr FISHER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"Unfortunately , sir, I have scarcely any voice lef t to discuss the Bill . The Minister now tells me that it is only part of the Bill that the officials have had to do with. Eveu that statement is quite unsatisfactory.",27
191,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,Do you view that you should not consult an official in the preparation of a machine?,27
192,Mr FISHER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"Yes . I think that any sensible Ministry will consult the permanent head, and every other person who can aid them in drafting any legislation.",27
193,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,I should thin k so.,27
194,Mr FISHER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"H a v in g done that, it is the Ministry's Bill ; and represents the Ministry's policy; they should not shelter themselves behind any officials, nor must they expose officials to the fire of party politics if they are straightforward and manly.",27
195,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,Who is doing^ that?,27
196,Mr FISHER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,The Prime Minister is evidently not hearing.,27
197,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,I am hearing.,27
198,Mr FISHER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"Not only did the Honorary Minister repeat that statement over and over yesterday, but he interrupted me to repeat it today.",27
199,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,And I am going to repeat it again.,27
200,Mr SPEAKER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,Order !,27
201,Mr ANSTEY,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"Mr Speaker, may I ask you a question ?",27
202,Mr SPEAKER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,Order ! This is not question time.,27
203,Mr ANSTEY,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,Has the Prime Minister a special privilege to interject here ?,27
204,Mr SPEAKER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,Order !,27
205,Mr FISHER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"The Honorary Minister interrupted me to repeat the statement either to show that permanent officials are behind the Ministry in this matter, or that the Ministry are behind the permanent officials. There is no getting away from that. What is the purpose in purging the rolls? Is it to get a clean roll?",27
206,Mr KELLY,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"He a r , hear!",27
207,Mr FISHER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"Has there been any evidence forthcoming as to the existence of an unclean roll ? We have had figures galore, but no evidence of any duplication except that which is essential to enable everybody to be on the roll. When you are nearing an election-in deed, at any time-if you intend to have every person on the roll, under our systhem. tem, there must be duplications. In no country do people travel more from one part to the other than is done in Australia, and it is a good thing for Australia that it is done. Tliose who sit still in one place can always be sure of having the franchise; but those who remove from place to place will experience great difficulty in exercising the franchise unless take the the existing system is continued. We are making a rule which, I hope, will last as long as we have a franchise Act, and that is that the name of a person shall not be removed from the roll of a division until it has been enrolled effectively in another division, and that a person, though he travels from one part of Australia to another, following his occupation, and helping to produce the wealth of his country, shall remain a citizen, and be entitled to exercise the franchise. Is the Ministry against that ideal? There must be duplication. In no country in the world, not even in America, is the nomadic portion of the community more numerous than in Australia. And that principle must continue to prevail if we want to protect tliese persons. A great deal has been made-and quite properly made, if the statement is correct;-of about 77,000 persons being disfranchised because of in firmity and sickness. I believe that that number is excessive. As regards maternity disability, I think there is a large term involved there, probably over two months, while as regards the other cases of sickness, I can get no statistics from those in authority to bear out the allegation. Suppose that that is so, what is the proposal of the Government on the other hand ? What do they propose to do regarding the 10,000 young Australians who become twenty-one years of age more than a month before the issue of the writs, and whose names are not on the roll before the issue of the writs? The Government are going to deprive these young persons of a vote, although they say they are desirous of every one having a vote. Could inconsistency go further than to have the youth of Australia, who are looking forward to the opportunity of casting their first vote, in all probability deprived of that opportunity for three years and one month by the act of a Government who say they desire to see every one taking part in the elections? This Bill bristles with inconsistencies.",27
208,Mr WEST,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,That is good; give it to ,27
209,Mr FISHER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"They give it to themselves. That is exactly what they state; this is their own measure, after great and careful deliberation. The Bill contains many minor points, which, of course, are worth considering, and which I should like to deal with. There is quite a number of references which I should be very pleased to put before the House; but it cannot be agreeable to honourable members fco listen to my voice, and the use of it is certainly not very pleasant to myself. As regards the postal vote, that is another weakness, and one which cannot be eliminated by any system which might be passed through the House. I refer again to the 15 per cent, of postal votes that were never returned at the 1910 elections. In our own experience, and in the experience of Queensland, generally, these are probably votes given to persons who take charge of them, and destroy them for particular reasons. that the Ministry are honestly desirous of protecting these votes in every possible way once they have been recorded by the electors. But I am apprehensive that we shall never be able to satisfactorily get a larger vote from the persons who are absent from the ballot-box in a proper voting place. A u d it is for these reasons, I think, that the Government, in their efforts to give these facilities to the sick and the infirm, have failed to carry out their own wishes, and certainly the wishes of the Opposition. We are desirous that every person shall have a vote, and that every facility shall be given for voting. I think I am speaking for the whole of the Opposition when I say that, while we believe that there have been abuses of the postal vote, if any system can be devised that would euable the infirm and the sick to record a vote, we should be glad to cooperate to do so; but this proposal is certainly not one of those which can commend themselves to us. Generally speaking, I think that the Bill fails to do anything to the electoral system which is beneficial. I believe that it is not conceived in the best spirit of a democratic government. Its effect will be restrictive, altliough its purport, according to the Ministry, is progressive and extensive. The measure will not extend the franchise to any persons who do not now enjoy it , and, in my opinion, it represents a weakening rather than a strengthening of the principle of democratic representation. For those reasons I cannot promise the Government to support the Bill .",28

I also regret that the insult ; Bill contains provisions which were eliminated from the Electoral Act last session.

This House might deal such subjects as the federalization, of our State debts, the strengthening of our Defence Forces, the building up of our Navy, and the nationalization of the l - Atlantic cable. These are some of the in - questions with which the Government deal at the present stage. The Government, however, are attempting to radical alterations in an Act that received the support of a substantial was majority of the members of both Houses of the Parliament returned at the election it previous to the last general election. pursue At the last general election, some of the matters with which this Bill were the subject of a great deal of controversy, and, taking the membership of the two Houses, we find that more were returned in favour of the of principles which I have in mind than we had supporting them in the last Par",30

258,Mr THOMAS,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"At the last general election, there were more members reI turned in favour of the principles that I have in mind than there were in the last Parliament. In the last Parliament, we had in this House forty-two members of the Labour party, including the two Independents, as against thirty-three members of the Liberal party, whilst in the Senate there were twenty-two members of the Labour party and fourteen members of the Liberal party. Taking the two Houses together, we thus had sixty-four members of our party and forty-seven Liberals.",30
259,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,Is that why honourable members are playing up?,31
260,Mr THOMAS,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"I did not interject when the honourable member was speaking. In the present House, there are thirty-seven members of the Labour party aud thirty-eight Liberals, but in the Senate there are twenty-nine members of our party, and only seven members of the Liberal party.",31
261,Mr ATKINSON,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,But eighteen senators did not face the constituencies at the last general election.,31
262,Mr THOMAS,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"I am quite prepared to deal only with those who sought re-election, and I would remind the honourable member that the Labour party won the larger number of seats. The point which I wish to emphasize is that we now have in this Parliament a larger number of members in favour of certain amendments made two years ago in the Electoral Act than we had at that time. I am referring more particularly to two or three provisions which the Government are trying to remove from the principal Act, and one which they desire to put back. Dealing with this question, we must have regard to the Constitution as it stands, remembering that the two Houses are elected by the people, and have equal co-ordinate powers except in matters of finance. I have always objected to a Legislature consisting of more than one House. I voted against the Federal referendum in New South Wales on both occasions because the Constitution Bill provided for the bicameral system. It seems to me, however, that having been defeated, those of us who at that time advocated a National Parliament of only one House must, in common with the people of Australia as a whole, work within the sphere of the Constitution which the people of the Commonwealth have seen fit to adopt. In speaking thus, I am not taking up a new position. We had some difficulty between the House of Representatives and the Senate in the very first Parliament, a certain degree of friction and a substantial difference of opinion arising between the two Houses concerning a very important point. I then took up the position that I am now adopting, urging that the people of Australia, having decided upon the bicameral system of legislation, it was our duty to work within the Constitution as it stood. Looking up the debate which then took place, in order to refresh my memory, I found that the present Prime Minister took part in it. I cannot say that he was influenced by any opinions that I had expressed. He spoke shortly after I had addressed the House, and used practically the words that I had uttered, although he spoke with a great deal more power, and with a brilliancy which I do not possess. He said-and his words are applicable to the present situationI f a crisis were to occur, and I went to the people of New South Wales and said that I objected to what the Senate had done in regard to the Tariff, they would turn around and say, "" We want the Senate to do precisely as it is doing."" Then I might retort, "" But look at the danger that is involved to the Constitution."" They would then say, "" We had all those dangers pointed out to us before the referendum was taken. We knew all about them then, and now that the Senate is in favour of our view with regard to the Tariff, we ask you and others to work the Constitution as you find it until it is altered in a constitutional way."" That was in 1903, and today I take up the same stand. I do not say for one moment that if the Government of the day hold strong views on a certain matter, they ought not to submit them to the Parliament, although they may know for a certainty that the Senate will not adopt them. I claim, however, that it is not wise for a Government to adopt such a course unless it deliberately desires to waste the session. It is not wise to introduce a measure of this kind, containing provisions that must inevitably be rejected by the Senate, seeing that that House-whic h is not a nominee Chamber - ha s just returned from the country aa we have done",31
263,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,And the Labour party's candidates polled a minority of votes.,31
264,Mr THOMAS,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"I doubt whether that is so; but if it will please the honourable member, I will give him that point.",31
265,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"It is a fact. It is not a matter of "" giving."" ' Mr THOMAS - In the last Parliament, twenty-two out of thirty-six members of the Senate belonged to our party; today we have twenty-nine out of thirty six. Is it reasonable, therefore, to suppose for one moment that those honourable members, having just returned from an appeal to the people, would necessarily go back upon that which they did two years ago 'f Although, at the last general election, our party lost some of its strength in this House, we gained, so far as the Senate was concerned. The ranks of those who, in both Houses two years ago, took up a certain stand regarding the electoral law have been strengthened.",31
266,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,Does that mean that the Labour party do not intend to let us put this Bill through ?,32
267,Mr THOMAS,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"I do not say anything of the kind. But I do say that it is unwise for the Government to do what they are doing just now, in view of the fact that there are quite a number of other matters with which they could deal. If the Government desire to force an election-if they feel that the time has come when they should appeal from a halting Parliament to an awakened - people-wel l and good. But let us understand the position. No one can imagine for a moment that the Government seriously anticipate that they are likely to succeed in carrying two or three of the provisions of this Bill . I quite admit that there are in the Act some provisions which it would be wise to amend. I agree with the Prime Minister that the Act itself is not perfect. Nothing that comes from the human mind can possibly be perfect; and, however good an Electoral Act may be, after it has run the gantlet of a general election it is usually found to contain provisions that might justifiably be altered. That, however, is quite a different matter from - the attitude of the Government with regard to two or three matters which have been made vital, to a very great extent, by one of the parties in this House, in view of the fact that, in the two Houses, we have today a bigger majority in favour of them than existed two years ago. I do not propose to deal with the whole of the clauses in this measure, for I recognise that we shall have, in Committee, a good deal of time to consider them. One of the provisions of this B i ll does away with the requirement of the present Act that, during an election campaign, political articles published in newspapers shall have attached to them the names of the writers. understand that the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs, in introducing this Bill , said that what was done in this regard two years ago was an interference with the liberty and freedom of the press. We are not opposed to the liberty of the press. We are opposed to the licence of the press. But, whilst we believe in the freedom of the press, we say that there is something even more important, and that is truth . We are anxious that, as far as possible, the press of Australia shall be a truth f u l press.",32
268,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,Does the honourable member think that the signing of articles will alter the tone of them ?,32
269,Mr THOMAS,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"I intend to elaborate my argument somewhat on that line. There is no doubt that the press of Australia, in common with the press of the world generally, has, during the past few years, undergone a serious change. There was a time when the press did stand for freedom; when it did stand for the privileges of the poor; when it did stand for the disinherited. But that time has passed. Editors, proprietors, general managers, and those responsible for the conduct of the press- I am not referring so much to the provincial press as to the metropolitan-hav e become wealthy people or corporations. Consequently, they are not today so much inclined to advocate the cause of the defenceless poor,- or to champion the oppressed. I was speaking a few years ago to a very prominent editor of one of our great metropolitan newspapers. He is well known to quite a number of honourable members as editor of one of our fighting journals. I said to him, "" Is it not a fact that people do not read leading articles today as once they did, and that leading articles do not influence public opinion as they used to do ? But is it not also a fact that, nevertheless, the press has greater influence over the popular mind than it once had?"" He said, '' Yes, that is so; you are correct in both suppositions. I do not believe that people do read leading articles as they did once, but, nevertheless, the press is more powerf u l than it was. I will give you my reasons. When I was young, and became a reporter on the press, it was my duty simply to report a meeting to which I was sent. No one on the paper was allowed to have any politics except the I editor. The politics of the paper were expounded by the leader-writers; but no one else was permitted to allow his political opinions to appear in his work. When we were sent to report a meeting, we were expected to report the facts, and nothing but the facts. But times have changed. Every person on a newspaper nowadays has"" to write up to the leading articles. The consequence is that it does not matter what part of a paper you are reading, you must come under the influence of the policy espoused by it . "" The tone of the press has absolutely altered. I am much indebted to a useful little book entitled The Newspaper, written by Mr G. B. Dibblee, who is an M.A., and a late fellow of All Souls' College, Oxford. The book is published as one of the volumes of the "" Home University Library."" The author says The newspaper is primarily a collector and distributer of news, and in this function has long ago beaten every possible rival out of the field. Secondarily, it is a vehicle of opinion, and in the virtue of this capacity it often becomes the prey of the mighty or the victim of the long purse. I think there can be no question that the newspaper has become ' ' the prey of the mighty,"" and ""the victim of the long purse."" This writer has an extremely interesting chapter discussing whether articles should be signed or not. He states that in France and Italy all articles have to be signed, and his opinion is that the outcome is that the standard of literary excellence is higher than is the case in countries where articles are not signed.  political articles only.",32
270,Mr THOMAS,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"I am glad that the honourable member has mentioned that, because, as I said when speaking on the motion of censure, I am of opinion that every article published in a newspaper ought to be signed. So far from beiug willing to remove this restriction, if it be a restriction, I should like to see it extended to every article. In dealing witli the question of signed articles, and referring to the press of Great Britain, Mr Dibblee saysIn the United Kingdom the prevailing, practice has followed another course. journalism has been found in the end to be a more powerful political weapon, partly because reverence attaches itself more easily to the unknown, and also because the shelter of corporate responsibility adds somewhat to the freedom of writing, and very much to the fertility of invention. We do not wish to interfere with the liberty of the press, but we do say that the influence which the press exerts over public opinion ought not to be the result of a ""reverence for the unknown,"" but ought to follow from the weight attached by the reader to the opinion of a writer whose name he knows. Another objection to the non-signing of articles is, as the author says, that it gives to those who are writing an opportunity for "" fertility of invention.""",33
271,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,Does he state any of the advantages arising from unsigned articles ?,33
272,Mr THOMAS,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"There are some advantages, and the author states them. The honourable member may read the book for himself. One advantage of unsigned articles is that it affords au opportunity for a mediocre writer to get behind the reputation of a great newspaper. Brilliant men, this author says, prefer to have nothing to do with journals in which articles are not signed. They prefer to attach their names to what they write.  have no brilliant men writing for the papers here.",33
273,Mr THOMAS,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"I mentioned just now that the editor of one of the great journals of Australia told me that nowadays every reporter had to write up to the leading articles, whereas, when he was a youth, a reporter was expected to report a meeting exactly as it took place. I remember an occasion a few years ago when a meeting was held at the Protestant Hall, Sydney. It was addressed by Sir William Lyne, and the main subject of discussion was Protection. If honourable members want an illustration of the truth of what I have been saying, let them compare the reports of that meeting in the Argus and the Age. Any honourable member who takes the trouble to do that may reasonably ask himself whether it was possible for two such reports to appear unless the reporters were writing up tc the political opinions of the journals which sent them to the meeting.  ber associate his argument with the reAnonymous porter of a meeting; in other words, does he suggest that the reporter does not want to report faithfully?",33
274,Mr THOMAS,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"T simply say that if the reporter had to sign his name to the report he would be much more careful about his work. I have no hesitation in saying that, in the majority of cases, if the name of the reporter appeared in connection with his report, reports would, in very many instances, be different from what they are today.  ence, at any rate.",33
275,Mr THOMAS,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"I desire also .to read an extract from Mr Dibblee's book in connection with the press of today, because the press of Australia is very similar to the press of England. I may be pardoned for reading this extract, because it bears out the contention of some of us. The author speaks very highly of the English press up to a certain time; but he does not believe that it is maintained at so high a standard today. He refers to the period since the Boer war and the commencement of the Tariff reform agitation, the result of which has been that practically all the principal metropolitan newspapers in Eugland are on the one side. Consequently, according to this account, there is not that regard for impartiality and truth that at one time was maintained by the newspapers. Then there were newspapers writing on each side of the question. But since then in England the greater part of the rich and powerful newspapers have been writing on one side. The author says that the press has lost its high standing to a large extent, because it is not as careful of the truth as it used to be. tinuesThis prevailing misfortune is growing worse daily, and already we have lost the chastening memory of days when impartiality was more strictly maintained in our press as a whole by nn adequate representation of both sides. Society, with a big S, has gone entirely on to o:ie side, and has imposed on its press that most hopeless form of provincialism which already prevails in high circles in Berlin, of merely refusing to recognise as possible the existence culture, good faith, ancl even of common honesty in tbose who do not adopt the opinions prevailing in its own ranks. From this blindness I see no ordinary means of deliverance. Here in Australia the metropolitan newspapers are all on one side. I am not blaming the press for that. It is not their fault that we have not a press on the other side. It is the fault of the workers of Australia, who have not yet come forward in sufficiently large numbers with their pounds and their ten shillings in order to establish a daily press to advocate their own cause.",34
276,Mr HIGGS,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"That ouly emphasizes the departure of the press from the old system, under which the newspapers reported both sides fairly.",34
277,Mr THOMAS,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"That is so. In view of these facts, we have to take every ineans that we possibly can to insure that, as far as possible, a regard for fairness and truth shall be exercised by the press. Personally, I do not care whether the Labour press, or any other press, is affected. The nearer we get to the truth the better it will be for the nation.  papers set an example?",34
278,Mr THOMAS,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"I quite recognise that there are some associated with the Labour press who object to the signing of articles; but that makes no difference, so far as I am concerned. I know, for example, that some of those who are associated with a rather powerful organ connected with my own party are strong on the other side on this question; but that does not influence my opinion. What I want to get is the truth from all sides. I envy no man or party who wins an election by misrepresentation and falsehood. A u y party or candidate that wins by misrepresentation or untruth can only triumph for a time. The triumphs of misrepresentation and falsehood are of a very temporary character. It is the triumphs gained by t r u th that last. There was a time when the liberty, freedom, and greatness of the press were to be exHe con- tolled, when the newspapers advocated great measures of reform, great causes and great principles, and were not merely money-making machines. But that time has passed. It is now true of them to say, as has been saidThere is little distinction now made between newspaper properties and any other, except that their political influence adds some considerable extra value to their market price. In almost of the majority of cases they are owned by limited companies. Their possession does not carry with it the feeling of a public trust; to own one means just so much money and so much power. We know that some years ago it was practically a toss up wliether the Sydney Daily Telegraph should be brought out as a Protectionist or as a Free Trade organ, the directors, by a majority of one, deciding that it should be the latter. They came to that decision, not because they cared particularly about eitlier fiscal policy, but because they wished the newspaper to earn as big dividends as possible, so that tlieir shares might become as valuable as possible; and they thought that more money was to be made by its advocacy of Free Trade. We must deal with things as they are. There are some who think that the signing of newspaper articles is a measure which was first proposed by the Labour party; but that is not so. As the Prime Minister has supported his arguments by references to what happened in the time of Jack Cade, and even of Diocletian, aud as one of his supporters referred to something that occurred in China 900 years ago, I may be allowed to go back to the year 1864, and quote the opinion of one whom even the honourable member for Robertson, if he knows anything of history, will recognise as a great Liberal- I refer to John Bright, oue of England's greatest Liberals and tribunes. During the corn law agitation, the Times assailed both Cobden and Bright very fiercely, publishing leading articles which went beyond what they deemed to be fair criticism. Cobden thereupon demanded that the articles should be signed, and Mr Delane, one of the greatest editors that the Times has had, was forced to sign his name to them. John Bright, dealing with this episode at a meeting held in Birmingham a little while afterwards, said, referring to CobdenHe found a mon in a mask endeavouring to stab me in the back-for he had not seen that the same man had beea in a previous article also stabbing him-and he came forward and dragged his mask from him, and he showed him to the gaze of the whole nation and of the world. And at last, after denial and equivocation of every kind, this unmasked editor of this great journal was obliged to retire from the personal part of this controversy, and to skulk back into his anonymous hiding place, which suited him better. Speaking of persons who did not sign their articles, he said that he was reminded of a politician in New York-perhaps the honourable member for Darwin may know him-wh o had been for some time at the elbow of the correspondent of the TimesJt was said of him that "" he was a just man, and a righteous man, and that he walked uprightly before the world, but when he was not before the world his walk was slantendicular."" It is only fair that the walk of those who write for the newspapers should not be slantendicular. We do not wish to interfere with the freedom or liberty of the press, but we ask that the walk of its writers be upright. It is important that the writers who made incorrect statements should be known. Speaking on the no-confidence amendment, I referred to an article published in the Melbourne Argus, which had been written by Mr. Maling, under instructions from the proprietors, stating that the then Leader of Mr Thomas. the Opposition and present Prime Minister had thrown off some of the Labour views which he held in the past, as one might throw off infantile complaints. I wrote to the newspaper pointing out that the honourable member had stated recently that his views were unchanged, and that it was of serious interest to the country to know the facts of the case. Some years ago the honourable gentleman told the following story: Once upon a time there lived in Dublin a well-to-do man, who was known as Cosy Murphy. He practically went to sleep for seven years. At the end of that time he was twice as wealthy as when he went to sleep. Well, boys, when you discover the secret that enabled Cosy Murphy to grow wealthy whilst sleeping, then you will have solved all Labour troubles, and will be able to get, each man, the full results of his labour. We ought to know whether those are still the Prime Minister's views. According to Mr Maling, the honourable gentleman does not hold those views now, but according to what the Prime Minister himself said, at Lithgow, some twelve months ago, he has not changed his views. Let' me take another incident in which I was personally concerned. When Minister of External Affairs I went to the Northern Territory with a parliamentary party. The original arrangement was that I should leave by train on Sunday, but I changed my plan and left on the Monday. Much to my surprise I read in Monday's Age that on Sunday the train had been kept back, because I had not turned up, that a motor-car had been sent out to find me, that a telephone message had been sent in asking that the train might be stopped, and fchafc a compartment had been reserved for me, and that I had not said that I would not use it. I tried to ascertain what truth there was in these statements, and the stationmaster informed me that .the train had not been kept back for a minute on my account, and I had sent him no telephone message, nor had a motor-car been sent out for me. Something to that effect appeared in the Herald of the same afternoon, but the correspondent of the Daily Telegraph wired to Sydney that what I had stated was nonsense, that the train had been kept back for me, and that three motorcars had gone in search of me. The writer did not sign his name, though I  ways writes a certain column. He knew that his statement was not true, and might not have made it if he had had to sign his article. When I returned from the Territory, I had a chat with him his confrere*, and before starting busiexercise ness I asked whether I had ever done any in j u ry to him personally, either vately or publicly. He said, "" You should not talk in that fashion."" I replied, "" Well, why did you send that statementTake when you knew that it was not true?"" sick or infirm . "" Oh , "" he answered, "" y o u knew i - a joke."" I replied, "" Then you sliould have stated that it was a joke, so that people could understand it in that l i g h If men are to be assailed, let them sailed in the open. When a deputatiou of press representatives- I tliink the orable member for Wimmera was among them-waite d ou me, I spoke on this ject, without mentioning the particular case, and was told that a public man who might be assailed unfairly or unjustly - could appeal to the Courts of Law for chance of knowing. justice. Well, in the affair which I have mentioned, I went to Messrs. Sly and Bussell, than whom there are no more emithat nent solicitors in Sydney, and M was good enough to say that he thought I had a good case, but he added, not advise you to go to law over the matter, because if you win-and you might lose-the other side will appeal. If are lucky enough to win again, they will appeal again, and even if you win on third occasion you will be hundreds of pounds out of pocket."" No doubt, men will write unfairly and unjustly even when articles have to be signed, but man who is assailed by the press by post-ought to be permitted to know the name of his assailant. As honourable members know, it is the intention of Government to re-introduce the postal voting system, if possible. I voted for the abolition of the postal voting system a year or two ago very reluctantly, be-cause I had previously spoken in favour Bright. of the system in this House, and had supported its adoption in the electoral law of New South Wales, but I was forced by the logic of facts to - change my opinion with regard to it . We should endeavour, not merely to secure the insertion of electors' names upon the rolls, but also to provide them with reasonable facilities for voting. I have taken up a stand in opposition to the restoration of the postal vote because it cannot be questioned that that vote interferes with the secrecy of the ballot. Out of every one hundred persons who vote by post, I and venture to say that how ninety of them their franchise is known to canvassers. That remark is not applicable primerely to supporters of the Liberal party, but also to supporters of the Labour party. It is obvious that it must be so. the case of 100 persons who are Ten out of that numt was ber may be anxious to vote, and may take the trouble to get the necessary the papers to enable them to do so. They t . "" may fill in those papers and forward them be asby post in the ordinary way. Nobody may know how they voted. But, in the honother ninety cases, the agents will not bother to secure the requisite papers if subthey do not know how the persons concerned intend to vote. ",34
279,Mr THOMAS,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,I say emphatically that is the position so far as the r . Russell Labour party is concerned.,36
280,Mr SAMPSON,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"Does not that apply to "" I do the whole organization?",36

285,Mr THOMAS,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,The honourable member should be the last to say that.  how the honourable member proposes to enfranchise the sick if he is not in favour of the postal vote?,36
286,Mr THOMAS,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"There is something more important than that a sick person should have a vote. The majority of the people are healthy. If 97 per cent, of the electors can vote by ballot, surely we ought not to undermine a great principle for the sake of the remaining 3 per cent.!",36
287,Mr SAMPSON,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,The postal vote was instituted only to meet special cnses.,37
288,Mr THOMAS,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"I understand that, before he entered this House, the honourable member for Gippsland was a canvasser, aud, therefore, I ask him whether it is not known to agents of political parties how the great majority of sick and infirm persons who vote by post exercise their franchise? In 1867 the Conservative party in England introduced a Bill for the purpose of conferring the franchise upon a large number of persons. At that time Lord Cranbourne, who was afterwards the Marquis of Salisbury, the great Conservative Prime Minister of England, introduced a provision for voting by post. In a very able speech he defended voting by post. The whole of the Liberal Opposition opposed that proposal, and no one more ably than did John Bright himself. In replying to Lord Cranbourne, in the House of Commons, he saidJ am not now' speaking of the sick, because we ought not to make special laws for a comparatively small proportion of the people, and that is why the sick are much better in their rooms and in bed than taking any part whatever in the excitement of a contested election at a time when they are suffering mental and bodily depression. I do not know that I agree with the whole of that statement, but it is only fair to say that when, at the last general elections, voting by post had been abolished, and the ex-Minister of Home Affairs endeavoured to get voting facilities granted at the hospitals throughout Australia, his request, in Victoria and other places, was refused, on the ground that the medical officers considered that the sick ought not to be worried with the affairs of a general election. John Bright went on to sayMy honourable friend, Mr Ayrton, described what would take place with agents. wonderful fertility of invention at and clever agents would busy themselves in the streets of our boroughs, and in some parts of the counties, with a view to obtaining these polling papers. That applies absolutely today. In order to illustrate my point, and to show what agents are prepared to do in the open, I propose to read the following leaflet, which is signed by Archdale Parkhill, who is probably known to honourable membersFEDERAL REFERENDA. The Man on the Land. Some Reasons why You should Vole No. 1. It leads to complete unification, and then the Commonwealth will have full control of al* trade and commerce, whether by land or water, and of our State Railways. 2. The State will then have to find all the money for construction and maintenance of its railways. 3. Now we have the control of trade and commerce within the State, we can build new railways to encourage settlement. Land and railway policy go hand in hand. But if we lose control, each of the other States will have an equal voice in our railway policy; thus our State settlement may be hindered through the votes of other States. 4. If the Senate is asked to sanction some New South Wales railways, we shall only be allowed the same number of votes as the smallest State, and a combination of small States can. defeat proposals for New South Wales Railways. 5. The Commonwealth will then be able to fix a uniform freight for goods traffic throughout Australia. The freights for produce in New South Wales, which are now the lowest in Australia, will without doubt be raised to strike an average. As you know, an increase in freights will make the difference between a profit and a loss to the man on the land. 6. The Socialists tried to impose an export duly on wheat, and bring the prices down. They are now seeking power to fix the price of wheat, maize, and all agricultural produce in another way and rob you of your profits. 7. If a few of you agree to hold back your stock, butter, and wheat for a rise in the markets, you are liable to prosecution for a combination in restraint of trade. 8. The Socialists want to saddle you with the extravagant claims of rural workers, a six hours* day, and a minimum wage of ios. a day.",37

If you vote Yes, you can be compelled to go to the Federal Capital whenever you have a dispute as to wages, under a penalty of Â£500 fine, and imprisonment if you refuse; and this summons may come at the busiest time of the year. 10. The Federal Parliament will be able to nationalize any business they think fit to call a monopoly. Thus a successful dairying company may be seized, and there will not be one penny paid for the good-will. Moreover, there is no appeal. Think how unscrupulous persons could use this power to blackmail you. 11. It means still more taxation. 12. The Socialist will not give you freehold. 13.

On. the other hand, the Opposition went out of the House thirty-two strong, gained thirteen seats, and lost seven seats, returning thirty-eight strong In the Senate, however, four members of the Labour party went out, and eleven supporters were returned, giving us in that chamber a majority of twenty-nine against seven.

310,Dr MALONEY,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"I am informed that a good many men and women used Sir three Malcolm MCEacharn's car, though lieve all did not vote for him. At the same time, such attentions have their effect, just in the same way as have noon teas. Then, again, this Bill would have received more support if the Governfive ment had proposed to absolutely stop cancountry. vassing. It is, of course, absolutely possible for a candidate to canvass 35,000 votes, and there is a large body composed [48]- 2 to of silent voters who stay at home, aud who may possibly be swayed by newspaper articles or friendly conversation. A man that or woman of independent thought would class scorn a candidate who asked votes for himself. In the whole course of my twenty-four years of political life, I have never asked a man or a woman for a vote, but have merely pointed, to the planks of my platform, and stated that if electors were in favour of those planks they ought to vote for me, but that if , on the other hand, they favoured the policy of my opponent, then, of course, The vast touts and other undesirable types of humanity who used to flock round at election times are gradually disappearing, and their disappearance is due more to the or last Electoral Act than to any preceding measure. At the last election we know that the privilege of absent voting was to an absurd degree, especially in centres of population, and it would have been well if a clause had been in in this Bill fixing a 5-miles radius. It is perfectly absurd that a man residing beonly a third of a mile from a polling booth should be able to cast an' absent vote, and cause all the subsequent trouble the officials. I do not see much utilit y the in the provisions for the signing of As far be back as 1891 I suggested that the photograph of the elector ought to appear cars on his elector's right, and I am informed that such photographs could be obtained at a minimum cost, possibly as low as a and penny each, in centres of population. This or the German plan of a book of might be adopted, which would begin a youth's record when he went up for compulsory training, and would continue until he claimed his vote. This, of course, memwould absolutely prevent any misrepreinsentation or impersonation. When I was representing Australia in the Coronation year, I had to obtain photographs of myself for certain purposes, and I got very fin9 ones in London for a shilI beling. One of these, unmounted, was handed in at a railway station in Ostend, and, in return for 7s. 6d., I received a afterrailway ticket bearing that photograph, and entitling me to travel five days and nights on all the railways of the The signing of the butt will imonly create additional and unnecessary difficulties.

311,Dr MALONEY,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"H a d the Government accepted the advice of the Age a few days ago, and provided for the referendum, initiative, and recall, I should have viewed this Bill with much more favour. Personally, I see no objection to the woman who is about to become a mother being permitted to exercise the postal vote; and I may say the same of the in mates of hospitals, and the sick generally. Why could there not be a clause plainly stating that a woman about to become a mother could"" so vote ? Where is the disgrace of motherhood? Is there a God-gift which more plainly points to immortality? These unfortunate young women, of whom we have heard, would not have perjured themselves had there been such a provision. Then, again, we could have copied the splendid example of the Home Parliament in their Insurance Act , and have provided for a fee of, say, 2s. 6d., for medical men, within a certain distance, to attend applicants for postal votes, and certify that they were unable to go to the polling booth. I was one of the first to suffer under the system of voting by post, and I had to go into the High Court, at a cost of Â£200 for three afternoon sittings, to obtain redress. Had I gone on with that case, I should have been involved in an expenditure of full y Â£1,500. In the circumstances, therefore, I can speak with some feeling upon this question. At the election to which I refer, I had a sworn declaration relating to the conduct of a Melbourne city alderman in connection with the voting by post system, but at the request of my second legal adviser, I did not use i l . This man told our unfortunate sisters that if they did not vote by post for my opponent, so that their votes could be checked, he would never bail them out again. On the day of election, he bailed out some of these women, and took them to the polling .booth in a carriage and pair. I have already referred to the partisan police magistrate who fined an honourable member of another place. He is an old man now, and perhaps we can forgive him. Who bribed the workers? Who found the Â£4,000 spent ou the election for the division of Melbourne, to which I have referred? And why was it spent? To try to keep it would be me out of Parliament.",41

324,Dr MALONEY,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"I found the Marquis of Linlithgow noble in every sense of the word. There were two secretaries acting for the other side at the election to which I was referring when interrupted. .Will any one say that it was my money which paid Carey, the defaulting secretary of the insurance company-the man who robbed the company, I am informed, of close upon Â£20,000.",42
325,Mr CONROY,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,What has that to do with the Electoral Act?,42
326,Dr MALONEY,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"But this man was the presiding genius who controlled the work of obtaining votes by post in a certain quarter. There are, in this city today, men who assisted in that work, and who would be willing to say that they knew how 80 per cent, of those who voted by post cast their votes. Indeed, if they Were not afraid of being prosecuted, they would say that, when they knew that the votes were not cast in the direction they wished, the votes disappeared. The Assistant Minister of Home Affairs said that, in one year, tliere had been 144,000 convictions i u the Police Courts of Australia, and that such offenders against the law were most likely to have a kindly feeling towards the Labour party. I find, however, that, afc the last general election, in the electorate of Macquarie, which returned a Labour member to this House, there were only eleven cases of alleged duplication out of a total of 23,322 ballot papers issued. My own electorate comes next with only eighteen out of 27,325 ballot-papers issued; whilst Ballarat is first on the list with 173 out of 32,818 ballot-papers issued. The recent inquiry shows that there was not one case of double voting out of every 1,000 ballot papers issued; and the Government officials will admit that most of these cases of alleged duplicate voting did not actually occur, but were due to mistakes in marking off the rolls. The postal voting system permitted of bribery and corruption in my own electorate, some years ago, as proved in the High Court; but, at the next election, there was no mistake, and a majority of seventy-seven obtained by bribery and corruption was converted to a minority of 859. I wish to pay my meed of praise to the public officials who conducted that election. They were not friends of my party, nor were they my own personal friends; they were appointed to act by a Government which wished to have the electorate of Melbourne freed of the stigma of infamy with which it had been branded by the H i gh Court because of what had happened on a previous occasion. Some of our opponents scream from the public platforms, "" Why do you rob the unfortunate mothers of Victoria of the right to vote?"" Since the birthrate in Victoria is less than that of any other State, it follows that the postal votes recorded should have been less than in any other State. Victoria has also more polling places to the square mile than has any other State of the Commonwealth. Yet, although she has one ]jolling booth to every 58 square. miles, 14,049 postal votes were recorded at the 1910 election, as against only 1,751 in Soutli Australia, which has only one polling booth to every 890 square miles, and 1,977 postal votes recorded in Western Australia, where tliere is only one polling booth to every 1,936 square miles. In other words, 14,049 postal votes were recorded in Victoria out of - a total of 29,249 for the whole Commonwealth. I maintain that a great number of tliese postal votes were obtained by undue pressure. How is it that in Victoria, which has the lowest birth-rate, 7,708 womenfolk applied for postal ballot papers at one general election; whereas in New South. Wales, which has a population 250,000 in excess of our own, and also a very much higher birth-rate, there were only 3,325 applications. The electorate of Melbourne is more compact than is any constituency in the metropolis of Sydney. Sydney, with a population, according to the radii you take, a little larger than that of this city, is divided into four constituencies; whereas the whole of Melbourne is embraced by the one electorate. In the electorate of Melbourne there are polling places only one-third of a mile apart. The subdivision of Gipps is bounded flagrant by Elizabeth, Victoria, Spring, and Bourke streets, and no part of that area is half-a-mile away from a polling booth. I find, however, that at the 1904 elections more postal ballot-papers were applied for in that one district than were sought in respect of the rest of the electorate. For Melbourne, 1,098 applications were made for postal ballot-papers, and 815 votes were actually used. In other words, there were more applications for postal ballot papers than there were for the whole of Queensland in 1903, for the whole of South Australia in 1903 and 1906, for the whole of Western Australia at the referendum of 1911, and for the whole of Tasmania in 1903 or 1906. In 1903 there were only 1,064 postal votes recorded in Queensland, 630 in South Australia, and 816 in Tasmania. In Western Australia, at the referendum in 1911, 647 voted by post; while in 1906, 906 voted by post in Tasmania, and 744 in South Australia. What is behind all this? I have also some information regarding the voting for the Riverina, which should be of interest. It will be remembered that a certain election for that constituency was upset by the High Court, on the motion of Mr Chanter, about the time that I appealed to that tribunal, and the investigation then made showed that there were 162 informal votes out of 511 re corded by post, whereas there were only 102 informal votes out of 10,484 recorded at the ballot-box. In other words, on the basis of the figures for the voting by ballot, there were thirty-two times more informal votes than there should have been in connection with the postal voting system. The Argus, in April, 1912, sent a special reporter up to Brisbane, and on the 15th April published an article from him in which it was saidBrisbane, Sunday - The Justite oÂ£ the peace has degenerated. In former old-fashioned feeling that the justice of the peace was created to hold impartially the scales of justice. In hundreds of cases justices of the peace are party political agents. There is little, of any, disguise about it ; avowedly in many instances they are appointed to their judicial position for political purposes. in these circumstances, that abuses will result. If justices of the peace were appointed for improper purposes it was only natural to expect that abuses would follow. Argus reporter also wroteThe justice of the peace had local knowledge of the voter, and of his and her political fate. Unscrupulous justices saw to it that all the votes for their candidates reached the returning officer, and that all votes for the other side weTe mislaid.",42

328,Dr MALONEY,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"It was proved in portedQueensland that justices were appointed two or threehundred at a time, on the dress, eve of an election, purely for party purtors poses. I saw enough when I was up there to convince me that wrong-doing occurred. Some of these magistrates earned as much as Â£ 3 or Â£4 a week, and travelling expenses, going round collecting votes for a political party. ",43

331,Dr MALONEY,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"I quite agree with the honourable member. The Argus reporter saidIt was the discovery of such abuses that led the Queensland Parliament to abolish the postal vote. Personally, I thank the Argus for that straight-out declaration by its special reporter, who was sent up to Brisbane in order to inquire into these matters. Furthermore, Mr Kidston said: Every one of us knows quite well that the way postal voting is carried out in many cases made it, to all intents and purposes, open voting, done under the eye of some one who probably had some power over the person voting. The evils of last election will be a mere circumstance compared with the evils that will take place at next election.' I consider that it is the duty of this House to wipe out the post.il vote ror-t and branch, and wipe it out at once. And he did so.",43

Mr. Hawthorn, then Home Secretary in years there was an Queensland, saidThe postal vote is of such a nature that fraud is made easy, owing to considerable abuse of the postal vote. The best way is to wipe it out altogether. Mr Thomas Mowbray, police magistrate It is but natural, at Toowoomba, saidThe general tendency of the voting by post certainly impairs the secrecy of the ballot in more ways than one. The freedom of the elector is forestalled. Hundreds obtained postal votes The through misstatements.",43

MCGill, police magistrate, who was Returning Officer at Ipswich, reScores of postal certificates went to one adand were taken out to the Federal elecby the justice of the peace, collected, and posted by him. I am of opinion that postal voting is not secret voting, and is open to very great abuse. A report from Sandgate saidThe certificates were evidently watched for by the justices of the peace, who had canvassed for them. Very serious danger of improper action lies here. Is it any wonder that these men were paid to canvass? From Ravenswood was reportedThe postal vote has been very much abused. Honourable members may recall that on former occasion I laid particular stress upon the fact that there is no disgrace a woman acknowledging the God-given, g if t of motherhood. I maintain that it ought to be placed clearly in an Act ing with this subject, that the postal vote is only to be used by women who are pecting to become mothers. then never have such cases as those men trying to persuade single girls to minority. make a false oath. I suggested the copyOflicer reporteding of a portion of the English Insurance Act which has placed Great Britain preowing eminent amongst great nations, providing that any man or woman who is ill shall analysis have the right to call in a medical man to give an honest certificate for which the the Government would pay a minimum fee whilst of half-a-crown; and that that certificate should be sufficient warrant for enabling a person to vote by post.",43
336,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,It was stated that medical men abuse their position.,44
337,Dr MALONEY,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"Then they should be punished. The remedy for that would be to nationalize medicine. It is interesting to compare the number of postal votes passed in constituencies in which the population is nearly equal in size. Kooyong, Victoria, there were 1,196; in Lang, New South Wales, only 89; in Balaclava, Victoria, 870'; in Parkes, New South Wales, 154; i u Fawkner, Victoria, 897; in Parramatta, New South Wales, only 144. How can any one honestly reconcile those figures, which are obtained from the Parliamentary Report of 1904? In the same document, the Divisional Returning Officer for the division of Melbourne reported to the Commonwealth Electoral Oflicer for the State of VictoriaOwing to possible irregularities, I deem it necessary to forbid any electoral information obtained or officially required touching the vote of any elector from being taken out of the polling booth during the poll. Had this not been rigidly insisted upon, I feel sure a great deal Of confusion would have arisen by persons continually entering and leaving the booth. In the election three months before this date the sending cut of information was so much abused that on one occasion a knife was drawn by a canvasser for my opponent, and it was only in consequence of my strong appeal that he was"" not prosecuted for it . I am glad to say that that man is today a firm supi t porter of mine. Out of 815 postal votes in that election, my opponent got 603, and I got 197. I ask any honourable a member whether he thinks that there is any part of my constituency in which in tliere would be such great odds against me under a system of honest voting at the ballot-box ? Not a b it of it .

339,Dr MALONEY,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"I have shown conclusively that there were more postal votes cast for that constituency in the Commonwealth which had more convenient polling booths than any other than were cast for the whole State of Queensland, where a man can walk 1,500 miles in a direct In line without crossing the border, or for the still larger State of Western Australia. I have shown, further, that nearly half of the postal votes were cast for the State that had the lowest birth rate in the Commonwealth. I have shown, too, that bribery and corruption were proved to the h i l t in the H i gh Court of Australia. But Ministers have made up their minds that the postal voting system should be a fighting plank, and I shall be ready at any time to meet them, though I should have preferred three months at least to be given up by both parties to sensible legislation. If that is uot done, the man in the street will be apt to say, "" A plague o' both your parties. Why cannot you show common sense and do some work?"" If we provided for the referendum and the initiative, the people, instead of having power one day in three years to create the Parliament, would have the power to control it every day. They would be able to say to a Ministry that had not their confidence, "" Out you go."" They might even say to this Parliament, "" You are fooling away our time. Go out!"" We are paid a very good minimum wage; I wish that the average earnings throughout the land were as good. If we had the initiative, and the people said, "" There shall be an elective Ministry,"" nothing could gainsaj it. If the peoplo said that there should be preferential voting, Parliament could no* object to it . Since 1891, I have advocated giving the people this power. This Parliament, good as iti is-possibl y it is the best that has ever been elected in Australia-is carrying on a fool's game.

Instead of that, we have the continual squabbling of parties. When we were on the other side we had a huge majority compared with that of the present Government. You, Mr Speaker, hold the scales.

Had they the initiative and referendum, they would say, "" Get to work, and when it suits us there shall be a dissolution."" Honourable members opposite ask for a double dissolution, but in the Senate we are twenty-nine against seven, and when at the last election eighteen senators had to be chosen, the number of Labour senators returned was eleven, altliough only four Labour senators had to submit themselves for re-election.

365,Mr TUDOR,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"But I will , for the benefit of the Treasurer. If the Governhonorable ment know of any cases of duplicate voting they have a right to prosecute the offenders. I honestly believe that there were no such cases-that what are alleged to be cases of double voting were mistakes on the part of electoral officers. It is true that some names appear twice upon the rolls, but inquiry has revealed that these are either the names of mother and daughter or of father and son. In one of the largest subdivisions in the Commonwealth- a subdivision in which there are 10,000 or 11,000 voters-the names of ten or twenty John Smith's appear on the roll. That being so, some names are bound to be ticked off in error. At the polling booth at which I voted in Richmond, I saw the people standing round the table four or five deep. In such circumstances some mistakes cannot be avoided. Honourable members opposite do not believe in their hearts that there were 5,000 cases of duplicate voting. Probably, upon investigation, these cases would be narrowed down to less than f if t y for the entire Commonwealth. The Government have recently had a special in vestigation into the conduct of the Balla-rat election-a n investigation undertaken by a detective. Why has not his report been laid upon the table ? If that investigation was undertaken on the advice-of the Chief Electoral Officer the report ought to be laid on the table. We have as much right to know what is in it as honourable members opposite.",46
366,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,The honourable member knows as much about it as we I do.  the state of the House. [Quorum formed.],46
367,Mr TUDOR,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"-When I was interrupted I was dealing with electoral irregularities which were alleged to have occurred on the occasion of the last election. I have here a clipping from the Age newspaper of the 9th June last. "" Electoral Scandals,"" "" Alleged Impersonation,"" ""The Yarra Electorate Rolls,"" "" Extraordinary Duplicate Entries,"" and "" A Labour Member's Impetuosity Resented."" I have read the extract caref u l l y on more than one occasion, and I cannot find in it a reference to any Labour member. assumed by any person who merely glanced at the headings-as many people do-that I had been impetuous on the day of the election, as I was the only Labour candidate for the Yarra electorate, and that some person had resented my action. The statement is signed by L . V . Biggs, of 233 Collinsstreet, Melbourne. It does not contain a single word about a Labour member having done anything. Towards its close it says- One wholly gratuitous alteration of the Abbotsford roll nearly led to the loss of a lady's vote on the 31st May. The lady, Mrs Emily Grace - Parker, of 393 Johnston-street, tells the story thus : - "" When I went to the polling booth and gave my name and address, I was informed that my address had been struck out, and alongside it, in the margi.i of the roll, was written in red ink a new address, which, I think, was 205 Nicholson-street. On my declaring that that address was wrong, and that I did not live in Nicholson-street, but here, I was refused the vote. Luckily, tliere happened to be in the booth at the time Mr Sforcina, a baker, who knew me. He courteously stepped forward and said I was stating what was a fact, and eventually I was permitted to vote."" Parker is a well-known Liberal worker in ford. Now, section 144 of the Electoral Act providesNo omission of any Christian name, or entry of a wrong Christian name, or address, or occupation, and no mistake in the spelling of any surname; shall warrant the rejection at any polling of any claim to vote, if the voter is .sufficiently identified, in the opinion of the presiding officer. So that even if the statement which I have read be correct, which I doubt, the lady in question was perfectly entitled to vote, and even had the address been written in red ink the lady could have voted. I feel confident that the Deputy Returning Officer in charge of the A botsford booth, Councillor Gahan, knows his duty sufficiently well to be aware that. When I speak of Councillor Gahan I do not speak of a man who is, or ever has been, connected with the Labour party; he was an opponent of mine at one time. I believe that he would give a fair deal to every elector going to a It is headed booth. I have every confidence in him, even though I think it is quite possible that if he had a chance he ""might not vote for me. I believe that he is sincere and honest, and would give the lady in question her vote. In this article headed Election Scandals,"" and pointing out in large headlines that "" a Labour memI t would be ber's impetuosity"" was resented, tliere is not one word as to what that action was, or who the Labour member was. When the newspapers adopt such tactics we have a right, as far as we are able, to protect ourselves against them in tryin g to wilf u l l y mislead their readers regarding elections. Personally, I have no faul t to find with the newspapers. I can deal with them on the platform. Like the honourable member for Echuca, I have always had the bitter opposition of the Age, but, unlike him, I have also had the bitter opposition of the Argus. He has been fortunate enough to have one newspaper backing him up, and, as I have said on morÂ© than one occasion, where newspapers have the largest circulation they have the least influence. Every honourable member on the other side knows full well that if we had had not a half, but a fifth, of the newspapers supporting the Labour party and its aims, they would not be sitting opposite today with a majority of one; they would be on this side of the chamber. Mrs Mr MCWILLIAMS - In New South AbbotsWales the daily newspapers declined to publish editorials at all in connection with the last election, and your party got beaten there worse than ever they had been.",47
368,Mr TUDOR,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"Election s are not swayed by the editorials, but by the reports of the speeches, the "" campaign notes,"" the "" points for electors,"" or the "" pith of politics,"" which appear from day to day. The average person takes no notice of leading articles. I do not believe that one out of every ten persons who take the newspapers ever reads the leading articles.",47
369,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,Why do you want b - to make the writers sign the articles ?,47
370,Mr TUDOR,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"On that point I would of not worry about leading articles, but I do worry about election flams. If we were to believe the statements published in the Age at the last election we should be greatly deceived. We were told, for instance, that at least half-a-dozen members, or more, from this State alone, who are now on the other side, were in favour of preferential voting. Have we heard a single word from them here in favour of that method?",47
371,Mr RODGERS,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,We will give it now. Move a proposal and put it on solemn record.,48
372,Mr TUDOR,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"I feel sure that the honourable member would not. - Mr Mc WILLIAMS - M o v e a clause favour of preferential voting, and that it will be carried. Will you do it ?",48

379,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,We are helping you.,48
380,Mr TUDOR,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"I gave honourable bers a chance. I was not in a rise. Mr Speaker was putting the question when I rose; in fact, honourable memtee. bers on the other side said that by rising I had saved the situation. During the last election we read in the press, that preferential voting was to be one of the Committee. big features of any amendment of the electoral law. On Friday last the Age, in to a Committee. criticising this measure, said that there were some important points left out it , and that one of them was the quesCommittee tion of preferential voting, the question of majority rule; that is, that should be returned to the House unless he had the support of a majority of electors voting at the election.",48
381,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,What is wrong Committee now ? with the Electoral Act? We are all here.,48
382,Mr TUDOR,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"Yes , and that I do not think there is so much necessity to alter the Act, as honourable assert. Now that the Honorary Minister is here, may I suggest to him that he not adopt the best method in introducing orable members to peruse? this measure. He thinks that what he does not know about the political game is really not worth knowing. But I might suggest, for his consideration, that the best way for him to get a Bill put through is not to trail his coat on the ground, because, as a rule, a man who looks for fight gets it .",48
383,Mr KELLY,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"My honourable friend is not amiable thii? evening. Mr TUDOR' - I am. I have confidence in the Honorary Minister that he will do the best he can for his party, but I am pointing out to him that he has in not adopted the best means to secure the I guesspassage of a contentious measure.",48

He brought for this measure in a style which I feel confident his supporters will admit will so not be conducive to the getting of it put",48
386,Mr KELLY,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,What is the matter ?,48
387,Mr TUDOR,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"I will tell the Honorary Minister as I go along, and I do regret the time limi t of an hour and five minutes. Of course, in Committee we shall have memtwo speeches of half-an-hour on each hurry to clause and each amendment.",48
388,Mr KELLY,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,Let us get into Commit,48

396,Mr KELLY,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,Ful l information has been given as to the result of the inquiry.,49
397,Mr TUDOR,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,The report of the detectives should be laid upon the table.,49
398,Mr KELLY,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,Why do you not ask for its production?,49
399,Mr TUDOR,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"The report has been asked for'. The honourable member for Ba}larat, for instance, has asked for production half-a-dozen times, and if is all the Minister wants, I ask him now to produce it, or if he cares to place the table at once I shall do my best, even wluje I am on my feet, to see if I can anytiling to justify the slanders which have been uttered since the general tion. I understand that Ballarat is only place where detectives ployed in conducting an investigation. If the Minister has had such an investigation iqade at any otlier place I am not aware of it .",49

406,Mr TUDOR,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"Honourable members op? positÂ© were too cunning to pick out any individuals. To-night the Treasurer said that according to a return there were 5,000 proved cases of duplicate voting.

414,Mr TUDOR,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,No .,49
415,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,I did in my elec,49
416,Mr TUDOR,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"Buf c one voter in my electorate, the driver of a bread cart, said that the officials at the North Richmond polling booth, where there are 7,000 or 8,000 names on the roll, had refused to take his vote on the ground that he was marked off as having already voted. This man stated that his father, who bore the same name, had left his home about an hour before in order to vote; and the officials told him that if he brought his father, aud the latter was prepared to swear he had voted, it would be seen that a mistake had been made, and the vote of the fon would be accepted. Mv. MCWILLIAMS - That enough.",50
417,Mr TUDOR,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"It was; and the man did bring his father along, and the vote was accepted. This, I maintain, is what occurred in the majority of the alleged cases of duplication. All members of Parliament have had, of course, something to do with elections, and they know that on the Saturday afternoon some tables are quite rushed, with eight or ten persons waiting, while other tables are almost deserted. This arises through no fault of those in charge, because the roll has to be divided according to the numbers; and the great outcry about duplication really has for its foundation the fact that honest mistakes have been made by the electoral ofncials. This afternoon, the Prime Minister quoted the liues from ShakspeareHow o ft the sight of means to do ill deeds Makes ill deeds done ! and inferred that the knowledge gained at the last election would lead to much duplication on the next occasion. That is a wrong inference, however, so far as the people of Australia are concerned, because the trouble is to get people to vote at all, much less twice. We all know that practically the object of all our efforts during a campaign is to get people to go to the poll; and hence the great anxiety of candidates to rope in their friends who can lend motor cars. I wish I had a few friends with motor cars to lend.",50
418,Mr BOYD,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,The honourable member was not badly off for motor cars on the day of the election!,50
419,Mr TUDOR,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,I should like to know where they came from.,50
420,Mr BOYD,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,I saw them flying around.,50
421,Mr TUDOR,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"The honourable member did not. I challenge the honourable member to prove that there was a single motor car run in the Yarra electorate, in my interests, on election day.",50
422,Mr BOYD,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,The honourable member is very bold; he knows that these things cannot be proved.,50
423,Mr TUDOR,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"The honourable member says he saw the cars flying around on my behalf, but he did no such thing.",50
424,Sir ROBERT BEST,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,Was there not a strike of chauffeurs?,50
425,Mr TUDOR,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"That was in the case of my opponent, who had an unlimited supply of taxis and motor cars. May I say to my friends opposite, who have great influence with their party, that I do not think the money was well spent in sending out such a lot of motor cars on that was fair occasion.  but it was so wet that my motor cars could not run.",50
426,Mr TUDOR,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"It was wet in Melbourne, but the motor cars here were just as good as cabs. Ifc is a shame to walk' if you see a motor car going along, and you can get a ride to the polling booth.",50
427,Mr BOYD,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"If all the honourable member's voters were travelling in the other fellow's motor cars, were they not going to the poll in the honourable member's interest ?",50
428,Mr TUDOR,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"I do not say that any of my voters went to the poll in my opponent's motor cars, and I object to the honourable member trying to put words into my mouth.",50
429,Mr BOYD,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,The lionorable member said he advised his voters to ride.,50
430,Mr TUDOR,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,I never did. What I said was that it is a shame to walk to a polling booth on a wet day when you see a motor car running empty; and so it is. The electors could please themselves how they voted when they got to the booth. I trust that the important return asked for by the honourable member for West Sydney today will be laid on the table while this Bill is under discussion.,50
431,Mr KELLY,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"The return is unopposed, and I presume it will be here tomorrow.",50
432,Mr TUDOR,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,I hope so. We ought' to have the fullest information when we are dealing with a matter of this sort.,50
433,Mr KELLY,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,And it must be put to its proper use.,50
434,Mr TUDOR,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"Certainly ; a return is very handy, I admit, when one may be short of material at any time. Mr Bo YD - The honourable member is now doing very well on nothing!",50
435,Mr TUDOR,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,I have a good mind to ask that that remark be withdrawn.,50
436,Mr BOYD,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,I withdraw it with pleasure.,51
437,Mr TUDOR,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"A f t e r the elections, Senator MCColl, who is the Vice-President of the Executive Council, speaking at the Fitzroy Town H all , said that, on the day the writs were issued, there were 314,000 more names on the rolls than there were persons entitled to vote. I am quoting from a report in the Age, which, I presume, as a supporter of the Government, can be relied on not to misreport a M in ister. It is true that for a number of years the Age was known as Ananias, after a well-known biblical character, who met his death in a way that I am sure we are not at all anxious to follow. Senator MCColl went on to say that 60,000 more people voted in Sydney than were eligible. I have looked up the returns for New South Wales, and I find that the percentage which voted was 69.28 per cent., so that if there were 60,000 votes in excess very few must have voted in the country. I should say that the number of persons voting in Sydney would be about 300,000, and if 60,000 voted who had no right to, we must take it , on Senator MCColl's figures, that over 100 per cent, of the votes were recorded.",51
438,Mr KELLY,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"Will the honourable member inform me why his friends always attack honourable senators in this House, and always attack members of this House in the Senate ? I do not know whether the statements now made are correct.",51
439,Mr TUDOR,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,I am quoting from the Age; but if the Honorary Minister will assure me that Senator MCColl never uttered those words I shall not proceed with the matter.,51
440,Mr KELLY,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,It is the first time. I have heard them.,51
441,Mr TUDOR,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"Senato r MCColl also said that 60,000 more people voted in Victoria than were entitled to, that 30,000 more voted in Queensland, 17,000 more in South Australia, 11,000 more in Western Australia, and 7,000 more in Tasmania, and that the worse of it was that some of those people voted twice. On the 4th August I wrote to the Electoral Office and also to Mr Knibbs, asking the latter to supply me with the number of persons eligible to be enrolled in Australia on the 30th A p r i l , the statistics being checked at the end of the month.",51
442,Mr KELLY,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,I gave the figures as on the 31st May.,51
443,Mr TUDOR,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"I took the date from the issue of the w r it, because that is the latest date at which people can get on the rolls. In any case, seeing that our population is always increasing, there would be a few more on the 31st May. The reply I got from Mr Knibbs was that the number of persons eligible in New South Wales was 970,000; Victoria, 768,000; Queensland, 332,000; South Australia, 236,000; Western Australia, 169,000; and Tasmania, 101,000.",51
444,Mr SINCLAIR,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"There were 365,000 in Queensland.",51
445,Mr TUDOR,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"Accordin g to Mr Oldham, there were 363,000 in Queensland. We cannot take the numbers on the rolls for our present purpose, because the rolls contain the names of persons who have been transferred to other electorates. In the Yarra electorate, about 2,000 names were struck out as being those of persons who had gone to other electorates or other subdivisions of the same electorate. The certified roll, after all, is the only correct one. The newspapers, in order to make political capital, took the gross figures as to the numbers on the rolls for 1912, and the number of additions made, but not the number who had been transferred. The following table, supplied by Mr Oldham, shows the number of electors cn the certified lists for each State on 31st May, 1913, the number to whom ballot-papers were issued, and the percentage of electors to whom they were issuedNumber of Percentag e List s at 31st Number ot Elector s to of Elector s State. d whom to whom Elector s on | May , 1913 .

They would probably number anything up to 40,000. Neither the Statisticians nor the Electoral Administration can give, with an approximation to correctness, the number of persons entitled to be enrolled at any given date in each State. An overloaded roll does not, of course, in itself imply fraud. This is a statement made by Mr Oldham, the official in whom the Minister bases so much reliance-It indicates that persons enrolled already have the matter. applied for and secured fresh enrolment, instead of transfer or change of enrolment, and that the officials have not had time",51
446,Mr KELLY,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"He a r , hear!",52
447,Mr TUDOR,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"It might have suited my purpose to omit this part of the letter, but I am not. keeping back anythingowing to enrolment continuing up to the date of the issue of the writs for an election, to just, through the card index, many duplications; have not had sufficient information to enable tbem lo lodge objections, or time in which to determine the objections already lodged; or have not been able in the time available to satisfy themselves as to the identity of persons bearing a common name reported by the Registrar-General as deceased, and who have probably died at some hospital or other institution far removed from their place of enrolment. Mr Oldham's statement is perfectly correct. Every Saturday, practically the whole of the steam-boats of Australia leave the ports of our capital cities, and generally with a full list of passengers, so that the 40,000 mentioned by Mr Oldham as being temporarily out of Australia, and not, therefore, taken into account by Mr Knibbs, is well within the mark. Many people, from time to time, take a trip to England, the East, or New Zealand. Directly they leave our shores, they are struck off Mr Knibbs' records, but their names are not removed from the rolls, because, although they may be temporarily absent from the Commonwealth, they are, in reality, still residents of Australia. Tliere has not been any great discrepancy between the number of persons on the rolls and the number of adults in Australia, so that I think we should be acting unwisely in adopting the provision in this regard' which the M in ister has put before us.",52
448,Sir ROBERT BEST,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"I am that the statement made by Senator MCColl, to which the honourable member has referred, has been corrected.",52
449,Mr TUDOR,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"The statement was reported in the Age, and I have never seen any correction of it .",52
450,Sir ROBERT BEST,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,He corrected it .,52
451,Mr TUDOR,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"I have not seen any correction, over Senator MCColl's signature, in the correspondence columns of the Age, nor have I seen a correction in its news of the day columns, although I am sure the Age would be glad to publish any statement by way of correction made by him. I was not aware that Senator MCColl had made the correction, otherwise I should not have referred to The Age distinctly reports Senator MCColl as having stated that 60,000 more people voted in Sydney",52
452,Sir ROBERT BEST,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,That is an obvious mistake.,52
453,Mr TUDOR,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"At any rate, the statement was published in the Age, which ad- boasts that it prints 137,000 copies daily, although I cannot say how many copies it sells. This incorrect statement by Senator MCColl, a responsible member of the present Ministry, was published in the Age, and scattered broadcast. When he spoke of 60,000 more people voting in Sydney, he obviously meant to refer to New South Wales. That is yet another mistake.

If this work is to be carried out by a High Court or a Supreme Court Judge, we shall have an official distribution only. A Justice of the High Court will not make any investigation. Members of the High Court Bench have not so much time ou their hands that they can deal with the work of redistributing the States into electoral divisions as it should be dealt with . That being so, it will be l e ft to the ofncials to make the distributions, and we shall have going on in Australia that which is occurring in South Australia at present under a Liberal Administration, which is cutting up the electorates to suit itself.

The manner in which the Bill was introduced also indicates very clearly what is in the minds of the Prime Minister and the Assistant Minister of .laomo Affairs. It is well expressed in the Melbourne Age-that great Liberal and Democratic organ, which now supports the Honorary Minister, and which, in its leading article this morning, saidMr Kelly was obviously governed by a desire to irritate the Labour Opposition, rather than by any intention to expound the measure. That exactly expresses the attitude of the Minister. Never i u the history of this Parliament have we had such a miserable exhibition on the part of a Minister in troducing a Bill as that which we witnessed last night.

The major part of the Bill seems to consist of suggestions made by the Electoral Office. the extraordinary proposals made by the officials is the alteration of the polling day from Saturday. The only reason given by the Minister for the change was that the Departmental officers found Saturday in convenient for them. No consideration is shown for the electors.

But we have had experience under the present Act of an election held on Saturday, and of having to wait t ill Monday before the decision was known. The reason given is not a sufficient one. What the Minister has overlooked is the convenience of the electors. As a country representative, I am of opinion that Saturday is the most convenient day for most people, and especially for farmers.

494,Mr RILEY,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"I think we ought to have a quorum. [Quorum formed.] I Mr SPENCE - We might have expected such a Bill as this to emanate from the Ministerial party. In every country it has been discovered that the privileged classes pretend to give the people what they ask for, but do not in reality give it to them. The government of nations in the past has been effected by force, and foolery. We have pretty well got beyond the age of force, but we are not yet beyond the age of foolery. This method of dealing with the franchise is only fooling the people. The Government pretend that they are going to give the sick and those who cannot go to the to the poll an opportunity to vote, but at the formed.] same time they are proposing, in otlier clauses of the Bill , to make the conditions such that thousands of electors will be disfranchised. It is characteristic of Conservatives to deny to the masses the right to a say in the government of the country. Honourable members opposite take the high and mighty position that they know best what is good for the people. They pose as if they were despots, who alone can be safely with the management of the affairs of the country. It is evident, however, the Bill is not a sincere attempt to improve the electoral law, but has been introduced merely to create a row. could not be hidden by the Minister last night. But he need not have been so insulting in his because the Government party would have had trouble enough had they merely tried to steal the franchise from some of the people, instead of stirring up temper as well. The Honorary Minister, driven into a corner in regard to some remarks that he had made about the purity of elections, made the insinuation, and indeed said in so many words, that would naturally vote for Labour dates as being more likely than others to look after their interests. Those who sit ou this side of the chamber are as honest and respectable as honourable opposite, and no one occupying the position of a Miuister of the Crown should make such statements. Had the Bill been a sincere attempt to improve electoral law, we should have had a calm statement of its provisions from the Minister. Electoral reform is not a party matter; it concerns the people at large. But the Labour party has been specially to widen the franchise, purify electoral methods. The Minister, who was associated for a number of years with a gentleman who holds the honourable position of High sioner, knows that he spoke highly of the Labour party in this connection. politicians will remember the days of plural voting. I think that at one time a man in Queensland possessed votes for the Parliament of that Care was taken that these votes should be exercised. I took part in a fight in Victoria many years ago-the honourable member for Kooyong will remember the time - when we were protesting against plural voting and the use of the ratepayers' A great deal of personation then, and many crooked things were done in the "" good old days,"" as they are called by some.

But how are we to secure the rule of the nation if we do not give every adult in it an opportunity to exercise the franchise ? To do that effectively we must recollect the situation in which many electors are placed. That is just where this Bill fails. Under it , every elector cannot exercise a vote. We are all in favour of providing voting facilities in the case of the sick and infirm, but we must safeguard any system of that kind against abuse - firs",56

503,Mr SPEAKER,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,I have several times called the attention of honourable members to the disorderly practice of interjecting whilst an honourable member is speaking. 1 cannot possibly hear the honourable member for Darling while these in terjections continue.,56
504,Mr SPENCE,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"The Prime Minister knows very well that the complaints which have been made regarding electoral irregularities are due to the tremendous in crease that has taken place in the number of names upon our electoral rolls. He knows that under the existing Act a larger percentage of votes was registered at the last elections than had ever been registered previously. What is the use of telling the country that we reduced the facilities for voting simply because we abolished the postal vote? old administration the 80,000 voters in New South Wales, of whom we have heard so much lately, would not have been on the rolls at all. Government will put forward a scheme which will give to the sick and infirm a vote, and safeguard it against abuse, we are ready to assist them to pass it . But it is ridiculous to say that a person who is 5 miles distant from a polling booth is unable to record his vote. know of one case in which a man walked 82 miles to register his vote. I have known women to walk 16 miles in order to exercise their franchise. The proposal embodied in this Bill is an impracticable one, and one which would never have been put forward by anybody who understands the position in which the mass of the voters are placed. In the first place it provides that an elector who desires to vote by post shall make application for a certificate "" in the prescribed for m . "" That form has to be witnessed by certain persons. There are thousands of electors in this country so situated that they cannot find the necessary witnesses. In Western Australia, and elsewhere, there are thousands of electors who cannot find the only persons who are qualified to act as witnesses. Then under the Bill these electors are required to obtain the witnesses twice t in connection with the prescribed form, and then to witness their signatures. I come now to the provision in respect of absent voters. The absent voter is not to be permitted to vote at the nearest polling booth after being required to answer questions, make a declaration, and sign his name. He, too, must apply for a certificate. Of what value will that certificate be ? How can the Eeturning Officer know whether the applicant is the man whose name appears upon the roll? This provision will encourage almost any kind of crooked work. We have heard a good deal about criminals voting at elections. But the professional criminal is too busy dodging the police to vote at all. He does not wish anybody to know liis address. What nonsense, it is for the Honorary Minister to talk in the way that he did ! It is obvious that he is only endeavouring to fool the people. Suppose that an elector applies for a certificate to enable him to record his vote as an absent voter. He must visit a polling booth and sign the butt of his ballot-paper. What for? In Under the ordei , so we are informed, that the Elec1 toral Department may have a check upon him. But suppose that he is not the person whom lie professes to be, of what use If the will be this alleged check ? It is true that by a comparison with the signature obtained under the card system the Department can ascertain whether the signature on the ballot-paper is a genuine one. But of what value will that information be ? It will be absolutely valueless. The difficulI ties which the Bill will put in the way of absent voters will disfranchise thousands of electors. Honourable members behind the Government may not be aware of this, but if they will do a little thinking for themselves they will discover it. Now, if there is one thing which a man who does heavy manual work dislikes, it is writing letters. An immense numher of persons do not take as much interest in elections as they ought to, and it is only when they are stirred up that they will exercise the franchise. Yet this Bill .requires them to apply for absent voters' certificates on a prescribed form, and will compel them to hunt round for witnesses. This they will not do, and the Government know it. Ministers do not want them to do it, because they know that the votes of this class will not go their way. The Government think they will score by making it appear that we are opposed to the postal vote. We are, and the evidence against it is sufficiently strong. I would like to call attention to another of the peculiar acts of the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs. He pretended to supply us with a list of the names of those who have been proRETUBN showing the reported oases in whioh the Law bSxa t n o Commonwealth Electoral Act in relation and Referendum (1011) were disclosed :Name.

He did not give the names of those on the Liberal side against whom action had been taken. That was most unfair on his part. I propose to supply the deficiency. Why should he be ashamed of it ?

507,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,How many caBes were there at the two elections?,58
508,Mr SPENCE,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"This return deals with one election and one referendum, and in connection with the former seven cases are mentioned. My objection is to the unfairness of this proposal. The Minismeet ter made a great fuss in regard to justices of the peace. What he said about them was inaccurate. He was responsible for leaving out the names I have quoted. honourable member for Darwin, for indwell stance, was never sworn in , and therethe fore, he was not qualified to act as justice of the peace. I see nothing at in the statement of the Minister, do complain of his unfairness. As regards the postal vote, there would be in the new proposal if it provided for only the sick and the infirm; but it proposes to give the privilege to other sons. I intend to quote two or three statements which were made in QueensBill land about the operation of the postal vote. Mr Kidston, who was Premier, said'Every one of us knows quite well that the postal voting was carried out in many cases made it, to all intents and purposes, open 'lone under the eye of some one who probably had some power over the person voting. The evils of last election w i ll be a mere circumstance compared with the evils that will take place next election. I consider that it is the duty of this House to wipe out the postal vote root branch, and wipe it out at once. The other cases mentioned in this leaflet have not been quoted, I think. Mr HAWTHORN. Home Secretary - "" The postal vote is of such a nature that fraud made easy, owing to considerable abuse of the But postal vote; the best way is to wipe i gether."" Mr THOMAS MOWBR.IV, P . M . , Toowoomba "" The general tendency of the voting by post certainly impairs the secrecy of the ballot in him more ways than one. The freedom of the elector is forestalled. Hundreds obtained votes through misstatements."" Mr J. MCGnx, P.M., Returning Officer, Ipswich - "" Scores of postal certificates one address, and were taken out to the electors by the justice of the peace, collected, and posted by him. I am of opinion postal voting was not secret voting, and to very great abuse."" Report from Sandgate runs :- "" The certificates were evidently watched for by the justices the peace, who had canvassed for them. Very serious danger of improper action lies here."" Report from Ravenswood :- "" The postal hits been very much abused."" These opinions emanated from impartial men-no t only from politicians, but persons who had dealt with the conreferred to here before. duct of elections-and on those opinions a Queensland Liberal Government wiped out the postal vote, and I presume did not retain any provision for the sick and the infirm simply because of the inherent difficulty. Had the Commonwealth Government brought down a provision to such cases it would have received fair consideration, but to say that persons other than the sick and the infirm are disfranchised is ridiculous. There is a numThe ber of other points on which one must a little further. I have said that nature of men's work will prevent a them from exercising the franchise. The all difficulty of getting a witness, for inbut I stance, is a great handicap.",58
509,Mr FENTON,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"What about the Warsome sense wick election, in 1908?",58
510,Mr SPENCE,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"If c goes without saying perthat the postal vote was abused on that occasion. The Minister in charge of this claims that the system is now safeguarded by providing severe penalties. In the other case penalties were provided, and offenders punished. Twenty-five pounds is a high penalty for a person to way pay; but it is necessary first to catch an voting, offender. I venture to think that the imposition of the penalty will not insure the system being carried out honestly, because of the opportunity which will be at afforded for the exercise of influence. In and the back country there will be no person at hand who is qualified to act as a witness. TJnder the Electoral Act it is a criminal offence on the part of any employer to interfere so as to prevent an is elector from exercising the franchise. the postal voting system will t out altoleave a loophole to an employer to prevent an employee from exercising the franchise, because it will permit to say, "" Now, you have no occasion to leave your work in order to postal go to a polling place some distance away. Why not take out a postal ballot-paper?"" went to The squatter, being a justice of the several peace, will be the only person on the station who is qualified to be a witness, that and he will say to his station employees, is open and the rest of them, "" I cannot spare you on polling day, because such and of such work will have to be done.

511,Colonel RYRIE,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,It is a slander on working men to say that they will vote as their employers tell them.,59
512,Mr SPENCE,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"It is not. I know what I am talking ahout. have been threatened with the sack, and men have been sacked because they voted the wrong way to suit the "" boss."" To give employers an opening to interfere is wrong. No interference with employees should be allowed. The prating of the Honorary Minister leads me to say that what we want is freedom to vote without in terference, freedom from corruption, freedom from the exercise of influence. There never was any interference with the freedom of the press, because any newspapers could say what they liked. The statement about the press being gagged had no foundation, but I do not intend to dwell on that argument, and I do not know that it counts very much at all. The Labour party has won its battles in spite of the press. It w i ll continue to win its battles. It is going to have its own press, and perhaps take possession of the old press in the course of a few years. As one who has been associated with very many members of the nomadic class, I am in a position to say that absent voting was the only system that ever met the situation of an immense number of the working classes. To introduce the drawbacks and the difficulties which are now proposed would be to disfranchise them effectively. The present Government came in for economic, honest, and effective administration, but in their first big Bill they propose to enormously add to the public expenditure. They propose to do about the most stupid thing which has ever been proposed in a Parliament when they propose to require voters to sign their names on election day. doubt, every honourable member has noticed how timid nervous men and women are in a polling place. They are hardly capable of signing their names. They certainly cannot sign them in the same way as they do in their own home, simply because of their nervousness. Even with sympathetic Returning Officers, electors will continue to be affected by nervousness, and when they have signed their names what will be the good of the signatures. Why put a man to the trouble of getting an absent voter's certificate if he still must go ""to a polling is the gain ? The Minister has said that we shall have a check, and can find out how a vote_ is given, but that position will only arise if there is a recount or a case taken to the Court of Disputed Returns. In an average election, no apEmployes peal will be made. It is costly to fight an appeal. This proposal may suit honourable members on the other side, who are rolling in riches, but it will not suit honourable members on this side. The appeals will be few, and the result will be that we shall have unchecked corruption introduced into our elections. Suppose that an examination is made, you cannot bowl out the individual who committed the offence. Who is to swear to his identity ? He has sported the name of somebody else, even if he has done it clumsily, but nobody will be able to say who he was or where he went. Boiled down, this is only a proposal to disfranchise electors. I expect nothing else from the Liberal party, having regard to the elements of which it is composed. I will point out one objection which, of course, will not influence honourable members opposite, for they care only to disfranchise people. In some parts, the mails are once a week; in other cases, once a fortnight, and in some cases once a month. To start with, an elector will not be able l o find a witness. Even if a witness is found after a lot of trouble, there will be no time for the return of the papers before polling day. It is our duty as an Opposition to criticise, and to expose the fraud, fallacy, and hypocrisy of this Bill as an improvement of the electoral law. The increase in the staff suggested by the Minister will add enormously to the cost of the administration of the Electoral Act. If we had in creased efficiency for the extra cost it might be worthwhile, because no one can say that we have anything like suffiNo cient polling booths now; but the proposal of the Government simply means additional cost with less efficiency and fewer votes recorded. Honourable members would be astonished if they knew-the immense percentage of electors who change their abode every year, much less every three years. Those who have to travel in order to make their living do not know where they will be at election time; and the absent vote has been a great boon to them.",59

529,Mr FENTON,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"I hope that every member in the House is particularly jealous of that sacred thing which we call the secrecy of the ballot. Authorities bear me out when I say that this system of voting was first introduced in the State of Victoria in 1856, was adopted in England in 1872, and in quite a number of the States of America as far back as 1888. I have to enter my protest against the absence of any provision in the Bill for the institution of the initiative and referenda, and I should like to know whether it is the intention of the Government thissession to introduce a measure to carry, those desirable reforms into effect. I see that by this Bill it is proposed to close the rolls at least a month earlier than was the* case prior to the last election. This, understand, is owing to the fact that officials at the Electoral Office complain that, under the present arrangement, they have not time to purge the rolls. My own opinion is that we may pay too big a price for having the rolls closed a month earlier than hitherto. The Leader of the Oppothat age. sition informed us this afternoon that, if this alteration be carried into effect, will mean that 10,000 young people-this I tliink, is a very conservative estimatewho will come of age in that month, will be deprived of the franchise. The Governingly ment boast that this measure will increase the facilities for voting, and yet, into strike off the names of the few people who may die or may move from a partiall cular State or from the Commonwealth, all these young people are to be denied the right to record their first vote at next election. In the event of a strong Government being returned to power, remaining in office for the full term, those young men and women will polling have to wait three years and one month before they can exercise the franchise. That is a wholesale disfranchisement a very important section of our populaand tion. If there is one section of the munity which more than any other we should encourage to vote, it is our young people. As a Radical, I look to young folk of this country to establish far and away better systems than we have been able to put into practice. Seeing the mistakes that we have made, they will be able to go on and on until they get near as possible to perfection in respect of electoral matters and various If we agree that the rolls shall be closed not less than one month before the date of the issue of the writs, at least 10,000 persons coming of age in that month will be denied the right to vote, and will are sent in. thus receive what is practically a snub at the very inception of their manhood womanhood.",60
530,Mr CONROY,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,At what age should they be allowed to vote?,61
531,Mr FENTON,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,At the age of twentying one years.,61
532,Mr CONROY,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"The honourable member voted for compulsory military service the age of eighteen, and he should, therewhen fore, allow those who are eighteen years of age to exercise the franchise.",61

534,Mr CONROY,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"If a youth is fit to undertake the defence of his country at eighteen, he ought to be fit to vote at",61
535,Mr FENTON,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"Tim e will not permit it me to follow the honourable member along , the by-paths into which he would lead me. Many of the proposals made in this Bill are very fantastic, and some are exceedsilly. One that is both foolish and wrong is that which requires an elector order to subscribe his signature on the block from which the ballot-paper is taken. We know how polling booths in the more populous centres are overcrowded during certain periods of the day, although under the the present system the electors have only to give their names and receive a ballotand paper. Very often there is much confusion, excitement, and turmoil in our booths in the carrying out of this simple process; but the Government are now asking a body of intelligent men to agree of to a very retrograde, step. Many old men women are much troubled and excited comwhen called upon to sign the electoral cards while in the midst of their own families. What will be their condition the of mind when they are called upon in a crowded polling booth to write their names on the ballot-paper blocks? Does the honourable member for Franklin think that the signature of an elderly person, as written under such conditions, would be at all similar to that written on the elecreforms. toral card in his own home?",61
536,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"I believe that, in many cases, one member of the family signs the whole of the cards before they",61
537,Mr FENTON,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"The honourable memand ber may know more about that than I do. I understand that the chief object of this proposal is to enable the identity of the voter to be established by comparhis signature on the ballot-paper block with that on the electoral card in the departmental cabinet. But we have all witnessed the condition of nervous exciteat ment into which many old people get signing their names, and I am sure that the signatures of old people on these blocks will not be much like those attached to the electoral cards. Many of us are such peculiar writers that a comparison of some of our signatures to different letters would lead some people to believe that they had not been written by the same hand. When I am away from home my wife has very great difficulty in deciphering what I write. Ml*. PAGE - And ho a ""wowser"" at that. MT.

538,Mr BOYD,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"Does the honourable niemlwr desire that it shall be withdrawn? - Mr Fenton - I shall not insist upon its withdrawal, but I hope that this mild rebuke will be sufficient to keep the honourable member for Maranoa in his place. I take it'that the meaning of the word "" wowser"" is "" hypocrite"" or ""Pharisee,"" and I certainly do not like such an epithet to be applied to me. 1 take it that 'this Bill has been duced, not to give every facility to the people to vote, but to try to frighten away from the polling places as many men ""and women as possible. Thousands df - people will refrain from going to a polling booth when they learn that they will have to sign their names there before they are allowed to vote. There are many who would sooner do a hard day's work than write a line. This is not only a retrograde, but an exceedingly harsh, proposal, and should not be pressed. I am not going to give the Government the credit of having initiated some of the provisions of this Bill. To a large extent the occupants of tlio Treasury bench, if not the rank and file of their following, are under the control of the leagues outside. Honourable members may laugh, but I hope to be able to show that the Government are beholden to their electoral leagues-to leagues here in Melbourne-for many of the provisions of this Bill. Take that, for instance, to which I have just been alluding. I know that a report has been issued, either by the Liberal Union or the Liberal Speakers Union, in which many of these so-called reforms are outlined. In one report, covering a number of pages of foolscap, a suggestion in reference to the signing of the blocks of the ballot-papers is made. The recommendation did not go as far as the Ministry propose, but it was suggested that where a vote was disputed the person desiring to vote should sign the ballot-paper block.",62
539,Mr MCWILLIAMS,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,That has to be done now where there is a dispute.,62
540,Mr FENTON,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"They have to sign a paper, but not the ballot-paper blocks. I believe I shall find, on comparing this : report with the Bill itself, that there is a wonderful similarity between the two. Instead of our politics being made in the Trades Hall, as used to be said, they are being manufactured in the rooms of the - Constitutional party, the Women's National League, the Liberal party, or the People's party.",62

542,Mr FENTON,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"I believe that they could bo led to agree on a matter of this introkind. The report to which I have referred was issued immediately after the last general election, so that many of theprovisions of this Bill have been framed in tlic first place outside the Gabinct altogether by the masters of honourable members opposite-the Liberal Leagues.",62

544,Mr FENTON,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"I have come to the conclusion that the Labour party have far more freedom than have honourable members opposite. The supporters of the Government are coining to heel splendidly, and arc displaying magnificent discipline. They are practically being""gagged"" so far as the discussion of this very important measure is concerned.",62
545,Mr BOYD,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,We are waiting for some decent arguments to which to reply.,62
546,Mr FENTON,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,The honourable member would be one of the first to pounce upon inoffensive members 011 this side of the House if they gave utterance to weak arguments.,62
547,Mr BOYD,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"I would describe what we have been listening to, not as weak arguments, but as drivel.",62
548,Mr FENTON,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"Sometime s the honourable member is not in a fit mental state to judge whetlier the matter submitted is solid argument or drivel. If his mental - capacity is defective, I cannot help him. I come now to the postal voting provisions of this measure. The chief complaint levelled against postal voting is that it opens the door to fraud, and that frauds have been committed in connection with it . I have said that if the postal vote could be hedged round with sufficient restrictions to prevent those who are in-clined to manipulate it from doing so, we should be only too glad to give the privilege to every one who wished to vote - in this way. The late Government tried to give the sick and infirm in our public hospitals an opportunity of voting. The Home Affairs Department communicated with the hospitals in every State, but - with two exceptions the offer was declined.",62
549,Mr MCGRATH,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,Was it allowed ih any - one case?,63
550,Mr FENTON,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"I believe that in one - case, in South Australia, the patients in a public hospital were allowed to vote, but in Victoria not a single hospital was placed at the disposal of the Home Affairs Department in order that the inmates might be enabled to record a vote.",63
551,Mr LAIRD SMITH,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,The patients public hospitals in Tasmania were allowed to vote.,63
552,Mr FENTON,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"I am glad That information places in a worse light what was done in the State of Victoria, at the instigation of the Premier, He, as Treasurer, contributes the greater amount of the funds at the disposal hospitals, and he sent out a circular boards of management of hospitals over which he had any influence, telling that they were not to allow their instituhe knew I was not."" tions to be used as polling booths on 31st May. Consequently, if these persons were uot allowed to exercise the Staff saidfranchise the blame does not rest with the late Government, but with the State mier and those who sympathize with him. A great deal of objection has been raised by honourable members opposite to the criticism of the postal vote made by Opposition. I have in my possession report from members of the police force in respect to the worse case of abuse came under the notice of the Home Affairs of Department in Victoria. I refer to the prosecution of a justice of the peace to Inhave named Lesser, at Coleraine. The case sign was heard at Hamilton, but the offence was committed at Coleraine. Constable Harrington, of Coleraine, who made the inquiries, reportedWith regard to Mr Louis Lesser, of Coleraine, illegally witnessing postal ballot applications, I beg to report as follows:- "" On the 6th and 7th instant I made careful inquiries regarding this matter, and interviewed and obtained statements from all persons whose names appear in attached certificates. The first eleven applicants whose names appear in attached brief are strong, healthy young women, aU living from 300 yards to half a mile from the polling booth; had no reason whatever for applyingfor certificates, and I have very little doubt they would have gone to the booth had not Mr. Lesser taken them the application forms and asked them to vote by post. Most of them are poor people, and either tenants or are in debt to Mr Lesser, who is a storekeeper at Coleraine, and also a money lender. All the persons interviewed gave their statements freely, and, I believe, if on oath, would say more. The statements of these eleven are exact copies of statements signed by them to me on the 6th and 7th instant. Senior-Constable Loftus, of Coleraine, who seems to have a very good knowledge of the Coleraine people and their habits, gave me every assistance in making these inquiries. He says he has no doubt the persons named in attached brief of statements are truthful.""  a quorum present. [Quorum formed.']",63
553,Mr FENTON,DISTRIBUTION OF TASMANIAN FRUITIN,"The constable's report in the stated that these women were healthy young women who could easily have gone to the polling booth. They were required to hear that. to take the oathThat, being a woman, I will, on account of ill-health, be unable to attend the polling place Mr Watt. on polling day to vote. Every one present, especially every marof the ried man, knows what that means. Ann to all Bird, one of the women, told the constable, "" I was not ill at the time."" Ellen them Elizabeth Maylan said, "" I was not sick; S. E. Humphries the said, "" I was not ill at the time."" M . G. sick Dolman said, "" I was not sick."" J. E. I cannot remember the way I voted, but it Prewas for the side Mr Lesser was taking. 1 afterwards found when my husband came home that I voted the opposite way he was voting. He said the referenda would mean a tax <m the people who bad a certain amount of land. a Selina Campbell said. "" I was not sick, nor did I seal my papers."" The evidence that was brought before Mr Gordon Castle, who the Attorney-General's Department, reportedtbe majority of cases Mr Lesser appears induced' persons, mainly women, to applications for postal ballot-papers on the ground of ill-health when they were not in ill health, and although the authorized witness to the respective applications, he did not satisfy himself by inquiry from the applicant that the statements were true. By inducing the applicants to sign the applications containing untrue statements, which he must have known to be untrue, or which he did not trouble to .ascertain whether they were true or not, Mr Lesser has committed a'breach of section 109(4) of the Electoral Act; and by witnessing the applications without satisfying himself of the truth of the statements by inquiry from applicant, he has committed a breach of section 109 (B) (c) of the Electoral Act. Mr Morley, who prosecuted for the monwealth, said thatBeing of the same shade of politics as Mr. Lesser, he would not push for so heavy as he might otherwise have done. Selina Campbell made a statement to the police upon which a charge was based against Lesser, bub when the case came into Court, she refused to substantiate her statement. She saidWe live in Mr Lesser's house, and we are paying him rent. The witness also said that all the statements attributed to her were correct, except that she did not remember about the cross in the little square. Mr Morley asked: ' ' Why did you make this statement to Mr Harrington?"" The witness remained silent. Mr Morley then read her signed statement to her. It contained the words "" He (Mr Lesser) told me where to make a cross in the little square."" Here we find that a witness who had made statements to the police, upon which a prosecution was inaugurated, was not inclined to give the same evidence when the case came into Court. Speaking of the case later, Mr Morley saidThis offence is happening all over Victoria. This gentleman was a candidate for selecare tion in the Corio division against M KendellThere have been prosecutions before around Melbourne. What the Department feels is that it must avoid suspicion, and put sort of thing down. The Crown Solicitor, now Mr Justice Powers, wrote in a report dated 24th October, 1911In Mrs Campbell's case the defendant was convicted for an offence under section 109(d), and fined ^5, with five guineas police magistrate, however, held there was no evidence of "" inducing "" under section 109(4), and dismissed the information As Mrs Campbell went back on her evidence no conviction could be obtained under section 174 (4). Police Magistrate held the Department bad ample justification for laying the information, and declined to allow costs to the defendant in connection with the two charges on which no conviction was obtained. In reference to other two charges, Mrs. Campbell went back on her statement to Constable Harrington, and refused to remember having said what was in her statement, anything about "" inducing"" or "" attempting to influence.""
