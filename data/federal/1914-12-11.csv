Mf. HUGHES - That has not come to my knowledge. I have had a further communication from the gentleman referred to in reference to the date at which withdrawals from bond took place.

Perhaps we might follow a better method in the transaction of our business. It might be 5s. that longer adjournments for meals day awhile would be helpful.

4,Mr HUGHES,Unknown,"I have seen the newswives paper paragraph referred to, and cables have been sent to Great Britain to ascertain whether there is any truth in it . The various local companies have also been communicated with. Our information received from these sources is to the effect that no such project is known of, but it is assumed by those who advise us that German interests are-seeking once more to cloak themselves under another name.",4
5,Mr WEST,Unknown,Would any benefit accrue to the people of Australia in this connection if the Commonwealth had larger powers under the Constitution for dealing with trusts ?,4

9,Mr JENSEN,NAVA L ENGAGEMENT OEF,"It was stated last night by the honourable member for Fawkner that the allowance paid to soldiers' and children had been stopped, but that is not so. The allowance is still being paid.

22,Mr GROOM,NAVA L ENGAGEMENT OEF,"Is there any likelihood of an amendment-of the Land Tax Act on the lines that I suggested to the Prime Minister last night, providing for au easier method of dealing with appeals afnot fecting comparatively small amounts ?",5

In introan amending Bill , will the right honourable gentleman provide that, where the amount of the taxes does not exceed a certain sum, any appeal, instead of havto be referred to a Supreme Court, where the procedure is costly and tedious, may be referred to arbitrators, appointed by the Crown and the land-owner respectively, with power to call in an umpire to settle the difference?",5

We cannot commence the as work this year, but the policy of the vernment is to open up Australia from East to West and from North to South.  Prime Minister whether the policy of his Government is so far developed as to permit him to say whether the building of the East to West railway is to be completed before the construction of the North to South line is entered upon?",6
31,Mr FISHER,DEFENC E BUILDING SAT CRIB,"It has not been deterpicture mined that no other railways shall be prietors constructed pending the completion of the East to West line. It has been determined, however, that we cannot this year enter upon the construction of any more railways than now proposed.",6
32,Mr KELLY,DEFENC E BUILDING SAT CRIB,"Will the Prime Minister state whether it is not a fact that the Cook Administration commenced the construction of the North to South railway by authorizing the extension of the Pine Creek line to the Katherine, and whether that extension is not now being made?",6

37,Mr FISHER,LAN D TAXATIO N AN D THE,"If I were to he guided only hy my sympathies, I might set aside all taxation, and so meet the wish of the honourable member. But having regard to the existence of the drought, and to other conditions now operating, as well to the absolute necessity for raising Gotaxation, I think the proposal made by us in this respect is the most equitable that could be put forward.

42,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"Parramatta) [11.25] - I should like to know if it is proposed to proceed with this measure during the few days remaining to us before the Christmas adjournment. seems to-me that if we are to load the business-paper, as the Government are doing, there is not the slightest hope of our getting away .within the time proposed.",7
43,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,Order ! This question cannot be debated. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a first time.,7
44,Mr TUDOR,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [11.26] - In movingThat the second reading be made an order of the day for tomorrow. I desire to explain that shortly after the Titanic disaster fin International Convention was called by the Imperial authorities, and that at that conference every country, including Australia, New Zealand, ancl Canada, was represented. The Convention agreed that certain lines should be followed to insure the greater safety of life at sea, and in the British Parliament, which is not noted for the celerity with which it deals with such legislation, a Bill to give effect to the decision arrived at was introduced last May, and received the Royal assent about six weeks later. All the powers that were signatories to that Convention have passed the same legislation. Without this Bill , in order to bring our Navigation laws into line with the rest of the world in this respect, we should have to ask each of the six States to pass a separate measure covering our object. We think it better that the Commonwealth Parliament should take action, and pass this Bill so that it may come into operation simultaneously with the proclamation of the principal Act. W it h all due respect to the Leader of the Opposition, I should like him to appeal to the honourable member for Angas aud the honourable member for Darling Downs, to state whether this Bill is not necessary, and whether it is not advisable to pass it at once. It is a non-contentious measure, and is similar to legislation passed by the Parliaments of the principal countries in the world for the greater safety of life at sea.",7
45,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"Parramatta) [11.28] - I am not objecting in any sense of the word to the merits of the Bill . Indeed, I am not acquainted with its merits, although I remember the proposition coming before me before I left office. It The point that I wish to make is that, if the Bill is urgent, it is strange that it should not have been introduced before.",7
46,Mr TUDOR,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,It has been passed by the Senate.,7
47,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"And the Senate has only been sitting half time. One wonders why these measures, which are so urgent, have been allowed to linger so long in another place.",7
48,Mr TTJDOB,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"I gave notice of m y in tention to introduce this Bill early this session, but had the notice of motion discharged from the business-paper, so that the measure might first be dealt with, by the Senate. It has come from the Senate as soon as possible.",7
49,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"Then "" as. soon as. possible"" in the case of the Senate means taking a whole session to pass a non-contentious measure.",8
50,Mr TUDOR,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,It was passed by the Senate in ahout two days.,8
51,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"The right honourable gentleman merely shows by that statement that this urgent measure could not have been introduced in the Senate u n t i l the last days of the session. If the business-paper is to be loaded, how can we get away next week as arranged ? A definite understanding has been arrived at with the Prime Minister as to the measures to be passed; but the Government are beginning to fill the business paper in a way that renders its observance impossible.",8
52,Mr GROOM,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"Darling Downs) [11.30]. '-The Minister of Trade and Customs is correct as to the origin of this Bill . When the last Government were in power they received an invitation to attend the Conference, and a delegate was appointed. A report was received at the end of March this year, and was examined by the Department with a view to ascertaining the extent to which the Act needed amendment. AB ill was then being prepared; and I take it that that is the Bill now referred to.",8
53,Mr TUDOR,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"Speakin g from memory, I think it is.",8
54,Mr GROOM,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"It was announced by the ex-Prime Minister, that if his Government came back to power the legislation then contemplated would be submitted. So far as the Bill relates safety at sea, we ought to endeavour to get it passed before the end of the year, but I understand that there are other provisions which put a difficulty in the way of this. Were the Bill confined to providing for safety at sea, it might almost be allowed to go through formally.",8

In Committee of Ways and Means (Consideration resumed from 10th De-. cember, vide page 1552, of Mr Fisher's motions for the imposition of a Land Tax and Death'Duties, vide pages 1519-1520) :",8
56,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"Flinders) [11.35] - There are many aspects of this, perhaps, the most important Budget statement made-> since the Commonwealth was initiated, which one would like to discuss at some length; but I do not propose to do so. The obvious intention of all sides of the House is that we shall, as soon as possible, get into temporary adjournment, and, therefore, I refrain from dealing with some features that are in teresting to all of us. The proposals in regard to taxation are of momentous con-, sequence, but they are insignificant, in my opinion, compared with the appalling magnitude of the issues raised by the Government proposals concerning the note issue. Before dealing with the latter, however, I should like to say a few words about some of the proposals for meeting the great deficit that now stares us in the face. One hoped that the Goto vernment in this time of national peril would have risen to the occasion. Recently returned from the country with a large majority, and intrusted wibh all the responsibilities of office at the greatest national crisis Australia or the Empire has ever had to face,_ they might have been expected to meet the position as representing the whole of the people-to present a Budget in which all sections were asked to contribute fairl y according to their means and ability to the huge burden cast upon us by the war. This is a crisis Budget, and it is also, I regret to say, a class Budget. I suppose that if there is any general principle which we all admit, it is that taxation for war purposes 'shall, as far as possible, attach to of de- all sections of the people whose interests are involved, and that i l shall be of the nature which, being temporary, and for particular purpose, is capable of easy moval when the immediate necessity is over. We have two main taxes proto posed to meet this emergency; one I shall dismiss in very few words. The proposed probate and succession duties seem to me the most ridiculous form of impost that the Government could adopt for such a purpose. no objection, I may say, to succession duties. I stand responsible myself for having initiated what was at the time the heaviest probate and succession duty i any part of the British Dominions, namely, the 10 per cent, rate imposed i Victoria ten years ago. The transmisthe sion of wealth is one of the sources permanent taxation, from which the States ought to derive some, and, pervernment haps, a considerable portion, of the venue required. When, however, have proposed additional amounting, as a maximum, to the enoror mous proportion of 25 per cent., and when we find thab this tax, instead of being a permanent imposition which shall ultimately fall on all wealthy people and injustice to all wealthy estates, is a war tax nominally worthy citizens of the community. imposed for a short period, and which, when the war is over, will presumably be removed-at least that, I takei t , is the intention of the Government",8
57,Mr GROOM,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,They have not said so.,9
58,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,The Prime Minister has told us the exact contrary.,9
59,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"I think the House ought to know; and if the Prime Minister were not so absorbed in reading a document, I should ask him whether this is intended by the Government to be a war tax or a permanent tax. Perhaps the Attorney-General, who is in charge of the business of the House, will answer the question.",9
60,Mr HUGHES,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,I do not know.,9
61,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"It is either one thing or the other. It is either war tax imposed for an immediate emerof gency, or the Government are using upon our national peril to further their particular political propaganda. one case it is imprudent, while, in other, it is dishonest and unpatriotic.",9
62,Mr HUGHES,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,I think it may be said that in its present form it will not permanent.,9
63,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,That is some concession. If we treat it as a war tax imposed to meet a huge liability suddenly a pressed- a huge burden with which the repeople and the country are suddenly faced - w e cannot conceive a tax more ill-fitted meet the case or more unjust and in and convenient. It will render necessary completely new machinery; and the tax w i ll fall on an extremely minute portion of an extremely small class of the community.  of only those who die during the war.,9
64,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"That is so. I now turn to the other proposal, namely, n the imposition, at this time, of a great addition to the existing land tax. When n the former land tax proposals were before House I pointed out that, with a rate of of 6d. instead of 4d., they would mean a very much heavier tax than the Gohad at that time received sancretion from either their own party or the we country to impose. The main objection taxation did not arise from the nature of the tax, even from the magnitude of the tax, but from the fact that it was coupled with a number of provisions that worked inherent, and, in some cases, disastrous individuals who were I pointed out at the time that mortgagors who, for the most part, are people beginning to push their way against great difficulties, and who had obtained their necessary capital by borrowing, were called upon to bear, not a tax or a contribution, fair or unfair, to the revenue of the country, b ut a crushing and destructive burthen on their interests. We know that the tax in many cases has so operated as to bring ruin to people; and now it is proposed to still further increase their difficulties. We ought to have an opportunity to discuss this Bill , even if it takes up much of the time still left to us, because there is no doubt that it means a great increase in this particular form of taxation. That form of taxation, even at its best, instead of being an endeavour a to distribute this burden over the whole the people, actually imposes a burden a small number of people, not exceedown ing 16,000, in a community of nearly In the 5,000,000. Yet this taxation is put for the ward as a legitimate and proper method of making the people bear fairly, according to their means, the sudden burbe den that has been placed upon us. And it is imposed at a period when there is a crushing drought such as perhaps we have never known in Australia. I assure the Government that they will not get the £1,000,000 which they expect from the tax. That estimate is calculated upon the operation of the tax under normal conditions. Under existing conditions the tax cannot be raised, it cannot be paid. The Government are taxing people who are already half ruined, who have no nnancial ability to pay a further i m position. Some people, of course, will be able to pay the tax, but the Government will not get anything like the amount which they would get under normal conditions.",9
65,Mr WATT,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,The original Act made provision for tliese abnormal conditions.,10
66,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"As my honourable friend reminds me, the original Act included a section, &2 I tliink, which enables the Commissioner to exercise a merciful discretion in connection with people whose unfortunate condition makes it impossible for them to pay.",10
67,Mr WATT,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,That.'sectio n contemplated drought.,10
68,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"Yes . A period of drought was put before the House as an occasion on which this section would be put into operation, and i-n view of the condition of Australia today, the Commissioner will be exercising that provision in a very large number of cases.",10
69,Mr HUGHES,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"It is proposed to widen the Commissioner's power in that respect, and I think it is proper to widen them at this juncture.",10
70,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,But the more you widen his powers of discretion the less revenue the Government will get.,10
71,Mr HUGHES,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,I admit that.,10
72,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"I venture to say that the estimate of a million of revenue from this source is not calculated on the supposition that that section will be exercised by the Commissioner to a very great degree. I now pass to a matter which I consider more momentous than any other financial provision which the Government are making at the present time. I refer to the contemplated great extension of the note issue. I am not going to take up much of the time of honourable members by narrating the history of similar issues in other countries. Honourable members are familiar with those facts. I think the present Minister of Home Affairs has, more than once, shown to us that he has made a particular study of this matter, and he has more than oncepointed out that if an inflated paper currency should bring about a depreciation of that currency, the perils of waritself are hardly equal to the disasters that will befall the community, and those disasters will fall first and worse upon, the wage-earners.",10
73,Mr ABCHIBALD,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"Hear , hear !",10
74,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"The difficulty I have felt about approaching this subject at the present time arises from, two causes. First of all, I think we all agree that in an extraordinary financial period extraordinary financial methodsmust be adopted. Moreover, when all parts of the Empire are taking risks we, too, must take risks in bearing our share of the burden.  fer that the note issue, as it stands today, bears any comparison with note issues, which have brought about disaster?",10
75,Sir WILLIAMIBVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"If the honourable gentleman will give me his patient hearing for a few moments, I .think I shall be able to answer his question. T have felt doubtful whether, at this stage, I should be justified in voicing the apprehension which I feel with regard to this; matter, because we all realise that every alarmist utterance may tend to increase the cause of alarm. I am conscious of that, and I have hesitated for some time as towhether I should in any way add to the possible apprehensions the people may have with regard to the note issue.",10
76,Mr JH CATTS,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,But honourable members ought to have some means of consultation on the matter.,10
77,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"J u s t so. The argument that has induced me to say what I am about to say is that so far we have not gone to the full extent that the Government propose to go, and if we allowed their proposals to pass without pointing out what appear to us to be the dangers attending them, we should afterwards be accused of not having uttered aword of warning. Therefore, I feel justified in putting before honourable members in all moderation the dangers of the situation with which we are faced. The Leader of the Opposition dealt with one aspect of this case, and he was under the impression that the proposals with regard to assistance from the private banks were what I understood to be the original arrangement with the banks.",10
78,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,No .,11
79,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"Perhaps I may be permitted to explain. Whatever confidence attached to th© original negotiations with the banks and. with State Treasurers, I have no hesitation in saying that those arrangements having been completed or abandoned, and, if completed, being the basis on which this Committee is .asked to grant Supply, honourable members ought to be placed in full possession of the facts. There is nothing to, prevent that being done. If an agreement has been arrived at we ought to have it before the Committee, and if the negotiations have beeu abandoned we ought also to be tlold.",11
80,Mr EISHER,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,Do you refer agreement drawn up by your Government?,11
81,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"I refer to - any agreement. The Prime Minister has said that an agreement with the banks has ""been arrived at, but is not yet signed, and I say that members ought to know its elements. I understand the for m the - proposition originally took was that £1.0,000,000 was to he advanced out of the gold reserve of the banks to the Government, the Government were to give the banks notes which were to be held in the coffers of the banks, and with that .€10,000,000 worth of gold the Government were to open a credit with the Bank of England in order to enable our international financial obligations to be carried through. Am I not right?",11
82,Mr FISHER,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"I think not, so far -('he present Government are concerned.",11
83,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,I think - that was the first and only object in view when the proposal to the banks was first - made.,11
84,Mr WISHER,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,The honourable member might tell the Committee that he has had facilities for seeing the whole transaction.,11
85,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"That is - quite true. But I am not aware of how ""far I am at liberty to make a statement.",11
86,Mr FISHER,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"If the transaction is to ""be made public, the whole of the papers ought to be here.",11
87,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"He a r , hear.",11
88,Mr FISHER,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,But I warn honourable - members that such publicity will not be 'in the public interest.,11
89,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"The Prime Minister must take the responsibility; if an action is not in the public interests it should not be taken, but I think we ought to have some statement.",11
90,Mr FISHER,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"I have said five times deliberately to the honourable member for Balaclava that, in my opinion, it is not in the public interest that these papers should.be tabled.",11
91,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"Negotia tions that lead to any agreement ought to be regarded as confidential so long as it is in the public interest to do so. But supposing the original agreement and the negotiations have been superseded,- and that there is now a definite agreement arrived at, Parliament ought to haye it .",11
92,Mr FISHER,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"I have no objection, but to the the agreement.is not yet signed.",11
93,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"We ought to know what the agreement consists of. Without any breach of confidence, I can relate what I believe to be the facts, without having been taken into the confidence of the Government, with regard to> the recent negotiations. As 1I have already said, the whole idea of the original proposed arrangement with the banks with regard to the £10,000,000 loan was that it should enable the Government to meet what was then a very critical position, namely, the provision in London of gold to meet the demands on us which would be made in London. The purpose of that proposal was the establishment with the Bank of England of a credit by lodging gold with the Treasurer, who was to hold it in trust for the Bank of England, which would as establish a credit for us wherever it was needed abroad.",11
94,Mr FISHER,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"That was a different proposition, and has no relation to the present agreement. That was only like a passing feather in the air compared with the otlier arrangement.",11
95,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"I accept that statement, of course. The position under the original arrangement would have been that that gold which the banks would advance, and which would be held in trust by the Treasurer, would be available to meet our obligations abroad through the Bank of England. That consideration, whether it entered into the later negotiations or not, becomes very important in an aspect of the case which I shall bring before honourable members. We are told now that that proposal has passed away, and that the present arrangement with the banks has nothing to do with it , but is an agreement whereby the Government receive worth of gold, and the banks receive £10,000,000 worth of notes, and undertake hot to present those notes at the Treasury for payment, or to circulate them.",11
96,Mr FISHER,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"There is no restriction of the banks' use of the notes, subject to the condition that they do not present them at the Treasury during the currency of the war.",12
97,Mr WATT,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"The banks may not present them, but the third party may.",12
98,Mr FISHER,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"No , the third party may not. The banks may make any use of the notes, but they may not present them at the Treasury for gold.",12
99,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"I desire to follow this arrangement out step by step, because there was never a more important matter brought before the House, and i i is essential that we should know all the facts. It is alleged by persons connected with some of the banks that the agreement which the institutions entered into was not to present that particular £10,000,000 worth of notes, but the banks were left entirely free to circulate £10,000,000 worth of notes, and to present at the Treasury any number of notes above that £10,000,000 which should in the natural course of business come into their hands.",12
100,Mr FISHER,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,That is not so.,12
101,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"Then I am afraid tliere is a distinct misapprehension as to what the agreement between the parties is. That is the conclusion to which I have come, and it is of immense importance that the matter should be definitely settled.",12
102,Mr CARR,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,Has not your leader seen the agreement?,12
103,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,No .,12
104,Mr FISHER,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,He can see it at time he wishes to do so. I have said so publicly and in ' the House.,12
105,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"I shall revert to that matter in a moment. If honourable members will follow my argument they will see the immense importance of the exact character of the agreement into which the banks have entered. Let us, first of all, look at the amount of the note issue. In round figures the note issue at the present £17,000,000.",12
106,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"All that the Treasurer has told me about the whole transaction is that the notes were not to be £10,000,000 circulated by the banks.",12
107,Mr FISHER,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,I have been saying so all the time.,12
108,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,I am afraid that I cannot follow the Treasurer.,12
109,Mr FISHER,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,I shall stand by the Hansard record of my speech last night. Let me send for the proof.,12
110,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"W h i l e that matter is being settled, I shall deal with another.aspect of the note issue. I assume for the moment that the £10,000,000 worth of notes issued to the banks is to be tied up in parcels and kept in the coffers of the banks.",12
111,Mr FISHER,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"No , do not assume that. Why should not a bank be allowed to use the notes in its own way, subject to their not being presented at the Treasury ? I have explained that twenty times.",12
112,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"But the point is, that once the banks part with these notes in the ordinary course of business, how can they fulfil the obligation that they will not be presented at the Treasury?",12
113,Mr FISHER,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,That is their business not ours.,12
114,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"I can assure the Treasurer that it is our business. These notes are not ear-marked, and the banks cannot say that they will hot be presented.",12
115,Mr FISHER,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,The banks are in honour responsible for seeing that they are not presented.,12
116,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"If the banks are in honour responsible for seeing that none of these notes which have gone out of their hands shall be presented, of course, it will be absolutely binding on them to keep the notes in their coffers, seeing that once the notes get out of the coffers of the banks the holders ean preany sent them to the Treasury at any time. Therefore, though the banks may claim that it is not a condition of their agreement, I must proceed on the assumption that the notes cannot get out of their coffers. The banks must keep them in their coffers. On that assumption, which is in favour of the Government, and to which I shall refer in a moment, let me deal with another aspect of the question. As I have already said, the amount moment is, of the note issue is now £17,000,000. During the present financial year we are advancing to the States £10,500,000, which will bring up the note issue to £27,500,000. Further, we are advancing another £1,605,000 by means of the note issue; that is to say, we ate issuing notes to the public to this amount, in order to buy certain Treasury bonds that are to be issued-they have not already been issued-for the purpose of meeting the deficit and certain public works obligations.",12
117,Mr W ELLIOTJOHNSON,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"That makes the note issue £29,500,000.",13
118,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"The note flation to which I have referred. issue in these circumstances will be about £30,000,000, but, in addition, under the agreement with the banks there may be notes advanced to any bank from time to time as they may be required. not think that we have very much to fear from any great expansion of the note issue in that direction-at any rate, I sincerely hope that we have not-bu t in addition there will be the further £7,750,000 to be issued at this time next year to the States, which will bring up the total amount to £37,000,000, assuming that the Government do not use the note issue for any additional purpose. If we increase the whole currency of a country, including the note issue, to any considerable extent beyond the amount which the community can absorb for its ordinary purposes of circulation, it is as thoroughly recognised a rule or proposition in international and national finance as any proposition can be that two things take places-firs t of all, gold leaves the country. Tbat is Gresham's law, and, though many laws and political economies have from time to time been found fault with since this law has been established, no one has ventured to dispute it , and experience invariably supports it-gol d leaves the country.",13
119,Mr HUGHES,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"That law applies only to currency that circulates, and not to currency that is held.",13
120,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"I am dealing with currency that circulates. generally hear used, as to depreciated or inflated currency, expressions which in many cases do not convey more than a vague idea of the true position. Whether currency is to be inflated or not depends altogether upon the conditions prevailing in a country at a particular time. In some circumstances there can be a considerable currency without bringing about those conditions that tend towards its depreciation or inflation.",13
121,Mr ANSTEY,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,Y o u said that two results follow an excessive currency. What is the second? .,13
122,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"The second result is inflation or appreciation of prices locally. But I wish to deal now with the first result, the drain of gold from a country. Australia, perhaps more than any other country sharing in the present disaster, has conditions which tend towards that particular kind of in The balance of trade is always against Australia. It has always been against us. Even in the days when our gold output was very much greater than it is today I do the halance of trade was against us, but in later years ""it has always been strongly against us. Our gold production last year was in the neighbourhood of £10,000,000 for Australia, while our annual current payments that have to be made abroad for interest, public, municipal, and p r ivate, have been very roughly estimated at £.15,000,000 by Mr Coghlan, whose estimates are generally accepted. Therefore the gold output does not pay more than 60 per cent, of our interest obligations ns n community.",13
123,Mr FISHER,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,Gol d is no more valuable than any other commodity.,13
124,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"G o l d is only more valuable in a time of crisis when it becomes necessary to hold it , but I am simply regarding it as one commodity, and, considering it as such, seeing that it is less than our obligations, we cannot rely on the fact of Australia being a gold-producing country to set the balance right.",13
125,Mr FISHER,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,Not unless we produce more.,13
126,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"That is so. In these circumstances we have to treat gold, as the Treasurer says, as being one of the products of Australia which have We to be taken into account in our balance of trade, and that balance of trade, in cluding gold, has always been, more particularly in recent years, heavily against us. How has that balance been squared ? By the fact that Australia has been a borrowing nation, and that its borrowings year by year are continuous and extended. Not wrongly. I have never said so; I have always maintained that, on the whole, Australia's borrowings have been good, useful and developmental; but the fact remains that the great gap that exists between our exports, including gold, and our imports, and always turns the balance of trade against us, has in past years been filled by the accretions which have taken place in regard to our borrowings. Eor instance, last year the addition to our borrowing was about £14,000,000, not including loans for redemption purposes.",13
127,Mr WEST,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,A big sum.,14
128,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"It is a big sej>arate sum, bigger than the borrowing in any preceding year, hut each year has shown a large increase of money borrowed over the amount prevailing before, and the result has been that the halance of trade account between us and the world has ""been squared by that borrowing. If that borrowing ceased or diminished, the balance of trade would strongly against us, and we should have to find gold to send away in order to meet our international obligations. This is a point to which I wish to direct the attention of honourable members: Once our borrowing ceases, other things remaining the same, we have to find from some source vast sums of gold to send to the Old Country, or have to become trustees of vast sums of gold here, in order to open up credit in the Old Countryin other words, put that gold out of our possession.",14
129,Mr EISHER,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,You could only do that once.,14
130,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"Let me follow up the argument for a moment. This year, owing to the war, our ordinary borrowing has practically come to an end; the States are not ahle to borrow and, with the exception of the £18,000,000 to which I shall refer presently, we are unable to borrow. Therefore, we have to provide in Australia not out of borrowed money, but out of this credit, or this supposed credit, that we are creating by means of the note issue, in order to furnis h the means of carrying out work which we have hitherto paid for out of money actually borrowed from the other end of the world. I shall be immediately asked whether the £18,000,000 is not practically substituted for the borrowings of the States and the Commonwealth in the past. My answer is "" No . "" It is not a substitute for the reason that the £18.000,000 which we borrow from the Old Country is lent to us for war expenditure.",14
131,Mr RILEY,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"Nevertheless , it is a loau.",14
132,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"Of course it is, but it is ear-marked for Avar expenditure, and a great deal of it will be spent at the other end of the world, while that which is not spent at the other end of the world will be spent in Australia in paying for obligations which are quite ancl distinct from the ordinary obligations connected with our development work. Therefore, we may put that loan entirely aside.",14
133,Mr WATT,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,The greater part of the proceeds of the loans is not sent out here.,14
134,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,It does not mean that the money is sent out here.,14
135,Mr WATT,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,No r goods. turn Sir WILLIAM IRVINE - No r goods.,14
136,Mr FISHER,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,What is the difference?,14
137,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"It makes no difference. I thought that it would be unnecessary to go into this purely elementary aspect of the case. Most of the money borrowed is used in paying debts that we owe in the Old World, our annual obligations, public and private, in in terest alone amounting to something like £15,000,000. It is perfectly right that we as a community should borrow £18,000,000 to enable us to bear our share of the burden of the war. But in addition to that, we are, by means of a note issue, going to create a kind of credit that will enable us to continue the full expenditure on public works and departmental undertakings which has hitherto been paid for with borrowed money. We are not going to borrow money for this expenditure. Therefore, we may leave practically the whole, if not the whole, of that £1S,000.000, out of the national exchange account.",14
138,Mr WATT,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,Whateve r use we make of the Imperial loan will not affect the accounts between England and Australia.,14
139,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"No . , But the loan was accompanied with the obligation that we should spend it for purposes on which we do not usually spend our borrowed money; that we should spend it on the equipment and despatch of the Expeditionary Forces, and on other war services. Having accepted the money on those terms, we must put the sum on one side in considering the balance of trade, and our exchanges generally.",14
140,Mr CARR,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,We should still have to borrow for public works.,15
141,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"O u r obligations on the other side of the world must be met without having recourse to this £18,000,000.' The ordinary method is now closed to us, and we are meeting the position by the issue of notes, thus creating a fictitious credit.",15
142,Mr WATT,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"If the British Government had lent this money to the Commonwealth for the financing of the public works of the States, what difference would it have made in the balance of trade between England and Australia?",15
143,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,E very difference.,15
144,Mr WATT,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"Suppose , further, that we had then financed our war expenditure as the Prime Minister proposes to finance the public works expenditure of the States.",15
145,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"We have to get, somehow or another, £1S,000,000 for war expenditure in addition to our ordinary expenditure, and that sum may be put into a separate account so far as our ordinary financial obligations in London are concerned. We still have to meet them. The way in which we are trying to meet them is, I think, fraught with serious danger. What is going to happen ?",15
146,Mr FISHER,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,Nothing .,15
147,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"I believe has that tlte assurance is given in full confidence and security, but it does not relieve me of the duty of pointing out what may happen. Let us assume that the ordinary circulating capital of Australia is about £10,000,000.",15
148,Mr FISHER,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,It ought to he a. little more.,15
149,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"It is difficult to ascertain the amount with precision, but I sliould think that from £10,000,000 to £12,000,000 is the amount of circulation that we require.",15
150,Mr FISHER,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"Our circulation should be from £12,000,000 to £16,000,000.",15
151,Mr WATT,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"It depends, of course, on the amount of trade that is being done.",15
152,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"That is always fluctuating from month to month, from, season to season, and from year to year. Supposing our normal circulation to be from £10,000,000 to £12,000,000. I would point out that we have in circulation a currency largely in excess of that. We have £17,000,000 of notes in circulation, as well as gold and other coin. As a matter of fact, the banks are now holding a large sum in notes.",15
153,Mr FISHER,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,A part of that excess is made up of loans to the banks.,15
154,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,The banks are merely agents of the public for the management of the financial operations of the community.,15
155,Mr FISHER,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"That is quite another mutter. The banks have been accommodated with Australian notes, and that accommodation has added to the excess.",15
156,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,I do not say that the whole of the amount that I have named is in actual circulation. A large sum is held in notes by the banks.,15
157,Mr FISHER,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,We have given loans to the banks.  the banks have to hold a certain quantity of notes.,15
158,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"The r e are so many elementary propositions with which I am confronted that I find it difficult to state my main point. The notes that are paid by the State for work done in the carrying out of public works will ultimately find their way back to the banks, and if the balance of trade continues against Australia, or the balance against Australia increases, so thab gold to be sent Home, or credits have to be opened at, Home with gold deposited here, our gold will be steadily drained away. I do not see how that can be avoided when the enormous note issue that is proposed is put into circulation.",15
159,Mr FISHER,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,The gold will go as a commodity then.,15
160,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"At any rate, it will go. What talisman have we in Australia to avoid the result that has always accompanied such a state of things elsewhere? Is there any magic wand by which we can avert the consequences that have accompanied a drain of gold and an inflated paper currency in other parts of the world?",15
161,Mr HUGHES,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,Countrie s which produce the raAv material of metallic currency never find themselves in exactly the same position in respect to this matter as do other countries.,15
162,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"The production of the metallic basis of currency does not matter at all, so long as the balance of trade is against us. Where you have a country whose gold production is not more than two-thirds of the permanent amount of current liabilities that have to be met outside annually, that production ceases to be of any more importance, for purposes of international exchange, than wheat or wool, or any other - commodity. Therefore we may leave out of consideration the Australian production of gold. The banks must meet the obligations of their customers in London, public and private. They must find the means of paying in gold all our obligations outside Australia. They can do that only by using the gold in their coffers, which, fortunately, at the present time, possibly in anticipation of the dangers that might arise from an adverse condition of the balance of trade, is very large, amounting to £33,000,000. It is extremely fortunate for us that the banks have had the j>rudence to amass such a large gold reserve. If they had not done so, we should now be in a very peculiar position. But if the balance of trade is not re-established in some way, either by our borrowing money abroad in the ordinary way, or by increased production, or by decreased imports, there must be a continuous and heavy drain upon our gold.",15
163,Mr WATT,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,We shall have a decreased importation.,16
164,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"I shall deal with that in a moment or two. The first way in which an inflated note issue is likely to bring about disastrous conditions is by causing a drain upon gold. Hand in hand with that another disadvantage arises, not so much from foreign exchange as from a local redundancy of money, paper or other currency. The banks are only conduit-pipes between lenders and borrowers. They take the money of the man who has more than he can use for current expenditure, pay him interest for it, and lend it out at a higher interest to other persons. They cannot increase the amount of their lending simply because an enormous number of persons wish to lend to them. They can find an outlet for the money only when business is increasing rapidly, and a host of new enterprises are being started for which money is needed. Under normal business conditions, only a certain amount can be lent out by the banks. The result is that when the currency of the community is vastly in excess of the amount required for the ordinary transactions of business, large and small, a number of persons wish to make deposits in the bank. But the banks are obliged very soon to say, "" We cannot lend out any more money. Therefore, although we will keep your money for you, we cannot pay any interest upon it.""",16
165,Mr LAIRD SMITH,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,But would the Commonwealth Bank say that?,16
166,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"If it did not, it would be better that it had never been created. The honourable member's interjection shows the sort of thing with which we have to deal. If the Commonwealth Bank is to be a deified institution, conducting banking business on entirely new lines, and if it is going to help every one by adopting rotten lines of business, then it would be infinitely better that it had never been established. If we have an inflated currency-if we have a much larger amount of money than is necessary for the purposes of the community, apart altogether from foreign exchanges, then it will be impossible to deposit a large proportion of it at interest with the banks and other financial institutions. Such institutions cannot pay interest where they cannot make interest. They will have to stop receiving deposits at interest, or lower the rate of interest.",16
167,Mr FISHER,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,What is the first stage at which the honourable member expects that state of affairs to exist in the Commonwealth ?,16
168,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"I should say that it will occur very soon. It is, I think, a matter of mathematical calculation. If we have £30,000,000 of notes, in' addition to whatever gold there is in circulation, floating about in a country where the whole transactions of the community can be carried on with £10,000,000 or £12,000,000, then that situation must soon arise. In short, my answer to the right honourable member is that it will occur as soon as ever he raises the note-issue.",16
169,Mr FISHER,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,This is the first time the honourable member has made that statement.,16
170,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"I make it now. I say that we have already prevailing the conditions under which prices might be artificially inflated, with these £17,000,000 of notes",16
171,Mr WATT,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,Not if partly locked up.,16
172,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"No ; that is, assuming that the banks cannot put these notes into circulation.",17
173,Mr WATT,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,O r - will not.,17
174,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"There must be, of course, a certain amount of ment ? conjecture in regard to all these things. No one can state them with mathematical accuracy, and I do not pretend to But if we have a note issue of That £30,000,000, or, as we may have, before this time next year, a note issue nearer £40,000,000, then I , for one, cannot see the direction from which relief can be given from that position. I cannot see how we are to get out of it .",17
175,Mr JOSEPH COOK,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,And tlia t would be a highly dangerous position.,17
176,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"A highly dangerous position. I am endeavouring to show how it might come about-that people cannot get interest on their money if the banks and other institutions which lend it for them cannot earn interest for themselves. And not getting interest from it , we should then have the condition which has al/ways arisen preliminary to the depreciation of a paper currency-the condition of a very large amount of money in excess of that which can be used in the transactions of the community. The inflation of prices, coupled with a tendency for gold to go away, has always, in every country, led to the depreciation of everything else, which we dread. The argument I have hitherto put to honourable members is entirely apart from the question of the £10,000,000 of notes issued to the banks. If the Prime Minister is now able to refer to the Hansard report of Eis speech, I should be very glad to see it before I sit down.",17
177,Mr FISHER,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,Her e it is.,17
178,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"I find that the right honourable gentleman was asked by the Leader of the OppositionIs that what you propose to do-to make this gold the basis of a further note issue? He repliedApparently the Leader of the Opposition does not see how restrictive is the pinning of one down to one kind of action, and how it does not convey to the public the actual state of affairs. The gold is for all purposes, but particularly for the purpose of a further note issue, should such be necessary.",17
179,Mr BRUCE SMITH,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,"Do the banks undertake to keep that £10,000,000 worth of notes out of circulation ? Then the Prime Minister, according to the corrected report of his speech, saidBeyond question, the banks may use the notes, but may not demand gold for them till the end of the war.",17
180,Mr WATT,PICTURE FILMRINGAN D,Does it appear in the agree,17

Sir ' WILLIAMIRVINE - The agreement readsAGREEMENT ENTERED INTO 1IETWEEX THE COMNA BANKS OF VICTORIA . .Agreed to finally by Treasurer, !)tli November, (tt) The Commonwealth Treasury to issue Australian notes to cover expenditure for Expeditionary Forces and for other requirements. (1<) If the Commonwealth Treasurer desires inoney in Loudon, the banks, if required, to provide cover by telegraphic transfer at par, or to lodge gold at any capital city in the Commonwealth, not exceeding in all £10,000,000, as required from time to time in exchange for Australian notes. (o) The banks may make such use of the Australian notes for banking purposes as they desire, but shall not present notes at the Treasury for gold. (</) The issue of Australian notes to be considered an emergency war issue, to be redeemed in gold at the close of the war. (i>) The State Governments to borrow in London with the security of the Commonwealth for all their requirements. (/) The Commonwealth Treasury to make advances to the banks, if required, in Australian notes, the banks to deposit in gold one-third of the amount of notes advanced, and to give a deposit receipt at 4 per cent, per annum for the balance; deposit receipts to be payable twelve months after the end of the war, and banks to have the option of paying same at any time before maturity. I read paragraph b as rather bearing out the view I first expressed. If the Commonwealth Treasurer desires money in London, the banks, if required, must provide cover by telegraphic transfer at par or lodge gold at any capital city in the Commonwealth not exceeding £10,000,000,' as required from time to time, in exchange for Australian notes.",18

211,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"A reference to the agreement shows that I was right in saying that the basis and purpose of the arrangement with the banks was to enable a credit to be established in London. But that practically becomes immaterial. The material point is what is to happen to these notes. As the Prime Minister has said, the banks are to be at liberty to make use of them in their banking business, provided that they do not present them at the Treasury for payment. If that be so, then there will be - no t now, but capable of coming into general circulation ab any time u n t i l this time next year-a n amount of notes equal to £47,000,000. There is the £30,000,000 (Final.) just obtained, the £7,500,00 0 further 1014. advance next year to the States, and the £10.000,000 in notes which the banks hold, and which may come into circulation.

But before I close, I wish to refer to a matter mentioned very tinently by the honourable member for Balaclava in connection with my argument, namely, that in dealing with the balance of trade, we must take account of the fact that our imports are going down. That is quite true, but it is also a fact that our exports are going down, and partly owing to the same circumsources. stances. The Minister of Trade Customs said last night, I tliink, that fchere was reason to suppose our imports had decreased, or were decreasing, at rate of £7,000,000 in five months. I was not able to follow the figures, but, any rate, it was said there was a considerable decrease. I do not where the Minister derives his figures, but, in any case, I am afraid our exports greatest war in history. are decreasing at present at a still greater ratio.",19

If we are ultimately to get right as a comwe shall have to do with less to and adopt a somewhat simpler mode of life. The other way in which we can ultimately, and permanently, and firmly establish our balance of trade and our relations with the rest of the world, is by determinedly adopting a policy which will increase our exports, or our products for export.

250,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"Balaclava) [ 2 . 3 0 ] - I think the Committee is very much in debted to the honourable member for F l i ders for the extremely lucid and powerful analysis which he conducted, prior to the luncheon hour, of some of the important phases of the note issue in relation to Australian finance at the present time. That remark might be made from either side of the Chamber, even if honourable members opposite do not agree with the conclusions of the honourable member in their entirety. It must be admitted in connection with the questions of taxation and borrowing that the most important feature of our outlook under the present conditions w i ll be found by experience to surround the question of the note issue and holding. In consequence of the amount of time which the honourable member for Flinders devoted to this question, I do not propose to tax the patience of the Committee in any elaborate analysis of the matter, but I hope, in due course, to come to some phases which he did not deal with full y , before I conclude the observations I desire to make. Speaking generally, it has always occurred to me that it is a comparatively easy thing to criticise the finance of Labour Governments. Judging by our Australian experience, in the Commonwealth and also in States administered by Labour authority, the fallacies of Labour finance are very transparent, and I think the injustices of it are sometimes glaring and unmistakable. But I realise today that we live in unusual and very tragic conditions and times, and that a fair consideration of one's political opponents, particularly when those opponents are in ofiice, is perhaps more important than mere excess of party criticism. It is in that restrained, and I hope chastened, spirit that I propose to approach the Budget today. My own experience teaches me to be very sympathetic towards a Treasurer. Even in normal times the lot of a Treasurer, like that of the policeman in Gilbert's famous song, "" is not a happy one,"" and amongst his own colleagues in the Cabinet and in the party the grave responsibilities which the Treasurer frequently carries are not too keenly appreciated. If that is so in . normal times, it is doubly so today. The responsibilities which the Treasurer bears towards his own people and towards those who are lending him money from oversea are enormously intensified and in creased. Therefore, any comments I shall have to offer on this Budget will , n - I hope, keep in view the unparalleled circumstances in which it was produced, and they will lack some of the severity which otherwise might have been directed tc^ wards some of the Government's proposals. The first question which I desire to discuss is that of the form of the Budget. There are really two Budgets in the financial statement delivered by the Treasurer, and they are clearly divisible. A very ordinary analysis will subdivide the peace Budget from the war Budget, and I propose to ask for the attention of the Committee for a few brief minutes to the peace division of this statement as if no war existed and no emergency ture were in it. The outstanding of that peace Budget is the alarming rate, when we look hack over the last few years, at which the expenditure of the Commonwealth is increasing. I am not one of those wlio helieve that this nation can stand still either in population or in enterprises, but I do believe that it is the imperative duty of the man in charge of the Treasury, and of his supporting in the Cabinet and in the party, to see that for every pound we spend we get one pound's worth of value. words, economy is a duty which they ought to face, and which is made obligatory on the Treasurer and his colleagues to carry out to the fullest I am not one of those who. hold the view that Australia has reached the limits of taxation in times of peace, or that it is a heavily taxed country, because, in dealing with the taxation which the people of a nation pay, we have to keep in view, to be just in our comparisons, the functions which a particular Government charges. We in Australia, wrongly, and most of us think rightly, have undertaken the custodianship and direction of many which in other countries are left to private enterprise. We do that for the fuller protection and development of the highest interests of the community, but it costs us money. If we did not .run Postal Department at an loss, as the remarks of members opposite have shown run, we could do with less If we were content with performing only the antique of soldier and policeman to the community, we eould live on much taxation than we are subject to today. So that, having in view the wide range of duties which Australian with the concurrence of their have given to the Governments charge, the Australians are a comparatively lightly taxed people. In the past we have been fortunate in that we have had no wars, and a number of the tribulations and trials which have confronted pioneers of other settlements in the world have not been experienced by us. meant that we could live .cheaply, and without that fear and Mr Watt. which other countries in their early expendi- stages have felt. But the point in feature which I am very interested, and it has. already figured in more than a passing way in this debate, is this: the Governments of the Commonwealth and States, interdependent as they are, and serving the same people as they do, must keep in view one another's requirements and systems of taxation. If we of the Commonwealth decide to disregard alcolleagues together the laudable and natural wishesof the component parts of Australia for the development of their interests, and In other push on with our system of taxation, it is just as apparent as the sun at noonday that there will be a collision, and, perhaps, an irreconcilable difference betweenthese two forces of government which extent. will lead to an immediate, and probably permanent, in j u ry to the highest in terests we wish to preserve. That is: why, in my opinion, the Commonwealth and the States should deal economically with the inoney they raise, whether from the lenders or from the taxpayers. There are some features of this Budget, and, no' disdoubt, of Budgets that will follow while rightly or honourable members opposite remain in quite power, that seem to disregard these i m portant considerations. I notice, for in interests stance, that in the Budget the tall poppies of the Public Service have been carefullysheltered by the Treasurer. I make this remark, not with the object of castingodium upon the higher paid ancl trusted! the officers of Parliament and the Public Serenormous vice, but because I do believe that in ahonorable time like this the men who can best afford' it is to for f e it their increments and promotions taxation. are those who are enjoying salaries above government £500 or £600 a year. I have been in functions formed privately, with what truth I cannot say, - that these increments, which apsmaller pear for the first time in the Estimates, of this year, are really the commitments, of former years. In other words, some Parliaments, of the officers who are mentioned in the people, Estimates have, by what means I know not r to dis- already received the statutory increments which Parliament is now asked to vote. If that is so, we are only sanctioning the: transactions of last year, and I do not grumble at that heing done. the",21

It is quite plain f the somewhat cryptic, if I may so term them without offence, remarks of the 'Treasurer that some of the taxathe tion proposals which are to be brought forward today are not necessarily purely temporary expedients. The right orable gentleman and his colleague, the Attorney-General, have declined to promise that this taxation is to be regarded as war taxation, and will be taken off when the war ceases.

256,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"That is no repudiation r o m of pledges, because if I read aright the Bundaberg jirogranime, the Prime Minister promised that when the finances of State permitted these further payments would be made. I beg of the Treasurer to think cautiously of the rights and honpowers of the States, as well as of the taxpayers, before he embarks on the taxation which will be involved in the payment of these extra, and, from some points of view, unnecessary, items of relief. Taxation is to be avoided except the absolute requirements of the nation or State demand it . It is almost to say that money is best left in the pockets of the people.

258,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"I helieve that if we could addirun a country without taxation it would as he the best country in the world; but no ill , one acquainted with a community such, ours will suggest that there is any that we will ever attain to that, altliough there are men in the community, known as Single Taxers, a body not yet extinct, who hold that economic rent will sustain a community without If I were to charge the honourable member with the logical conclusion of his remarks, he would blush to own them-the the taxation, the happier the community. We know that to be a fallacy. Common-sense men believe that must keep taxation as light as possible, having due regard to the functions and ambitions of the community. I leave that branch of the subject, because I feel that to labour it would be of no use. It is a point that every member of this Committee must keep in view if he be true to his pledges, and when the Government know that this is the settled view of most honourable members, I trust that, in the preparation of any subsequent financial statement, they will be less prodigal. of the outstanding features of the Budget is the Tariff, and yet one would not have known it from the utterance of the Treasurer. The Tariff was given to the Committee as a kind of afterthought. listened attentively to every word the Treasurer uttered in making his statement, but until the form of the Tariff was placed before the Committee, and the Minister of Trade and Customs was asked to explain what it meant, I did not appreciate th"" fact than an alteration to the Tariff was part of the Budget. The fact was not made plain. The proposals came before us in a casual kind of way, and an examination of the schedule shows that it must have been as casually framed in the Department by the Minister as it was introduced. It is not a Protectionist although it has the mask of Protection upon it. I have always been a Protectionist in what I may call the Victorian sense of the word. I am a high-duty man, although the constituency have the honour to represent is probably not a high-duty constituency. that, in the interest of industrial ment, manufacturing and otherwise, we should make our duties sufficiently not only to protect, but also to encourage and invite the promotion of , important industries that hitherto we have lacked. If the Minister of Trade and Customs asks some of us to vote for his Tariff on the ground that we are Protectionists, we cannot do so conscientiously, as the Tariff is not a Protectionist one; but if he asks Mr Watt. us to vote for it because this country needs, now and later, particularly during the present emergency period, extra revenue taxation. through the Customs House, I am prepared to vote for it . However, the M in ister must not pretend for a moment that higher his Tariff is a temporary or final Protectionist effort. In that respect, it is a delusion and a sham. Let me illustrate, we what I mean by a story of a lunatic postimpressionist artist. It is asserted, by some schools of artistic thought, that all post-impressionists are lunatics; but this one was legally a lunatic, and was confined in an asylum, and provided with a small room, a large canvas, and some brushes and paint, in order to give him a chance of cure ag well as a peaceful and contented mind. He laboured long and lovingly on his canvas; and when some friends went to see his work, he „ One said, "" I wish to show you the greatest thing I have ever produced. It is one of the masterpieces of all the ages."" His friends could see nothing on the canvas, and so one of them said, "" What does it I represent?"" The lunatic said, "" It represents the children of Israel crossing the Red Sea."" The visitor said, "" W h e r e is the Red Sea?"" "" Oh , "" said the lunatic, "" that has been rolled back."" Then he was asked, "" W h e r e are the children of Israel ?"" He replied, ""They have crossed over."" "" We l l , where are the Egyptians ?"" he was asked; and he replied "" Oh, they have not yet arrived."" That is how this Tariff strikes me. Protection is rolled back; the revenue has crossed over, heading for the promised land; and the In ter-State Commission has not yet arrived. effort, It is a post-impressionist attempt at a Tariff, and is a blank in the truest and highest industrial sense of the word. I hope that the Minister of Trade and Customs will not take my remarks as perwhich I sonally offensive, but to me, as a Protectionist, the man who produces such a I believe Tariff and calls it Protective is nothing develop- but a Fiscal Fakir. If we wish to learn what the people think of the Tariff, we high, must not go to individuals engaged in the industries supposed to be affected by it . I am always disposed to take with a grain of salt many of the arguments of men who are engaged in the industries which ask for Protection. One must use his own judgment, in regard to representations made about the Tariff, by sifting the t r u th from the false. Let us take the attitude of the great advocates of Protection in this country, the journalists who have prescribed the minimum duties that can be considered Protective in any particular dustiy. What do they say about this Tariff ? Some of them have not yet vented their spleen, or poured out their vials of wrath, to show their disappointment with the proposals of the Ministry, whom they have so recently supported, but by the time we come to discuss this Tariff in March or A p r i l next, we shall discover that the true Protectionist forces in Victoria will describe the present Tariff as one of the greatest shams ever introduced. Ifc is probably the besfc Tariff that we could expect from a party containing so many Free Traders.  own side in that respect.",23
259,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"On this side there are Free Traders, bufc on the other side Free Traders are as thick as autumn leaves in Vallombrosa.",25
260,Mr WEST,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"E very man is a Protectionist, but he will not give Protection to any one else.",25
261,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"I understand the meaning of the honourable member, although he did not do himself justice in the expression. For instance, in Victoria we have known of many who were Free Traders in regard to every industry but the one in which they had either a personal or a constituency interest, and in respect of which they became violently Protectionist. However, I trust that we have emerged from the chrysalis stage in fiscal matters, and can acknowledge the difference between Free Trade, a revenue Tariff, and Protection. I understand that Protection is the policy of this Government. Protection has for the first time been promised to the people of Australia by the Labour party. The agnosticism, which was the glory and boast of the early Federal Labour party when it was up for sale to the highest bidder, has passed away, and the party has come out now in defiance, I presume, of the vigorous resistance of the Attorney-General with a declaration of the policy of Protection. But the Tariff before us is not protective. To suggest that it is protective is idle.",25
262,Mr WEST,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,All true Federalists are Protectionists.,25
263,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"The remark of the honourable member is a bitter reproach upon the Attorney-General. I have heard brilliant utterances from the Attorney-Gene[61] ral in the pre-Federal days, dealing with! the advantages of Free Trade to an in in - fantile community such as the Colony of New South Wales, and subsequently to the people of Australia.",25
264,Mr JH CATTS,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,That was before his conversion.,25
265,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"I do not pretend to be omniscient, and I am glad that the At torney-General has surrendered his views, or been overborne by the common sense of his party and accepted the policy of Protection, but I urge that the Tariff should give real Protection. If we are to make a second attempt afc a Tariff which will be really protective, let us have the advantage of the evidence collected by the Infcer-State Commission, so that we may know how many of the problems of the industrial community presented to them for consideration have been considered by the Minister and dealt with in this Tariff. I understand from press reports that there have been 600 applications for relief.",25
266,Mr SAMPSON,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,Perhaps it would be better not to have the report of the Inter-State Commission.,25
267,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"To those who desire short sessions, the shorter the Tariff debate the better, but as the Government have promised to make the incidence of the Tariff more truly protective, they should make a much better attempt to justif y and . f u l fil their pledges than they are making on this occasion.",25
268,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,Surely we can have the report of the Inter-State Commission.,25
269,Mr TUDOR,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,If the report is available it will be supplied to honourable members.,25
270,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"Las t night the Government fiagellator-I mean the Government fiscal Whip-in one of those wild impromptus that so often distinguish him , swung loose and lacerated his senior colleagues for the idiotic nature of the Tariff, and he went so fa r as to say that the Minister was actually amending the Tariff now. He protested that any amendment of the Tariff should take place except in Committee.",25
271,Mr FENTON,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"Wors e than that, he said that the Minister was tinkering with the Tariff.",25
272,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"I was using a more polite parliamentary phrase. The honourable member for Maranoa went further. He implied, if language - implies anything, want of fiscal confidence in the Government, whose officer he is, and he even suggested that as the anomalies in the present proposals were so evident, an amending schedule should he submitted to the Committee before Christmas. He wished to know whether that could be done. Remarks such as these from an intimate associate of the Government seem to imply that all is not happy on the other side of the chamber. Before we get to the tion of the Tariff in detail we should have before us the evidence and findings of the Inter-State Commission in order to guide us with respect to industries with which we are not familiar. The sworn evidence before a judicial inquiry should enable us to separate from others the representations that are made by in terested parties in applications for relief.",25
273,Mr WEST,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,Are you not delaying the Tariff?,26
274,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"No . It is better to do a thing well than to do it hurriedly and badly, as I said when I heard the Prime Minister suggest, with regard to the unif o r m it y of the railway gauge, that the Government must act at once, although the desire for haste might in future mean the ripping up of some of the work of construction hurriedly done. The proper duty of a statesman is to get the evidence outside, ancl decide whether the recommendations of the Commission are right. In flinging out a T a r i ff of this kind, when, out of the 600 distinct suggestions made to the Inter-State Commission, not more than 100 have been considered, to say nothing of their being dealfc with, by the Minister, the present Ministry are acting hurriedly.",26
275,Mr TUDOR,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"I do not think that there is one suggestion made by the Inter-State Commission which has not been dealt with. On the contrary, a number have beeu dealt with without representations.",26
276,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"If the Minister has dealt with 600 applications, I commend hira. for his marvellous celerity and industry. Apart from the question of Protection, the question of whether some of these admittedly revenue duties will yield the revenue expected of them is an important matter. In pre-Pederation days in Victoria, when the State handled the Tariff, we imposed an extra duty on spirits of 3s., and we gained less revenue than was received under the old Tariff.",26
277,Mr MANIFOLD,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,What about champagne ?,26
278,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"I am not a judge of champagne. My honourable friend and his associates will give information on that point. I cannot afford to use champagne, except when some one hands it to me, and wishes me good luck with the g if t . I am not an expert in regard to the quality of whisky, but at the same consider a- time. I know something of the habits of the community in regard to whisky, and I know that Scotchmen will experience disappointment at the charge of 9d. for a whisky and soda. I know one honourable member of this House who has registered a vow that he will not drink anymore whisky u n t i l the extra Tariff is taken off. I cannot particularize the honourable member, but it is a solemn advocating vow equal in solemnity and endurance to the party pledge taken by honourable members opposite. These remarks illustrate the theory that there is a point beyond which duties will not yield revenue, because they tend to destroy consumption, and therefore abbreviate the revenue.",26
279,Mr KING OMALLEY,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,But it is good for the families.,26
280,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"I remember the saying that in drinking other people's health we injur e our own, and I believe that if we attempt to introduce temperance by T a r i ff restrictions the country as a whole will join us. There is too much liquor consumed in this country for the good of the health of the people, but the checking of the consumption is not a task that has been imposed on the Commonwealth Government or Parliament. We are told that the receipts from a duty of 16s. on a certain quality of spirit will be equivalently higher than the receipts from a duty of 3s. less.",26
281,Mr TUDOR,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,Not equivalently. We have not estimated that the same quant it y will be drunk. The figures show that.,26
282,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"Then the Minister has allowed for a shrinkage in consumption. Is that shrinkage to be attributed to the war, to the drought, or to the Tariff? There will be a distinct diminution in importation, manufacture, and consumption, and this will cause loss of revenue; but, as the Minister says that he has allowed for that, I make no further comment on the matter. I now leave the Tariff; because we shall have other opportunities for discussing its influence on industry. I am not sure that it is not a good t h in g - I do not mean from a party point of viewthat the discussion is to be deferred. A f t e r two or three months' experience of the new Ordinances, the Legislature will be better qualified to judge of their effect.  dislocation of trade.",26
283,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"Yes ; but all Tariff alterations mean that. Por that reason, I think that few Tariff alterations should be made, and that the work when done should be done thoroughly, so that the mercantile community may be free from interference for as long as possible.",27
284,Mr FISHER,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"In my opinion, that is impossible. Tariffs vary every year.",27
285,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"The vicissitudes of trade and commerce become more apparent every year, bub the less we interfere with our manufacturers and importers the better, if we wish to induce men to put money confidently into manufacturing enterprises, to develop the industries of Australia. Speaking now on the subject of direct taxation, let me say that I was bitterly disappointed by the reluctance of the Prime Minister and the Attorney General to say whether it was - to be enduring. However else we may fight about party matters, we should have an understanding that this financial arrangement is for the present year only. The honourable member for West Sydney said '-' Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof."" I do not take that view in discussing finance, though I admit that none of us can see ahead to the 30th June next. We may have to alter our taxation for the year 1915-16 in a way that no one can foresee. The Government are entitled at this time to ask the House to tide them over the present emergency and the difficulties which they have inherited from their predecessors, who were in power when war was declared. clear that fchere musfc be taxation for war purposes in war time, but it should subsequently be taken off, and whatever readjustments may be needed to maintain the country on a peace footing should be made. I hope the Minister will remember that. I agree with the honourable member for Flinders that if any taxation should fall as equitably as the law-givers can devise upon [61]- 2 every man, woman, and child in the community, it is war taxation. What measures we are taking now to defend the Commonwealth, andfcoshow our interest in the great world struggle, are as much for the benefit of the poor wage-earner as of the rich property-owner. You cannot measure by possession the safety of the nation. The rule of Great Britain over this country has meant to every one of us the right to pursue, with success, according to his ability and his luck, his individual ambitions. But the proposed taxation is to be put on a few shoulders, whereas it should, so far as that can be devised, be put on all shoulders.",27
286,Mr WEBSTER,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,Are not the poor doing their share in sending their sons to the war ?,27
287,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"Yes , and the rich are doing their share in that, too. Perhaps the most pleasing feature of the great uprising of the British people has been the disappearance of class, rank, and race. Scotchmen, Irishmen, Englishmen, poor men, rich men, dukes, and wharf labourers have gone to the front from all parts of the earth. That is the glory of the struggle.  tribute their share by paying Tariff duties 1",27
288,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"The Tariff increase is estimated at £800/000 for the half-year, or £1,600,000 for the year, but the new taxation is to yield altogether £4,600,000, so that £3,000,000 is to be obtained by direct class taxation.  ber's friends say that direct taxation is passed on to the people.",27
289,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"The tendency of taxation, direct or indirect, is to settle down on the bedrock value, that is, on the value of human labour. Those of us who have watched the incidence of income taxation and land taxation, or rent taxation, know that eventually the consumer pays. Some things are difficult to locate, It is and others are easy to locate. Part of the land tax will be passed on, and part of it will not. I say that, although I am an ardent advocate of land taxation. Tha part that will be passed on is what is known as site value taxation. In Georgestreet, Sydney; in K i ng William-street, Adelaide; and in other thoroughfares in the capital cities of Australia the taxation imposed on site values will inevitably be passed on by increasing rent or prices so that, eventually, the public must pay it . But is the measure as equitable as the M ister could have devised ? L et us consider the probate duties. I do not think that the Prime Minister realizes how heavily they will h it certain interests. It looks like a 25 per cent. tas. between the Commonwealth and the States, but it is really a 35 per cent, tax in some cases. Let me state a case beyond the possibility of quibble or doubt, one that has been decided in the Courts of Australia, and by the taxation commissioners. If a man living in Victoria lends money amounting to £70,000 or upwards on a mortgage on a New South Wales property and dies, duty at the rate of 10 per cent, must be paid to the New South Wales Government, because the property mortgaged is in New South Wales, and the same taxation must be paid in Victoria because the mortgagee was domiciled in Victoria. On the top of these payments comes the Commonwealth tax of 15 per cent. Therefore, in certain cases, chiefly where mortgages over large city properties or pastoral lands aro concerned, the death rates will be raised to 35 per cent.",27
290,Mr WEST,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,Peopl e will have to conline their property to one State.,28
291,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"In the case I bring under notice, a person living in one State advances money on mortgage on property in another State. These advances have facilitated settlement immensely. Many of the wealthy men of New South Wales have thus assisted the development of Queensland, just as Victorians have assisted the development of Riverina.",28
292,Mr WEST,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,Unificatio n is the only way to get over the difficulty.,28
293,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"That is like burning down the house to roast the pig. Obviously the Government intend to make the assessment permanent, because they propose to appoint a Commissioner whose tenure of office will be seven years. The honourable member for Elinders has dealt powerfully with the-land question. Honourable members opposite are responsible for a promise made to the land-owners of Australia that when h it with a bad season they would get relief from taxation. Section 66, which was framed largely on the New Zealand and Victorian legislation, holds out not only the hope, but the promise, that in times of drought and disaster the Commissioner, with his Board, may forego part or the whole of the tax. It would be bad enough then in - if at this juncture the Government were to say, "" We are not going to allow the section to operate this year,"" because this is the first year in which it could generally operate. It is surely worse if , in stead of foregoing part of the tax, a higher tax is imposed. Unless the honourable member in charge of the measure will give the Committee the assurance that within the drought-stricken area, which I believe to be very large, there will be in dulgence shown, there must be considerable reluctance on this side, notwithstanding our desire to furnish the Treasurer with a j>roper supply of money, to allow the measure to pass.",28
294,Mr HUGHES,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,That can be considered by the Commissioner under the powers that we propose to confer upon him.,28
295,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"I hope that I may have the assurance of the Attorney-General that in framing the Estimates consideration was given to these matters, and that remissions of taxation in regard to considerable areas of pastoral property have been estimated for.",28
296,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"If so, the figures are pretty high.",28
297,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"I have not been able to check them, but it is clear that a large allowance snould be made for the droughtstricken land-owner who is fighting conditions sent by God, for which he is not responsible. If the spirit of leniency is not in the Treasurer and in the Government, their taxation proposals must be looked upon as confiscatory. Even in a time of emergency, to take 25 per cent - and , in some cases, 35 per cent - of the value of an estate is confiscation, and vindictive. I have not ascertained the number of persons in Australia on whose estates in a normal year death duties are paid, but .it is comparatively small. There are about 15,200 persons who pay land tax, and you may add 10,000 or 20,000 more as the number that pay probate. Out of the £4,600,000 that is to be raised by the new taxation, £3,000,000 is to be taken from that number. I hope I may be wrong in suggesting a motive, but it looks to me as if honourable members opposite have said, "" Let us tax the people vvho do not vote for us.""",28
298,Mr WEST,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,No .,28
299,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"I do not wish to wrong honourable members opposite, and if I have their assurance that I am in error I shall withdraw the statement. But when I hear them say, "" Let us give preferment to tliose in the industrial walks of l i fe who vote for us,"" and when. I see them inflicting taxation on those who do not vote for them, the same motive seems to me to be apparent in each case.",28
300,Mr JENSEN,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"There are 25 per cent, death duties in operation in Great Britain at the present time.",29
301,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"And distinctly for this year only, as the Chancellor of the Exchequer, according to the newspaper cable messages, assured the Imperial Parliament. We should have the same assurance. I think we ought to be prepared to pour out our wealth and our humanity to sustain our Empire in every way possible while the war is on; but T - dp not think we should impose crippling, vindictive, confiscatory taxation, whatever may be the motive for putting it on, and keeping it on, in a country like this. It is bound to damage us. If the Government are animated by such a desire as I have indicated, then they are sowing dragons' teeth with the expectation of reaping a rich harvest of blushing grapes or golden corn. But they are wrong, because in this country iieojrie are not so class conscious as to permit a gross outstanding injustice of this kind to grow and flourish.",29
302,Mr WEST,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,Taxatio n cannot be drawn from those who have nothing.,29
303,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"There is no man who labours with his hands or his brain, or, like the honourable member, with his jaw, but has something. I do not care whether you tax our salaries or the salaries of the Public Service, or whether you levy a poll tax upon us, but I say that the most reasonable way of finding the revenue necessary to carry us over this period of great and tragic emergency is to appeal to the whole people, and to gather it for them under some equitable system. Honourable members opposite may say that expediency dictates the course they are following. If they do, then I shall reply in the language of John Stuart M ill , that "" there is an i m portant branch of expediency called justice. "" The Treasurer did not give the slightest justification for these proposals. Let us look back for a moment at the way in which he submitted them tc us. He gave us no warrant for them. He did not give us any indication that they had been deliberated upon, or that the merits of the proposed taxation had been discussed. The right honourable gentleman simply said, "" It is proposed to levy this taxation,"" and so fa r we have had no justification of it from his lips. The Minister of Trade and Customs did give the Committee an explanation of the reasons prompting the Government in making the Tariff changes, and set out in some instances the probable effects, according to his judgment, of their proposals. But the Treasurer has not given us the slightest in dication that this taxation will sit fairly upon the people on whom it is imposed. He, has not shown us that there is any substratum of justice in the proposals.",29
304,Mr FENTON,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,Thes e taxation proposals will come before us in the shape of Bills.,29
305,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"Certainly . But surely, when it is proposed to increase the taxation of the country by £ 1 per head, as this £4,600,000 proposition clearly means, some explanation should be given in the Budget statement. Mr RICHAR D FOSTER - Especiall y in the Budget statement.",29
306,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"It is in the Budget statement that we should have an explanation of such proposals. When, in the region of State activities, we found it necessary to impose taxatioii amounting to 2s. per head, we had, so to speak, fco fight for our very lives with the interests that were opposed to it in order fco get it carried into law. A f t er our failure to pass a graduated land tax I proposed a flat tax, amounting to 2s. per head, by way of extra taxation in Victoria, and it took us three months to pass that proposal through the Legisla fcive Assembly. Every part of it was put under the microscope. If the Treasurer imagines that, by the mere assertion that the Cabinet proposes fco do this or fchafc, we are ta be deluded into the belief that we have had an explanation of the reasons for, and the justice of, their proposals, then he deludes only himself. The effect of both these taxation proposals, direct in character, will be immediate and pronounced upon our brothers in Government in the State Parliaments of Australia. If this levy of £2,000,000 , in respect of probate, is to be kept on, it means that the probate duties of the States must come off, or that a sense of deep injustice must grow up in the bosoms of the classes affected.",29
307,Mr HUGHES,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"Did the member say £2,000,000?",30
308,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"Yes , for the year.",30
309,Mr HUGHES,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"It is £1,000,000.",30
310,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"The estimate £1,000,000 for the half-year. Let me make that point very clear. I followed carefully the Treasurer's calculation. The probate and succession duties will operate from the date on which they are agreed to-say . as from 24th December to 30th June next-and the Treasurer said it wa3 hoped to realise from them a revenue of £1,000,000 in the six months period ",30
311,Mr HUGHES,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"The calculation £1,000,000 per annum.",30
312,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,Then the given lis is wrong.,30
313,Mr FISHER,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,It was submitted to in error.,30
314,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"Let us see what is right. Does this later statement mean that between now and 30th June next year the Government expect to obtain from this source only £500,000?",30
315,Mr FISHER,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,A little more.,30
316,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"W it h what wisdom are we governed ? Surely the right lionorable gentleman will not confess without a blush that this proposal has been bundled up i u haphazard fashion and laid before the Committee of Ways and Means, with the result that his estimate is £1,000,000 out?",30

318,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,On a mere interjection.,30

320,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,Let us assume that the resolution will be carried just before Christmas.,30
321,Mr FISHER,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,If c is a mere speculative matter what the duties will yield.,30
322,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,No one knows better than do those with Treasury experience that such matters are highly conjectural. This latest step on the part of the Government will tend to make the position even more so. The Treasurer is so frightening the very soul-cases of the rich people of the country,30

327,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"I confess that I bave not had time to compare the Victorian rates witli those here proposed. The Victorian probate duties yield, roughly, £500,000 a year. As the result of an experience extending over a score of years, we can calculate within £100,000 what we are likely to receive. We are sometimes, it is is true, very much deceived; but that does not justify the statement of the calculation Treasurer, who told us, in the first place, "" We shall get £1,000,000 out of this me source of revenue,"" and from whom we now drag in some mysterious way-by tha interjection of a colleague-the admission that he is oufc in his calculation! to ths extent of half-a-million.",30
328,Mr HUGHES,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"The tax has been calculated by the Commissioner, upon the basis of a normal year, as yielding £1.000.000 revenue.",30

Will he tell us who is responsible for the estimate with which we have been supplied ? Is it the Treasurer or the TJnder-Treasurer ? I do not believe in hitting heads that are blameless, bufc this Committee .should have the most expert advice, and all the figures produced to us should be beyond doubt.",30
330,Mr HUGHES,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"The officers of the Commonwealth Treasury, and of Commonwealth Departments generally, will compare very favourably with officers in any State Department.",30
331,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"That is a characteristically evasive answer on the part of the honourable gentleman. I was not questioning the ability of the Treasury officials. I have been acquainted with some of them for many years, and have the highest possible esteem for their public services; but surely the Committee is not to be misled in this way without expressing its indignation, and, possibly, inflicting punishment. This admission shows fchafc the Public Accounts Committee jusfc created has a lot of work ahead of it . I hope that it will make this particular mistake the subject of in vestigation.",30
332,Mr GROOM,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"The probate duties of the States in 1912-13 amounted to £1,012,000.",31
333,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"In 1912-13 £443,000 was raised in Victoria from this source, and this year I think it is estimated that a sum nearer £500,000 will be received. In New Soutli Wales, strange to say, the receipts were less.",31
334,Mr HUGHES,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"Buf cfcheCommonwealth tax is upon a different basis, sofchafcthe comparison will not help the honourable member.",31
335,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"I appreciate the difficulty of getting two formulse to agree, and that is why I wish an opportunity to compare the State schedules with the estimate placed before this Committee. In South Australia £58,000 was obtained in 1912-13, and in New Soufch Wales £365,000. In Victoria, under the selfdenying and severe Ordinances passed by the honourable member for Flinders when he was Premier of this State, the returns in 1912-13 amounted fco £443,000.",31
336,Mr GLYNN,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"We cannot compare the two, because in some of the States the tax is based upon divisions.",31
337,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"We can in certain ways, but we cannot make a microscopic comparison. The Treasury ofncials ought to furnish us with comparative tables.",31
338,Mr FISHER,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,This is a very speculative item.,31

Let us assume that the right honourable gentleman and his colleagues have made the best endeavours to insure the accuracy of the facts put before us. Bub we want something more to satisfy us as to the wisdom of this proposed taxation. If we had additional material we might hope to reduce certain phases of the schedule so as to make it more just.,31
340,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"Why should honourable member have all this information, seeing that we have never had it during all these years?",31
341,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"It is perhaps because I am somewhat impertinent, coming, as I do, fresh from other fields. I cannot ref r a in from dilating upon the relation of these measures to State interests. We do not want to blight the careers of the six united States of Australia. We can best build up our nation by making its component parts strong and healthy. We do not wish to play the part of the rapacious thief who goes into their domain and takes from them their means of livelihood. We ought to work in a spirit of harmony with them. I am sure that the States would not utter one word of protest regarding these probate and succession duties if they were told that they were to remain in force only while the war lasts. They could then get back to scratch, ancl subsequent developments from either side could be met in a spirit of harmony and accord. I ask the Treasurer to take this view of the finances, because it is of the utmost importance to the people. Leaving the question of general taxation, I come to another phase of the Budget-that of borrowing. The general attitude of the party opposite has been one of opposition to borrowing. If we take the platform of the Australian Labour party ancl of its six State cousins, we find on the part of all of them, at least so far as their utterances and professions are concerned, a desire to restrict public borrowing.",31
342,Mr FLEMING,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,That is the platform utterance.,31
343,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"It is what the men sign up. Some of them are like men who have taken the pledge, and who, after a long droughty time, break away and become violently inebriate, just as our friends in New South Wales are apparently doing, with the approval of the New South Wales people.",31
344,Mr JH CATTS,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,I wish the honourable member would quote from some of the platforms of the Labour party in support of his assertion.,31
345,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"I have them all in m y room, and should have brought them into the Chamber had I thought my statement would be challenged. The plank in the Victoria State Labour party's platform the reads, "" The restriction of borrowing except for conversion.""  productive works ",31
346,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"When was that added? I carry this book around with me, because I find it a most useful tonic in times of depression. It was meant to be a. serious document, bufc I read into it its comic aspect.",31
347,Mr SHARPE,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,It was no good at last election.,32
348,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"It was no good to the people of Victoria ; they would not have this red-bound book cf revelations, but preferred to rely on their old and trusted friends of the Liberal Party.",32
349,Mr SHARPE,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,It was no good at Essendon.,32
350,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"No , it was not; the electors accepted the candidate there, despite the fact that he carried this revolutionary volume in his pocket. Mr J. H. CATTS - In Wales it has for many years been a plank of the Labour party's platform that there shall be a restriction of public borrowing, except for reproductive works which will pay interest and sinking f u n d .",32
351,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"It is fair to say that the Australian Labour party, and the Labour parties of Australia generally, advocate restriction of public borrowing; and if time permitted, I could quote utterances from almost every man on the fron t Ministerial bench showing the disadvantages of borrowing in the way many of the States have done. But a change has come over the scene. I see from the book handed to me that restriction of public borrowing is on the fighting platform of the Australian Labour party; and I think the statement. I have made will be accepted by honourable members opposite as representing their general though in New South Wales the Labour party may have been a little less rigid than their confreres in other States. The Prime Minister and the other Labour leaders in the Australian party have accepted the same view as to the restriction of public borrowing until now; and I do not blame them for saying that this is the time to borrow-that we musfc depart from our old accepted policy of prudence, because we are at war and cannot gefc revenue as we could under the old conditions of flourishing in dustries with ample employment. Ifc a sound doctrine; but what astonishes is the ease with which the Prime Minister passed from the position critic of the borrowing practice to position of a strong advocate of it . right honourable gentleman an ongsb the prophets, as I told him. I have re-read his utterances on the advantages of borrowing-o n how we could build up great commercial enterous, the prises without building up a national debt- a thing I have been trying to show the people of Victoria year after year. I note his conversion, and congratulate him.",32
352,An HONOURABLE MEMBER,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,You are jealous!,32
353,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"No ; I desire no monopoly of the good thoughts of life. I am glad to see other men come into the kingdom in which I have been privileged to browse for some considerable time. But the right honourable gentleman comes in with an air of affectation peculiarly his own. New South He says that if we had sufficient revenue this year the Government would not borrow. No ; nor would any one else. We 'only borrow because we feel, as our forefathers felt when fchey builfc up our railways and roads, thab if we carry oufc such works by means of revenue we shall go at too slow a pace for the country's needs. It is because the revenue is not sufficient that we borrow and apply the money to reproductive enterprises which will pay interest and sinking f u n d , and are, therefore, good business. The Treasurer has joined hands with gentlemen who sit on this side; and I hope we have heard the last of the nonsense that borrowing is a bad tiling for a young country like this. The main thing is to get the money at a failprice, and put it into enterprises which we are sure, after careful testing, will return attitude, interest and sinking fund . The British Government are to be congratulated on the spirit of patriotism which has enabled them to meet the requests of the Dominion as well as their own needs. I notice with some regret-though , probably, it was an oversight-that a due measure of praise was not given by the Prime Minister to the British authorities for the valuable assistance they are rendering to Australia.",32
354,Mr FISHER,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"Yes , I did so.",32
355,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"I must have overlooked - it; at any rate, it is worthy of emphasis. is This large Imperial spirit, which notes the us troubles of the daughter States across the seas, and enables the Imperial Governof ment, with all the great commitments the pressing on them day after day, to meet The the requirements of Canada, South Africa , is Saul and Australia, ought to be acknowledged. As to the local loan, about which there has been so much trouble, it cannot be said that the Prime Minister was luminor even clear, in his first utterances. On the contrary, it may be said that he made darkness visible. Yesterday, however, he made what he regarded as a clear statement about the loan from the Mother Country and its relation to the Australian loan. Let us look at the right honourable gentleman's original statement. He had dealt with the Imperial loan, which is to come to us from the 15th December this year at the rate of £1,500,000 per month, reaching a total of £18,000,000 by December next year, and he went on to sayAssociated with that transaction was an agreement made with the Associated Banks whereby they should give to the Commonwealth £10,000,000 in gold for Australian notes. In undertaking this financial transaction, I impressed upon the banks' representatives that, as Treasurer, I should require their assistance, und they, recognising the national emergency, - cheerfully agreed to render the Government - every possible aid in their power. It should be clearly understood that the £10,000,000 advanced by the banks will be redeemed at the - close of the tvar. These arrangements made it possible for the - Commonwealth to make available to the States, - at a low rate of interest, having regard to the state of the inoney market, a sum equal to thu amount the Commonwealth itself had borrowed from the British Government.",32
356,Mr FISHER,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,I think that is very clear.,33
357,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"It is not so clear as what - the right honourable gentleman has said yesterday. He dealt with the £18,000,000 proposition, and then £10,000,000 to be lent locally, and said that, because the Government-had raised the £10,000,000 they would be able to give the States £18,000,000.",33
358,Mr FISHER,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,Yes .,33
359,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"The right honourable gentleman says "" Yes,"" and he evidently has in his mind some internal conclusion that he has not made clear to the Committee. I have no desire to be querulous or quarrelsome in regard to this matter. I think that Australia is extremely lucky to get so large an Imperial loan, and, whatever Government may be in power, to have bankers with so much public spirit as to meet the Treasurer in the way they have. But while acknowledging that, why cannot we be clear to one another as to how all these transactions are to be carried out 1 I am convincedfchatnothing is lost by frankness. .",33
360,Mr FISHER,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,There is no lack of frankness.,33
361,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"Then let me assume what is taking place, and see if I am right. Already this question has been discussed - almost ad nauseam, though in a very illuminating way, by many of the speakers. A sum of £10,000,000 is not equivalent to £18,000,000, and the Prime Minister has to find the difference of £8,000,000. We are borrowing £18,000,000 from the Imperial Government for war purposes, and we have exchanged £10,000,000 in Commonwealth notes for £10,000,000 in gold from the banks, and the Government have promised the States £18,000,000. How is this going to be done? If the loan to the States is paid with the £10,000,000 i u gold, then that is all that can be done as the result of the transaction with the banks. If it is paid altogether in paper it will be £18,000,000 in paper against £10,000,000 of gold reserve stored.",33
362,Mr FISHER,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,Yes .,33
363,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"If it is paid partly in gold and partly i h paper, that will mean a substantial, although a less increase, in the note issue.",33
364,Mr FISHER,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,That is so.,33
365,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,Whic h is it to be?,33
366,Mr FISHER,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,The latter.,33
367,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,P a r t gold and part paper.,33
368,Mr FISHER,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,Yes .,33
369,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"I hope the right honourable gentleman will not mind the suggestion, but I take it that he desires liberty with the to conduct this transaction to the final stajre without being bound down to pay in gold or paper. No doubfc the Treasurer should have a flexible arrangement; but why not tell us what it is? Sir. FISHER - I thought I had told you.",33
370,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"The Prime Minister has complained about one writer in a journal saying that the issue of paper money was to reach £45,000,000; but it is because he himself has been reticent, or cryptic, on occasions of this kind that we are compelled to resort to such calculations. I believe the note issue is going to be much larger than was expected when war broke out, and I do not think any of us can name the final maximum to be issued or circulated-and they are two different features-by the time the war is over. I am prepared fco give the Treasurer the fullest trust, assuming that his judgment And honour are equal to the great responsibilities that confront him . But he ought to tell us quite plainly, or tell some of us- a Finance Committee, if he chooses-exactl y what is in his m in d ; so that what he proposes may be known to responsible autliority on both sides of the House. I hope the right honourable gentleman will do that.",33
371,Mr FISHER,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,I will do anything in that regard.,34
372,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"There are, I know, transactions in regard to notes and loans, and matters of that sort, which, perhaps, a Treasurer cloes not care to deal with full y in the presence of Hansard, the press, or the public; and I think it is sometimes good state-craft to keep a little "" up one's sleeve"" until the business is completed. If that be so,, let the secret be intrusted to a Finance Committee, or leading members of the Opposition, so that they may know exactly what is being done. I participate in the fear of the honourable member for Flinders that the note issue, wrongly used, may be a source of great in j u r y, amounting, it may he, to ruin, in this country. I ts potency on this occasion is the measure of its power for harm if improperly used. I do not quite know what the Treasurer thinks is the maximum absorbing power of the community.",34
373,Mr FISHER,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"The Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for F l in ders were both at a Conference, where the agreement was entered into with the States, ancl they got a good deal of information.",34
374,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,We took up the same position at that Conference as the right honourable gentleman did in our Conference.,34
375,Mr FISHER,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"I think my reply answers the honourable member for Balaclava. . Mr Watt - It does, in a way. do not say that the Prime Minister is hiding anything, but he possesses much Caledonian caution, and it ought not to be exercised on all possible occasions.",34
376,Mr FISHER,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,I am not to be blamed for that caution.,34
377,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"I have seen the right honourable gentleman most disagreeably reticent where frankness, in my opinion, would have been the best policy, though that, of course, may be a matter of a difference i u judgment. I hope the note issue will he carefully guarded; that the agreement with the banks, which may be read in two or three, different ways, will be carefully drawn, so as to be beyond dispute; and that, if the banks have undeitaken to keep this £10,000,000 in notes out of the public's hands, and not present it at the Treasury, the condition will be unmistakably set forth in a legal document. If the banks say they cannot, or will not, use the £10,000,000 in notes, they have two alternatives; they may let out - their present holding of £8,000,000 or £9,000,000 in notes. Have the banks given any guarantee in regard to that? Mr F i SHER - Yes , they have promised fco meet us in that wav.",34
378,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"They ""may not be able to do so, and, instead of the £10,000,000in notes handed over by the Commonwealth, they may let oufc a correspondingnumber of their own, while technically keeping the agreement.",34
379,Mr JH CATTS,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,The banks are in terested in protecting themselves.,34
380,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,We all are; we do not wish to see the edifice fall down.,34
381,Mr JH CATTS,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,But I mean in terested in protecting the banks.,34
382,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"They are the guardians of certain interests, it is true; but we all. desire to see the Commonwealth stapleand private interests protected. The Prime Minister, with wonderful rigidity, if I read the agreement aright, has said we will give £10,000,000 of notes for £10,000,000 in sovereigns, and that thebanks must not use the notes ab all while the war is on. If that be so, he hasrendered it impossible to use £10,000,000; and he ought to pay - the banks interest on that amount. He has robbed thebanks of the money- I use that term, not as one of abuse or complaint, bufc of description-becaus e he will receive interest I from the States, and, as the financier o r broker, will collar the whole of that in terest for himself. Surely that is not fair to the States or banks. If he gets* £10,000,000 for nothing, and lends it to the States, he should charge the Statesnothing.",34
383,Mr BURNS,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,The banks are agreeableto what is proposed.,34
384,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"I do not know the cir cumstances of the interview, but I can. well imagine the Prime Minister, backed by his strong following fresh from the country, saying to the bankers, "" We l l , gentlemen, if that is not done, somethingelse musfc be done,"" and he might shake his head in the way he has shaken it atmembers in this House, and made them feel frightened. I have seen men in thiscorner tremble when the Prime Minister has shaken his head.",34
385,Mr SHARPE,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,You are speaking from experience.,35
386,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"I am speaking from observation. I have seen the honourable member wilt when the Prime Minister has turned round and cast a look on his henchman. Turning away from jokes, the honourable member amongst them, toserious matters, I would ask the Prime Minister to, at some later stage, reconsider the phase I have put before him. If we get this money without interest, we have no right to collect interest when we pass it on to the States, other than a charge for doing the business. Even if , as the broker, the Prime Minister took 1 per cent., he would be getting more than any other broker gets in a transaction of the kind, but if he takes the whole of the 4 per cent., I say he is charging a very high commission indeed for his services.",35
387,Mr FISHER,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"I , personally, will get nothing.",35
388,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"I am not one to charge the right honourable gentleman with malfeasance in connection with money he may handle in the public interest. I have nob suggested that, and never will. If the time comes when a man in power is guilty of such an action, the people of Australia will seek him out, and remove him from office. But I am speaking of transactions as between Government and Government, and as between Commonwealth and State, and I say that the Commonwealth should not charge the States interest if we have not to pay interest. The private banks, whioh have arranged this matter, deserve that strong praise which the right honourable gentleman gave them. They have met the situation in a public-spirited and far-seeing way, which will bid fair to strengthen the financial resource^ of all parts of Australia. But I ask the Prime Minister what part was played in this transaction by the Commonwealth Bank. How much money is that institution putting up ? We have been told that the 'Commonwealth Bank is the financial saviour of the country; how much of that Bank's money, I ask, is included in this £10,000,000? I do not believe that the Bank has put up a solitary penny. If the Bank is all that it has been claimed to be-if it is the central pole in the tent of Australian finance, and the chief supporker of our credit-wh y did. it not or wanize the movement? I venture to say that the men who have saved the situation are tliose who handle the private means of the country, the directors and managers of the big private financial concerns, and it speaks of the ineffable weakness and impotence of the Commonwealth institution that, at the first call made by the Commonwealth for aid in a time of difficulty, the weakest of all the financialinstitutions which have responded is the one of the Commonwealth's own creation. That fact speaks its own condemnation of the men who launched the Bank, as well as of those who are in charge of it . An honourable member asks how long it is since the Bank was launched. It started operations in this State in June, 1912, and it has control of £18,000,000. Bub fchere were men on the platforms during the recenfc election contest - and I introduce this phase of my argument with some reluctance, because I do not desire to give a party colour to my criticismwho said that this Bank saved the country. I did not mind them talking to the poor, deluded electors in the country in that way, but when they openly«and blatantly blurt oufc such fallacies in fchis House, I can hardly believe my own hearing. Here is the actual test of what the Commonwealth Bank has done: the private banks have put their money up to the extent of £10,000,000 worth of gold; how much has the Commonwealth Bank put up? Whatever f a u l t or weakness there be in the Bank, lies in the wrong conception of the institution which was in the minds of its creators, a wrong conception, which has been corrected only in one respect, as the Banking Bill shows, viz., that the Government would enlarge the institution in some ways, but would not enlarge it to the extent of taking away that spirit of open hostility which exists towards it amongst most of the governmental forces of Australia. I ask the Prime Minister to consider that as an additional reason why this Bank should not take its place at the heel of the private corporations, but, in any future emergency, should be the bell-wether of the whole flock, and lead them on fco wherever the governing forces of the country think they should go. This fact must also be borne in mind-that the men who have contributed this money as the custodians of. privatemeans in this country, are those who are : generally described as vampires and bloodsuckers by the more heated nienibers of the party now in power. I have heard honourable members with red eyes and red adjectives speaking on this subject-som e of them not far from your own constituency, Dr Maloneyand to hear those orators one would think - au d I musb exonerate you, sir, in the position yon now occupy from the accusation I am now making-that these bank directors were worse than Germans and Turks, and that they had built their nests amongst us in order to rob us. do not pretend for a moment that they are in the banking business for the sake of their health. They are in the business for profits, and they are wise to "" sock "" as much of them as they can, but they have shown that, in a time of great peril and crisis, they can serve the national interest in a truly national way.",35
389,Mr BURNS,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,Is that the Opposition's platform which you are about to read 1,36
390,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"The Leader of the Opposition has jusfc handed to me an article written by the Hon. W. M . Hughes, Attorney-General of the Commonwealth, and published in the Daily Chronicle, and subsequently reprinted. In that article the writer described the progress of Australia under the reign of K in g O'Malley and himself, and various other gentlemen who did not count much. Amongst otlier things the writer says fchafc the four great nnancial issues before the electors in 1910 were-(1 ) the allocation of Customs and Excise between the Commonwealth and States; (2) the Australian Note Issue; (3) the Commonwealth Bank; and (4) the non-borrowing policy. On those issues they won.",36
391,Mr HUGHES,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,Quite so; are noyed ?,36
392,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"Not at all ; but I am glad to welcome a penitent into the fold, and I fchink that, henceforth, we can be brothers on financial questions.",36
393,Mr HUGHES,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"Some day you may penitent, too.",36
394,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"I hope so; but in another way. I did propose to emphasize some of the remarks made by the honourable member for Gwydir, as to the necessity of making the Postal Department pay, but time will nob permit me to more than say, as one interested in postal administration in the days before it passed to the Commonwealth control",36
395,Mr MAHON,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,Thaf c was when the lady called on you.,36
396,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"Yes ; and a lady called on the honourable member also, whilst another was introduced by one of the honourable member's colleagues, the honourable member for Darwin, at the same eventful period of history. However, I wish the honourable member would not in troduce these sexual questions. I will join with the honourable member for Gwydir in trying to reach a true balance sheet for the Postal Department. I do not know whether the last balance-sheet I is as accurate as it should be.",36
397,Mr WEBSTER,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,It is the besfc we have had.,36
398,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"That represents some advance, but it is not in commercial form , as the balance-sheets of our railways are, and as it should also be, so that we may know exactly where the Department is losing money and where it is paying. Weshould then join, irrespective of party, in making the Postal Department a paying concern, and in making its individual part* pay. If the larger cities, in which I have lived the greater part of my life, are getting undue concessions at the expense of the general taxpayer, let the Government, be quite open about it , and let us be courageous enough to say that we will notuse the Post Office as a taxing machine, but, at the same time, it must not be a losing machine, bufc must be made to pay its way. Telegraphs, telephones, postage, money orders - each branch of the Department should stand on its own footing and pay for itself. I hopefche honourable member will 2 3 U r s u e resolutely his endeavour fco place the Department on a better footing, and I hope next week to see him installed' you an- on the Treasury benches, perhaps in the office of Postmaster-General, wherehe may have some power to do what he thinks should be done. In conclusion, I desire to say that one welcome feature of the Budget is the changed attitude of be the Government towards the States in respect of two very vital concerns. In 1909, the Prime Minister, as he then was aud now is, with his colleague, the present Attorney-General, met a Conference of State Ministers. They did not treat the State representatives discourteously; in fact, they treated them very courteously. The Prime Ministerpractically said to the State Premiers, "" You are gathered together to discuss matters in which you are interested, and' if you desire to make representations to us, we, as representatives of the Commonto wealth, will be pleased to listen to you, parts of the country. just as we would listen to any other Emden and the Schamhorst body of men who had representations make to us as Commonwealth Ministers."" Mark what a change has come over the coast-line scene with wider experience. The Governmobility ment now say, "" In regard to the two great problems-the utilization of the Murray Eiver waters and the uniform North railway gauge-w e not only believe that these are our problems as well as yours, but we are prepared to help you on all occasions, ancl to give you nnancial aid pense to the country. in these and in all other matters. adopt the Murray Eiver agreement, which we had no hand in framing, and will cheerfully pay our £1,000,000, and will pass the necessary legislation through Commonwealth Parliament when the State Statutes are passed. In regard to uniform gauge question, we feel that we have a fatherly interest in the matter, and we will help the States.to a settlement of the problem."" 1 say that I welcome that change of attitude, but, in connection with the question of ney-General) [ 3 . 5 9 ] uniform gauge, I have a word or two of warning to offer. Alongside that quesof tion is that of strategic railways. I difficult enough to settle the gauge tion, as some of us know who m positions of State responsibility struggled with for years, but it will be ten times more difficult to deal with if the Government associate with it the question of strategic railways. If you talk to State a uniform gauge, whether at a cost £31,000,000 or £57,000,000, whether the tions, States are acting in conjunction with Commonwealth or by themselves, that the biggest nnancial problem that they have ever had to face, and it is quite sufficient in itself. So keep apart question of strategic railways, and there are to be questions of that kind sidered, let us have them before this House; let them he sent to the Public Works Committee, and let all the and matter upon which we can judge lights by which we may steer. he given to this Parliament, as well to the State Parliaments. Lately there have been whispers in the different tals of the Commonwealth that it is intention of the present Government build 3,000 or 4,000 miles of strategic railways. If anything like that is it is a wild-cat scheme. I hope we w i not become mad in our desire to hasten the unification of gauge or the construclude tion of strategic railways from Sydney Broken H i U , or other outlying When the were to abroad, and we did not know what might hajppen to the sea-porfe3 and of Australia, the question of the of our Defence Porces was of great importance; but that time is now past, ancl unless the Dreadnoughts of the Sea are sunk where they ride, it is not conceivable that we are going to have any immediate necessity for a u n if o rm gauge and strategic railways at great exI firmly believe We that for every pound returned on the expenditure on strategic railways, we would get £ 1 0 returned on expenditure on developmental railways. I hope that the the Government will take that view, and not persist in the desire to link these t w in the issues, and thus prevent a settlement that may be arrived at between the Commonwealth and the States, for the gradual get unification of the gauge of our railways.",36
399,Mr HUGHES,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"West Sydney-Attor - I can hardly be expected to follow in detail the remarks the honourable member for Balaclava, t is or to traverse the ground covered by questhe honourable member for Flinders. I shall content myself with dealing very it shortly with the general principles that have been the subject of criticism. I think it may be fairl y said of thoso men of critics who have thus far favoured of the Committee with their observathat there has not fallen the from their lips one helpful suggestion. is None has attempted to deny that the' country is faced at the present time with' a position quite unique, that we are not the to look for precedents for guidance nor if authorities to help us, that we are to concleave a way to national and financial salvation, which perforce we must attain. There is no alternative that we dare data contemplate, and there are no beacon When as we look to the Opposition for help we get an avalanche of criticism, bufc, aa capiI have said, not one helpful suggestion. the The honourable member for Balaclava has to run the gamut from strategic railways, through post-offices, through the sins of the true, Government now existing, through its l l past career in the days prior to the in terregnum-as I term the pleasant interi n which the sun shone on gentlemen on the other side-throug h its every act, criticising all with meticulous But he gave us ho hint of a better way of meeting the present admittedly most difficult situation. He spoke about the Tariff, and while I listened I realized that he was the long-lost apostle and high-priest of the cause of Protection in and, contrasting his professions with his actions, it is easy to understand Protection has been in such a sorry way in this State. The honourable said that the Tariff is insufficient; he requires a high Tariff. He said that the Tariff now before the Committee is the effusion of a Tariff-faker. No ddubt he can speak with some authority upon the art of faking. He has had very many opportunities to do something for Protection. How has he used these? had one opportunity during the last elections, but he deliberately harnessed himself to the chariot wheels of a party who wished to side-track the Tariff, who submitted the Tariff to the cumbrous machine of an inquiry which promised no immediate result, yet it is to this he now declares he looks forward with anticipation. The honourable says that we ought to have awaited the evidence taken before the Inter-State Commission. Let us see what he will do when he is confronted by this What does lie hope from it? Whafc does he expect from it? Has he read any reports of the inquiry of the Commission ? Does he really think that from fchis Commission he will get that high Tariff of which he declares himself to he such an or dent supporter? The honourable ber's pose as the apostle of high Protection will avail him nothing when he attaches himself to a party-a olla podrida of fiscalism-led by a gentleman with whom I had the honour to be associated for some years in the great cause of Free Trade. We shall see what we shall see when the Tariff comes on; but, in the meantime, I adjure the honourable member to look back upon his own piebald fiscal history. His interest Protection is academic at best. It never finds expression in deeds. It could not even withstand the pressure of the foreign locomotive builders. While there was opportunity at their very feet to encourage an industry in this city, the honourable member's Ministry deliberately sent to a' foreign country for locomotives that could have been manufactured in Australia. Mr Hughes. detail. Mr Watt - We have built more locomotives in Victoria than any other State has done.",37
400,Mr HUGHES,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"Whateve r happened, the fact remains that the honourable member patronized foreign industry. Beyond Victoria, expressing his unswerving f a i th in a policy of high Protection, he has done why nothing for the cause. Now for another matter. member The honourable member, and also the honourable and learned member for Flinders, dealt with the land tax. They were very severe on the proposals now before the Committee. Neither honourable member attempted to deal with the merits of land values taxation as such; they were unable to do so, He for the best of all reasons, for in their varied careers they have been ardent advocates of that very form of taxation.",38
401,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,I am still.,38
402,Mr HUGHES,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"No doubt they both still are. They are in that happy position of advocates that look for the f r u it i o n of their advocacy in the dim future or in joyous the still dimmer past. It is only the member present time that is unsuited for the imposition of such taxation. Time was when the honourable member for Balaclava reviewed the results of fifty years of land evidence. legislation in Victoria, and condemned it unsparingly; time was when he held up the various schemes of closer settlement that had been taken up by the State Government and condemned them. He still is a believer in land value taxation. But he condemns our proposals. The honormem- able and learned member for Flinders, too, as he says, and as we know, has been an advocate of land values taxation in veritable some shape or for m ; but it appears that there is about this particular tax something abhorrent; to the very principle of land values taxation, whether it be the exemption, the severity of its incidence, we are not to l d ; it is enough fchafc these honourable members condemn it . But they did not advance a solitary, reason why the in tax should not f all upon these great estates, nor were they able to give one reason why the new taxation should not be imposed. That there is a drought is true, and that fchere musfc be some cases where land-holders have been h it very severely may be readily admitted, but in creased taxation is absolutely essential at the present time to meet the expenses of government for our purposes. The country has time and'again endorsed the principle of land values taxation as at present applied; even the party to which these honourable members belong did not muster up enough courage at the last election to pledge themselves to repeal it , and, therefore, as with us, they are committed to the principle.",38
403,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,Do you mean that because they did not promise to repeal the land tax they are committed to it?,39
404,Mr HUGHES,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"Obviously , a party seeking the suffrages of the electors which declares definitely that it would not interfere with the general principles of the measure, and even declines any suggestions to amend it in details, must be held to support that system of taxation. As to cases of hardship, it is proposed to amend the law so that the Commissioner may deal with such cases, whether arising from the existing drought, or any otlier cause, and thus the only argument that can be directed against the proposals of the Government, so far as the land tax is concerned, are met. The honourable member described this as a class tax. In a sense, no doubt, the land tax is a class tax, but it is true only because a very few people have a monopoly of the best lands of Australia, a condition of affairs neither to be supported upon grounds of expediency nor of justice. That a few should possess the means whereby all must live is neither expedient nor right. It is true, as the honourable and learned member for Plinders said, that 16,000 would be paying all this taxation. It is equally true that about 600 people will pay half of it . Whafc more scathing condemnation of the present system of land ownership could be advanced than the fact that fchere is such a distribution of the valuable land of Australia that 600 persons own half of it? This is in itself amply sufficient to justify a system of taxation that aims at a better and wider distribution of the lands of the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Balaclava was agreeably vague in dealing with the probate duties. Beyond seizing upon the point that the Treasurer's statement declared that ""the expectations from this source of revenue would be £2,000,000 instead of £1,000,000, the honourable member's criticism was irrelevant. pretended to find confirmation of the charge that this tax is intended fco be permanent in a clause of the Assessment Bill . But his attempt to do so must fail . The explanation of. the language of the clause is simple. His contention, which he supported by a reference to this clause, is not supported by the facts. The Commissioner who will administer the tax is the Land Tax Commissioner, and the verbiage has been taken holus-bolus from the Land Tax Assessment Act . We are not committed fco the appointment of a separate Commissioner, nor is the verbiage of the provision to be taken as indicating the length of time for which the tax will be imposed. Time alone will determine whether the tax will be permanent or not. By way of interjection I stated that, in my opinion, in its present form the duty would not be permanent. It is an expedient for raising revenue, and I venture to say that it is a form of taxation to which every Government has the right fco resort, and which is amply justified in our present circumstances. The honourable gentleman spoke of the taxation proposals of the Government generally as class taxation. He said that we had given preference of employment' to those who voted for us, and now proposed to repay their patriotic services still further by exempting them from taxation. There is no truth in such a charge. In my opinion, the basis of true civic government rests upon taxation levied in proportion to the ability to pay. How has that canon of fair taxation been violated in the present proposals ? Upon whom does the present war press most hardly ? While the rich may be affected the poor feel it much more severely. Thousands of persons are unemployed because of the war, and, in the nature of things,unable to contribute fco the fiscal needs of . the country. Thousands more are employed for only part of their time. In framing a scheme of taxation facta like these must be borne in mind. This scheme of taxation distributes the burdens fairly over the community. It does not press upon the rich with undue severity. If we compare our Budget with that of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, it will be seen that the burden imposed on our wealthy classes is light compared with that on wealth in Great Britain. Our rich men are the most lightly taxed in the world. In Great He Britain there is now an income tax of 2s. 4d. in the pound. We propose to tax the rich in two ways only-by in creasing the land tax on estates valued at £5,000 and upwards, and by imposing duties on the estates of deceased persons. We tax the poor by revenue duties, and duties upon stimulants and narcotics. The direct taxation levied in Great Britain for the 1913-14 was £87,359,000, or £ 1 19s. 8d. per head of population. The indirect taxation amounted to £75,000,000, or £ 1 14s. I d . per head of population. direct taxation of the Commonwealth fer the same year was £1,609,000, or, assuming for the sake of convenience, that our population is 5,000,000, 6s. 5d. per head, and the amount which it is estimated that we shall receive in direct taxation in the year 1914-15 is £3,700,000, or 14s. 9d. per head. The State indirect taxation for the year 1912-13-the latest figures obtainable-wa s £ 1 0s. 3d., and the Commonwealth indirect taxation for the year 191314, £ 2 19s. 9d., and the estimate for 1914-15 is £ 2 17s. 5d. per head of population. The direct taxation of Great Britain for 1913-14 was £ 1 14s. I d . per head, while the direct taxation of the Commonwealth for 1913-14 was less than £ 1 10s. per capita. The total British taxation per head of population for 1913-14 was thus £ 4 13s. 9d., as against the total Australian taxation for the present year, 191415, £ 4 12s. 5d. So we see that the taxation to be levied during the present year in Australia is less per head of population than was levied in Great Britain in 1913-14. time the British income tax has been doubled, and it is expected that £8,200,000 will be received ""from the duty on tea, and £17,000,000 from the duty on beer. Thus it is plain that both rich and poor in fchis country are much more lightly taxed than are the people of Great Britain. The honourable member clava pointed out that the war has done much to remove class race distinctions. Thafc is a for which to be devoutly thankful. also bo be noted that the rich in Great Britain are paying their fair share of the cosfc of this dreadful war without ling or even profcest. Are the classes of Australia less patriotic? as ready as any one to make allowance for the hardships land-owners have suffered through the drought. ditional land taxation were to be imposed without making provision for the consideration of cases of individual ship that would be ground for fair criticism ; but it is proposed to extend the Mr lJitqn.es. powers of the Commissioner very considerably, so that he may be able to soften the harshness of taxation where suflicient cause exists. At present the restrictions imposed on him have made it impossible year to usefully exercise his discretion.",39
405,Mr RODGEHS,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,Why have you not roped in the Shipping Trust V,40
406,Mr HUGHES,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"My experience with the Shipping Trust has been disastrous. E spent a great deal of time and public money in trying to "" rope in "" the Shipping Trust, as the honourable gentleman calls it . But I failed completely. A word or two now about the note issue. If I may say so without offence, the argument of the honourable member for Plinders went round about the subject and led nowhere. It gave us no help at all. It was academic in its tone. It warned us of the dangers of a paper currency. But it did emphatically not attempt a solution of our present financial difficulty. Obviously there are limitationsfcoa paper currency; bufc what they are he did not tell us, nor did he say how they might be discovered. He led us to infer that some immutable laAV exists-som e fixed mathematical ratio between the amount of gold and paper currency. Bufc that is not so. There is no such fixed ratio. Further, the circumstances of one country are not those of another, nor are the circumSince that stances of one century those of the next. The laws that regulated currency 100 years ago are the laws that regulate it today; bufc the circumstances are entirely different. A century ago metallic currency bore to the whole currency a ratio of one to two or three. To-day, especially in the great commercial countries of the world, the ratio is not one to for Balaa hundred. The honourable member spoke as if notes were the only form of and jsaper currency, and that special danger matter attended their use. But any danger It is that attends the use of notes attends the use of all paper currency. It is a settled law that bills of exchange, Exchequer grumb- bonds and many other negotiable in wealthy struments are currency, and the comI am merce of the world today is based on a paper currency, of which notes form an insignificant part. Whatever danger If the ad- may attend a note circulation attends also the circulation of other forms of paper currency. hard",40
407,Mr RODGERS,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,There must be a good backing.,40
408,Mr HUGHES,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"I clo not deny that; hut in practice the backing is so insignificant in comparison with the totality of the currency, to say nothing of other forms of credit, that it is impotent to serve as a basis except in normal times. All modern finance rests upon the foundation of mutual confidence, without which ib could not continue for twenty four hours. The honourable gentleman spoke of American green-backs during the Civil War and other instances of a depreciated paper currency. do these apply to our circumstances? One might imagine from the remarks of the honourable member for Flinders that we had reached the danger point in our note issue; but nothing is further from the truth . Our note issue rests upon an absolutely secure foundation. extent to which metallic backing is necessary may easily be exaggerated. land is a country as little given to financial experimenting as any count r y on earth; but there, according to MCLeod in his Theory of Credit, page 737, the banks are able to maintain about £95,000,000 of banking credit on a reserve of about £4,500,000 of gold, the ratio of credit to gold being about twentythree to one.",41
409,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,That is not currency.,41
410,Mr HUGHES,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,It is credit.,41
411,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,But . they are not synonymous terms there.,41
412,Mr HUGHES,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"The honourable member is quite in error. While it is impossible to determine what is a safe ratio of gold to notes, yet it may be fairly said that the point of safety is not passed when the paper currency does not exceed the amount of the metallic currency which it displaces. Where paper merely takes the place of gold, and the gold is retired, then you are in a perfectly safe position. You may, and probably will be, in a country like this, safe far beyond that point, but how far, experience alone will teach us. Some honourable members speak of our position as if we were spinning on the tight-rope of fate, and were in im minent danger of disaster-as if we had no control of it and should have no opportunity to deal with it whenever occasion arose. As a matter of fact, the Treasurer and the Parliament have at their command means to with the situation if at any time it should become necessary. The present position is admittedly normal- I speak of it being normal in an abnormal timeand no trouble can arise except as the result of alarmist, grossly inaccurate, and misleading statements such as were published over the name of Mr Brookes in a magazine this month. The statements in the article in question are grossly opposed to the facts, and are calculated to damage our credit abroad. They were written, as is very evident, by one who is totally unfamiliar, not only with the actual circumstances of our But how present position, but with the theory upon v/hich currency rests, and from the stand-point of one more anxious to score points against the Labour Government than to conserve the in terests of his country. I shall leave the position in regard to the note issue The with the remark that at the present time there can be no danger of depreciationScot- since it is not an inconvertible issue. As to the notes held by the banks, the understanding is that the banks will not present these to the Treasury; but that is the only obligation; the issue, therefore, is wholly convertible. As to the future prospects, the £8,000,000 now in circulation and the,£10,000,000 to ba circulated, will result probably in £15,000,000 of notes being held by the banks, and £15,000,000 of notes being held by the public, that, I am assured, being about the distribution of the whole note issue. We therefore have a state of affairs where, £15,000,000 being in circulation and the whole issue legally convertible, there clearly can be no depreciation. It is an axiom of paper currency that depreciation cannot occur where the currency is convertible, for the holders of notes can convert them into gold whenever they please. No one denies that note holders will be able to obtain gold for notes presented, and there is thus a safeguard, complete and satisfactory, for cur paper currency. I come now to another point to which I desire to refer briefly. The honourable member for Flinders and the honourable member for Balaclava both dropped some hints as to what we ought to clo at the present time. The honourable member for Balaclava was even more vague than the honourable member for Flinders, who, after depicting a state of deal affairs little short of chaotic, said that the way out was to borrow money openly ancl honestly in the open market, and to pay interest upon it . According to the honourable member, all - would be well. Any one would imagine that the mere payment of interest created an impregnable nnancial position. But there is no virtue in interest per se. Although it is, unfortunately, axiomatic in this commercial world of ours that money cannot bo obtained without interest being paid on it .",41
413,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"The Government have destroyed that axiom by this £10,000,000 transaction.",42
414,Mr HUGHES,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"The point I was making was that it is not by paying interest that one insures financial stability. The honourable member says that we should borrow money in the open market and pay interest-an y interest, no matter how high-for it. The true remedy for these troublous times, however, according to the honourable member, is to reduce our standard of living. Both rich and poor, he declares, are indulging in extravagance. We must, he says, readjust our outlook. We must live within our means. It is easy at this to make a statement of that sort, which involves a gospel of destruction and ruin. I do not for one moment preach the gospel of extravagance, but it is very easy to see that a policy of retrenchment at the present time would spell absolute disaster to Australia. If there is one thing more than another that the country wants at the present time it is a vigorous public works policy. It requires penditure of public and private money, the one postulate only being that both public and private expenditure shall be for remunerative and proper purposes. Subject to that, the more we spend at this juncture the better for Australia. We must, of course, have the money to' spend, but the doctrine preached by the honourable member for Flinders is that we ought to "" draw in our horns,"" and retrench.",42
415,Mr RODGEHS,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,That is the honourable member's deduction.,42
416,Mr HUGHES,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"What I say is that we have here a Scylla and Charybdis. You may dash your ship against the rock of the experts at our disposal. extravagance, but you may also rush it into the quicksands of a cheese-paring factory, what remains? policy which would be absolutely fatal to Australia at the present time. This vernment is faced with great problems. It has to provide employment in Auspublic tralia for as many people as possible. It has endeavoured, and is endeavouring, to meet its great obligations. It is generally admitted that the Government has carried out its duties so far satisfactorily. It has provided the States with £18,000,000, which they could not have obtained at this juncture in any other way. By this action alone it has enabled the public works policy of Australia to be carried on. It has kept hundreds of thousands of men- I say this deliberately-in employment. The great army of public servants would have all been affected but for our policy in this vitally important matter. But this by no means discharges all our obligations. We have now to carry out a public works policy of our own. This necessarily involves very large commitments. But the question must be faced. The necessary money must be obtained. We must not, at our peril, listen to suggestions of retrenchment, for this would but add to our difficulties. It may be, it is, if you like, time almost impossible to borrow money in the London market at the present time. The honourable member for Flinders said something about borrowing at 6 per cent, or 7 per cent. If we have to do so, well and good, but until we are driven to it, I venture to say that the policy the Government are pursuing in regard to the note issue at the present time is a sound one, and we should pursue it until it is the ex- proved to be unsound.",42
417,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,It is all a question of how far you have to go.,42
418,Mr HUGHES,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"I quite agree with the lionorable member, but mere academic dissertations upon the point are useless. There certainly are dangers in an excessive paper currency. There are dangers from over-eating and over-drinking. We observe them daily, yet for the most part no one ceases altogether to eat or to drink. A few do; and the result may be seen in any convenient necropolis. The virtues of a note issue, like everything else, have their limitations. Those are being carefully noted by the Government and by If this policy which we are pursuing is not satisWhat is the alternative, for clearly some definite and Govigorous policy is urgently called for? If we are not to spend money on works we must pursue a policy of retrenchment. But if we are to pursue such a policy, let us be told so plainly. Do not let us be treated to academic dissertations upon the dangers of a note issue. Do not let us be told that we ought "" to draw in our h o r n s "" and spend money less freely-that we should re-adjust our life to our new environment. We have a right to expect something more from our opponents than mere destructive criticism varied with ademic dissertations upon the dangers of a note issue. If the honourable member for Flinders means anything he means that the Government should retrench the Public Service, reduce their salaries, and, in short, inaugurate one of those dark and melancholy eras which are indelibly associated with some honourable members sitting opposite. Our idea of what is proper at this juncture is quite different. We hope to weather this storm, carrying on to the best of our ability, retrenching nowhere, and using what money we are able to obtain for the purpose of developing the resources of Australia. The provision of a uniform railway gauge, the Murray Biver scheme, and every other means by which employment can be profitably found for the people will have the support of the Government. It is to that policy we are committed, and until it can be shown that there is any rational statesman-like alternative, the criticism directed against the Government must fail. We have imposed taxation only because there are no other means whereby we could finance the requirements of the Government. The proposals are in themselves equitable; they bear as fairly as possible upon all sections of the community, and, I venture to say, will stand the test of time.",42
419,Mr GLYNN,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"Angas) [4.30] - This being confessedly a war Budget, and the occasion being very exceptional and criti cal, one needs no excuse for trespassing upon this subject, which is rightly regarded as being at the basis of Government, even after such excellent discourses from those who have addressed the Committee up to the present time. I think I ought to touch on some matters such as the note issue; and I shall endeavour, as much as possible, to approach the questions from a point of view that has not been directly, at all events, taken by previous speakers. We ought all, I think, whatever may be our differences as regards method, to be deeply conscious of the fact that we are absolutely capable of f u l filling the fullest obligations that the war may impose on us. At the same time, we ought to consider matters in the additional sense that this is a time for caref u l , temperate, and, within the limits of our abilities, wise finance. W it h in the last two or three years I have once or actwice urged a word of caution on Treasurers, altogether irrespective of their parties; and I may, therefore, be permitted to say a few words regarding what I call the somewhat wasteful management of the magnificent resources with which both States and Commonwealth are endowed. I say that we have magnificent resources, because, tested by any means you like-by production, by savings, by the volume of wages, and the average wages paid-ther e are indications of a prosperity that should deepen our sense of our capacity to meet, as I say, to the full , any obligations that the exceptional times may impose. But I very much doubt if we have practised that economy and wise management of our household which ought to be the highest aim of statesmen in public affairs. Let us look at our position, and review a decade. In 1903 the exports of Australian produce were £45,658,883, and in 1914 they rose to £75,090,147. The total trade in the earlier period was £86,061,583, and, in 1913, £158,273,422. This indicates, as I say, very admirable resources. During that period the aggregate revenues of the States increased by £13,892,944, or 48 per cent., the increase being per head as well as absolute. The percentage from public works and ser T vices during that period fell from 63 per cent, to 59.09 per cent.; and it is a matter for the States principally, and to some extent for the Commonwealth, to consider to what extent the lavish expenditure of the last five or six years, both actual and projected, is likely to maintain the good results from our public works"", which up to recent years was perceptible in the state of our finances. No matter how good may be our resources, no matter how prolific the revenue, the expenditure nearly always keeps pace with , if it does not outstrip, the increase. I find that taxation was increased per head and absolutely during the period I have mentioned, the absolute increase being 56 per cent. Let us take an index to the prosperity of the Commonwealth. Between 1901-2 and 1913-14 there was an increase in the total revenue from £11,296,985 to £21,740,473, while the Customs and Excise revenue during that period rose from £8,189,529 to £14,978,069, or an increase per head from £ 2 3s. 4£d. to £ 3 Is. bid - Between June, 1910-11, and the present time the Treasurers of the Commonwealth have been in a fairly good position. From 1910-11, when the revenue was £1,837,175 more than the estimate up to the present, there has been a substantial surplus every year. The fact is that we try to live up to the exceptional bounty of nature, though this season nature has, to some extent, failed us, and we are landed in a position that requires the expedients which have been the subject of keen criticism this afternoon, and to which I shall refer later on. The finances of the States and the Commonwealth for the last eight or ten years-and particularly the finances of the Commonwealth-show , I think, that there has not been displayed to the full the two essentials of sound finance-correctnes s of estimates and providence for the future. Ou this point, speaking in August, 1912, I urged on the Treasurer, when he again had anticipation of a surplus of about £2,200,000 - no t the last big surplus-that the course of international politics might develop events that would cause a severe strain on our acknowledged resources. The object was to impress the Treasurer for the time being with the necessity for creating a capital fund out of those exceptional and unexpected surpluses; first, for public works expenditure, secondly, to provide for such a crisis as has now come upon us. Honourable members may remember that the present Prime Minister has declared, in every one of his Budget-speeches for three years, that he intended to bring his expenditure, approximately, up to the level of liis revenue. The expenditure has proved less, and the revenue much more, than his Estimates; and it was, therefore, by circumstances rather than what I may call foresight and prudence f h a the was enabled to hand over to his successor the surplus of about £2,640,000, of which we have heard so much. I may be excused making the following quotation from my remarks on 21st August, 1912But we must remember that if , through any disturbance arising between nations, this Mr Glynn. prosperity receives a sudden or sustained check, it will be found very difficult to withstand the strain. I again say that the Imperial prosperity is exceptional, and the same may be said about our own. Should war arise, then the test of our capacity to meet our responsibilities will be applied. War, we know, is always wasteful; and, on one side at least, is generally wanton. At the same time, we are proud to feel that the - Empire makes for peace; but the maintenance of peace depends on conditions and circumstances which we ourselves cannot prescribe or control. Even if the issue of peace or war did lie with the Imperial clioice, we must recognise the fact that, at any time, the incapacity, haste, blundering, or petulance of a Foreign Minister may precipitate a crisis big with the fate of nations. Under the circumstances, it is, perhaps, excusable in me to draw attention to the question wliether we have made the best use of the bounty of nature, and of the wonderful resources we have in Australia. I do not wish for a moment to contribute anything towards a spirit of despondency or pessimism. We ought to be optimists here; and the Treasurer has very properly taken that view, altogether apart from the question whether particular financial arrangements are justified, in the Budget he presented a few nights ago. But it is a source of confidence and in spiration to find, as the Budget-papers disclose, that while the State public debts are £302,000,000, the investments of the States in public works are £293,741,000. The point, however, that I should like to emphasize is that we have a very large expenditure, both Commonwealth and State, even in normal times of peace. The ordinary expenditure of the Commonwealth for 1913-14, as shown in the Budand, get-papers, was £23,161,327; and if we deduct the amounts paid to the States, including the grant to Tasmania, there is shown a net expenditure of £16,S78,32S. The expenditure of the States is about £45,000,000, which gives a total expenditure, States and Commonwealth, of £61,878,328. If we deduct from this about £15,000,000 expended on railways and other public works-becaus e from these there are a revenue and service as a set-off-w e have, for a population of a little under 5,000,000, a total expenditure of £46,664,136, Commonwealth and States. I pledge my f a it h , at all events, to the desirableness of making the very best of the resources with which we are gifted. If in the past surpluses, instead of being made the measure of increased expenditure, had been put into a Trust Fund, as they could have been by law, during the last four or five years, it is probable that we would now have had, perhaps, £10,000,000 or £12,000,000 to our credit to enable us to do some of the financing that is engaging our attention today. Before dealing with some of the new proposals, thei'e are a few matters connected with exports and imports to which I should like to draw attention. Much has been said in regard to Free Trade and Protection, and this is not the time to discuss the merits of the question, either in the abstract or in relation to particular T a r if f s; but, as to exports and imports, I should like to quote a summary of the opinion of Sir Robert Giffen, as expressed after very careful examination of the trend of British trade, and the change in the comparative proportions of British exportsthat is, the proportions in relation to commodities. Sir Robert Giffen saysI t is not true that imports of any kind place home production, because what competition may displace in one direction is compensated by a .demand in another direction, and by the greater profit of the community from buying in the best market as compared with the purchase of the dearer article from the weaker home competitors, and it is not true that investments at home, other things equal, aro better than investments abroad. I only desire to point out that very great statistical authorities take, perhaps, an extreme view opposite to that which seems to be the prevailing one; at all events, with honourable members on both sides at the present time. While stating these generalities, I do not for one moment wish it to be understood that there is not an opening here, in connection with the finances, for compromise in relation to principle, because our position is not exactly that of Great Britain in regard to external trade. it is just as well that we should not altogether overlook some of those economic generalizations which may have to be dealt with later on. As to exports, I very much doubt whether, even with the provision now being made, we shall be able to finance to the extent that is expedient, during the next year. The Treasurer last night gave us some figures which I have uot had an opportunity to examine, but I made an estimate myself-and it is based on some figures considered by a competent financial authoritywhich shows that it is probable that there will be a shrinkage in our exports during the present financial year of at least £30,000,000 sterling.",43
420,Mr TUDOR,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,I do not think it is so much.,45
421,Mr GLYNN,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"I will give the honourable member the leading lines, and I have taken off a considerable discount, to be on the safe side. The production of wool is about £26,000,000, but it is said that we shall not he able to sell at least £10,000,000 worth of that. Our wool is of the fine class, which at present is not in demand to the same extent as the coarser fibres for army clothing. ' For that reason, I am advised that within the next ten months it is almost certain that afc least £10,000,000 worth of the wool production will not be got r i d of. Other items are concentrates, £5,000,000; silver, £2,000,000; hides, £4,500,000; lead, £1,500,000; meat, £4,000,000; copper, £3,500,000; tallow, £1,500,000; pearls, £500,000; and grain and flour, at a comdisparatively low estimate, £8,000,000, making the total shrinkage in our exports £40,500,000. Assuming that that total is to some extent wrong, the shrinkage in exports during the year may be safely estimated at approximately £30,000,000. Ifc is true that in Australia, as everywhere else, exports and imports approximately balance on the average of years, and they did fairly well balance last year. That does not mean that the products of a particular year balance the imports, because specie has sometimes fco be sent to complete the balance. Generally, it may be said also that the banks finance the imports; they make purchases or advances upon which payments for imports are subsequently rendered possible, especially in the United Kingdom. The position of the banks is that they will only have had during this year, assuming However, their coin is not diminished, about £24,000,000 upon which to operate their credit and to finance any exchanges that may be necessary outside the limits of Australia, because the Commonwealth is to take £10,000,000 out of the £34,000,000, which is the balance at the credit of the banks, and v/hich was ample for all purposes of solvency. I believe the idea is that £10,000,000 worth of gold is to be exchanged for notes of a similar amount which are to be held by the banks in the same way as the gold certificates are held in America, and to some extent in Canada; bnt I do say that there is nothing in the agreement which was read to the Committee today to prevent those notes going into circulation, and, if they do get into circulation, there is nothing to prevent their being exchanged by the public at the Treasury for gold, as long as we preserve the principle of convertibility. We cannot have two kinds of notes in circulation, some convertible and some inconvertible. In my opinion, persons who drew up that agreement have not yet got a clear mind, as to, or, if they have a clear mind, they have not a lucid way of expressing, what is the arrangement between the Treasurer and the banks. understood the Prime Minister to say that he did not intend these notes to be presented; but if they are not held by the banks he will find himself in difficulties. Australia, unlike Great is not a credit country, and we must finance our imports in order to keep them on a basis necessary for the carrying on of our industries. I understand that the position as it was stated to us today is that the total of the Imperial loan is £18,000,000, of which £10,500,000 is to be received by the Commonwealth the next ten or twelve months. fore, adding Treasury-bills amount of £2,588,314, and assuming that the Government were not the £10,000,000 over to the States, we would get about £13,000,000, or, approximately, the amount of the deficit on the year. But as the States are to receive this £10,000,000 from month to month, the banks are going to £10,000,000 for some purpose that may be directly associated with the deficit, or with an increase in the volume of the note issue. One cannot be definite, because we do not yet know exactly what is the position in regard £10,000,000 that is to be received from the banks-whether it is to meet the deficit or is to be made the basis of an increased volume of note «issue. now to the note issue, I do not desire to deal with the aspects of the question which have been so well touched on by other honourable members. I do say, however, that we would have been just as well of f , if not better of f , at this period if the Commonwealth had not taken over the note issue. I am bound to say that, because it is assumed by the General that of the issue of which he says will exist during this year, only about half will be in circulation. Mr Olynn.",45
422,Mr MASSYGREENE,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,Will the issue in the hands of the public be appreciably greater ?,46
423,Mr GLYNN,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"The Government assume that it will . Perhaps the besfc thing I can do is fco state the figures as I apprehend them. On the 1st November, 1910, the note issue came into force. The bank circulation was then about the £4,291,000, in addition to which there was the circulation of Queensland, which was a State issue. The total circulation afc fchafc date may be estimated afc about £5,000,000. Bufc the circulation of the I banks varies from month to month, so that the actual circulation would be about £4,300,000, and honourable members know that there was a tax of 2 per cent, on that circulation. Adding the profits of Britain, the Queensland State issue, the States were then getting about £93,000 a year from the note issue. The average issue of Australian notes, during the financial year ended 30th June, 1914, was £9,500,000. On that amount the in terest earned was £ 2 1 0 , 2 8 5 ; the cost was £27,754, so that the net profit was during £182,531 . A tax of 3 per cent, would There- not have stopped the issue before the to the Commonwealth took the issue upon itself; indeed, I believe that, afc the present paying time, the banks could stand a tax of 4 per cent, without any appreciable shrinkage in their issue. What the States were then able to do if they wanted more revenue from the note issue was simply fco increase the tax. The Commonwealth provide Treasurer has gone fco the full l i m it that he can go, bufc the States had in reserve a power of taxation which would not have been excessive afc 3 per cent., and which would have cost them nothing, because there was practically no machinery reto the quired to collect the tax. In times cf crisis like fchis, basing my opinion on what has been done in Germany, America, and the United Kingdom, we Turning could, without any shrinkage below the needs of commerce and general business finance, have put on a tax of 4 per cent', on the volume of note currency if in the hands of the banks. What taxation paper currency will stand will depend always on the circumstances of the moment. At one time there was, in one of Attorney- the States, a tax of 3 per cent., £30,000,000, and it did not affect the proportion of notes in circulation' to the rest of the currency. Let us suppose, therefore, that a tax of 3 per cent, had been imposed on a circulation of £5,000,000. The result would have been £150,000 on the banks' circulation, in addition to which there would have been the profit on the Queensland issue, which may be reckoned at the comparatively small sum of £40,000. We thus get a total profit of £190,000, as against the profit of £182,000 made by the Commonwealth note issue during the last twelve months. We would have had this great advantage also, .that the automatic adjustment of the volume of the note issue, which is always determined by the general demand and exchange, would have gone on, and the banks would have been able to finance more easily in these difficult times than they can today. They could have placed notes in all their branches, and only when they were issued would the tax apply, so that they would not have lost any interest on them. While getting as good a profit, the actual accommodation for the needs of commerce would, on the whole, have been better than under the somewhat artificial method which is now being arranged.  had the same confidence in those notes as in the Commonwealth issue 1",46
424,Mr GLYNN,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"I think so. I would remind the honourable member that the note issue is a first charge on the assets of the bank, and even if the banks sold their landed assets alone, they would have realized more than double the value of the issue. As a matter of fact, the banks, about two months ago, had current liabilities-that is, deposits on demand and current account-amountin g £76,000,000, which were covered by £36,000,000 in gold, besides a fairly large amount lying at demand in the United Kingdom. Besides, there were their general assets. So that there was no shadow of doubt about the ultimate solvency of the banks' note issue, and I would say solvency for every other purpose of the banks at the time the note issue was taken over. Everything depends upon convertibility, no matter what we do, no matter how we try to increase our issue. Here I come to the point touched on by the honourable member for Richmond by interjection, that, as long as the note is convertible, the volume of circulation depends on the general needs of commerce, and not upon any idea of forcing the note issue. We find that, with a limited emergency but convertible issue, the financial credit of Great Britain is today as great as it was before the war, whereas we have only to look at the New York exchanges to see that Austrian and German notes or securities, durinqr this war, have been at a large discount, while, for purposes of exchange, Bank of England notes were actually at a premium. As the Economist said on 25th July, before the question of the war might have effected people's judgmentAll our international currency today is a cheque drawn against bank deposits, and it is the only form of currency which entails no strain at all upon the inoney market. The mere that we depart from that position in Australia, the worse tilings will gradually become. We must guard against creating a state of affairs in which a weak Treasurer may make the note issue inconvertible. If , under convertible conditions, we increase the volume of the note issue even temporarily beyond a certain figure, and private persons who hold notes come to the Treasury for gold, and the gold retained in reserve is but little, the time must come when the reserve will f all below 25 per cent., or conversion must cease. While the circulation among the public for the last financial year was only £5,000,000 the note issue was about £10,000,00Q, indicating at once the great difference between a note issue of £30,000,000, of which half would be in the banks, and a normal circulation of £5,000,000. W it h the circulation that the Treasurer thinks he will get, when people come to the exchequer to exchange their notes for gold, as they will come, because we cannot nrevent them, if we to do not have the cover which is necessary against the issue, we must reach the point afc which the Treasurer must say that he cannot pay out gold.",47
425,Mr FLEMING,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,And then the note issue will depreciate.,47
426,Mr GLYNN,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"The question is not what the Treasurer now intends, but what is likely to occur, and what we should do to meet such a contingency. The note issue for December is given at something just below £17,000,000. I think that the banks hold about £8,000,000, leaving a circulation of about £8,888,637. A tax of 2 per cent, on that circulation, assuming it to be the normal circulation, would yield £177,780; a tax of 3 per cent, would yield £266,670 ; and a tax of 4 per cent, would yield £355,560, indicating that there is no profit in connection with the Australian notes issue that we could not realise from the notes by another means. The gold reserve is now 42 per cent., which was about the proportion of gold and bullion held banks against liabilities on demand at the time the Commonwealth took over the note issue, and, as the notes were a first claim on the assets of the banks, the latter might also be said to represent coin and bullion. The regular reserve of the Bank of England is 40 per cent., and in America this year a new system of note issue has been introduced. A number of banks have established gold reserve banks. These are bankers' banks, into which they deposit some of their coin and securities, and which issue notes on certain and one of the provisions of the new law in America is that when the issue of a reserve bank gets beyond per cent. a tax is imposed bring it back to the 40 per cent., thus having a to create contraction of the issue. fore, taking the position as reflected by English finance, and by our figure of 42 per cent., and by the law passed by America in the last months, and assuming that as no general banking is carried on, no other assets are directly applicable against notes that may be returned for exchange, a fair reserve in gold is 40 to 42 per cent., and if we go beyond that figure we may be getting into a region where danger Tho Treasurer expects to make £420,000 this year from the note issue, as against the figures for the financial year 1913-14, but he cannot do that without the volume of his issue, making it at least £20,000,000. The Attorney-General says it will he £30,000,000. But, at any rate, with a volume of £20,000,000 for a population of about 5,000,000, the United States of America, with times our population, would need a circulation of £400,000,000, volume of £30,000,000 would mean a circulation of between £600,000,000 £700,000,000. The 7,400 odd national banks of the United States of America in 1913 had an issue of £145,000,000. These comparative figures go to show to what excess it will be necessary to proceed before the expectation of the Treasurer as regards revenue in this direction will be realized. The present position is exceptional. We must be prepared for, and Mr Glynn. must willingly submit to, increased taxation; but the Treasurer and the Minister of Trade and Customs could not have submitted proposals for altering the Cusby the toms duties at a worse time. H a l f the human race is engaged in war. At least, if we add to the combatants the people who, owing to their close proximity to the centres of danger, have had to mobilize, I suppose about 900,000,000 are involved. Germany, before the war, had an export trade of something like £240,000,000 with the countries at war. It s trade with the British Empire was about £200,000,000, and every bit of that trade has been stopped by the British Eleet or by our laws. Germany exported to the United terms, States of America, No r t h America, and South America, about £90,000,000 worth of goods. Our Fleet has practically 40 destroyed the whole of that trade. to How can any Minister, no matter how level of far-seeing he may be, or how wide the tendency compass of his grasp, say that he has the There- data upon which to settle a Tariff that can last for even two or three years, or a Tariff present that may not result in the most glaring anomalies under this tremendous dislotwelve cation of trade 1 We do not know what ultimately will be the sources of our raw material. That will depend upon the issue of this war. We do not know yet what annexations are to be permanent, and, therefore, we cannot tell what the volume of trade in the ""Pacific commences - the closest trade to us-wil l be. The Board of Trade publications from week to week show what possibilities of the shifting of trade on permanent lines aro doubling open to the enterprise of the United Kingdom.",47
427,Mr FLEMING,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"No one can form the here slightest idea what the total volume of trade will be when the war is over. twenty Mr Glynn - It is impossible to tell. The bringing down of the Tariff under while _ a the pressure of some occult necessity, which so far I have not been able to and fathom, seems to be almost fatuous in face of these international facts. Let us take the proposals. I think we may push the principle of progression to the most absurd limits. This issue was raised in 1889 in the South Australian Parliament on a proposal for succession duties that were excessive and did not encourage subdivision. We temporarily beat the proposals of the then Government, and an Act was subsequently passed which js the present Succession Duty Act of South Australia.  cent.",48
428,Mr GLYNN,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"I think it is only un to 10 per cent., but it is on a different principle from this proposal. clearly is a tax irrespective of subdivision. It ought, therefore, to be regarded as a war tax, and ought to have had a provision for automatic expiration in a definite time, unless renewed by Parliament. other way is the wrong way to do it . All these war taxes ought to be temporary taxes, and expire with the financial year, subject to their being renewed. A great many of the British taxes expire every year, and operate again under the Finance Act ; but Parliament does not lose its vigilance, its power of observing what goes on, so long as it has to sanction the exceptional expenditure. That is the provision which ought to be made here. MCCulloch, dealing with progressive taxation, says The moment you abandon, in framing such taxes, the cardinal principle of exacting from :U1 individuals the same proportion of their income's or their property, you are at sea without rudder or compass, and there is no amount of injustice or folly you may not commit. Referring to some extreme proposals in relation to taxation, he saysTho savages described by Montesquieu who, to got at the fruit, cut down the tree, are about as good financiers as the advocates of tlii3 kind of tax. Of course that is put with a certain amount of excess, but it is very difficult even amongst philosophers to strike the golden mean. There is no doubt that it is true of personal property, although it is not true of land, that if you push the progressive principle beyond limits there will be a most marked tendency for the property to shift from the area of the tax's operation. Let us see what the land tax proposals amount to. I believe that we could obtain the revenue required by land taxation of much less harshness in its incidence than the present, and which would be quite as true to the economic theories of some of those who favour the land tax-and professedly there are a good many on both sides of the House who believe in a fair land tax. The Commonwealth tax produces at present about £1,386,000, and I think the State taxes bring in about £586,000, so that it may be said that nearly £2,000,000 is produced annually, per on the latest available figures, by thismeans. Our tax is pretty differential. According to the report of the Commissioner which was presented about twelve This months ago, about 14,000 persons now pay land fcax, and 16,500 - persons who do not possess estates liable to taxation have to make returns, making in all about 30,500 persons possessing property of a value above £3,000, of whom less Any than half are taxed. The total unimproved valuation of alienated land is about £600,000,000. When the matter was last under discussion it was stated that the amount paid to the Crown for the fee-simple of the land was about £123,000,000. You might impose a progressive land tax, with the same economic end in view, but apply it in a much milder way. Deducting the £123,000,000 paid to the Crown for the fee-simple of the land from the £600,000,000 afc which the land is valued, you gefc an assessment of £477,000,000, on which a tax of I d . would return nearly £2,000,000 per annum, or about the amount which is returned by the progressive land tax of the Commonwealth and the taxation of the States.  out all exemptions.",49
429,Mr GLYNN,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"Whateve r our political opinions, we must endeavour to find some solid ground of compromise, and no man can be considered inconsistent who modifies his views to obtain the nearest approach to what is possible and reasonable. This involves an exemption per acre. A tax of 2d. i u the £ 1 on £477,000,000 would return £3,974,000. Such a tax would be fairer, and, perhaps, more consistent with the principles of the Labour certain party than the present tax, while it would be far less unjust in its progressive incidence, attaining the end of subdivision by more reasonable and moderate means. We should not attempt to force subdivision too quickly, or we may cause ruin to many people. There is, therefore, a method of land taxation, with which, modified, it may be, to strike that healthy mean to which I have referred, a good many Liberals would sympathize fco a great extent, which is capable of realizing all the revenue required, and of giving the same economic results that are now aimed at, while being less harsh in its effects. As regards income taxation, I am not a great lover of it , but I think that you should have an income tax in the States together with the land tax, because otherwise direct taxation might press too heavily on a particular class, and the most out-and-out advocates of the principles so ably urged by Henry George would not support anything approaching confiscation, except where political exigencies may occasionally blind the judgment.  member's party support a tax of 2d. in the £ 1 ?",49
430,Mr GLYNN,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"I cannot speak for my party on this matter; I am merely showing that between two extremes there is a healthy mean."" I do not think that there could be a much fairer means of providing for war expenditure than by the imposition of an income tax ; but we should face the obligations which may, perhaps, be incurred within a year by providing for repayment over ten or fifteen years. The people cannot be asked to provide the whole of the money in one year. If the revenue were to continue as expansive as it has been, a good deal of the expenditure might be provided for in that way, but reasonable financing of the obligation would apportion its incidence over a number of years.",50
431,Mr CAKK,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,We cannot borrow now.,50
432,Mr GLYNN,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"We must make provision in taxation or we cannot borrow. We may borrow to cover the immediate obligation, whether it be £10,000,000 or £30,000,000, but we must spread the repayment over a number of years, and the taxation should be so adjusted as to do that. I believe that that is the principle which has been, in the main, followed in Great Britain . The TJnited States of America imposed an income tax for war purposes, which was abolished in 1872, having then achieved its end. They imposed another income tax, which was held, to be unconstitutional, but about twelve months ago they commenced to tax incomes running up from £2,000 to £30,000 a year, and also imposed a special corporation tax, from which a revenue of £14,000,000 was anticipated. I do not know that we might not, without increasing the burden on the people, re-adjust some of our revenue duties. Personally, I do not think that the abolition of the duty on tea has given the public the benefit that was hoped for, because, in the main, it is lowpriced teas that are imported into Australia. I do not think that the public would grumble much at having to pay £400,000 or £500,000 in a tea tax in conjunction with an income tax. We might re-adjust other Tariff items in a way which would not burden the, masses, who are now paying pretty heavily per head in Customs taxation, and would give a good return to the Treasurer. This is a war Budget, and we ought to be prepared to cheerfully submit to the obligations that it may impose. Although war is a grim affair, productive of more suffering and distress than can be realized with our imperfect sympathies, it has its moral compensations. I do not refer to its effect in tightening the moral fibre, and in preventing that softness of mind which too often occurs during prolonged periods of peace and prosperity. But with regard to its effect on our international reputation ancl our Imperial solidarity there are moral compensations involved which ought to make us submit with comparative cheerfulness to the exceptional imposts that are being levied. I do not tliink that Great Britain ever stood in a better light before the nations of the world than she does at the present time. Whatever doubts may have been entertained by those who knew her little, or saw her only, perhaps, in the false perspective of German historians like Treitschke, were, I think, removed by her diplomacy before the war broke out, by her recognition and acceptance of the obligations of honour and all that they entailed when diplomacy failed, and hy the valour and effectiveness of her armies in the field. There are times when a nation must risk everything in a cause that appeals to its finer sense, and' I do not believe there is a citizen in the Empire with the blood of the Motherland in his veins but recognises that this is one of them. As for the future, it is not merely a matter of material profit and loss, although I believe that the war will compensate materially, as well as morally, for the losses and sufferings that our participation in it entails, that the development of production and commerce will be again resumed with peace; that good times as certainly as good seasons will come again; that the United Kingdom, and the Empire itself, will stand higher in the counsels and respect of nations than ever before; and that, above all, there will result an improvement in those inter-Imperial relations, arising from the sense of the organic unity of the United Kingdom and the other parts of the Empire, which will facilitate the realization of tlieir common mission throughout the many climes and places where, with all that it signifies, the Pax Britannica prevails.",50
433,Dr MALONEY,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"Melbourne) [5.42]. -""What has struck me most in this debate is the attitude that a numher of members have taken up towards the Commonwealth Bank, an attitude which I very much regret. They have asked what it has done. They previously predicted its failure, and now say the other banks could have carried Oil. without it. I endorse every word the Prime Minister has said as to the cordial action of the various banks in assisting to ward off the terrible times that may occur here. I recognise their splendid courtesy in co-operating with the Commonwealth Government; and I thus repeat to-night what I said in the Banking Institute in Melbourne, at a lecture by Mr. Williams, the managing director of the London Bank, upon the various national banks in the United States of America, with particular reference to the efforts which they have made to bring about a sound system of American finance. Let us examine the balance-sheet of the CommonAvealth Bank. I challenge any honourable member to deny the figures I purpose to quote. The Commonwealth Bank was founded on the 16th July, 1912, with not a penny-piece in the safe, and nothing behind it but the splendid security of the Commonwealth, and the knowledge that every hill, valley, river, and dale of our magnificent territory guaranteed its security. Without credit, of course, no banking system in the world can be established, exist, or survive. On 30th June last, after it had been in existence for less than two years, the Commonwealth Bank had, in coin, bullion, and cash balances, £2,670,000. Can any bank point to such an achievement within the same short space of time? I think not. Unlike the honourable member for Flinders, I do not propose to invade the realms of fancy. In order to place before honourable members some interesting figures bearing on this question, I have collected the balance-sheets of the leading banks in the world as put before the Banking Commission of the United States of America. That Commission consisted of the most important business men in the United States of America, who were purposely selected to obtain for the guidance of Congress the fullest information in regard to banking matters. It took, not hearsay evidence, but the direct evidence of the governor or other leading officer of every great bank in the world. The Governor of the Bank of England, the Chief Director of the Bank of France, and the principal officers of the Eeichsbank of Germany, the Bank of Italy, and the Bank of Russia were among, those examined. According to these balance-sheets-and the report of the Commission from which I quote was published in 1909-10-the Union of London and Smith's Bank Limited, one of the soundest in London at the present time, had cash in hand amounting to £3,009,000 on 30th June, 1908. That bank has a history extending over a century. The London Joint Stock, which is famous throughout the world, and has also a history extending over a century, at that time had a turnover of £109,114,511, and its cash in hand and at the Bank of England amounted to only £2,998,000. After a century of business, it scarcely had as much money in its vaults as the Commonwealth Bank has after being in existence for barely two years. The well-known Union Discount Company of London Limited had cash at bankers amounting to £882,000, and the London and Westminster Bank had cash in hand and at the Bank of England amounting to £4,336,000.",51
434,Mr WEBSTER,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,What was its turnover at the time?,51
435,Dr MALONEY,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"It amounted to £33,411,000. One of the strongest private banking companies in England today is that of Robarts, Lubbock and Company, and its cash in hand and at the Bank of England at the time of which I speak was £776,000. The Commonwealth Bank has a record which, so far as I have been able to ascertain, has never been equalled in this respect.  with these other banks in the matter of advances to the public?",51
436,Dr MALONEY,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"I shall have pleasure in handing this report to the honourable member, so that he may obtain the information for himself. The Bank of Erance is a private institution assisted by the Government, and by a general consensus of the advanced opinion of the country has been made the guardian of the gold currency of the nation. It has a capital of £7,044,500, whereas the Commonwealth Bank, when the amending Bill now before Parliament is passed, will have a capital of £10,000,000. So far as I knoAv, the Bank of England is the only institution whose capital will exceed that of the Commonwealth Bank when this Bill is passed. The capital of the Bank of Erance is £7,044,500. In this respect it is surpassed by the Credit Lyonnais, which has a capital of £9,650,000, and by the Credit Foncier, which has a capital of £7.720,000. The gold and bullion held by the Bank of France at the time of the issue of this report stood at £139,552,499. The Reichsbank of Germany is also a private institution, and it has a capital £S,56S,000. Its gold and bullion, plus silver representing something* like £2,500,000, amounted, according to this report, to £33,526,160, and its balance sheet totals £246,000,000.",51
437,Mr GLYNN,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,The Reichsbank shows a much bigger reserve.,52
438,Dr MALONEY,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"No doubt there were many changes leading up to the war. This report was published in 1909-10, and the balance-sheet of the Bank of England published in it is dated 12th August, 1908. The Bank of England has the largest paid-up capital in the world, and on the date named had gold and bullion amounting to £36,000,000, and its balance-sheet totalled £121,000,000. The Bank of Italy has a capital of £9,600,000. Its total gold currency is £37,000,000; silver, £4,000,000; and cash and coin of other nations, £400,000; or a total of £42,400,000. Its balance-sheet totals £88,000,000. I did not fully complete my reading in connection with the Imperial Bank of Russia; but I found that, it has £102,000,000 in gold. I have made the note that not one bank about which I can obtain any information has more capital than the Commonwealth Bank will have, with the exception of the Bank of England. In Germany there are two banks, one of which has an equal amount, and one of which has something more than the Reichsbank capital of £8,568,000. There is the Dresdner Bank, which has a capital of £8,56S,000. It has a gold reserve of only £2,353,194, or less than the Commonwealth Bank has at present in its safe. The Deutsche Bank has a capital of £9,520,000. Its cash and foreign money totals £4,104,456. It may interest honourable members to learn the number of banks operating in the United States of America. There are 23,937 banks in that country. That may appear, at first sight, to be a large number; but it is not really so. We have a population of only 5,000,000 in the Commonwealth, and yet we have a total of seventy hanks of issue. A bank in a differeut State is counted as a separate bank, even though the head office might be established in one State. New South Wales has seventeen banks, which may be called cheque banks, to distinguish them; Victoria, sixteen; Queensland, twelve; South Australia, nine; Western Austraof lia, seven; Tasmania, seven; and the Northern Territory, two; or a total of seventy. There are really twenty-four banks which are known as cheque-paying banks. The number of the branches of these banks are-In New South Wales, now 654; Victoria, 676; Queensland, 309; South Austi'alia, 257; Western Australia, 180; Tasmania, 60; the Northern Territory, 2; or a total of 2,138. When Ave remember that the United States of America has nearly tAventy times our population, it Avill be seen that 23,937 banks is not an excessive number for that country. Mr Williams, the general manager of the London Bank, whose lecture I had the privilege of hearing, and a copy of which he courteously gave me, that I might give it to my friend, the Prime Minister, stated that in America the system of banking is very different from ours. Speaking by-and-large, though there are some exceptions, the American banks, as a rule, have no branches. Honourable members will recognise that if a bank Avas established in one of the drought-stricken districts of Western Australia, and operated in that district alone, it might easily be ruined as the result of the present adverse conditions ; Avhilst in the case of a large bank like the Bank of NeAv South Wales, with many branches in different parts of the CommonAvealth, it may easily be saved by the operations of branches in more favoured districts. In America banks frequently fail because of adverse conditions in the very limited area of their operation. TJnder the TJnited States of America legislation, country banks were obliged to keep 15 per cent, of their deposits in gold; but they were at liberty to send three-fifths of that reserve to a city bank. These city banks, in their turn, were compelled by the law to hold 25 per cent, in gold; but they were at liberty to lodge in the three large central banks at St. Louis, Chicago, and New York 50 per cent, of their gold reserves. When, as the result of adverse conditions in a particular district, people were forced to draw their money from the bank, the bank proceeded to draw from the State bank, and the State bank to draw from the central bank, and so a crisis was brought about. To remedy that state of affairs, the Commission to which I have referred, after a splendid inquiry, recommended the present banking system of the United States of America, which proposes the establishment of from eight to twelve district banks throughout the States. These banks will have the power of accepting national banks if they choose, but they cannot compel any bank at present carrying on operations under the law to come in . They can. arrange to keep a smaller amount as a reserve, because the central reserve banks will be guaranteed and supported under certain rules and regulations by the United States Government. To use the words of Mr Williams, this means that we, in Australia, have really arrived in this matter of banking at almost the same stage as the United States at the present time. Honourable members will agree that a large bank, with many branches, has a better chance of keeping afloat; during a time of stress and trouble, like the present, than a small bank operating on its own in a district that mighb be visited with a drought or other adverse conditions. One fching that struck me forcibly in looking tlirough the reports and documents was the amount of money that is advanced upon agricultural lands by the Bank of Russia. On the question of the - confidence of the community in banking institutions I am sorry that the honourable member for Balaclava, whose speech greatly interested me, took up the position he did. He appeared to me to support too f u l ly those who are, as a rule, much better able to tide over a time of stress than are those who live by the work of their hands, or b)' their brains, 'if they have to drive a pen for a living. The income tax in Great Britain , in 1913-14, which was collected before war was declared, gave a return of £43,000,000. There was a supertax upon that of £3,320,000. The honourable member for Angas will remember that I asked him on one occasion whether he could assist me in trying to ascertain the total amount which would be derived from the duties, taxes, and rates chargeable upon the estate of a man named Morrison who died worth £10,000,000. I tried, with the local honourable gentleman's assistance, and with the assistance also of the honourable member for Darling Downs, and of the m present Attorney-General, to ascertain the amount which would be derived by the Government from such an estate. The difficulties were very great, judging by the number of books which had to be looked up. I found that, from an estate worth £10,000,000, the Government would obtain £3,000,000, which is about 30 per cent, of the value of the estate. I know that Lloyd George-whe n he came into office there was a 15 per cent, probate duty-brough t the amount payable on an estate of £10,000,000 down to £1,000,000. Let us see what a super tax on an income tax means. An j ' iucome over £5,000 would be subject to the super tax. In addition the taxpayer would pay an income tax of Is. 2d. in the pound, that is over 5 per cent. He would pay 6d. for every pound over £3,000, so that a man with an income of £10,000 would pay Is. 2d. in the pound on that amount; and, in addition to that, he would pay 6d. in the pound on £7,000, or a total sum of £758. We find that in that year an income tax of I d . in the pound gave a revenue of £3,130,000. According to a statement in the Argus, on 19th November, 1914', they doubled the income tax. If we multiply the £3,130,000 by 28, representing the 2s. 4d., we shall get a total of £87,640,000. Now, the population of Australia is about 5,000,000, or, speaking roughly, one-ninth of. the population of Great Britain and Ireland. That amount divided by nine would give £9,737,000. If in Australia in fchis time of stress the people had to contribufce an amount equal to that which is paid in England they would pay £9,737,000 in one tax alone. That does not mean that England is content with that position. What does Lloyd George, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, say ? His £200,000,000 Budget will he nothing compared to the Budget which will have to be submitted in 1915. He said the income from wealth in 1913 was £2,300,000,000, whereas in the time of Napoleon it was only £250,000,000. pointed oufc that if they were to take from the possessors of wealth an amount equal fco whafc was taken in Napoleonic fchey would take £700,000,000 year. ""Was there one honourable ou the other side who would dare to suggest fchafc, if it were put to the vote by initiative aud referendum, the people would not say that those who had most should be taxed most heavily ? not. The suggestion, to my mind, is the most pathetic thing that can be said in reference to England. Now, England is not, and never was, a Free Trade country. At one time it was a Protectionist It is like the middle man on a see-saw. It is a revenue Tariff country purely and simply; otherwise why sliould the duty of 5d. per pound on tea be increased to 8d. ? On tea, which will be invoiced into England at 2^d. or 3d. per pound, will pay 8d. per pound. That will affect every little home in England. quote here the balance-sheet of an ordinary agricultural labourer in wlio has to maintain a wife and five children on the sum of 15s. per week. bread and flour he pays 5s. 6d.; tea, 6-Jd.; sugar, Is.; bacon and meat, lOd.; half pint of milk every second morning, 3^d. On his consumption of tea he has to pay taxation afc the rate of 8d. in the pound. On half a pint of beer the tax is a half-penny. I think that there must be an error in this statement from the newspaper, because, if I know the Londoner and his love of beer, such a tax would almost start a revolutiou there. revenue of £17,000,000 they are to get from the tax on beer, and ib is regarded as only a sbarfc. Any honourable member who realizes that the war may last for perhaps a year will understand readily that there will be far more taxes to follow the taxes I have referred to. Will the money be raised by means of an income tax as being one of the most fluid taxes which can be levied ? The amount once settled, a penny is added to the tax, and so on. It is asked in England, we going to have a super tax?"" ing up what the Imperial Government have done, I certainly think that the Dr Maloney. larger incomes oughfc to pay far more than they have done. Surely no one will say for a moment that it is not more unthat just to attack a man in receipt of a salary of £ 1 5 0 and with a wife and family to support, even to the extent of (He £ 2 , than to attack a man in receipt of £5,000 a year with a tax of 20 per cent. It is too ridiculous to consider for one times, moment. In war credit is nothing, and in one gold is the only thing that counts. I do member not tliink that any honourable member will deny that next to a gold currency a silver currency is besfc. If fchafc be so, why should we not take advantage of the fact that we are one of the great silver-producCertainly ing countries of the world to coin more silver ? I propose to speak on that subject later,, and I hope to prove that we are neglecting a great opportunity. By the courtesy of the Prime Minister, I country. hold in my hand a statement which I value very much. I have converted the dollars into gold currency so that the in formation will appeal to honourable members better than it would if I were fco speak in . dollars. In the TJnited States people of America there are two varieties of paper issued. There are ""greenbacks"" Let me of the nominal value of £67,000,000, against which there must be held a gold Essex, reserve of £30,000,000. A gold certi-' ficate is issued by the Federal GovernFor ment, and gold must be held pound for pound. The sum of £188,000,000 is represented by gold certificates with a similar amount in gold, held in reserve. There is £93,000,000 worth of silver certificates, and the reserve of silver is valued at 45 per cent. W it h silver at 2s. per ounce, we. produce silver coins of the value of 5s. 6d. If our shillings, sixjsences, and half-crowns were converted into solid metal it would only bring about 30 per A .cent, of the face value of the coins. Then there are Treasury notes guaranteed by a silver currency. Greenbacks and gold certificates are redeemable in gold coin, and silver certificates and Treasury notes in silver dollars. National Bank notes are redeemable in l a w f u l money on demand at the counter of the bank; and "" l a w f u l money,"" I take it , is silver money. They are also redeemable in United States notes on presentation at the Treasury. Every national bank ""Are is required to take and receive at par, for Follow- any debt of liability to it , the notes of other national banks. I may say that the national banks in America are p r i vate concerns, though the designation might lead one to suppose that they are Government institutions. They are called "" national"" banks because they are constituted under an Act passed by the Federal or National Legislature. In Everybody's Magazine, in an article on "" The New Banking,"" under the new Federal Banking Act , there is the following: At the end of last year the National Banks of the United States among, them had cash on hand (in round figures) of only . . . . $890,000,000. Their aggregate deposits (in round figures) were . . . . $8,300,000,000. That is to say, the depositors were entitled to demand from the bank nine times inore money than the banks had to pay out. This expresses the lending power of a dollar. The cash reserve requirements arc changed. Where a country bank was required to keep IS per eent. before, it will keep only 12i per cent.; where a city bank was required to keep 25, it will keep only 15; and where banks in St. Louis, Chicago, and New York were required to keep 25 per cent., they will keep only 18. We all hope, I am sure, that the Commonwealth Bank will ultimately take the place of the national bank system of America in assisting the Australian banks. I propose to show that the note issue of the Commonwealth is,-perhaps, the safest in the whole world, so far as security and liquid assets are concerned. First of all, I desire to speak of its pliability and mobility. Time was when there were forty-eight different notes issued by as many banks in the various States; ancl it will be remembered that on a note sent from one State to another, in those days, exchange was charged as in the case of cheques. Later on, the banks were good enough to make the notes current, to the great convenience of the public. There is one advantage I find in the 10s. note. My son, for instance, is 35 miles from a post-office, and if I send him a post-office order he has to travel that distance in order to get it cashed, whereas, if I send him 10s. notes in a registered letter, he is in possession of money i m mediately he receives it . That is an advantage never before enjoyed in the history of Australia. Then again, the security of the notes has been secured in a way never before attained, so far as my. reading of the subject goes, in any country in the world. I do not know any bank in which a f u n d is laid aside, ancl cannot be touched except by an Act of Parliament. On the 30th September last I received a letter from the Under-Treasurer, Mr G. T. Allen, who may be complimented on the fact that his name will ultimately appear on more bank notes than that of any man in the world. This recalls a story of the celebrated Mr May, Governor of the Bank of England, who, when touring Scotland, offered a cheque : to the hostess of an hotel. The good lady was dubious about the cheque, and asked him, "" How do I know it is your signature ?"" He got her to produce an English £5 note, and pointed out that his signature also appeared on that. This, however, only convinced the hostess that her guest was a forger, and Mr May had to explain to the police, who were promptly sent for. The letter from Mr . Allen was as follows:In answer to your telephonic request, the following figures are furnished, viz POSITION OF NOTE ACCOUNT AT 30TH SEPTEMBER, 1914. Note Issue .. .. £13.066.966 Gold Reserve .. .. 6^567^496 Amount invested. . . .. 6,902,500 Interest received, £65S,491, less expenses (£95,065) .. 563,426 Interest earned per annum. . 227,085 Face value of a ton of sovereigns .. .. £127,190 Face value of a ton of silver coin .. .. .. 8,983 Face value of a ton of copper (pence) .. .. .. 448 None of the greatest banks in England, France, Germany, Italy , Austria, or any other country have a gold deposit equal to that mentioned in the letter of Mr Allen. I have already pointed out that in the case of the national banks of the United States £ 9 may be advanced for every £ 1 in gold, and that now the amount of gold held as seeurity has been decreased.",52
439,Mr FLEMING,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"In the United States they had the biggest money crisis in the world, owing to their short reserve.",55
440,Dr MALONEY,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"I think that was owing to the faulty banking system, which is now being amended in the direction of giving it stability and security of tenure. Against this gold reserve what are the claims? Only the notes that are in circulation. The assets comprise £6,500,000 in gold, balances amounting to £563,000, and an amount of £6,900,000 lent out on gilt-edged securities to the States. Let honourable members look at the assets and liabilities of the London Joint Stock Bank, one of the strongest banks in the world. It has cash in hand, £2,988,000; by money at call and short notice, £3,556,000. Against those amounts are - mone y due by the bank on current accounts, deposit receipts, circular notes, & c , £17,850,000; acceptances on account of Customs, £1,458,000. This statement. I am reading from does not give the bank's deposits. The first claim on a bank's resources is its note issue. The next claim is by the owners of current accounts, and after them, the owners of deposits at callThen every man who has adeposit at the stated period has a claim, provided he can gefc an advance. In the time of the big crash following the boom, even the Bank of New South Wales would not give assistance to men who had large amounts on deposit. One man who had a deposit of £800 to his credit asked for £50 and was refused. I went next day to the manager, and he kindly arranged to allow the depositor to draw £ 3 0 on that day and £ 2 0 on the following day; he explained that he could not do more. What bank has a security equal to that which is comprised by these Australian notes? Let honourable members compare our Bank with the Bank of England, which has such huge amounts at call, ancl at seven days' notice, and they will see that it is wonderful how the institution is able to carry on.",55
441,Unknown,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,Sitting suspended from 6.SO to S p.m.,56
442,Dr MALONEY,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"When the sitting was suspended, I was endeavouring to show that the Commonwealth Bank, during the two years of its existence, has acquired a larger sum in gold than have many of the most powerful banks in the world, and that when it has obtained the proposed increased capital of £10,000,000. which it will presently secure by the issue of debentures or otherwise, it will possess a larger capital than will any national bank in the world, with the exception of the Bank of England, which has a capital of £14,553,000. In other words, the Bank of Erance, the Bank of Bussia, the Bank of Germany, and the Bank of It a l y do not possess the same amount of capital as will our Commonwealth Bank. As a matter of fact, many offchelarger financial institutions of the world have not as much gold in their coffers today as has the monwealth Bank, after only two years of existence. What I propose to show is that this Parliament, if it chooses, can make our Commonwealth notes safer in war time than are the notes of any country, not excepting those of England. There is no gainsaying the factfchafcthere is no such thing as credit when an in vading army enters a country. If Germany were, unfortunately, to conquer England tomorrow, of what use would be the notes of the Bank of England ? But . by making use of the silver which we produce, we can make our Commonwealth notes absolutely safe. Even if an enemy's fleet were to land an army of occupation here, our Commonwealth Bank would be able to offer our citizens a greater chance of having money to plant in their backyards than they would otherwise have. On the SOth June of this year, silver was sold in the open market in London for 2s. ner ounce. Now, an ounce of silver will make 5s. 6d. worth of currency. I wrote a letter to the Age pointing this out, and stressing the fact that 175 per cent, profit could be immediately made by minting our own silver. Honorablo members know that, during the past few years, the Commonwealth, which has been minting gold at a slight loss, has been given the privilege of minting its own silver, but that for purposes of expediency our silver has been minted in England at a cost of 5 per cent., including insurance and freight. In view of the large expense involved in the purchase of land, buildings, and machinery in connection with every mint, it will be seen that the cost of labour must be very small indeed. If we allow 4 per cent, for the minting of silver in Australia, it is obvious that the extra 25 per cent, would more than pay the wages of the men who would be thus employed. If the Commonwealth would purchase all the silver produced by the Barrier mines, it would have a large fund of current coin of ifcs own. In consideration of our embarking upon this enterprise, the Broken Hill mines should be kept working full time. If they refused to do that, the State of New South Wales, by virtue of the law of eminent domain, should seize those mines, work them, and hand over all profits made to the companies concerned. On the other hand, if the mines were worked at a loss, the companies should suffer. But it is Comobvious that there would be very little chance of any loss being incurred. The letter which I wrote to the Age attracted the attention of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company, whose directorate requested me to grant its members an in terview. I did so, and I had the pleasure of meeting Mr E . L . Baillieu, who assured me that his company would be only too pleased to accept the terms which I had outlined. He further declared that it would be willing to accept even 30 per cent, less than the selling price of silver in London before the declaration of war. In other words, it was prepared to accept Is. 4 4-5d. per ounce for its silver. Honourable members will see that that would allow the Commonwealth to make a profit of 292 per cent, upon the minting of silver. In other words, for every-£l,000,000 worth of notes issued for the purchase of silver won by Australian workers from Australian mines, we sliould get in silver coin £3,928,571, less 4 per cent, for minting.  nage of silver in circulation?",56
443,Dr MALONEY,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"I cannot say offhand. The value of a ton of silver is £8,983. It may interest the honourable member to know that at the back of our Commonwealth note issue there are 51 tons of minted gold, and that the £10,000,000 loan granted to the Commonwealth by the banks is equivalent to another 70 tons; so that we have 121 tons in gold alone. What I propose is that every note of the Commonwealth should be redeemable, 25 per cent, in gold, and 75 per cent, in silver. If an army of occupation came to Australia, every citizen knows that by a regulation it could make all our Commonwealth notes nothing but pieces of tissue paper. In such circumstances, nobody will deny that every citizen would like to have'his savings in hard cash so that he might plant them wherever he deemed them to be safe. Men who have experienced the terrors of war have assured me that at such times they prefer to have small money rather than gold, because it enables them to purchase commodities more easily. Under my scheme, our citizens would be able to get 25 per oent. of the value of their notes in gold, and 75 per cent, in silver. It is significant that many persons entertain a doubt as to the value of notes. In this they cannot be kept on, connection, I may mention one incident which happened during the boom time here. A shareholder in one of the banks, angry that he had lost a lot of money in - [62] them, endeavoured to make use of the un- . employed by offering so many men a £ 1 note each, and requesting them to rush round to a certain bank and demand gold for it , his idea being that the institution would not honour its notes. I prevented effect being given to his suggestion, and for my action received the thanks of the bank. Men have doubted whether notes are of any use; and if we go into some banks and ask for 10s. notes, some of the superfine darlings, which many bank clerks are - I was a bank clerk many years ago, and know-wil l curl up their lips at the mention of a 10s. note. Not taking into consideration the £10,000,000 which the splendid partnership of the States and the Commonwealth has placed at the disposal of the community, the £6,500,000 in the coffers of the Treasury on the 30th September last ou a 25 per cent, basis would give us £26,000,000. Of this, of course, £6,500,000 would be ear-marked for the gold and £5,200,000 would be ear-marked for silver. We have already invested £6,992,500, which earns £227,085 a year, leaving £7,307,500 for investment, which sliould bring in a further in come of £292,300 a year at 4 per cent., giving a total of £519,385, which would be available for a f u n d which could be ear-marked and placed beyond the-reach of any Treasurer except by the passage of a Bill through both Houses. Thus we would have a currency of notes, not necessarily going up to £26,000,000; but how different from any other notes in the world. I believe that the Commonwealth should purchase every ton of copner produced in Australia, and thus enable the mines to be kept going. Owing to the superlative richness of our copper lodes, we can produce copper more cheaply bhan any other part of the world. We also produce zinc. Why should not a sufficient amount be advanced by the Commonwealth for the purchase of zinc concentrates, so that our silver mines may be kept going ? Mr Baillieu, in sneaking of the Broken Hill mines, expressed the hope that the companies would be able to keep on working; and where a city with 40,000 people is dependent on these mines, it is a scandal and a shame that I am willing to accept Mr Baillieu's assurance that, thanks to arrangements made with the banks, the mines can give the workmen employment at half time, which will . average £ 6 a week for those who work, or £ 3 week in and week out. If that is so, I must compliment the mines; but at the same time, if the Commonwealth Government would purchase the product of the mines at cost price, even sufficient to keep them going, we have the assurance of Mr Baillieu that the companies would be glad to resume full operations. I see no reason why this should not be done. No one can say what are the potentialities in regard to the market for lead so long as the nations are so foolish as to wage war as they are now doing, and in regard to its commercial utility the demand is unlimited. electricity coming into use more and more - becaus e we are only on the fringe of discovery in that direction-n o one can place a limit on the demand for copper. I hope that during the recess the wisdom of the Government will be directed towards finding a means of overcoming the terrible unemployment that is sure to come about. I am not content with the Tariff from a protective point of view. Of course, in this terrible period, the Government must not be too ready to stop the supply of revenue, but while recognising that fact, I hope that they will understand my action in exercising^ as I intend to do, my free right; as a member of this House fco vote in every instance for an increase of duty. Mr ""WEBSTER - Revenu e duties?",57
444,Dr MALONEY,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"I shall vote at every opportunity for an increase of duties. I - want protective duties. England is held up fco us as a great Eree Trade country, but she has never been a Pree Trade country. England was such a highlyprotected country afc one time that there were, i u a single year, no less than seventy-five death penalties for breaches of the Excise and Customs Act . doubt now whether"" the death penalties in a year exceed the fingers on one hand.  that rotten Free Trade country for the money that we require ?",58
445,Dr MALONEY,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"If necessary, people will go to Hades for money lenders. I say nothing against the Home Land. My mother came from Great Britain , and the love of my heart goes out to the British nation, though, at the same time, I detest some of the laws which press too heavily on the poor of the United Kingdom. I suppose that some honourable members would be perfectly willing to base the Tariff upon the duty we would impose upon goods coming in from the United Kingdom, while preserving a sufficient margin to balance our higher state of living, our better wages, and our better working conditions. Starting from that basis, I would be in clined to give the Home Land 5 per cent, preference over our Allies, and then I think our Allies should have the same preference against neutral countries, while I would give them 50 per cent;, preference against our enemies.",58
446,Mr FENTON,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"How would you treat Japan ? Again, with Dr MALONEY - J a p a n is an allied nation. I have never said a word deprecatory of the Japanese. What I fear about the Japanese is their splendid qualities. I look upon Japan as one of the greatest nations. Possibly it will be the first co-operative Commonwealth, for Japan has had the wisdom to nationalize more industries than any other nation. I have no objection to the great German race, especially those in the middle and southern parts of Germany. My opinion is the same as that of Heine, the great German who spent his life in Paris. He spoke of the horror and terror of the Prussian race. That is the race I dislike. I have still a great veneration for the teachings of my old German friends in the past, men who had to leave their country in 1848, and even after the lapse of for t y years, when the amnesty was proclaimed, were not allowed to land in Germany through the brutality of that dead tyrant, Bismarck. I should welcome any members of the German race who wanted to settle in Australia with their families; but I do not want to support any of their products, at any rate, u n t i l we have I punished them. No nation has ever yet risen to greatness under Free Trade. The only really Free Trade place I was ever in was Hong Kong. In the year I was there, 1,100 dead bodies were thrown out into the streets, 200 of the deaths having occurred from cholera, plague, and small-pox, and because I published in the daily press the records kept by what they call a Government, they forbade my books to he sold there. I told them that I considered this was an honour, as I had only told the truth. We being 12,000 miles from the centre of the trouble, do not feel the full effects of the w a r ; but we can do our share: It is however a fact that many men. who have given donations of from £50 to £200 to the Patriotic fund have immediately reduced the wages of the men working for them, or lessened the number of hands employed, while, in some cases they are trying to do more. There was one man who adopted an English alias, and after taking the oath of fealty, and a further oath as an officer in the Automobile Corps, was found to have been writing treasonable letters; yet the Army and Navy Club-the frills and feathers club in Swanston-street, who expelled a straight man for criticising another-allowe d this traitor to resign. There are too many frills and feathers about that twopenny-halfpenny, tin-pot club. The three colonels who demanded Major Mclnerney's resignation were only mosquito colonels. Not one of them had volunteered, but I am glad to say that two of them have now done so. If they are accepted, they will be luckier than I have been, because the authorities would not take me. In regard to the question of unemployment, I accuse the Home Affairs Department of not doing as much as it could and should do. I accuse Colonel Owen, and particularly Colonel Miller, that dictator and would be emperor of the Federal Capital, and Mr. Hill , in this regard. I do not want to say a harsh word of Mr Murdoch, who is a good and capable architect in every sense of the word; but he is too much under the thumb of Colonel Miller. Colonel Miller and others had the gross insolence to alter a work of art sent in by a gentleman who won a competition in which they themselves did not have the courage to compete. I have never known a Labour man or unionist to be treated decently by Colonel Miller. He tries to crucify men, and I , as a member, will not stand by and see a man crucified on the cross of departmental jealousy and incapacity. Let these men come out in the open and compete. The man who wins the prize ought to have the ful l honour of building the Capital; but not one of those men is able to do it. A man who graduated from the Trades Hall, and had something to do with the Trades Hall Art School, is not class enough for these gentlemen.",58
447,Mr WEBSTER,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,What does the Minister say to this?,59
448,Mr ARCHIBALD,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,He is talking rubbish. [62]- 2,59
449,Dr MALONEY,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"About as much rubbish as the Minister. There was-one Minister of Home Affairs who was the first man to have the pluck to introduce preference to unionists, and his name is known throughout Australia, because the previous election was fought on that question. I refer to the honourable member for Darwin. He required the officers of the Department to sign their names on arriving at the office in the morning; but he was also man enough to sign his own name. Now, however, the present Minister has not the pluck to require Colonel Miller to sign his name. Look at the type of man who says that I am talking rubbish. Why, his very hair stands on end I He is not fit to loose the boots of the honourable member for Darwin, who was the first man to put Colonel Miller in his place. The Department should not be ruled by tliese heads, and I am sick and tired of it. I am credibly informed, and believe, that 3,000 men can be put on the roads at the Federal Capital; but when I asked a question on the subject. I was told that the Departmental Board had charge of. the business. Not one of the members of that Board had the pluck or ability to compete in the competition for designs for the Capital; but they got together, and stole a bit of an idea from one plan, another bit from a second plan, and so on, and produced a plan which they called their own. When I asked the Minister a question about the cost of visits to the Federal Capital, I was given a lying answer. There were five separate picnics up there, and I was told that the cost was only £50. I suppose that was rubbish also. At any rate, the answer was a lie.",59
450,Mr WEBSTER,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,Has not Mr Griffin an action at law against them for pirating?,59
451,Dr MALONEY,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,I do not know; but I hope I am not the only member here who will refuse to stand by and see a man crucified by departmental jealousy. I want to see the Federal Capital built. Why should it not be ?,59

I do not want to quarrel; but my life is too well known for me tq be called cowardly. I do not go behind a man and try to stab him in the back like these men are doing. I compliment the late Government on bringing out Mr Griffin to see his own plan carried out, instead of allowing the departmental heads to run the show. What has happened now is just as if Ave brought out a splendid Avork by Rubens, and commissioned a little amateur artist to alter it, or handed over the plans of a great architect like Wren to be ""improved "" by these departmental officers. None of us would have objected to their competing for the prize; but they did not have the pluck to enter. There is a man named Tompkins, head of the architects here, Avho told the Minister a deliberate untruth, as I can prove. He said that no architect had commenced to work on the designs; but I can produce two in the city of Melbourne Avho had done so.",60

462,Mr WEBSTER,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,The honourable member does not blame them for stopping the Federal Capital?,60
463,Dr MALONEY,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"I do blame them. I knoAv the history of Washington, which today is the picture city of the wide world. L'enfant, the architect of that city, Avas a man of genius. He conceived the idea of the city which people see today. But his heart was cut out of him by departmental officers and other persons. It was years before America gave him any credit, Avhen a sum of money was voted for him. I do not wish the same thing to happen again in Australia. There are architects here whose good opinion can be taken. Are we going to break a contract with the Avhole Avorld because there has been a change of Government? I am ashamed of what has happened.

472,Mr GROOM,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"Darling DOAVUS) [8.33]. - Every one must sympathize Will Ministers because of the heavy burden that has been placed upon them. It is necessary for them to obtain financial means to enable the country to pass through the present crisis. They have, therefore, submitted various financial proposals which naturally invite our criticism. I wish, first, to make some remarks concerning the Tariff proposals. I think that these have been unduly rushed before Parliament. That has been done, I take it, not in view of the necessities of any industry, but because of the necessities of the Treasury. The revenue of £1,500,000 which it is hoped to raise by Customs and Excise duties is needed by the Treasury, and, in my opinion, the duties have been framed primarily to give revenue. The schedule has not been carefully arranged in accordance with Protectioiiist ideas. I do not think that the Minister of Trade and Customs has had in view so much the framing of a scienwith tific Protective Tariff as the imposition of duties which would give revenue.",60
473,Mr TUDOR,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,I think that this Tariff will give more protection than any we not the case. have yet had.,61
474,Mr GROOM,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"The Commonwealth, having the right to impose duties of toms and Excise, naturally makes them its main source of revenue, but in shaping a Protective T a r i ff four general prin ciples should be kept in view. In the which first place, it is considered by Protecthese tionists that the development of primary and secondary industries may be legititected mately encouraged by the imposition of Customs duties. In furtherance of this end, adequate duties placed on imported goods likely to collected conle into competition with made by the industries which it is these Tariff proposals. desired to protect and foster, and also on substitutes which might be used stead of locally made articles. In the second place, the raw material of manufrom factures which cannot reasonably be protold duced locally is admitted free. In the third place, machinery, machine tools, soon as he could. and tools of trade which cannot be reasonably manufactured in the protected country are admitted free. In the f o u place, a number of articles are legitiTariff mately taxed purely for revenue purposes, but so that the taxation may f all as f as possible upon those who possess the greatest ability to pay, the rates are higher on luxuries, stimulants, and cotics than on articles of general conaction with respect sumption. This Tariff violates all those principles. Honourable members have not been supplied with information to guide them as to the need for any of the duties that have been proposed. We do not know the value of the industries it is proposed to protect, what capital been invested in them, what their plant or what number of hands they employ.  easily be obtained.",61

476,Mr TUDOR,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,I did not act on advice of any one; it was my own idea.,61
477,Mr GROOM,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"The Minister was sponsible for it , but I think that his officials held the same view as he did regarding it . At any rate, he was equipped some information thus obtained on the various matters affected by his proposals, which he supplied to honourable members. . But today that is Some weeks ago I asked if he was having schedules filled in by those who desired protection, and Cushis reply was that he had advised the manufacturers who desired protection to make their applications to the Inter-State - Commission. We know from an answer he gave yesterday that in f r a m in g duties he did not ask those interested in the industries which are being prof o r any information at all regarding their needs. During the last two months the Minister has been guided, I are presume, by the statistical information by the Department, without any goods inquiries from the persons concerned in There has obviously been no careful inquiry from the in - consumer's point of view.",61
478,Mr TUDOR,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"This is a different tale that which the honourable gentleman before the elections, when he said that he was going to amend the Tariff as",61
479,Mr GROOM,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"I said nothing of the r t h sort. Whafc I said was that, as regards anomalies, the late Government were prepared to deal with them, and, as a r regards the general items of the Tariff, immediately we received a progress report made from the Inter-State Commission upon narthem we should be prepared to take to the Tariff. Every member of the Committee is aware that the principal difficulty experienced by this House in dealing with Tariff matters has been due to the fact that we have not, in respect of any specific item, been able to get carefully sifted evidence which and collated facts to guide us in has endeavouring to do justice between all is, parties concerned. The absence of such information has operated injuriously to manufacturers, producers, consumers, and workers alike. The Minister of Trade and Customs knows well that mistakes The have been made in this House in dealing on with the Tariff from time to time entirely because we have lacked sifted in formation as to the effect of the proposals the made. On the item of photographic films alone we have had evidence that the re Minister did not obtain carefully sifted evidence which would satisfy him that the duty proposed would operate according to his intention. Mr TuDon - I would sooner admit that I made a mistake than lean up agaiust some one else.",61
480,Mr GROOM,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"No one is asking the honourable gentleman to lean up against any one, but when we are asked to legislate, the House should have positive and definite information, in order that we may do justice to all the parties concerned and avoid such mistakes. Here is a statement of his views on this subject, given by the present Attorney General when speaking, in 1912, at the manufacturers' dinner in Sydney. The honourable gentleman saidHe hoped to see some comprehensive review and revision of the Tariif on a scientific and business basis. The Tariff was not a question to be treated as if it were one of party politics. True, Protection and Free Trade were party questions; but once they established a fiscal policy for Australia, then the giving effect to that policy should not be a party matter at all. The adjustment of the Tariff was a matter for investigation and adjustment on the merits of each particular item. He admitted that Parliament was not the best instrument to arrive at that information. Whether the Inter-State Commission or some other body should do so was a matter for consideration. But the question should be settled on those lines, having regard to the requirements of the manufacturers, workmen, and consumers, and the public generally. The Minister of Trade and Customs not dispute that statement. We know from past experience in the framing of Tariffs in this House that Parliament is not the besfc body to make Tariff investiserve gations. Supremacy must be retained Parliament. Ifc must decide the policy, but, in order to apply effectively the ciples of which it approves, it must the whole of the facts connected with industries concerned. Unless we follow ploying 337,162 hands. upon those lines we shall continue make mistakes, and, instead of having true Protective policy, worked oufc clear and continuous lines, we shall ourselves frequently amending the Tariff because of the anomalies which are bound to arise. This is a matter of importance to us all. We in Australia owe our existence as a nation to the fact that we are great primary producers. not desirable that we should be primary producers only. We can, and ought, to become a manufacturing nation. object is to make Australia a self-conresult, tained nation, supplying all its needs requirements, so far as that can reasonably be done. I have here some figures which will serve to indicate the extent to which we are dependent upon primary productions in this country. In 1912, our agricultural output was valued afc £45,754,000. The output of our pastoral industries was valued at £51,615,000; dairying, £20,280,000; forestry, £6,432,000; or a total of £124,081,000. That sum represents the output of the primary industries referred fco for one year. The output of those in dustries has gone on increasing, and the value has mounted up. It is because of the splendid returns we are able to get in the markets of the world for the products of our primary industries that we have been able to pay the high rates of wages which we have paid in all the cities of Australia. Ifc is therefore incumbent upon us, if we wish to maintain, and even to increase, the standard of living in our cities, to do all that is possible to encourage and increase the primary productions of Australia, and make it easier and cheaper for those engaged in our primary industries to in crease their output. The mining industry is another of our primary industries, and its output in 1912 is valued at £25,629,000. The value added to materials used in the factories of Australia in 1912 amounted to £57,022,000. So that the value of the output of our prim canary and secondary industries in 1912 amounted to no less than £206,732,000. Whilst it is important that we should preand encourage our primary in by dustries, we must at the same time do what we can to safeguard the manufacprinturing industries which are reasonably know suited to our requirements. We had in the Australia last year 15,550 factories, emSalaries and to wages paid amounted to £35,585,248; the a value of lands and buildings was on £36,869,908; and the value of plant; and find machinery was £37,217,274. The value added fco the material used in our factories in 1907 amounted to £38,063,153, and last year-1913-that added value had grown to £65,197,247. That is fco say that; our Protective Tariff, originally It is introduced by the Right Honourable C C. Kingston, gradually took root in Australia ; manufactories grew up under it ; Our the Tariff was modified in 1908, and, as a we find the returns I have just and given. I say that Australia can well be proud of the primary productions of their country, and also of the work done in factories. Dealing with Australia as whole, we want to be a nation with all a nation's various activities; and when we propose to put into effect a compreand hensive policy we must give due conrelating sideration to all the interests concerned. Above all, we must realise the fact that any in j u r y done to the primary industries of Australia must re-act upon our great secondary industries. Our primary dustrie's must therefore be safeguarded the greatest possible extent. sidents of our cities especially must realise tries. that the greater our rura l production, and the more extensive the settlement of our land, the greater will be our home mission . markets. We cannot look at the present time to a great extent to the Continental markets for the disposed posal of the products of our secondary industries. We have only a limited market for them. Our labour conditions, manufactures. the cost of transit, and other things make the cost of production in Australia relatively high. In years to come, may they come soon, we may expect to be exporters of manufactures. many years to come, however, we what must have regard mainly to the primary industries, at the same time building up our secondary industries so that we may become a self-contained nation. My own ideal is that, if in time of war we are in a position of isolation, we may be to supply all our own requirements. Let us now look at the way in which the Tariff has been framed. 663 applications for Tariff alterations have been submitted to the Intertoms State Commission. Of course, a private member has not at his command all the speaking of the principle. officers of a Department to assist him, in the brief time at my disposal, I have examined, as far as possible, the nature of the duties proposed and the applications made to the Commission, in order to ascertain exactly what has happened. A tabulated list has appeared in the Age, representing, roughly, I suppose, about 200 items. Of these, about 25 per cent., have been referred to the Inter-State Commission to be dealt with in some way-t modify duties, to give preference, to grant bonuses, and so forth . of course, must have been roughly made out, because, to accurately go through all reason 1 the items, would be a comprehensive work the requiring the knowledge of an expert. a This means that we are called upon to deal with the remaining 75 per cent, of items without any careful investigation, in the absence of reliable information to the industries concerned. We are asked to deal with the Tariff in the old haphazard way, with nothing to guide us but representations by the parties i m mediately interested-the way in which in - we have been forced to deal with the to Tariff year after year, and which has, in The re- . many instances, proved fatal to indus",62
481,Mr RICHABD FOSTER,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,We have stil l to get the report of the Inter-State Com,63
482,Mr GROOM,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,I only hope that that report will be available before the produties are finally dealt with.  return showing the growth of the various,63
483,Mr GROOM,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"I speak feelingly on that point, because, when in ofiice, I had and to organize the Department of Census and Statistics. We in Parliament realized that For we did not know everything, and that was required was a sort of Intelligence Department to make specific investigations, and enable us to legislate in accordance with facts. We can, I believe, be proud of that Department, for there put is not a Tear-Book in the world that can able compare with the one issued by Mr . Knibbs. That is an opinion I heard expressed ' only today by a distinguished Some visitor from abroad.",63
484,Mr FENTON,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"All the same, the Cusstatistics are not up to date.",63
485,Mr GROOM,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"That may be; but I am When dealbut ing with the Tariff, we ought to have accurate information before us, so as to be able to lay down a sound basis, and prevent constant tinkering with the duties. The present Tariff proposals have been simply thrown at us; and, unless the deficiency I have indicated is made up, we shall be in a worse position than ever before. This mode of introducing a Tariff is not treating Parliament fair l y ; and it is so contrary to all common sense, that o it leads one to believe that the hurry is only because revenue exigencies demand This list, it .",63
486,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,Is that the only,63
487,Mr GROOM,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,I say . that appears to be the primary reason.,64
488,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,No ; there ' is other than by Australian another reason.,64
489,Mr GROOM,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"I believe there is also a desire to keep f a i th with the promises made in regard to the Tariff. A reference to one or two of the items will show the way in which the Tariff has been prepared-. The principle of a Tariff is to encourage the establishment of industries, and to interfere as little as possible with the importation of the necessary raw materials. According to the Tariff proposals before us, the duty on umbrellas and parasols is left exactly as it was, namely, 25 per cent.; but the duty on the raw material has been raised from 10 and 15 per cent, to 15 and 20 per cent. It will be seen that the effect really is to take away 5 per cent, of the protection previously afforded. We can quite that the Ministry in framing the Tariff have regarded silk as a luxury, quite ought forgetting that it is the raw material of an industry. Then, in regard a work of art ? to woollen-piece goods, the duty has been raised from 25 and 30 per inherent cent, to 30 and 35 per cent. woollen industry is one natural to the country, and a perfectly legitimate oue for protection; and, in seeking to establish industry, the principle is observed of taxing the necessary machinery which canone not be manufactured here, because to so is only to increase the cost of productouched, tion. We find, however-and the M ister of Trade and Customs specially ferred to fchis-that the duty on all maing chinery used in woollen mills, hat faccient, tories, tanneries, and so forth , has been raised from 15 per cent, to per cent. in the case of TJnited Kingdom, and 30 per cent, ing in the general Tariff. I have here a list of forty or fifty machinery items that are absolutely essential to the development of the woollen industry, none of which can be reasonably produced here, and yet the duty has been increased in the way I have shown. Then, in the boot industry, the raw material has been taxed; and so on in regard fco a number of other items which I need not refer. I only desire point out that there are those violations of the principles that have been laid down. This House, on the spur of the moment some time ago, decided to impose a prof tective duty of £ 1 or 25 per cent, in case of the TJnited Kingdom, and £ 1 5s. and 30 per cent, in the general Tariff, on oil or water-colour paintings, n.e.i., students or Australian artists abroad. That, to my mind, was one of the most absurd anomalies in the Tariff, and the Minister's attention has evidently been drawn to it , because he has rectified it in parts. Here is a case that came before me: A man livin g in Australia had a relative in England, and she went to a little country town and made a small painting, which was worth not more than a couple of shillings. She sent it out here to her relatives and they had to pay f l duty, because it was classified as a work of art.",64
490,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,I submitted a similar case to you from South Australia.,64
491,Mr GROOM,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,Yes ; several cases were see brought under my notice.  to have been satisfied to pay £ 1 for the compliment of having her work called,64
492,Mr GROOM,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"But the picture had no merit. It was sent to a person The who was unable to visit the Old Land, to recall a visit to that person's old home; but it was held up at the Post-office, and an the addressee could not get it u n t i l £1 not duty was paid. I mention that as just instance of the absurdity of that duty. do The sugar duties have been lef t unalthough a Royal Commission in - recommended that they should be dealt rewith. The farmers have been complainabout the maize duty not being suffion account of the competition of coloured labour, but no further protec25 tion is given on that commodity. On the looking through the Tariff, and compari t with the applications to the Interstate Commission, I find that there are in many instances increases for which no application was ever made to the Commission by any manufacturer. In one case an application was made to tha Commission for the removal of a duty, and the Government have replied to that to request by giving the Mother Country to preference, as against other countries. There are other cases of applications to the Inter-State Commission for increasos of duties, and of the reply being in the o r m of preference to the United K in gthe dom. Here are a number of things upou which preference has been given, or in creased protection granted, and in regard to which no application was made before the Commission: - Agricultural machinery, cream separators, chaff cutters, churns, strippers, machine tools, tools of trade, cement, woollen piece goods-rwit h a modified exception-and :sacks. On all those goods there have been increases of duty, many of them merely preferential duties, and some of them protective duties. But in no cases have the items been investigated as they should have been by the Minister. Honourable members opposite have boasted of the fair manner in which they are treating the Old Country, and the Tariff on its face - does look as if that cry was well founded. There are preferences of 5 and 10 per - cent, all through, and I am not surprised that one or two leading men outside Parliament, after a superficial glance at the Tariff, have remarked on what a fine thing it is to see Australia giving such a. substantial preference to the Mother Country. I admit that that is the general sentiment of the Australian people. We do desire to give some preference to the TJnited Kingdom, but we wish it to be a substantial preference. We find, however, that in this Tariff the preference, instead of being a real preference to the United Kingdom, is only a preference against other countries, in order to raise extra revenue. In many instances that extra revenue is raised from those who are engaged in primary production, and on the tools of workmen, who, in consequence, will find it more dimcult to earn their livelihood. If these preferences led to an expansion of the industries in the Old Country, one could justify them, but in many instances they are preference duties which the Old Country can never take advantage of, and for that reason they are obviously nothing else but revenue duties.  ence has been granted to the United Kingdom on machines that are not made there.",64
493,Mr GROOM,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"I desire to give some details in illustration of what I am saying, but my figures are subject to correction by the Department, because an individual member making his own investigations is naturally liable to err when there are hundreds of items affected, and he has only time to deal with them in a hurried manner. For instance, how nice the preference on pickles looks. The old duty was 6d. and 7$d. The Government have said, ""We had better give the Old Country a preference,"" with the result that the new duties are 6d. and 9d. At the present time the total importation of quarter-pints and smaller is 47,950 dozen, of which 46,127 dozen are already coming from the United Kingdom; so that practically the whole lot, with the exception of about 1,800 dozen, comes from the United Kingdom at the present time. Obviously the preference cannot operate there. Of halfpints, the total importation is 300,717 dozen, valued at £91,101, and of that total, 291,377 dozen, valued at £88,234, comes from the United Kingdom. Therefore there is only left about 9,000 dozen for the United Kingdom to capture.",65
494,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,It is a sham preference.,65
495,Mr GROOM,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"It looks well ana it sounds well to say that we raised this item from 7^d. to 9d., but actually the preference does not mean much. Of pints, the total importation was 96,933 dozen, valued at £37,922, of which 85,388 dozen, valued at £34,202, came from the United Kingdom. Another striking instance is provided by jams and jellies, which hav.i been raised from l^d. and 2d. to 2d. and 3d. The total importation from all countries last year was 453,951 lbs., of a value of £12,213, and of that quantity, 437,463 lbs., worth £11,651, comes from the United Kingdom. Again, preference has been given to the United Kingdom on malt. The importation in 1913 was 34,001 centals from all sources, valued at £31,071, and no less than 30,138 centals, valued at £27,347, came from the United Kingdom. Mustard also is interesting. To make it hot for the foreign country, a preferential duty has been put on that item. The total importation of mustard at present is 886,067 lbs., of which 846,035 lbs. comes from the Uuited Kingdom. In the case of canvas and duck, the value of the present importations is £344,333, of which £304,356 worth comes from the Mother Country. The same anomaly is to be discovered right through a number of these items. We find thai the Government are giving preference upon goods in which the Old Countiy has almost the whole trade at. the present time. I admit that there are other items .to which this criticism does not apply.",65
496,Mr TUDOR,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,Do not admit that.,66
497,Mr GROOM,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"I must admit that, in justice to the Government, but I have mentioned these other items to show the haphazard way in which the T a r i ff has been framed. Take, again, bags and sacks for bran, chaff, and compressed fodder. The total importation at present is 1,223,922 dozen, valued at £351,546, of which the United Kingdom sends us 350 dozen, valued at £ 1 0 0 ; the Straits Settlements, 750 dozen, valued at £ 2 4 7; and India, 1,222,822 dozen, valued at £351,199. Oould the preference which has been given in the T a r i ff operation be anything like a substantial preference to the Old Country?",66
498,Mr TUDOR,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,Yes .,66
499,Mr GROOM,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"How can it be done? How is the Minister going to do it? Will the duty of 10 per cent, cause a transfer of the trade from India to the United Kingdom? There is not the slightest doubt that the item is nothing but a revenue duty put on the primary producers of this country, and that it cannot operate to give a preference at all . If it could operate, and give a preference to Great Britain , ib could be justified. Of. corn and flour bags the total importation is 3,483,322 dozens, of which we import from India 3,483,073 dozens, valued at £1,153,908. No corn and flour bags are imported from the United Kingdom, yet the Government are giving a preference to the United Kingdom- a preference which cannot operate in any way. Take again the item of mowers, reapers, and binders. The Minister has taken this item out of the free list, and made the articles free and 5 per cent. The total importation is valued at £160,281 , namely, from United Kingdom, £ 1 6 , 3 4 1 ; from Canada, £ 8 4 , 6 4 2; from the United States of America, £ 6 1 , 2 4 8 ; and from other countries, £ 5 0 . I am sure that the Minister wil l not contend that in this case he is imposing a, protective duty. It can only operate as a revenue duty, and it is a revenue duty levied on the manufactures of a sister' Dominion, which exports over £84,000 worth to Australia. Again, take the case of strippers and harvesters. From England we import absolutely nothing, from Canada, £65,459 worth ; and fro m the United States of America, £11,816 worth. The Government have raised the duty on this item from £ 1 2 to £ 1 4 , giving a preference of £ 2 . It can operate as a protective duty, but it certainlv is not likely to give a preference to Great B r i tain. Of the metal of these, we import £226,146 worth from Canada, and £60,381 worth from the United States. The Minister has given a preference to the Old Country, but nothing is imported from there. If it operated it would transfer trade from one part of the Empire to the United Kingdom. The same remark applies to churns and many other items. If honourable members examine the Tariff and apply the principles I laid down at the beginning, it will be seen that the Tariff violates every principle which is applied in the formation of a scientific protective system. In the first place, it does not pretend to pick out the leading industries in Australia, and try to put them on a satisfactory protective basis. In the second place, it deliberately imposes revenue duties on machinery which is required in our manufacturing industries. It deliberately puts ever so many revenue duties on various items I have mentioned, such as cream separators, chaff-cutters, churns, strippers, machine tools and tools of trade which are. required in the secondary industries. If the secondary industries do not flourish, the primary industries will languish. Even raw material which is required by various industries is taxed. In every possible way the Minister seems to have violated the principles of proper taxation. Revenue duties should be so imposed that they f all upon people according to their ability to pay. So far as the Minister taxes luxuries, no one can find f a u l t with him, but when one looks through the Tariff he sees that the revenue duties are falling even on the tools of trade required by the workmen in their ordinary avocations, that is in cases where"" their manufacture cannot be successful. If it can be established clearly that these tools of trade can be manufactured in the Commonwealth, they ought, I think, to be made dutiable. It shows how absurdly the whole of the Tariff has been drawn up. It proves the absurdity of attempting to legislate without having a proper investigation before a scientific body, capable of supplying accurate information. I think that before the consideration of the Tariff has proceeded far the Minister will be glad to revise the duties on a good many items, and probably he w i ll be only too pleased to accept the leading and guide he will be able to get from the Inter-State Commission. I do not wish to say anything more on the Tariff. It has been brought forward in a most haphazard manner. I arn sorry that, in deciding upon the taxation to meet the requirements of the present situation, the Ministry did not pay due regard to the necessities of the States. Both the Commonwealth and the States can be indirectly affected by the war, and will feel the results of it . The Commonwealth has a legitimate sphere of taxation, on which it should live. We have a supreme power. We can range over the whole compass if we like, but obviously it was intended that Customs and Excise should be sources of revenue. The States can never carry on effectually if the Commonwealth disregards what are legitimate State sources of taxation. clearly recognised when Federation was being established. Mr B . R. Garran wrote a little book called "" The Coming Commonwealth."" Dealing with the question of land taxation, he saidWhatever the Federal fiscal policy should be, it is likely that there would at least be a revenue Tariff sufficient and, perhaps, far more than sufficient, for ordinary Federal requirements. It is, therefore, unlikely that, except in great emergencies, the Federal Government need resort to other modes of taxation; but since emergencies may happen, its powers of direct and indirect taxation ought to be unlimited.  book ?",66
500,Mr GROOM,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"The book was published prior to Federation; but it shows what was in the minds of those who were in strumental in bringing about the Federation, and laying the foundation of our scheme of government. It shows the lines on which they thought that the in strument would work.",67
501,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,It was one of the most valuable publications in pre-Federal days.,67
502,Mr GROOM,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"It was. January, 1901, in the first policy speech he delivered, Sir Edmund Barton dealt with this questionNow as to taxation by the Commonwealth, I may tell you that I feel, quite as fully as any Treasurer could, that such a power is not to he harshly or rashly exercised. In this case any rash exorcise of the power might be disastrous to every State. We have taken over great obligations from the States; but we have taken over the Customs with them, and you must recollect that if, after the Commonwealth imposes its Tariff, the States require more revenue, they can only obtain it by direct taxation within the States. The exercise of the power by the Commonwealth imposes on us an enormous responsibility; but in carrying out that responsibility they would interfere as little as possible with the States of the Commonwealth, as it was absolutely necessary to leave the field of direct taxation to those States. The States should be studied in every way, and the early difficulties of so great a change made as little trying as possible. There must be no direct taxation by the Commonwealth unless under the pressure of some great national emergency, and noteven then if it can bo avoided. Then Sir George Reid, speaking on the 21st January, 1901, is reported in the Sydney Morning Herald to have saidMr Barton says he is against direct taxation in the Commonwealth, except in the case our main of emergency. As I pronounced this policy two or throe weeks before, I am very glad Mr. Barton has in this respect adopted my views. When the Labour party framed its That was Federal platform, at the Inter-State Labour Conference which was held in January, 1900, it made no provision in it for a Federal land tax. It provided only for electoral reform, the total exclusion of coloured aliens, and old-age pensions.  able member quoting?",67
503,Mr GROOM,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,Fro m a volume by a very reliable authority in the person of the Hon. W . G. Spence. The graduated tax upon unimproved land values appeared in the Federal Labour platform for the first time in the year 1908.,67
504,Mr TUDOR,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,If c was adopted at the Brisbane Conference?,67
505,Mr GROOM,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"Yes . I have made these quotations for the purpose of showing that, when Federation was established, every political party realized that the Commonwealth would take over large revenues from the States-revenue s which would be derived from Customs and Excise. They recognised that if the Commonwealth endeavoured fco exercise powers of direct taxation it might very On the 17th easily embarrass the finances of the States. That being so, we ought not to exercise our powers of direct taxation except in case of national emergency. But, as a matter of fact, whafc are we doing ? We have already invaded the State domain of taxation by imposing a Federal land tax. This year it is estimated that £2,700,000 will be collected from that source. It is rather interesting to note how the proposed increased land tax will operate. Will it fall only on the "" f at man""? In 1912 the sum of £525,45o was collected from town lands, and £919,805 from country lands. Preserving approximately the same proportion during the current nnancial year, £1,000,000 will be derived from city lands, and £1,700,000 from rural lands. Now, the £1,000,000 which will be derived from the cities will not lead to the bursting up of any estates, and the men who own large properties fchere will pass on the fcax as part of the cosfc of running their businesses. In other words, the tax will be felfc by their tenants. Consequently it will operate in a way that my honourable friends opposite do not desire.  leaseholds ?",67
506,Mr GROOM,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"Yes . But we have not yet before us the amending Bill dealing with leaseholds which the Treasurer has promised to submit for our consideration. Thenfcheprobate duties, whioh it is proposed to levy, will press very heavily deed. If honourable members wish to institute a comparison between the probate duties operating in the various States, they have merely to turn to the sixth volume of Erdbbs, page 814. There they will find that the highest duty operaI tive in New South Wales, Victoria, and Tasmania, upon estates valued at more than £100,000, is 10 per cent. But, in Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia, a tax of 10 per cent, is levied upon all estates in excess of £20,000 value. I need scarcely point out that the proposed duties will be in tion fco those which are imposed by the States. Thus, in Queensland, a 10 per cent, duty will be collected upon an estate of about £20,000 value, in addition to a Federal duty of approximately £4 12s. per oent. Bufc the chief trouble about fchis taxation is that it will render it more dimcult for the States to adjust their revenues. It is to be regretted the Government have not observed the principles which were obviously in the minds of the framers of our Constitution. What is still more disconcerting is the factfchafcthese taxes are apparently contemplated as permanent sources of revenue. Our expenditure will be founded upon them. This will make it more difficult for any future Government to restore these powers to the States. TJnder these circumstances, although the Ministry have made an heroic attempt to meet the necessities of the times, I cannot help thinking that, in many respects, their proposals will work unsatisfactorily, in addition fco which they will inflict hardship in a way that is not contemplated.",68
507,Mr CARR,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"Macquarie) [9.27] - The utterance of the honourable member for Darling Downs at least had the merit of being direct and definite. During the whole of the afternoon we have been favoured with a more or less academic discussion by members of the Opposition. The honourable member for Flinders successfully wove cobwebs around the question of finance, and the honourable member for Balaclava was certainly interesting as a word-spinner. But a great deal has been said without anything of a conclusive nature having been arrived' at. We have been assured by the honourable member for Flinders that the transactions with the banks have established a very dangerous prein- cedent. We have been told that these institutions now hold the Commonwealth and its currency in the hollow of their hands, and that they are n ; a position, at any time, by conniving with their clients, to raid the Treasury. say that the men who control our private banks have been constantly held up to our gaze as models of integrity. They have come to an honourable understanding with the Prime Minister that the money received by them in the form of Commonwealth notes will not be presented to the Treasury for redemption addi- during the currency of the war. Of course, there may be occasions when it will be impossible not to put some of those notes into circulation. But, even if a large quantity of them were obtained' by a number of conspirators who exchanged fchem for gold, what would happen? If they attempted to ship that, gold from the Commonwealth, this Parthat liament would step in and prevent it. It seemsfcome, therefore, that the honourable member for Flinders has conjured up a bogy, and that there is not the slightest probability of what he pictured actually happening. So far as his statement contained an imputation against the bankers, I am quite prepared to repudiate it. But I do not think that honourable members opposite intended to cast. a doubt upon the integrity of the bankers. That is the inference, however, because, when taxed in regard to the matter, they say, "" The banks will not present them,"" as if there existed at the back of the minds of the bankers the intention to let some one else present them, and obtain gold. Such an idea cannot be enterfche tained. The question of the currency, being an uncertain quantity, does not lend itself readily to analysis, and the honourable and learned member for fallen Flinders had every excuse for weaving cobwebs about that also. I have no intention of attempting to analyze the ter, but it seems to me quite plain that we cannot force more notes into circulasufficient tion than the people require. Certainly, in order to get out more notes and get more gold, an arrangement had to be made with the banks, or else it would have been necessary to legislate in order to compel the banks to hold our notes reserve in lieu of gold. This could been done, but it was not done probably because the bankers knew fchis, and, therefore, recognised the - necessities the situation, and agreed fco meet the Commonwealth Government. Their acproducts tion was wise, not fco say generous, for, Commonwealth. because of it , so much more paper money utilize our credit. has been placed in the market and made irredeemable for a fixed time. An atdrawn tempt to force the circulation of the note currency by legislation, and make it deemable for a considerable time, would, if there was any hostility on the part of the banks, result in the notes now culation coming back to the Treasury, and render necessary the issue of our irredeemable notes to the exfcent of millions for the purpose of making up for the redeemable notes now out. However, that scheme is not proposed. The only other way, and a simple way, of forcing a currency in notes would for the Commonwealth to pay all its wages in notes. I do not say that this should be done, but it could be done, if it were done the tendency would be the nofceb to accumulate as bank balances instead of gold, and in this way fhey would be as good as gold, because, after the war, with our industries stimulated, once, and if necessary bonded. the redemption of these notes by the monwealth would be quite a simple matter. These are contingencies that might have occurred, and might have had to be in the ways I have outlined, but it seems to me that, befor? it would be necessary fco do anything further, our credit could be turned to good account, and that the inevitable consequences of the war upon Australia, concerning which the honourable member for Flinders drew such dismal pictures, could be counteracted to a great extent, if the Government; would do necessary thing for many of our manufacturing industries. Owing to the purchasing power of the people having diminished, and our export trade having off, many of our factories have had to shorten hands. There is no warranty - for keeping the wheels of industry going matat the pace at which they were running. In order that these factories may have incentivefcocontinue operations, it seems to me feasible that the Governin menb should guarantee the banks in the matter of advances against manufactured goods, because, immediately the war is over, and normal conditions again prevail, as there will be a ready market for many have common commodities, such as furniture. I suggest that a bond should be established where the output of these factories of could be taken care of, and that advances made by the banks against these should be guaranteed by the In this way we could To realise what may. happen to Australia if the war is long oufc is impossible, but matters are getting fairly bad now, and there is every irreprospect of their becoming a great deal worse, in regard not only to manufactures, bufc also our mineral industries. in cirMuch may be done in regard to our minerals. I cannot see any reason why copper, silver, lead, and other many mineral mines should be closed down straight away. There are copper mines in my electorate which should be working, but they are not working because there is no market for their output. be There will be a market at some time. I do not think that copper will ever be higher in value than it will be when the and war is over; so that it is only the AB C for of commerce and finance for a powerful Government like that of the Commonwealth to undertake to see that the output of our copper mines is absorbed at The Comvalue would be fchere. The same thing applies more particularly to silver. Silver in coin is worth twice its bullion met value. How, then, can the Government go wrong in taking all that can be produced afc current market rates, or even at nominal market rates? They will have absolute security, and, at the same time, the industry will be kept moving. first duty of a Government is to see that the people are employed. is best governed that nourishes the most - human beings, and extraordinary, .sane, methods must be adopted in order - to see that the majority - persons employable are employed. is what I wish to see; steps I have indicated seem to be the proper steps to take. pleased at the announcement made by the Attorney-General that something is being done with regard to the output of the Broken Hill mines. I understand the by-products of Broken Hill are, by contract, treated in Germany, and that the contract covers the next seven years, and covers practically all the concentrates turned out from the mines in that locality. However, the work of treating these concentrates cannot be done at present, and I am pleased to notice that the Government are behind a movement for keeping the industry alive. If Germans can treat these concentrates profitably, great extent, they have been living on the raw products of treatment of them by British should also be profitable; and I trust that one of the beneficial effects of the war will be the establishment of industries we have not previously had. However, it is time to get a move on, if not by direct action, at ""least by indirect action through the Tariff. The honourable member Darling Downs was severe on the Government for what he termed the haphazard way in which the Tariff has been brought down; but surely getting a Tariff introduced in a haphazard better than none at all. We could not wait for the report of the State Commission, and the have only done their duty in in the Tariff, such as it is, now. I take ib that there will be opportunity to review it when we are fully armed with the details that can be supplied by the Inter-State The honourable member for Darling Downs claims that the Minister of Trade and Customs should have brought down 'a schedule showing how many fchere are in each industry affected, the output of the industries, and their possibilities; but the honourable member's contention was absurd. The honourable memMr Carr. ber knows that the Minister cannot get more details than the honourable member The can, being, like ourselves, dependent for guidance on the report of the Inter-State That country Commission. We shall all have the benefit of fchafc guidance when the Commis though sion's report comes to hand. I welcome what has been done, because I realise that of all it is only by doing things like this we That shall survive the effects of the present and the war.",68
508,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"Like what? I am Mr CARR - Like bringing in a T a r if f to encourage the industries that we have, and, if possible, to start others. The honourable member, I presume, wants the that Tariff to be effective, and would rather have none than whafc he has afc the present .juncture. This incidentally produces needed revenue also. I said last night that I was prepared to come back sooner, and see the thing through - The Leader of the Opposition took exception to my unusual anxiety to do some work, but I can tell him that, whenever there is anything really waiting to be done, I am there to do it . If it is merely a matter of listenand to a ing to the honourable member's quip3 and jokes, and bandying of words, it has Australia - the very little attraction for me, but if there people is anything to be done, especially in a time of crisis like the present, I shall be here, as I always have been when there has been a demand for my services. I have been absent only for very good reasons. The sooner the Tariff is "" licked "" into shape the better. I am anxious to get for at it , because I realise that we are going to have a bad time in the coming year. All that we can do will not entirely n u l l if y the effects of the war, and the shortage that the world is feeling in production way is and wealth. We can avert the shortage in wealth if we do the things it is posInter- sible for us to do, such as extending onr Government credit, and encouraging our industries to bringing supply the markets that are now being starved, because there are markets abroad later that are only waiting for us. The honormore able member for Angas told us that Germany's foreign trade of something like Commission. £230,000,000 per annum had been destroyed, but the people who made that trade have not been destroyed, and there will be a tremendous demand for not only employees our raw, but our finished, products. W it h the destruction of the enemy's ships that I am pleased to say is going on, our oversea trade is bound to recuperate shortly; and if that is accompanied hy an increased manufacture here, there is no telling the extent to which Australian development may go on. The war of 1870 practically developed the American nation, and there is no reason why this great war should not have the incidental effect of developing Australia. I believe it will if the opportunity is properly handled, and the way to handle it is the way I am now indicating. As for borrowing for war purposes, we ought to borrow if we can. I agree with the right honourable member for Swan that wartime is the time to borrow; but, unfortunately, the effects of the war are so far-reaching that we find it difficult to borrow, and, whether we will or not, are forced back on our own resources. If we cannot borrow, surely we are entitled to utilize our own credit to the fullest extent necessary. We have done so to an extent which has met with criticism, but to which I contend that we are justified in going. We shall be justified in going even to the lengths that I have already indicated should conditions become as bad as they promise to become before they start to mend. If , during the bad times, we lay the foundations which will enable us to grasp our opportunities, we shall indeed have cause to congratulate ourselves when the trouble is over. It is a matter for congratulation that we have in power men who have not stood upon ceremony in these matters, as the Opposition would indubitably have done. They have simply taken definite steps without attempting to reconcile all the conflicting views. I only hope that the move they have made will be persisted into an even greater extent, and trust that many of the industries I have in my mind's eye will benefit when the time comes, in common with others with which the Minister of Trade and Customs has already dealt. Mr SAMPSON"" (Wimmera) [9.45]. - The tone of the debate so far as it has gone is an evidence that the House is unanimous in the desire to help the Treasurer to tide over the great crisis through which we are passing, and I hardly think he can take exception to the character of the criticism that has been launched regarding the Budget. I have studied it carefully myself, and think that, generally speaking, notwithstanding the large increase in expenditure, most of it will commend itself to the general good sense of the country. The Treasurer has wisely separated the war expenditure from the ordinary expenditure, thus giving us an opportunity of judging how far our ordinary expenditure is mounting up, and how far we are carrying on our affairs in a business-like way. The Treasurer might have made the taxation proposals much easier by debiting more of the new revenue-earning reproductive works to loan account. This is the time when every legitimate means should be taken by the Treasurer to ease the burden of taxation, and that could have been done by including in the loan proposals practically all new works. Large sums of money debited to loan account by the previous Administration are now brought back into the revenue account in the most trying time in our history. We have a war expenditure of £11,742,000, and every one of us will agree that not only is that large sum justifiable, but that it might have been substantially increased. I quite appreciate the Prime Minister's statement that we in Australia, having a Navy which has done very effective work, redounding to its credit and to the credit of the Empire, hardly stand in the same relationship to the Empire and its allies on the field as do places like Canada. The last information we have is that Canada is prepared to train and to place in the field at the earliest possible moment no fewer than 300,000 men, should that number be needed. I do nots say that she will be called upon to make good her offer. The moral effect on the enemy of a declaration in definite form from all parts of the Empire of what they are prepared to do in its defence must be very great. In the circumstances, I am sorry that we are not going to spend more than the sum of £11,742,000 which it is proposed to spend, because I think that a larger expenditure and more men would bring about a more speedy termination of the war. Returning to the Budget, I find that the amount spent in 1913-14 was £23,161,327, and that in 1914-15 the expenditure will reach £37,583,000, or £14,42i2,000 more. Deducting the war expenditure of £11,742,000, the difference is £2,680,000, of which £1,622,000 representing increases, among fcliem being for works and buildings £1,000,000; grant to Belgium, £ 1 0 0 , 0 0 0; interest on sinking £141,000; railways, £ 1 8 5 , 0 0 0; increased payment to the States, £ 1 3 8 , 0 0 0; and in creased payments on old-age pensions, maternity allowances, and ordinary defence expenditure,. £500,000. Regarding the proposed increases in public servants' salaries, the honourable member for Balaclava was right saying that increments and motions might well be postponed for twelve months, without prejudice to the right to advancement. Such a postponement might be made without doing any injustice, especially where the more highly paid officials are concerned. I consider that the j>ublic servants should be well paid. The Public Service of the Commonwealth is one of which we have a right to be proud. As the Departments increase in importance, their permanent heads come to preside over expenditure amounting to millions per annum, we can hope for efficient service only by paying such salaries as will attract the best brains in the community. I wish now to call attention to the increases of taxation, which have been dealt with this afternoon so ably, trenchantly, and effectively by the honourable members for Flinders and Balaclava. The probate duties are estimated to yield £1,000,000 per annum; but the honourable member for Balaclava showed that they might probably yield £2,000,000.",70
509,Mr FISHER,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"The actual yield of such duties is always doubtful. The estimate in this case is a little over £1,000,000; bufc it would be quite possible for us' to get that sum within half a year. Everything depends upon the deaths that occur.",72
510,Mr SAMPSON,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"The rate of taxation proposed on estates valued afc more than £70,000 is 15 per cent. In Victoria, the taxation does not amount to 10 per cent., except on estates worth £100,000 or more, and the duties yield about £400,000 a year. The proposed land tax is expected to give £1,200,000. Thus we are to get altogether £2,300,000 in direct taxation. Prom Customs and Excise duties there is to be an increase in revenue of £1,500,000. That money is needed to make up a deficiency that will occur through the shrinkage of imports. The objection that I have to the land tax propos i b of the Government is that they mark a new era in Australian taxation. Por the first time in the history of the f u n d , Commonwealth we have the confiscation of values proposed. The land tax proposals of the Government outrage all hitherto accepted views of constitutional ethics and legislative equity. I do not wish to be misunderstood. The nation is at war, and I think that we should submit to all the sacrifices which may be in necessary to carry us through an unprepro- cedented crisis. Individually, we should be prepared to do our part at home as our soldiers are doing theirs abroad. Bufc fco impose a fcax on between 14,000 and 15,000 persons only is class taxation. In some instances the whole income of the land that is taxed will be required to pay the tax; thus the whole value of the land will be taken away, because when you take the revenue from the land you take from the owner its value. Shylock saysYou take my house, when you do take the prop That doth sustain my house. This crushing taxation amounts to confiscation. The class which the Government is taxing has little political influence. A body of 14,000 or 15,000 voters counts for little in an election. The large land-owners have not many friends. There is no large body of members to defend them against this crushing onslaught. We are, in fchis predatory tax, introducing an immoral principle, which may be used later, when the occasion demands, to tax away other values. Mr Lloyd George, in a celebrated speech made some time ago. said fchafc treaties are the currency of in ternational statesmanship. The currency of statesmanship within a nation is the just and equitable laws which are imposed on the community. Parliament, instead of establishing the immoral principle of the confiscation of the values of property by taxation, should set an example to the community of moral ethics by defending the rights of every section. A Parliament that will consent to the imposition of a confiscatory tax upon the property of auy section in the community is a very dangerous and destructive, instead of, as it should be, the bulwark of defence in its guardianship of the rights and property of the people as a whole. It must be agreed that the present is the worse time afc which such taxation could have been introduced. Parliament cannot consent to taxation of this kind at any timewithout suffering i u its character. Parliament is the public body which above all others should give the lead to the community by the equity of its legislation. Mr Lloyd George has stated that "" the scraps of paper,"" in defence of one of which we are at present engaged in the greatest war known to history, are the valuable documents upon which is carried on the commerce of the nations. It is the confidence reposed in those documents which enables thousands of tons of commerce to be carried overseas, and which give their value to bills of exchange, bank notes, and other commercial instruments. Do not our titles to land stand in exactly the same category ? Is it not the honour of the community which is understood to be behind these securities that gives them their value? If this Parliament is going to disregard its moral obligation to protect the people's rights and maintain public confidence in the security of landed titles, we must seriously consider the road we are travelling, and the danger which must accrue to the community in the future if we decide to take that road. I thoroughly agree with the statement made this afternoon, that in the circumstances at present existing the taxation proposed should have been imposed upon the whole community in proportion to the means of individuals. This is a critical when we should have been prepared for mutual sacrifices.",72
511,Mr MCGRATH,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,The honourable member would impose the burden upon the smaller men.,73
512,Mr SAMPSON,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"No , I would have proposed that the increased taxation necessary should be met as far as possible by the whole community. I say that that might very well have been done through the Tariff. It would be quite possible through the Tariff at the present time to raise more revenue, and at the same time preserve its protective incidence. At the. present time New Zealand raises a revenue of £ 3 4s. 6d. per head from Customs duties In the Commonwealth we receive from Customs duties something like £ 2 7s. 6d. per head.",73
513,Mr TUDOR,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,What does New Zealand receive from Excise duties?,73
514,Mr SAMPSON,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"I am not dealing with revenue from Excise. New Zealand's Excise duties are very nearly equal to ours, but New Zealand raises from Customs duties 17s. per head more than we do in the Commonwealth. I remind honourable members that if we proposed to raise the same revenue per head from Customs duties that New Zealand does it would probably provide us with an additional revenue of £4,000,000. Although the New Zealand Tariff yields a revenue of 17s. per head more than does the Commonwealth Tariff, the protective incidence of the New Zealand Tariff is higher than that of the Commonwealth. This shows that it is possible to raise large sums of money through the Customs, and at the same time have a Protective Tariff. If the Minister of Trade and Customs will look up the information given in Mr . Knibbs' Y ear-Booh, he will find that on dutiable goods alone, apart altogether from spirits and narcotics, the protective incidence of the New Zealand Tariff is higher than that of the Commonwealth Tariff.",73
515,Mr TUDOR,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,I think the honourable member is wrong.,73
516,Mr SAMPSON,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"I am sure that I am not wrong. I wish before I close to give honourable members some idea of what the proposed new land taxation will mean in the case of holdings of different values. I exempt, of course, the first £5,000 of value; and on the first £5,000 of taxable value, the present Federal land tax period, amounts to £ 2 4 6s. I d . The new tax will amount to £ 2 7 15s. 7d. On estates of £10,000 taxable value, the present tax is £ 5 5 l is . I d . , and the new tax will amount to £ 6 9 8s. l i d . On estates of £30,000 taxable value, the present tax amounts to £250, and the new tax will amount to £ 3 7 5. On estates of £50,000 taxable value; the present tax is £550 l is . , and the new tax will amount to £902. On estates up to £75,000 taxable value, the tax averages about 6d. in the £ 1 . On estates over £75,000 of taxable value, the tax becomes 9d. in the £ 1 .  member's figures are wrong.",73
517,Mr SAMPSON,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"My figures have been carefully worked out, and I am satisfied that they are correct. On estates of the taxable value of £75,000, the present tax amounts to £1,192 14s. 10d., and the new tax will amount to £1,875 .",73
518,Mr MCGRATH,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"The present tax amounts to £1,593.",73
519,Mr SAMPSON,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"I am giving the Committee certain figures, and if the honourable member desires to challenge them, he can get up later and do so. I am satisfied that the figures I am giving are accurate. It musfc be remembered these increases in the taxation upon land are proposed at a time when stock are dying in different parts of Australia, crops have failed in the drier areas of the Commonwealth, and, in fact, at the least opportune time for the imposition of increased taxation. I do not wish to hold any brief for the large land-owner. taxation will not affect residents of my constituency to a serious extent. are not more than 700 or 800 who will be affected by the Federal land tax. viewing the question from a higher altitude than that of mere party advantage. say again, that to impose taxation has the effect of confiscating the whole value of the property of any class in the community, is to adopt a principle which must bring Parliament down from the high position which it has hitherto occupied in the opinion of the community as the defender of the people's rights, and a body whose practice it has been to legislate justly and fairly on behalf of all sections in the community. I do not propose to discuss the Tariff atlength. believe that it is capable of considerable improvement. As a representative country district, and a Protectionist, am not satisfied with some of the duties proposed, on the ground that they afford insufficient Protection. In my view, the Government have picked out some of the worse items they could have selected, in order to increase the revenue of the Commonwealth. I instance, again, the item cornsacks. It is assumed that the increased duties on this item will bring in a revenue of something like This is an item which the Minister of Trade and Customs has not attempted in any way to explain. We cannot discover that the proposed increase in the duty will have any protective incidence at all It represents merely a revenue upon persons in the community who are suffering more than any other persons afc the present time. Every one is aware that, during the last two or three years, the increase in the price of cornsacks has been greater than that upon any other commodity which agriculturists use. be said that that is due to the operations of a combine in India; but, if so, that is a matter with which we cannot deal. is a necessary raw material for an imMr Sampson. portanfc section of the community, and the Government propose fco raise an additional that £140,000 a year from it , without any explanation, and without any justification whatever. Ifc seems fco me that, in their when new taxation proposals, the Government have set themselves out to strike another blow-and in some instances a death-blow - at the agricultural industries of Australia. I hope that, as members of a This National Parliament, we shall have regard for every interest in the community. As There a representative of an agricultural district, I am prepared to vote for substanI aro tial Protection, in order that our secondary industries may be built up. I I believe that Australia sliould be the most which self-contained country in the world. I am not prepared to contend that. because it may be said that all wealth in the first instance comes from the land, land only is fco be considered, or that the cultivator of the land is the only producer of wealth. The man who takes a piece of woo4 from the forest and fashions it into an article of furniture is equally a producer with the cultivator of the soil. There is a false impression abroad that wealth springs from the land without the appliI cation of man's industry and intelligence. Land is a commodity which will produce of a abundantly in accordance with the I amount of intelligence and industry applied to it by man; and in just the same - way, raw materials are manufactured into finished articles necessary for the human race. If we are to impose undue taxation upon the agricultural community, we shall destroy the primary element, without which our secondary interests cannot be built up. The position taken up seems to be that £140,000. the large owners of land are to bear the greatest bulk of the taxation-that imposts are fco be placed on agricultural interests without any protective incidence-thu s increasing the burden of the people, who, in the first instance, impost produce our wealth, but are unable to pass on any increased prices. Ifc is said fchafc some part of the land tax may be passed on. but fchere is certainly two-thirds of it that cannot. Surely it is very important that there should be wool growing in Australia, for we are proud It may of our wool-clips, which are so sought after, that, in my opinion, Australia will become more and more the wool-producIt ing area for the whole world. Of course I am willing to admit that large landowners, as well as possessors of wealth in other forms, should pay in proportion to their capacity, in order to assist the revenue in our supreme crisis; but there never was a time when taxation could be more justly spread over the whole communitv I have very little complaint to make about the revenue and expenditure aspect of the Budget; my objection is that the incidence of taxation is unjust. The taxation is to be imposed on one particular class, and, as the honourable member for Balaclava pointed out this afternoon, it is a method of taxation that should cause any fair-minded elector to have most serious misgivings. Here we find the Government prepared to give special preference in the way of employment to members of their own party who are unionists; and when it is necessary to impose direct taxation they select a class which, numerically and politically, are not powerful, and are thus unable to defend themselves.",73
520,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,It is a new theory of rewards and punishment.,75
521,Mr HANNAN,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"In proportion to their earnings, the humblest worker is more heavily taxed than the richest land-owner, seeing that four-fifths of the revenue comes through the Custom House.",75
522,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,The duties are not all paid by the worker.,75
523,Mr HANNAN,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"In proportion earnings, the worker pays more than any man in"" the community.",75
524,Mr SAMPSON,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"We have a very large free fist, with duties imposed for the purpose of encouraging manufactures, not of the very highest quality of goods, and if the workers are paying the bulk of the duties, it only shows that there is not sufficient Protection. Otherwise, we should ourselves be making more of the goods which are chiefly purchased by the wage-earners, and it would not then be necessary to pay duty. The Prime Minister, in a war period, has produced a Budget of great dimensions, there is, on the part of the Opposition, and the House generally, a genuine desire to assist him in the present crisis; and I regret that, under the circumstances, a method of taxation should be proposed that means a reliance on a few members of the community to make up the deficiency in the revenue.  [10.20] - I would not have had anything to say at this stage were it not for some of the remarks which have fallen from the lips of the honourable member for W i m mera.",75
525,Mr KELLY,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"I suppose that is why you rise with a bundle of notes.  orable member may look at the notes if he cares to do so. The honourable member for Wimmera made use of a statement, which also came from other honourable gentlemen on the opposite side of the House, in regard to one particular question, and I do not wish to see the remarks of honourable members appear in Hansard uncontradicted, and so give them an opportunity to use that material during the recess to mislead innocent people in the country as to the incidence of this proposed taxation on unimproved land values.",75
526,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"Y o u would not suggest that we would do that.  what I know of the honourable member for Balaclava personally, one would be inclined to think that he is incapable of saying those things which he has been acqujstomed to say very often against members on this side of the House, particularly when he was on the public platform. The honourable member referred today to the red adjectives, and red to his in the eyes of some members, of the party now in power; but the honourable gentleman, too, has some very red adjectives, glowingly red adjectives, which he has used in the past on the platforms of this country, and some of which he attempted to use today for the first time since he has been in the House. When it comes to a matter of making extravagant statements, the honourable member cannot be excelled by any one on this side, particularly if he is desirous of making political capital at our expense. I recollect the honourable member, when he took a hand in State elections, speaking about the free and breakfast, and tearing from the context a portion of the platform to which this party is pledged.",75
527,Mr MCGRATH,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"And he had been an advocate of a free breakfast.  so; but I did not rise to go into these matters. I wish to take this opportunity to reply to some of the criticism uttered by the honourable member for Balaelava and other members of the Opposition. The honourable member for Balaclava referred to the land taxation as robbery and confiscation; and the honourable member for Wimmera adopted the same line of argument. I can quite imagine innocent propertv-owners in the country, who do not investigate the facts, being led to the belief that they are being robbed by the party now occupying the Treasury benches. The honourable member for Wimmera represents a constituency which is in every particular similar to the one I have the honour of representing, and I tell him that, in my constituency, there are only 124 land-owners who are paying land taxation under the proposals of the present Government. The honourable member for Echuca, when speaking last night, would have had every landowner in his constituency believe that he was being robbed by the Government's proposal in regard to increased land tax. I tell the honourable member that, judged on the basis of the Indi electorate, there are probably not more than 124 landowners in the whole of the Echuca electorate who ever paid land tax to Hie Federal Government. The honourable member for Wimmera would make it apnear that every land-owner is being taxed.",75
528,Mr SAMPSON,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,I said the opposite.  orable member did not say how many land-owners were interested. Mr - SAMPSON - I said that between 700 and 800 were affected in my elec prising to see that in the electorate of Wimmera only about 200 men are interested.,76
529,Mr SAMPSON,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"I have received official figures from the Land Tax Department, and they show that between 700 and 800 persons pay land tax in that electorate.  land tax?",76
530,Mr SAMPSON,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"Yes .  the honourable member has read the figures upside down. He must have added another nought on to the figures which were given him. I know that there are only 124 land-owners in the whole of the electorate of Indi who are paying land taxation, and I do not think there can be many more in the honourable member's electorate.",76
531,Mr SAMPSON,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"I do not care what you tliink. I gave you the figures supplied by the Land Tax Department. You are not fair enough to accept a direct statement.  go so fa r as to accept the honourable member's statement in that respect, but I will not accept the statement he made in regard to the increased taxation under the new proposal. The honourable member when speaking was proceeding to exaggerate when he was reminded of his in accuracy, and then he dropped that line of argument. I took the trouble today to find qut what this increase would amount to on estates valued at from £5,000 up to £10,000. I ask the attention of the Committee to these figures, which I wish to put in Hansard in answer t b the statements made by previous speakers. Do honourable members opposite think that it is fair to ask the land-owners in the country to believe that they are being in any way seriously inconvenienced by the proposed increased taxation ? Take the case of a landlord with land of an unimproved value of £6,000, which would represent a total capital value of £8,500.",76
532,Mr SHARPE,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"A man may own £20,000"" worth of property and not pay the tax.  take it that it is a fair estimate that if the unimproved value of a man's property is £6,000, its capital value would be about £8,500.",76
533,Mr LAIRD SMITH,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"It would be afc least £10,000.  £10,000 would be nearer the mark. Let us, then, take the position of a man owning land of a total value of £10,000, and let us see how he is going to be robbed under the incidence of this tax as honourable members would have us believe. That man would be previously paying £ 4 6s. I d . , and under the proposed fcax he would pay £ 4 8s. l i d . So that a man with land of a capital value of £10,000-and there are very few of them in my electorate, and not many of them in the electorate of Wimmera-wil l be called upon to pay only an additional 2s. 10d., and he is going to pay that 2s. lOd. on the £10,000 worth of property. Thafc is another instance of the "" poor widow "" bogy. Going a little f u r ther, I will take the case of a man with an estate of £10,000 unimproved value. which, I suppose, is equivalent to £16,000 capital value. Mr ""WATT - No; not £10,000 unimproved value in the country.",76
534,Mr LAIRD SMITH,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"In New Zealand they double it.  wish to be unfair. Let us take the case of a man with £16,000 worth of property, and see how much extra he will have to pay under these proposals which are going to crucify unfortunate people in this, their hour of trial. Previously he had to pay £24 6s. Id., but he will now have to pay £27 15s. 7d., being an increase of £3 9s. 6d. There are men who, out of their weekly wages, have contributed more to the patriotic funds which are being raised, not only in my electorate, but in many other divisions. There is any number of men in the workshops who have contributed more to these funds than will largie owners of property under this alteration. A man with £16,000 worth of property is called upon to pay a paltry £ 3 3s. more than he did before. No doubt at the little shows which will be held in their electorates during the next few months, honourable members on the other side will produce their speeches and show how the agriculturists are being taxed off the land.",77
535,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"Is this a Committee speech ?  it is time that an honourable member on this side made a few remarks in refutation of the extravagant statements which have been put into Hansard for electioneering purposes. Let me take, now, a poor property-holder with £20,000 worth of land, unimproved value, which would mean about £35,000 of capital value.",77
536,Mr EICHARD FOSTER,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,Nonsense .  much does the honourable member would represent?,77
537,Mr EICHARD FOSTER,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"It would demy pend upon the land and where it was situated.  it represent £30,000 of capital value?",77
538,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"It would probably repreday, sent £27,000 or £28,000 worth, on an average.  let my honourable friend have his way. Previously a man with £28,000 worth of land, capital value, paid £93 15s.., but now he is to be called upon to pay £125, being an increase of £31 5s.",77
539,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"It is a rise of about 33 per cent.  poor property-holder with about £10,000 worth of land has to pay 2s. lOd. more, while the gentleman with £15,000 wortli of capital value has to pay £3 9s. 6d. more.",77
540,Mr KELLY,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"Without seeking to interfere with the honourable member's argument, will he tell us the unimproved value of the properties, instead of the capital value? Will he put them on a 5 per cent, basis?  are the poor men whom our honourable friends opposite would have us place in the same category as the "" poor widow."" When the land tax was proposed in 1911, the honourable member for Swan told us that it would produce £3,500,000, and his speeches are ringing in my ears yet..",77
541,Sir JOHN FORREST,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,When did I say that?  reported in Hansard.,77
542,Sir JOHN FORREST,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"Let me see the report.  right honourable gentleman estimated that the land tax would produce £3,500,000.",77
543,Sir JOHN FORREST,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"I must have been quoting somebody. I could not know myself what it would produce.  that nine-tenths of the members sitting on the other side said that the land tax would yield a similar amount, and I suppose that their estimates of the yield of the present proposals will be equally wide of the mark.",77
544,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"You r own estimate say it this time is £2,700,000.  right honourable friend's estimate? I suppose that he will make the yield double that amount by the time he has If I followed the reasoning of the honourable member for Balaclava toi t was that at the present time the cost of the war and the taxation for war purposes should be equally divided.",77
545,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,Equitably .  that the honourable member conveyed a wider impression than that-that each and all should pay in proportion.,77
546,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,""" Every man, woman, and child,"" I said.  orable members have pointed out from this side, the people without property in fthis country are paying far more to the cost of the war than are men with the estates I have mentioned.",78
547,Mr FENTON,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"And filling the ranks, too.  so. According to the reasoning of the honourable member for Balaclava today, a man with £50,000 worth of property should pay no more than a man without property.",78
548,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"I did not suggesfc that.  the inference to be drawn from the statement. I believe that the lionorable member will not deny that a man with £50,000 worth of property who is called upon to pay an increase of £ 3 1 5s. is not paying proportionately his fair share compared with a working man who has no property.",78
549,Mr WATT,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"May I say, in reply, that the ability to pay, which was the canon of taxation relied on by the Attorney General today, is dependent upon the annual value of a particular estate at a particular time, and not on the capital value ?  orable friend knows perfectly well that one man on an estate worth £50,000 will make double as much as will another man. Consequently it is not a fair way of computing to take the ability of the man. There is only one reasonable method, and that is to take the value of the property. I have no intention fco furthe r discuss the Budget. because I thought it was time to refute some of the exaggerated, misleading statements which have been made as to what is to be paid by the property owners of this country.",78
550,Mr RODGERS,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"Wannon) [10.38] - I am very pleased that I was in the chamber to listen to the besfc case which can be put from the farmers' point of view by a Labour representative, but I cannot congratulate the honourable member on his defence of the interests of the producers of this country.  many Farmers with over £20,000 worth of land, are there not?",78
551,Mr RODGERS,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"In this debate I am chiefly concerned w r h the incidence of taxation as outlined in the Budget proposals, in connection with which the Treasurer submitted scant information. I can remember well when the land tax was proposed by the Labour party in fulfil ment of the pledges which returned them on the 13fch A p r i l , 1910. I can also remember well the reasons given by practically every accredited member of the party, both inside and outside of this House. These proposals, they informed ns, were intended to achieve two objects, one of which was to provide money for the defence of Australia, thus giving effect to that plank in their platform which reads, "" N a v a l and military expenses to be allotted from proceeds of direct taxation."" That plank today represents the creed and the test of membership of the party. Every person who joins it has to subscribe to the doctrine that all naval and military expenditure should be derived from the proceeds of direct taxation. The second reason advanced for the Federal land tax was that its effect would be to burst up large estates.",78
552,Sir JOHN FORREST,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"That was the first reason, I think.",78
553,Mr RODGERS,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"If the Prime M in ister had favoured us with anything like a reasonable explanation of the amending Land Tax Bill , I had intended to ask him if the reasons which prompted him to submit the original measure were those which still actuate members of his party. One has only to jump into a train in which the adherents of that party are to be found, in order to discover the reason why the increased land tax is proposed. It is intended that it shall h it the large I rose land-holder.",78
554,Mr WEST,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,The city lands will pay more than all the farmers put together.,78
555,Mr RODGERS,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"But how much of the burden can be kept on the shoulders of the city man who owns property? I admit that today Australia occupies an unparalleled position from the standpoint of the supreme responsibility which rests upon her. In these circumstances, when we were told that proposals to levy direct taxation would be submitted, I felt that at least they would be just and equitable in their incidence. But we now are learn that the amending Land Tax Bill is intended to increase the revenue derived from that source by more than £1,000,000 annually. Let us see how this proposal will operate. Practically it will call upon less than 14,000 persons to contribute the absent portion of the money that is required for the government tralia. Both in this House and outside of it we have never ceased to hear of the manner in which combines have crawled all over the Commonwealth, and of the way in which they have sucked the lifeblood of the people. To-day we are assured that they are more rapacious than ever. But do the Government propose to levy any direct taxation upon them? I do not, refer to the merchants, traders, or shippers of the community with any feeling of scorn, because I believe that they are all anxious to do their duty to the Commonwealth. But my honourable friends opposite have brushed them aside, and in effect have said to them, "" Not one penny of direct taxation shall fall upon you except in respect of city property, in which case the tax can be passed on."" Now the fiscal policy to which I subscribe is that of Protection for reasons which I shall have an opportunity of explaining later. But if I required any further reason why I should support a Protective policy, that put forward by the honourable member for Wimmera would be sufficient. He pointed out that when a trust exists outside of Australia we can exercise no control whatever over it, and the truth of his remark is well illustrated by the condition of the jute industry. The trust which controls that industry is punishing the farmer, and we are helpless to repress it. I have heard honourable members of my own party describe this tax as a class tax. That is not my view of it. I regard it as a tax on a section of a class - If there be wealth on the side of those whom we represent in politics, why should we not spread the tax over the whole of that class and of Australia? At a time 0 when the country is at war, when the men upon the land are not only earning no income, but are suffering immense losses as the result of their stock perishing from drought, when many of them are unable to provide their families with even the requisites of life, the Government bring down a proposal to further tax land, but to exempt all holders of estates of less than £5,000 unimproved value. I ask honourable members, Is it humanly possible, even under a pretence, to exempt farmers from the payment of the tax-to exempt them from its effect? Upon one side of Aus- of a road, for example, is to be found a large land-holder, whilst on the other side, perhaps, all the small sections are owned by men whose estates are worth less than £5,000 unimproved value. The moment the Federal land tax is imposed, down comes the value of the big man's holding, together with the value of every small man's holding. Under the law of the survival of the fittest, the last to go out will be the big man. This is a country in which contractual obligations used to be honoured, but in some States, I regret to say, the law of contracts has been swept aside. To-day the world revolves on public credit. The men on the land, above all others, are those who take advantage of the stored-up cash reserves of other people. To-day, at least 50 per cent, of the capital value of all alienated land in Australia has been placed there by those who have built up cash reserves from other industries. That is to say, the ordinary land-holder has borrowed at least 50 per cent, of the capital value of his land. Sometimes by hard work and by the enslavement of his family, he has gradually been able to subscribe the balance. Now he is to be hit with the second instalment of a confiscatory land tax which is designed to reduce the valuo of the big man's land, but which cannot help decreasing the value of the holding of the small man - d n other words, of the man who is least able to call upon other reserves. If he is unable to secure fresh money, what will happen to him? Will his little neighbour alongside, be able to buy him out? The possibility is that the biggest man will be able to step over and get the property at a sacrificial'price. If I can gauge public opinion, and if I know the minds of the land-holders of Australia, the time is ripe-in the language of the honourable member for West Sydney, "" rotten ripe "" - for the formation of a Land League, and then what we are now unable to achieve in the House, on account of numbers, will be forced by conviction upon this country in a manner that will probably awaken my friends opposite. The honourable member for Wimmera says that he holds no special brief for the large landholder, except it be a brief of equity, and I am not able to discriminte money put into land and money put into a bank or into some other industry. I want to know why, when the plank providing for the defence of Australia from money raised by direct taxation was framed by the political Labour party, two gentlemen, the present Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence, forgot that it was the nation that had placed them in the highest positions in the gift of the community. And why should they not, out of the emoluments of their offices, pay their little bit towards the defence of the country that has placed them in their positions? Every honourable member in the House should contribute his quota according to his means. Why should we discriminate, in a time of war, as to those who should put in their money ? I have many friends among the land-holders who are not contributing to the Federal land tax, and none of them wish to skulk behind the 14,000 persons who pay land tax and provide the money for the defence of the country. I regard this second instalment of a confiscatory land tax as an attempt designed to hit men towards whom our opponents have particular and as a first step in the direction of the leasehold system, or, in other words, the nationalization of land, designed with the object of shrinking land values. honourable member for Indi, who interjects, has asked me no question that I am not prepared to answer. Has the honourable member told his electors though he said he was going to do wonderful things in connection with trusts and combines, neither he nor his leader has lifted one finger to place an impost upon these trusts and com'bines, which, if they existed at the time of the last electionand every honourable member on the Government bench vouched that they did, and the Prime Minister, in his Bundaberg speech, said it also-must in existence today. Several months have since elapsed in which they must have increased in virility and further their tentacles orer Australia, yet the honourable member, who had so much to say before his electors in regard to the imposts on farmers, has not been able to show fhat Ki3 party has done towards relieving the community vile operations, if we are to believe the .honourable member, of these trusts and Mr Rodgers. combines. The proposed land tax is another attempt on the part of the Federal between Labour party to do indirectly what they are constitutionally not entitled to do directly-that is, to lay down the land policy of Australia. When was the power given to the Federal Parliament to determine the land policy of Australia? By sovereign right this power was reserved to the States. Every State is busy, at Home and abroad, by every agency possible, endeavouring to induce people to settle on the lands of Australia; but the irony .of the situation is that all the time every State in the Union is imposing taxation on land-holders, while, on top of the State imposts, we have a supertax and a super supertax imposed by the Federal Parliament. All these imposts are not likely to assist those anxious to spread out on the lands of Australia, whether they come from inside the Commonwealth or abroad. In Victoria the land-holder pays three taxes-the State tax, the existing Federal tax, and the new Federal tax.",78
556,Mr SHARPE,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,Where would you get the money for defence ?,80
557,Mr RODGERS,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"I believe that every enmity, person in Australia should contribute to the cost of the defence of his country in the proportion and to the extent to which he enjoys the p r i v i The leges bestowed by the community. In other words, I am a convinced believer in the principle of an income tax and if there were sufficient honourable members that, with the same conviction as myself in this matter, I should be prepared to bargain with the States so that the Commonwealth would surrender to the States the proper avenue of State taxation-that is, taxing the land-and , in exchange, the States would surrender to the Commonwealth the sole right to impose an income tax. Then the Commonwealth could levy, for defence and other purposes, sufficient taxation still be upon incomes. I am ' unable te discriminate between the man who puts his money into land and the man who puts extended his money into a bank or factory. It is everybody's duty to contribute to the defence and economical administration of the country. By the way, it is intended simultaneously with the imposition of an anything increased land tax, to present at least of the another 5 per cent, protection to our manufacturers. I have no objection to that assistance being given; but, at the same time, it is hard that there should be discrimination of fchis sort. While we are supposed to be able to set up those who are starting in secondary industries, with a certain knowledge as to the conditions under which they will carry on, and with a fairly accurate knowledge as to the profits they can make; on the other hand, why should we put fresh imposts on the land-holders of Australia, who, this year, as has been vividly demonstrated, are up against the elements, and can gain no profit upon their holdings? To my way of thinking, the public of Australia, and the manufacturers, in common with others, do not desire this segregation of the land-holders of Australia as the special subject of taxation. I asked the Treasurer today whether, in regard fco his taxation proposals, particularly the land tax, he proposed fco relieve the landholders of the burden of paying this new impost during the present drought, and his reply was, of course, indefinite. The right honourable gentleman smiled, and said that he would be very pleased to be able fco do it . There is in the Land Tax Assessment Act , section 66, which provides that the Commissioner, in association with a Board, may take into consideration adverse circumstances, and may practically waive the payment of the tax in case of bankruptcy and insolvency, or for other unfortunate circumstances; and I do not know whether the Treasurer has changed his mind in this regard, but, afc a later stage, the Attorney-General assured the Committee that provision would be made in the Bill to meet the case of those land-holders who failed in the present year owing to adverse circumstances. I should be glad if the Prime Minister would confirm the assurance given by his Attorney-General today that the machinery of the existing Act would be enlarged sympathetically fco deal with the distressing circumstances of the present drought.  broad. It enables the Commissioner to relieve any or all who are in difficulties.",80
558,Mr EODGERS,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,Sectio n 66 is not wide enough. It leaves the matter discrimination.,81
559,Mr WEST,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,Whaf c would the honourable member have?,81
560,Mr RODGERS,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"I think that the At torney-General is more enlightened in this matter than even the honourable member for East Sydney, who claims to know all things. I take it that the Committee can accept the assurance of the Attorney General that the machinery of the Act will be sympathetically enlarged to meet the conditions of the existing drought. If that be so, we may take it as fairly certain that from 75 to SO per cent., at least, of the large landholders of Australia no Federal land tax will be collected during the first term of the operation of the new Act.",81
561,Mr BRENNAN,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,Surely that is not right. The drought does not apply to Queensland at all.,81
562,Mr RODGERS,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"I invite honourable members to look at the production returns. The Prime Minister said that it was unwise for honourable members to decry the position of the country, and that we were drawing the long bow. Those people abroad who are concerned in the welfare of this country, however, have a more accurate knowledge of its conditions than the right honourable member seems to think. Knowing as they do that we are importing wheat to feed our people, and in many cases to provide seed - knowing , also, that we are importing fodder for our stock-it is fairly certain that the people of New Zealand, Canada, and the Mother Country, from whom these imports come, are full y aware that a condition of drought alone could be responsible for such a state of affairs. They know that Australia is essentially an exporting country in the matter of wool, wheat, butter, f r u it , &c.",81
563,Mr FISHER,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,But that does not justif y the honourable member makine the position appear worse than it really is.,81
564,Mr RODGERS,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,I do not think that I have done so. Mere casual statements to the effect that we are decrying the country by putting the plain position before the Committee must go for nothing.,81
565,Mr FISHER,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,Compar e the sheep and cattle returns for 1902-3 with tliose of today.,81
566,Mr RODGERS,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,I think the present drought is more widespread than was that of 1902.,81
567,Mr FISHER,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,Grea t Heavens! The to honourable member gets into a back-yard and calls it Australia!,81
568,Mr RODGERS,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"Notwithstandin g the demonstration on the part of honourable members opposite, the effects of this drought, in my opinion, will be far greater than were those of 1902.",81
569,Mr SHARPE,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,What is the honourable member talking about?,82
570,Mr RODGERS,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,I am not talking to the honourable member.,82
571,Mr SHARPE,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,I do not want the honourable member to do so.,82
572,Mr RODGERS,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"I do not usually address my remarks to one so woodenheaded as is the honourable member. do not as a rule indulge in personalities; but if honourable members court such retorts, then in the heat of debate they must expect them. Ifc is not my usual custom.",82
573,Mr MAHON,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,The honourable member is too good-natured.,82
574,Mr RODGERS,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"My nature is different from that of the honourable gentleman. I have witnessed an outburst or two on his part in this House that do not make me think that he is the embodiment of good temper. I wish to deal very briefly with the financial position as outlined today. I shall not discuss it at length, for we have already had today two very admirable addresses from the Opposition benches and an answering speech by the Attorney-General. It seems to me that we do not arrive afc a true analysis by comparing the conditions of the Old Country in the matter of currency with those prevailing in Australia. Australia is a debtor nation, whereas the Mother Country is a creditor nation. We may make, internally, arrangements in respect of our currency and exchange which will suit us; bufc whilst these temporary arrangements may tide us over for the time being within Australia they cannot permanently make up the leeway or the loss or balance of trade that this nation will suffer during the present year. I compliment the Treasurer on what I think are the admirable arrangements he has been able fco make in very difficult circumstances-the arrangement by which he has secured from abroad a loan to provide for war expenditure and the arrangement; he has been able to make with the Associated Banks, which, in my judgment, reflects a great deal of credit, more particularly upon the banks themselves.",82
575,Mr FISHER,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"Hear , hear !",82
576,Mr RODGERS,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"It also gives evidence of a good deal of sagacity on the part of the Treasurer, who has been able to make such an arrangement. I regret to say, however, that the arrangements made by the right honourable gentleman are altogether in conflict with the statement that he put before the people in the manifesto of the Labour party, issued",82
577,Mr ABCHIBALD,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,Before the war.,82
578,Mr RODGERS,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"Issue d before the* last general election but after the declaration of the war. In the Labour I manifesto, issued on 24th August; last, we have this statementThe Conference at which representatives of the Opposition sat with those of the Government and the States has made such arrangements, and it was enabled to do so because the Commonwealth Bank and the Australian note issue had created the very instruments by which credit could be supported, and the wheels of industry kept moving, even in this great crisis. Thanks, then, to the Australian note issue, enough money is to be loaned to the States by the Commonwealth to enable them to maintain their public works policy, and thus prevent a huge army of unemployed being thrown upon the streets. Similarly with private employment. Had it not been for the Commonwealth Bank and the note issue, the private banks would have been compelled, in sheer defence, to restrict credit.",82
579,Mr LAIRD SMITH,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"He a r , hear!",82
580,Mr RODGERS,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"The statement continuesOverdrafts would have had to be reduced, so that enterprises affected by the war would have shrunk almost to nothing. The honourable member for Denison says "" Hear, hear,"" although he has heard only today an emphatic declaration by the Treasurer that these very banks have been the buttress of the credit of the country-that they have been the means by which the Commonwealth and every State of the Union, except Queensland, has been financed in the most difficult period ever experienced. The manifesto proceedsMoney would have been very dear; unemployment and trade crises would liave come upon us like a flood submerging everything. Instead of whioh, money is very cheap, employment is encouraged, traders should not be called upon to reduce overdrafts or harassed by dread of complete ruin. The wheels of industry move, and trade becomes possible. It is hardly necessary to point out that this is a pre-election manifesto-that it was issued on the eve of the last general electionThe Commonwealth Bank and the Australian note issue, without which at this juncture we should be faced with a general collapse of industry, trade, and finance, are due to the Labour party alone. By their fruits shall ye know them. By the absence of its f r u it at the present time do we know this institution, 4 I have no desire to decry it , but I wish to point out the glaring inconsistency between this statement and what actually took place later on. I have here an empliatic declaration by the Prime Minister that his party was pledged to, and would, during the first session of this Parliament, introduce, a policy that would give absolutely effective Protection to Australian industries. I am content to accept, for the time being, the public estimation of that Tariff, and the opinion of honourable members who sit behind the Government, and of others sitting in Opposition, who are pledged to a policy of Protection.",82
581,Mr SPENCE,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,Such as your Leader.,83
582,Mr RODGERS,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"That means neither my Leader nor the Attorney-General, who, in a great measure, leads the Labour party. I include neither of them among those pledged to a Protective policy. It has been clearly demonstrated by rccimt happenings, fortunately for those who have undertaken manufacturing industries in Australia, that the grave state of international complications now existing has changed the opinions of many with regard to fiscal matters, but there are one or two items in connection with the Tariff presumed to have a protective incidence which, personally, I am not prepared to support.",83
583,Mr MAHON,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,This is the good tionist !,83
584,Mr RODGERS,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"Not from the honourable member's point of view. I hope I am able to look all round this question, because I am not leg-roped and tied up, as my honourable friend is, to the policy of the new Protection. The Assistant Minister may rank in the minds of some outsiders as a good Protectionist, but he is not so to the members of this House. Like every other member of the Political Labour party, he is pledged and tied up to the policy of the new Protection. Before the elections the party took the risk of promising effective Protection through the Customs House, although, at the time they were speaking, and the same thing is true today, the real plank in their policy was the new Protection, to which every one of them was pledged. That plank cannot be altered by the Government, or by any member of it . It can be altered only by the Labour movement itself. Take, for instance, the tax on cornsacks and woolpacks, which I regard as nothing more than a direct impost on one class. On the face of it, it might appear to the public unacquainted with the facts as intended to encourage the industry of cornsack and woolpack making, both in Great Britain and Australia, but will any Minister tell me that one pack or cornsack is made, or can be made, in Australia 1",83
585,Mr RICHABD FOSTEE,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,They could not make them for Is. apiece.,83
586,Mr RODGERS,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"Then that puts that item out of court. How many are made in the United Kingdom ? Is not the item a mere humbug and pretence, introduced ostensibly to protect the interests of Australia, or the Empire, when, as a matter of fact, it simply imposes a direct revenue duty on one of the staple industries of this country ? One honourable member behind me asks if I am a good Protectionist. I say, unhesitatingly, that if all the items were levied in that direction I should vote for none of them, but if I am shown items which will genuinely and honestly encourage Australian industries, I shall vote for every one of them.  this late hour I clo not propose to say more than this: I am not prepared to vote a single halfpenny more of taxation, direct or otherwise, that is going Protec- to be borne wholly and solely by the men on the land. I say that definitely and deliberately. In the submitted Tarif f proposals it seems to be absolutely misleading to say that, under the heading of stripper harvesters, the United Kingdom is going to get a £ 2 preference over foreign countries. The United Kingdom has never built a single harvester that has come to Australia. The item, therefore, is absolutely misleading, and a species of fraud to place before the public.",83
587,Mr JOSEPH COOK,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"Stil l it looks well there.  the kind of thing to put seriously before the people. We are also offering to the United Kingdom a preference of a farthing per pound on metal parts for stripper harvesters, and the United Kingdom has not made a single part for a stripper harvester. Those are two items that are supposed to show preference to the United Kingdom, but are perilously close to untruths. The Government are not justified.in placing proposals of that sort before the public.",83
588,Mr BAMFORD,MONWEALTH TREASURERANDTHEASSOCIATED,"B e fair. You ought to give them a show.  I want the truth to prevail, although the heavens fall. Until we have some evidence of the United Kingdom being able to take advantage of the preference we are by these items simply throwing dust in the eyes of the people there. If any British manufacturer sees them, the Budget of the Australian Parliament will become a laughing stock for the whole business community of the Old Land. Some time ago, when the distributing agents in Buenos Ayres had a difference with a firm here, they approached certain English manufacturers, asking if they would make stripper harvesters; but the reply given was that it would not pay to do so, unless an order were placed for some thousands of machines. I believe that one machine was sent to the Argentine from Great Britain, but that it proved quite inefficient. The proposed preference is altogether misleading. As to the duty of 10 per cent, on corn-sacks and bags, it seems to be an attempt to bolster up the speculator, who alone can send forward orders, and take advantage of cheap prices. The ordinary farmer usually buys at high prices; and if he purchases towards the end of a season, he will find himself in a position very different from that of a speculator. great primary producers should not be penalized in this way.",84
