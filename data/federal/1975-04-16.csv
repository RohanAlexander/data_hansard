The petition the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showethThat the plan to obliterate the traditional weights and measures of this country is causing and will cause widespread inconvenience, confusion, expense and distress. That there is no certainty that any significant benefits or indeed any benefits at all will follow the use of the new weights and measures. That the traditional weights and measures are eminently satisfactory. Your petitioners therefore pray: That the Metric Conversion Act be repealed, and that the Government take urgent steps to cause the tradiuonal and familiar units to be restored to those areas where the greatest inconvenience and distress are occurring, that is to say, meterology, in road distances, in sport, in allied trades, in the printing trade, and in retail trade. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Adermann, Mr Kevin Cairns, Mr Donald Cameron, Mr Coates, Mr Kelly, Mr Mathews, Mr Nicholls, Mr Oldmeadow, Mr Eric Robinson, Mr Staley, Mr Thorburn and Mr Wallis.

Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Family Law Bill 1974 be amended (1) To require a reasonable attempt at reconcUiation with the aid of counselling at least twelve months prior to the application for a divorce; (2) To specify three objective tests for irretrievable breakdown, namely (a) intolerable behaviour, (b) desertion for at least 2 years, PETITIONS (c) separation for at least 3 years; (3) to retain in principle the legal responsibility of a husband to maintain his wife and children as under normal circumstances within marriage.

Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Family Law Bill 1974 be amended: 1. To require a reasonable attempt at reconciliation with the aid of counselling at least twelve months prior to the application for a divorce. 2. To specify three objective tests for irretrievable breakdown, namely (a) intolerable behaviour; (b) desertion for at least two years; (c) separation for at least three years. 3.

Family Law Bill To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. We the undersigned Citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia by this our humble Petition respectfully showeth: Family Law Bill (a) That the present matrimonial laws are archaic, unrealistic and cruel and the cause of so much distress, bitterness and injustice as to make their continued operation intolerable to the vast majority of fair minded citizens of Australia and that the Farnily Law Bill at present before Parliament should be passed without delay. (b) That the ground of Irretrievable Breakdown of Marriage determined by a maximum of twelve months' separation, embodied in the Farnily Law Bill already passed in the Senate, be the sole ground for divorce. (c) That there is widespread dissatisfaction with the enormous discretionary powers given Judges in the present legislation and that the non fault maintenance concept (according to need) based on specific criteria, as enunciated in Clause 54 (2) of the Family Law Bill 1974 No. 2, should be tried and we humbly pray Members of the House will restore this concept fully by deleting Clause 75 (n) from ""as read a third time"". And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. by Mr Staley and Mr Thorburn. Petitions received. Hansard: Subscription Rate To the Honourable the Speaker, and of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfuUy benefit showeth: That the increased price of the place it beyond thefinancialreach of most people; That it is basic in a Parliamentary democracy that electors have easy access to records of the debates in their Parliaexporting ment; That making Hansard available only to an elite who afford it is at odds with the concept of open government. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Governergy ment will reduce the cost of the Hansard subscription it is still available at a moderate price to any interested citizen. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Drury. Petition received. To the honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in the Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia respectfully showeth: That the Family Law Bill 1974 would be an unjust law if passed since the innocent party could be divorred against his or her will after a year's separation. That the Bill does not only facUitate divorces but changes the nature of marriage and the husband-wife relationship. Legislation ought to reflect pubUc opinion, not attempt to condition it. Gallup polls indicate 75 per cent of Australians are opposed to the concepts of the Family Law Bill. Therefore Parliament has no mandate from the people to ask such a far-reaching change in the nature of our society. That chUdren need a stable emotional and psychological environment in which to grow up. This stabUity is upset by divorce. A high proportion of criminals come from broken homes. Consequently any law which makes divorce easier is harmful to society. Your peutioners therefore humbly pray that the Parliament so vote as to defeat the FamUy Law Bill. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Mathews. Petition received. To the honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfuUy showeth: a. That the use of Uranium as an alternative source of energy is currently unacceptable as it presents problems ing radioactive waste, mUitary impUcations and thermal pollution. b. That there can, at present, be no assurances that radioactive materials exported for peaceful purposes will not be the new Bill used in the producuon of nuclear weapons. c. That there is not, as yet, any known safe method of disposal of radioactive wastes, nor ever Ukely to be. d. That the export of Uranium from Australia is internationaUy irresponsible and is not, in the long term, of benefit to Australia. e. That the export of Uranium from Australia only discourages importing countries from investing into research on Members of the House viable alternatives. f. That only the overdeveloped industrial nauons will from Australian Uranium and the gap between these countries and the energy-starved Third World will increase Hansard subscription will yet further. Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Government will immediately cease the mining and of Uranium until perfectly safe disposal methods for the radioactive wastes have been guaranteed; will greatly can increase expenditure on research into safe clean and inexhaustible sources of energy; and will aid underdeveloped countries in their plea for a fair share of the world's enresources, while at the sametimehonouring its obliso that gations to the future of humanity. And your petitioners as in duty bound wiU ever pray, by Mr Ruddock. Petition received. Child Endowment Family Law Bill To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that: Child Endowment received by families has decUned relative to average earnings so that today it is about 20 per cent of its value in 1949. The Interim Report of the Australian Government's Commission Into Poverty recommended a substantial increase in Child Endowment as a way of alleviating poveny. This report pointed out that increased Child Endowment deserved priority and would be advantageous to the community in the long run. It specifically recommended increasing child endowment: from 50 cents to $ 1.50 for the first chUd; from $ 1.00 to $2.00 for the second child; from $2.00 to $4.00 for the third child; from $2.25 to $7.00 for the fourth chUd; and to $8.00 for subsequent chUdren. Your petitioners humbly request that the Government increase Child Endowment in the next Budget. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Snedden. Petition received. Uranium Family Law Bill To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives of Australia in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth respectfully showeth: 1. That we have examined the Family Law Bill and subincludstantiaUy suppon the provisions therein 2. That the FamUy Law Bill takes into account the changing roles of women in modern society 3. That the amendment to the bill recommended by the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee will ensure that the rights of women who play will be protected, as well as the interest of children Your peuuoners therefore humbly pray that the Family Law Bill be debated and passed as soon as possible. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray, by Mr Snedden. Petition received. NA INTER-STATE COMMISSION",18
5,Mr GRAHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Will the Prime Minister have confirm that he personally is the main architect of the Inter-State Commission Bill? Does he conclaimed cur with the view that it is the most historic and far-reaching legislation designed to affect the Australian Constitution introduced into the House of Representatives in 40 years? Does he agree that the Inter-State Commission see the Securities and Corporations Commission as well as action taken under the Trade Practices Act and many other Commonwealth Governnotice. ment functions?,20
6,Mr WHITLAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The honourable gentleman refers to the Inter-State Commission in such glowing terms that I can hardly resist his invitaberra tion to claim the authorship ofit. But of course was not my idea; it was the idea of the founding fathers. It is an idea which Australians devised the 1890s on a precedent which the United States of America created in the 1880s and which the United States has found very beneficial through all the succeeding decades under all succeeding administrations. I believe the Inter-State Commission would not have any authority to override any of the activities of the Securities and Corportary ations Commission. It has, as the Bill itself makes plain, certain prevailing responsibilities regards the Trade Practices Tribunal and the time Prices Justification Tribunal. The Constitution says: 'There shall be an Inter-State Comseem mission . . .'. There can be very little doubt that Australia would have been better adminisment tered if the Commission had not been allowed expire in 1920. It is one of the 4 basic instruments ordained by the Constitution. We should always have had it. We certainly should have it now. I give one instance which honourable stitution. gentlemen might remember from some years ago. Early in 1972 Sir Henry Bland made a report to the Victorian Government concerning the disadvantages that accrued to Victoria through the rail freights charged into and out of the Riverina on a very great number of products-primar y products and products the traditional role in society required to produce primary products. If there had been an Inter-State Commission in existence at that time, very clearly the disadvantage imposed on Victoria and on the Riverina could have been examined and could have been removed. I am certain that other instances would occur very readily to honourable gentlemen. NA NA",20
7,Mr ANTHONY,OF PARLIAMENT,"I direct my question to the Prime Minister. He will be aware that many members of this Parhament, including himself, hadfinancialagreements or contracts with the Commonwealth-contract s which could be to be in technical breach of the Constitution. Is he prepared to give the House a list of the names of members ofParliament, their partnerships or theirfirms,who have had any financial transactions in agreement with the Public will overService of the Commonwealth?",20
8,Mr WHITLAM,OF PARLIAMENT,"Any such information could be given only in answer to a question upon I know of no such Ust having been compiled. I have heard suggestions from time to time that those members- I have been among themwho have occupied government flats in Canmight be disqualified under the Constiit tution from holding their seats or being elected. I take it that the right honourable gentleman is in referring to a matter concerning one of his colleagues in the Senate. Evidence about this situation was given before one of the parliamentary committees, the Joint Committee on Pecuniary Interests of Members ofParliament. All I would like to say on this subject is that, the evidence having been given to a parliamencommittee and there having been a prominent article by the witness in one of Australia's as most respected newspapers-it may err from to time; nevertheless it errs fewer times than do most of our metropolitan dailies-it would reasonable to have the High Court of Australia exercise the authority which the Parlialong since gave it to determine the to quaUfications of members. I do not think it is very seemly or effective for members of either House to determine whether they have broken the law, whether they have transgressed the ConParUament has made provision for such matters to be determined by the High Court. It would seem to be a seemly way to have the High Court determine it. If we find that many of us have transgressed the Constitution and have placed our seats in jeopardy, then the cure is not to ignore the Constitution but to ask the people to amend the Constitution. If the case I mentioned, that of renting government property in Canberra while we engaged on our parliamentary duties, puts us in breach of the Constitution that would seem to an instance in which we ought to ask the people to correct a farcical situation. There are a very great number of parliaments in the world where specific provision is made for the accomwould modation of members when they are about their parliamentary duties in the capital. That seems to be a perfectly reasonable the Constitution precludes it, then the Constitution ought to be amended. Nevertheless, nobody hitherto I beheve has cavilled at the vision of the Constitution which makes a memeter ber incapable of being chosen or of sitting if has any direct or indirect pecuniary interest any agreement with the Public Service of the Commonwealth otherwise than as a member a and in common with the other members of an incorporated company consisting of 25 persons. I would have thought that most of us would have thought that was an eminently reasonable, just and prudent provision to have in our Constitution.",20
9,Mr ANTHONY,OF PARLIAMENT,I am referring to 44 (v).,21
10,Mr WHITLAM,OF PARLIAMENT,"Yes, so was 1.1 just read it.",21
11,Mr SPEAKER,OF PARLIAMENT,Order! I suggest that it be in the best interests of this go into a situation where we are debating a specific case which will come before the Senate today. The question did not elicit that type information. I do not think it would be in the best interests of the House to debate this matter.,21
12,Mr WHITLAM,OF PARLIAMENT,"I have nothing further to Aid add, Mr Speaker. NA",21
13,Mr FAIRBAIRN,GAS PIPELINE TO WAGGA,I ask the Minister for Minbe erals and Energy: When will tenders be called for the supply of pipes for the natural line to Wagga? What size is this pipeline to be? Will it be.completed at the same time as the main line from Gidgealpa to Sydney? Can the Minister assure me that the cost per therm for natural gas will be no more at Wagga than at Sydney?,21
14,Mr CONNOR,GAS PIPELINE TO WAGGA,"To reassure the honourable poses member I would say that he need have no vide qualms as to receiving natural gas in the fair of Wagga. The main matter that has concerned me has been the rather whimsical behaviour my State counterparts in New South Wales and Victoria. Some months ago I approached my Victorian counterpart and suggested to him in the national interest it might be appropriate if we were to consider a real interconnection of the proposed national natural gas grid, and for that a purpose that we might construct a 20-inch line are from Young down through Wagga and Albury to Melbourne. I got, frankly, quite a cool recepbe tion. A few weeks later it was announced, for reasons best known to the gentleman concerned, that the Victorian pipeline, which was to be of the order of ten or twelve inches in diameter, be extended across the border to Albury, thereby pre-empting what would have been a legitimate market for the supply of gas within provision to make. If this State. Consequently, the best I can give to the prohonourable member is a pipeline with a diamof six andfive-eighthinches. I have received he criticism from some of the honourable member's in colleagues in regard to the cost of natural gas. The requirement that natural gas shall be sold at uniform price throughout Australia has been in the legislation since it passed through both more than Houses of this Parliament. NA",21
15,Mr MATHEWS,AUSTRALIAN LEGAL AID OFFICES,I ask the Attorney-General a question. Is he aware of any developments which might stand in the way of the proper development of the Australian Legal Aid Offices? Can he say which sections of our commay munity would be disadvantaged by any such House if we do not developments?,21
16,Mr ENDERBY,AUSTRALIAN LEGAL AID OFFICES,"The honourable member is probably referring to newspaper reports about of the decision by the Law Institute of Victoria, announced I think this morning, to mount a challenge in the High Court to the Australian Legal Office scheme to provide legal aid. That is the only one that I am aware of in concrete form. It has to be said, not by way of any comment on the legal issues involved but on the attitudes to found, unfortunately in some members of the legal profession, that there is opposition to the gas spur Australian Legal Aid Office. During the recent 4-week recess of the Parliament I had occasion to go down to Victoria seven or eight times, I think, to speak to solicitors principally, and also to barristers, about the functions of the Australian Legal Aid Office and how it no threat to them and was designed to prolegal facilities for people who never went city near a private solicitor for very good reasons, often the fear of incurring expense and often beof cause of the mystique that unfortunately too often surrounds the profession. I refer to the poor, the inarticulate and the uneducated in our that community-the people who, amongst others, this Labor Government proudly claims to speak for and for whom it works. It is those people who increasingly in recent years have been identified as members of the community who, although desperately in need of legal services, are denied legal services. Studies have revealed this unfortunate fact Australian life, the most recent, I suppose, that conducted by Professor Sackville on law poverty in Australia. As honourable members would know, he made a strong, scathing comnnanciai ment on the existing legal aid systems and that they were seriously lacking, seriously ficient, in many of the services they were able offer. It is the intent of the Australian Legal Office to fill that gap, and it has been remarkably successful. Today some 21 Australian Legal Offices operate successfully around Australia providing a service that was never provided before. Unfortunately, some members of the legal profession- I emphasise the word 'some'usually those who have never conducted a free case in their lives and who have done very well out of the law, object to the office's activities. seems that that innuence has prevailed in Vicwho toria, and it is to be regretted. The vote on the matter was surprisingly close-somethin 1 031 to 899. I am told that when one sees that against the overall total it means that about 30 per cent of solicitors in Victoria voted in favour of mounting the challenge. The Government deals stands committed to the Australian Legal Aid Office. The discussions will continue with membe bers of the legal profession around Australia. It is a pity that the legal profession seems pared to allow some of its spokesmen to take it along the same road that the doctors profession. We now see that end with the successfull acceptance by the Australian people of the Medibank scheme. The Liberal-CP main contributing factor there was public opinion. Public opinion taught the doctors that deal. they had to accommodate themselves to what Australian's wanted in medical care. There is no doubt in my mind that public opinion, somecontest times cold but sometimes very effective, duce the same change of mind in those members of the legal profession who object to NA",21
17,Mr KILLEN,DEFENCE SERVICES EXPENDITURE,"I direct a question to the Minister for Defence. Is it correct that an instruction has been issued to the 3 services that expenditure on travel incurred, for example, by way of postings from one command to another, attendance at training schools and the like is to be reduced to an absolute minimum in the remainder of the nnanciai year? Is the reason given for that instruction that there is a shortage of money?",22
18,Mr BARNARD,DEFENCE SERVICES EXPENDITURE,"A decision has been made to reduce expenditure for travel facilities-no t for postings-to a minimum. The reason for this is that there has been an over-expenditure. The apin propriation for travel by Army was determined being for the nnanciai year 1974-75. Army had and reached that appropriation. Therefore I issued instructions that travel for the remainder of this year should be restricted to the essential said movement of Army personnel. In relation to definance, which arises from the question, I point to out that as far as the vote for defence purposes is Aid concerned, in the last nnanciai year of the previous Liberal-Country Party Government-that Aid is 1971-72-the expenditure was $1,217m. This year the defence vote will reach $ 1,800m. NA",22
19,Mr NICHOLLS,CONTEST OF ELECTIONS,I direct a question to the Minister for Services and Property. Under the Electoral Act is it permissible for political parties It to arrange pacts or deals concerning who shall or shall not contest certain elections? Is it also permissible for deals of this kind to place in jeopg like ardy the seat of a sitting member?,22
20,Mr DALY,CONTEST OF ELECTIONS,"As far as I am aware there is nothing in the Electoral Act to prevent the activity of in regard to who shall or who shall not contest seats, except that of course coercion cannot used. It is true that deals in being arranged can place in jeopardy the seats of honourable members concerned. I am reminded of an article prewhich appeared in the Melbourne 'Sun' of 16 April. Evidently it arises out of a deal. It states: took their Lib-CP votes deal 'a sham' course coming to an - MCMillan MP A Country Party MP said yesterday a Victorian deal threatened his seat. MR HEWSON said he was bitterly disappointed at the The CP Leader, Mr Anthony, and the Liberal Leader, Mr Fraser, agreed on Tuesday that the two parties would not seats against each other where the sitting member will prowas a shadow cabinet member. The Parties would be allowed to stand candidates against the ALAO. each other in all other seats. Mr Hewson said the agreement between the two parties was a sham. "" I am bitterly disappointed that the Liberal Pany intends to contest MCMillan against me- a sitting anti-labor member,"" he said. 'The Liberals say the CP can contest Bendigo and, therefore, the Liberals can contest MCMillan. 'The reality of the situation is that Bendigo is a non-event for the CP, so it's a pretty poor trade-off.' 'If it's good enough for the Liberals to contest MCMillan, then it should be good enough for the CP to contest Wannon Good ideaor Corangamite, or any other Victoria Liberal seat matter.' 'The decision, virtually hands MCMillan to platter, if there is a major election-time electoral which can easily happen. The CP leader, Mr Anthony, refused Hewson's statement. But CP officials said Mr Anthony was embarrassed outburst. I say to the honourable member for MCMillan that he must have been very unlucky not to have got amongst the 31 shadow ministers, but let me remind him that there is still hope because the shadow ministry is growing every day. Might also extend to him my sympathy because of imminent defeat, no doubt, because at the last election he was elected with 26 per cent of the primary vote. NA",22
21,Mr SINCLAIR,FEES PAID BY LEGAL AID OFFICES,"I ask a question of the Attorney-General. Bearing in mind the obliis gations of section 45 (iii) of the Constitution, when does he expect to be able to provide to colleague in the other place-wh o has 3 times quested the information from him-the details those members of the legal profession who either personally or through their partnership have received fees paid by the Australian Legal Offices?",23
22,Mr ENDERBY,FEES PAID BY LEGAL AID OFFICES,I do not know of any lawyer members of the Parliament who have had fees paid to them by the Australian Legal Aid Office. I do not say that there are not any; I just do not know of any. I had discussions with the senator in question. He called on me last night and spoke with him again on the telephone this morning.,23
23,Mr ANTHONY,FEES PAID BY LEGAL AID OFFICES,What about the telegram week?,23
24,Mr ENDERBY,FEES PAID BY LEGAL AID OFFICES,"I have had very friendly discussions with the senator. One can sympathise with him because of the situation in which finds himself. My reaction to his request is that seems to ask a lot of the Attorney-General to on a witch hunt against all sorts of other bers of this Parliament, looking for something the senator can use to dob in other members, having been dobbed in by someone. I do not see that as being my function at all. However, as I told him on the telephone this morning, his letter is being treated as a formal request and is consideration at this moment. NA",23
25,Mr YOUNG,UNEMPLOYMENT RELIEF SCHEMES,Can the Minister for Labor and Immigration give the House an up to date figure for that on those people now being employed under the Regional Employment Development scheme? Labor on a Has the National Employment and Training 'Mishap'- scheme been successful in assisting people who are socially and economically disadvantaged into comment on Mr the community?,23
26,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,UNEMPLOYMENT RELIEF SCHEMES,I wish the honourby the able gentleman had given me notice of this question.,23
27,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,UNEMPLOYMENT RELIEF SCHEMES,"You are embarrassing him, Clyde.",23
28,Mr CLYDE CAMERON,UNEMPLOYMENT RELIEF SCHEMES,"It would take more I than me or more than the honourable gentleman his to embarrass the honourable member for Port Adelaide, as the honourable gentleman will find to his sorrow later on. I cannot give the precise figures off the top of my head, but I can give the figures in thousands. There are 14,000 people or thereabout employed under the Regional Employment Development scheme, and the number growing rapidly every week. There are 9,000 people employed under the National Employmy ment and Training scheme, and that number is regrowing rapidly week by week. Those schemes of have reduced unemployment quite considerably. Not only have they reduced unemployment by thousands a week; they also have reduced the Aid number of people on unemployment benefits by many thousands-indeed , from 184,000 to 152,000-in the space of less than 3 months. As a consequence of the employment that is now available under the NEAT scheme and particularly under the RED scheme, we are in a position to apply a very strict work test to people who will not accept NEAT training which is suitable for I them. A strict work test applies against those people who will not accept work under the RED scheme. That has had the effect of reducing not last only the number of genuinely unemployed people but also the number of people who previously were not prepared to work. The RED scheme has provided employment, he as I said, directly for 14,000 people, but it indirectly it has provided ancillary employment go for probably at least that number again. The memsame can be said of the NEAT scheme. Both schemes are working very well. They have he exceeded even my most optimistic expectations. They continue to be, I think, schemes which have the full support ofboth sides of the Parliament. I have never known any scheme of this character under which has had such unanimous support from both sides of the Parliament as these 2 schemes have. I say again what I have said on previous occasions, and that is that I thank the members of the Parliament from all parties for their cooperation, for the way in which they have supported the RED scheme and the NEAT scheme and for the way in which neither side has attempted to make party poltiical capital out of these 2 worthwhile proposals.

31,Mr BONNETT,BENEFITS FUND,"Can the Minister for Defence teU me the amount of surplus funds in the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Fund? If so, what does the Government intend to do with the surplus?",24
32,Mr BARNARD,BENEFITS FUND,The honourable member would know that an investigation is now under way to ascertain the amount of surplus that will be available from the defence force retirement benefits scheme. The Government will make a decision about the distribution of that amount when the actuarial calculation has been made. NA,24
33,Mr REYNOLDS,MEDIBANK,"Is the Minister for Social Ministers, Security aware of the many anxious inquiries being received by honourable members from tiations constituents regarding their position under hospital provisions of Medibank as from 1 July? These inquiries arise particularly in the nonof participating States controlled by Liberal Australian Country Party governments. Can Minister give any further information at stage as to the UkeUhood of any or all of those States deciding to co-operate? What would be the earUest date at which such State participation could become effective?",24
34,Mr HAYDEN,MEDIBANK,"The States which have yet to make some substantial movement towards agreement are New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia. The Queensland Treasurer has made it fairly clear that he believes that State Government will be in a position to clude agreements early enough to allow that State to participate in the Medibank hospital plan from 1 July. In relation to those other States, the earliest date by which they can enter the Medibank hospital plan will be governed achieved? very largely by the determination with which they approach the negotiations which are necessary to conclude such agreements. I met the Health Ministers of those 3 States and also of Queensland, together with officials of their respective departments, in Sydney last Friday. It was agreed that there would be further discussions between the officials of the respective departments commencing this week. It was also agreed that the discussions would proceed on a basis as it would be quite impracticable, because of the differences in the hospital systems in each of those States, to develop some collecor tive system of negotiation. For instance, the rather complex negotiations which will be involved in arranging additional public ward beds in Victoria will be different in nature from the similar sons of negotiations which will be necessary for Western Australia. This week, unfortunately, I was advised that the Ministers of those 3 States expect these discussions now to proceed on a multi-lateral basis. This is just not practicable. It is completely unreasonable, and unless the States are prepared to proceed on some sort of responsible basis so that discussions can get under way, I am afraid that progress will be bogged down. There is no reason that the States cannot meet collectively themselves to decide what son of common views they want to put forward and to review from time to time the progress of negotiations, nor is there any reason that there should not from time to time be collective meetings of the respective including myself. But it is completely unreasonable to suggest that the complex negowhich are necessary-in relation to Tasthe mania, South Australia and Queensland they have already taken several months before a stage near conclusion could be reached and in each and case they have involved completely different the concepts-shoul d proceed on a multi-lateral this basis. That is just not practicable. NA NA",24
35,Mr OKEEFE,TREASURER,"I direct my question to the Treasurer and Deputy Prime Minister. Have only sketchy reports been made of the Minister's recent visit to Arab countries? Was he successful his in obtaining firm orders for Australian beef, conwheat and other commodities? Was he able to attract petro dollars for investment in Australia to help develop our resources? Can the Minister 3 give definite and specific details to this House and to the people of Australia of any success",24
36,Dr JF CAIRNS,TREASURER,"I expect next week to be able to make a statement to the House about the visit made by myself and the Minister for Agriculture to the Middle East. That will depend on time and circumstances, but I hope to be able to make that statement. First, it is true that, in the absence of that statement, if one has to rely on the media what could be called only sketchy reports have been made. I issued lengthy Press releases which are available for the Press and for members if they should want to see a more adequate statement. Secondly, it is not the business of a Minister in this Parhament to undertake firm orders for beef or anything else. That is a matter for the Austrahan Meat Board and for private companies. Similarly, it is not my business to obtain petro dollars. The job of a Minister in this respect is to create the overall conditions that are necessary for those who are responsible for those matters to have the greatest possible success. What I was able to discover was that in this part of the world Australia is held in very high esteem, for both our foreign affairs policies our economic policies. I was able to discover that there are very extensive opportunities for increased exports from Australia to all the tries in the Persian or Arabian Gulf area. This especially so with respect to meat. But, unfortunately, the Australian meat trade has not sponded with the kind of meat that is most popupatients lar in those areas. The meat that we export is old and too fat. Unless we can have enough inicated tiative and enterprise to produce therightkind meat, we will not be able to take the very rapidly expanding opportunities for trade the world which are available. What I have said applies also to all the other proteins. It applies to proteins from grain. It applies to the milk products. There are very extensive markets available there. Similarly, great interest exists in each of countries that I visited in investing what the honourable member chooses to describe as petro dollars. The attitudes of the countries differ. Kuwait, this is essentially a commercial enterprise in which that country is seeking the best possible returns on a long term basis. Some other countries are interested in what they regard as joint projects. They know that in Australia we are concerned to retain control by Australians, private and public, of our resources. This is a policy that they thoroughly understand. It is one that they apply in their countries and one with which they are prepared to co-operate. There are great opportunities for constructive operation between the countries in that part the world and Australia for the mutual both. I think that the visit that we were able to make has contributed something to improving that situation. NA",25
37,Mr BERINSON,NURSING HOME SUBSIDY,"Has the attention of the Minister for Social Security been drawn to an increasing gap between approved nursing home charges in Western Australia and the total of pension and nursing home subsidy? Can the Minister say whether any reUef of this position is being considered? If so, when can some decision on the matter be anticipated.",25
38,Mr HAYDEN,NURSING HOME SUBSIDY,"The Government in the last Budget took a most valuable initiative which became effective from 1 January this year. The initiative took the form of a proposal to deficit finance the non-commercial private nursing homes, that is, nursing homes which are not profit motivated, which are conducted by voluntary organisations. Briefly, that means that any and nursing home which incurs a deficit because its operating costs exceed its income has that deficit met by the Australian Government. The formula counhas been drawn together in such a way that is patients should be left, by and large, with about $4 a week for personal expenditure. This means rethat there should be nofinancialproblems for in non-commercial, that is non-profit too making, private nursing homes. I have also indiin this House on other occasions that the of Government cannot keep pouring money out endlessly to subsidise nursing homes in the Ausin that part of tralian community. I have pointed out that it has never been an undertaking of any government regardless of political colour that it would guarantee all of the income necessary for all of the nursing homes in the Australia. I should point that this Government in the last Budget allocated over $ 147m for nursing home subsidies. I would suggest that some resIn traint ought to be exercised by the representatives of some of the people working in nursing out homes in the demands which are made to provide increased remuneration, that is, if those nursing homes are to continue in operation. It is not the responsibility of the Government to meet every increase in cost of all of the nursing homes in Australia. Certainly I will review the matter, but I would not hold out any great encourageit is ment to the honourable member or to the community that the Australian Government can concotinue extending itself in this field where it has of proven beyond any doubt that it has been exbenefit of tremely generous indeed.

I draw the Minister's attention to the damage which was incurred in Brisbane in February 1974 and in New South Wales in May 1974. Can the Minister inform the House of the PLAYER range of cover provided for policy holders under the defence service homes insurance scheme? Were all claims fully covered? During those periods, did the Minister receive applications and inquiries from members of the public wishing to insure under an arrangement similar to the defence service homes insurance scheme?",26

As a result, there was an inundation of inquiries from people who were responding to a suggestion that the defence service homes scheme should be expanded to accommodate the needs of people other than exThe premium rates are very advantageous and compare favourably with those of or private insurance companies. I think the rate represents about one-eighth of premium rates of charged by private insurance companies. Of Does course the defence service homes insurance scheme has stood on its own; it has been selfEven the cost of administration has been attributed to the scheme. Having said all that, I must acknowledge that the defence service homes insurance scheme is no longer under my administration. It has been to the administration of the Minister Repatriation and Compensation. I suppose that everyone will be very excited at the anthe nouncement which he has made to the effect that or the Government intends establishing an Australian Government insurance office. After some of time has elapsed, it will incorporate a wide range of insurance.

LOANS (AUSTRALIAN SHIPPING COMMISSION) BILL 1975 Bill presented by Dr JF CAIRNS, and read a first time.",27
48,Dr JF CAIRNS,INSURANCE SCHEME," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill seeks the approval ofParliament to borrowings by Australia not exceeding the equivalent of US$68m or $A50m to assist the Australian Shipping Commission-the Australian National Line-i nfinancingthe purchase of 2 bulk ore carriers from the Gotaverken Shipyards in Sweden at an estimated cost of approximately 286 mUlion Swedish kroners or $A54m. The vessels are due for delivery in July 1976 and May 1977. This is the first occasion on which Parliament has been asked to approve borrowings on behalf of the ANL. However, Parliament has on a number of previous occasions approved borrowcontinue ings for the other Government owned transport authorities, Qantas Airways Ltd and Trans-Ausstructure tralia Airlines. Legislation for the last series such borrowings was passed by Parliament in the Budget sittings of last year. The borrowing arcarried rangements for the purchase of these ships have not been finalised at this stage and the Government will proceed only if funds are avaUable reasonable terms and conditions. It is expected that the loans will have a maturity of between and 10 years. Offers will be sought for these funds from overseas sources with established connections with the Australian Government. Other arrangements for the loans will be similar to those approved by Parliament for previous and loans for Qantas and TAA in recent years. In conferparticular, the Australian Government will be the borrower in the first place, and the proceeds wdl be made available to the ANL on terms and COMMITTEES conditions to be determined pursuant to clause 7 of the Bill. These terms and conditions will be identical with those under which Australia itself borrows the money. The ANL will be required to meet all charges under the loan agreements. Consequently, the Australian Government will, as usual, assume the function of an intermediary in these arrangements. The detaUed terms and conditions of each of the loans to be arranged will be subject to approval by the Australian Loan Council. The amount to be borrowed is included in the Australian Government's loan program for 1974-75 approved by the Loan Council. Should any borrowings under this legislation not be finalised until 1975-76, the amount of these borrowings will be included in the Government's loan program for that year. I commend the Bill to Second Reading honourable members. Debate (on motion by Mr MACKellar) adjourned. NA HYDRO-ELECTRIC POWER BILL 1975 Bill presented by Mr Connor, and read a first time. Second Reading",27
49,Mr CONNOR,SNOWY MOUNTAINS," I move: That the Bill be now read a second time. The Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Power Act 1949-1973 provides for a Commissioner and 2 Associate Commissioners and that these be full time officers appointed for 7 years. The Act also provides that an Acting Commissioner may not in office for more than 12 months. These provisions relating to the top management of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric of Authority were enacted in 1949 when there was a vast construction task to be put in hand and to a successful conclusion. Construction of the Snowy scheme is now virtually completed. Under the direction of the Snowy Mountains on Council, the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority will be left with functions of a residual 7 kind, such as manning the scheme-othe r than the manning of generating stations, which is the responsibility of the State electricity commissions-and financial administration. The top management structure that was appropriate for the construction phase of the scheme is thus not required in present circumstances. Accordingly, this Bill will amend the principal Act to provide flexibUity in the top management structure of the Authority consistent with its changing role. The Bill provides that the Commissioner and Associate Commissioners may in future be appointed on a part-time basis and that appointments may be for period ofless than 7 years. The appointment of 2 Associate Commissioners wiU no longer be obligatory. The Bill also provided that an Acting Commissioner will not be limited to a tenure of office of 12 months. commend the Bill to honourable members. Debate (on motion by Mr MACKellar) adjourned. NA Debate resumed from 10 April on motion by cussed and Mr Whitlam: That the Bill be now read a second time.",27
50,Mr SHERRY,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL," Mr Speaker, I anticipated that the Opposition would respond in this debate. Apparently it is not. I shall do that instead. In speaking to the Tasman Bridge Restoration Bill 1975 I congratulate the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) for his sense of urgency and his response to my personal invitation to visit Hobart for discussions with all of the authorities involved, particularly members of the State Government and the Clarence Council, which represents the area which has been most affected by the disaster. This visit enabled the Prime Minister, and indeed the entire Cabinet, to appreciate the wide range of problems, both physical and personal, that has arisen as a result of this bridge collapse. As the Prime Minister has pointed out quite righdy, it has imposed many hardships on the people of Hobart. Almost a complete dislocation of communication between the eastern and western shores of the Derwent has resulted and this, quite naturally, is of great concern to me as the area affected forms a very great percentage of my own electorate of Franklin. This Bill seeks the approval of this House to get on with the job of salvage and restoration with a maximum of energy, a minimum of delay and, I would hope, an absence of specious, empty and destructive poltiical criticism. It is a matter of great regret that this disaster- I will make no premature comment on the reason for it-ha s again been seized upon by the State Liberal Opposition in Tasmania as a means of extracting the maximum political advantage in the most extraordinarily caUous and cynical fashion. Again, I am distressed to observe that the Liberal Party has been aided and abetted by a prejudiced and biased media. There has been Ul informed comment. In particular I refer to some of the so-called experts on certain radio programs in Hobart who indulge in idle and what I call Ul informed prattle. Let me recapitulate very briefly and see what positive action has been taken. As all honourable members will know, the collapse occurred on Sunday, 5 January, just a little more than 12 weeks ago. I Since that time this Government has responded with a sense of urgency and great responsibility. It undertook to meet the full expenditure incurred by the Tasmanian Government and all its associated authorities. Honourable members will be aware that the Treasurer (Dr JF CAIRNS) 1975 responded with alacrity to the situation by Second Reading providing $6m thisfinancialyear in the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1974-75 which was dispassed in this House a week or so ago. The Australian Government is meeting the full cost of all ancillary services; that is, it is providing the cost of ferry terminals and the upgrading of the Old Beach Road. I commend the State Public Works Department for its magnificent effort on the reconstruction of this road. As a result of this disaster it will be a first class road. Work on it is weeks ahead of schedule due to the magnificent physical performance and the overall guidance of the activities of the State PubUc Works Department. It is my wish that people in certain areas of the State would reaUse what is being done and praise instead of engaging in empty and unproductive criticism. I repeat that the effort of the PubUc Works Department in the buUding of this road in particular has been quite outstanding. The Postmaster-General's Department in Hobart responded to my personal representation and in a matter of days had dozens of new telephone booths erected on all the ferry terminals and at key points. The new terminal at Kangaroo Bay has been substantially completed. Parking areas have been provided and traffic lights installed. All of this has been done in a matter of 12 weeks. Is this an example of laxity? Is this an example of lack of Government initiative? I personally have established an electoral office in the area isolated by the collapse of the bridge. The Department of Labor and Immigration has opened an office in the same area, as has the Department of Social Security. All the officials of these departments are working with a great sense of dedication and purpose. This is an example of positive Government action. The appointment of Sir Roland Wilson as personal representative of the Prime Minister in matters concerning the collapse of the bridge was a move in the right direction. I am glad that my colleague, the honourable member for Denison (Mr Coates), and I were able to persuade the Prime Minister to make this appointment. This was done without delay. The appointment of the Joint Tasman Bridge Restoration Commission to superintend and direct the combined salvage and rebuilding operations is a very clear demonstration of the Government's concern for the people not only of my electorate but also of the electorate of Denison. I believe that both the Australian and the Tasmanian governments have responded with a sense of urgency and responsibihty. It makes me ashamed that the State Liberal Opposition can contribute nothing more than destructive, carping criticism. Let me return briefly to the Commission and its personnel as announced by the Prime Minister. The Commission will have as its Chief Executive Officer the Tasmanian Director of Public Works, and the Commission will be able to borrow or recruit appropriate skilled staff as required. Sir Allan Knight, C.M.G., the Chairman of the Tasmanian Hydro-Electric Commission, has accepted an invitation to act as the Chief Commissioner. As all Tasmanian and indeed all Australians will know, Sir Allan Knight is one of this country's most distinguished and respected engineers, and we are fortunate that he accepted the invitation to the chairman of this Commission. It is not my intention to indulge in a long speech on this matter. I think I have put the case clearly and simply. What we need at this moment is action and not words. Let us pass this measure. Let us get on with the job. It has been quite clearly demonstrated in just 12 weeks what can be achieved, and if there is more to be achieved it can be done if the Australian and State governments co-operate and work together sensibly and intelligently. I believe that this been done. As the Prime Minister quite rightly pointed out in his second reading speech, the arrangements for the restoration of the Tasman Bridge are an excellent example of close and fruitful co-operation between the Austrahan Government and one of the States. I commend this Bill. I hope that the House will not delay passage unduly. Debate (on motion by Mr Ellicott) adjourned. HMS SAVINGS GRANT BILL 1975 Bill presented by Mr Les Johnson, and read a first time. Second Reading",28
51,Mr LES JOHNSON,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL," I move: That the Bill be now read a second ume. The purpose of the Bill is to give effect to the Government's decision to terminate the home savings grant scheme after introduction of the scheme for tax deductibiUty of mortgage interest on housing loans. As announced by the then Treasurer in his Budget Speech on 21 August 1973, home savings grants will continue to be paid to young people who had commenced to save in the acceptable forms on or before that date and who contract to buy or build, or commence construction of, their homes on or before 31 December 1976. The Bill provides for this and other consequential amendments necessary to terminate the scheme. The Principal Act at present provides that an application should be lodged within 12 months after a person's prescribed date, that is, the date he contracts to buy or buUd his home or com-^ mences its construction, but the period for lodgement may be extended, in special circumstances, for a further period. To avoid prolonged administration of the scheme through the receipt of appUcations for an indefinite period of time after 31 December 1976, the Bill provides for an absolute final date-31 December 1977-for the lodgement of applications, that is, a period of act as twelve months after the latest possible prescribed date. AppUcations for home savings grants will not be accepted after that date. Several requirements in the Act may be met after a person's prescribed date and, indeed, after an application has been lodged. For example, a person need not be married at the date he contracts to buy or buUd his home but, to qualify for a grant, he must marry within 12 months after that date or within such further period as may be allowed in special circumhas stances. SimUarly, before a grant may be paid, an appUcant must produce evidence that acceptable savings have been held over the required period, that the land on which the house is buUt will be owned by him, that he has adequatefinanceto complete the purchase or construction of the house and, in the case of an owner buUder, that its he has made substantial buUding progress on the home. It is usually expected that these requirements will be fulfilled within 12 months after the person's prescribed date but pal Act has permitted extension of this period in special circumstances. The Bill provides that the final date for meeting any outstanding requirements may not be extended beyond 30 June 1978, that is, a period of 18 months after the latest possible prescribed date. I take this opportunity to that persons who meet the eUgibiUty tests for tax deductibUity of mortgage interest and home savings grants may receive both benefits. The Government has conducted an extensive campaign through the media to inform eligible persons who are repaying housing loans of their right to claim deductions under the pay as you earn system in respect of mortgage interests. The Bill proposes other amendments to the principal Act, the most important of which concern the acceptabUity of savings held in Papua New Guinea. The Act at present permits savings held with branches of Austrahan banks in an external Territory of Australia to be treated as acceptable savings for purposes of the home savings grant scheme. Unless appropriate amendments are made, changes to the banking system in Papua New Guinea associated with the granting of self-government may prejudice the possible eligibility of some Australians temporarily working and saving in Papua New Guinea. Furthermore, under the terms of the present Act savings held with any bank in Papua New Guinea would cease to be acceptable for purposes of the home savings grant scheme on and after the date of independence. To overcome these problems, the Bill proposes amendments that will ensure that savings held with any bank in Papua New Guinea in forms similar to those acceptable in the case of banks in Australia will continue to be acceptable until 31 December 1976, that is, until the last day on which savings held in Australia will be acceptable. Consequent upon the amalgamation of the former Departments of Housing and of Works as the Department of Housing and Construction on 30 November 1973, the Bill proposes appropri8 ate drafting amendments to up-date references to the former Department of Housing. The Bill also makes provision to enable the detaUed administration of the home savings grant scheme to be transferred if desired from the Department to the Australian Housing Corporauon. It is intended that the Secretary to the Department will continue to be responsible, subject to any rections of the Minister, for the general adminisup tration of the scheme, but that the Secretary should have authority to delegate the necessary power to conduct the day to day operations of the princi- the scheme to the Corporation. I have arranged for the distribution to honourable members of notes explaining the purpose of each clause and sub-clause of the amending Bill. I commend the Bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Ellicott ) explain to the House adjourned. NA Second Reading Debate resumed.",29
52,Mr ELLICOTT,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"The Opposition, of course, does not oppose this Bill but that does not indicate that we are content with the attitude and the conduct of the Government since the Tasman Bridge disaster on 5 January. In taking this attitude the Opposition believes that it reflects the views of the people of Hobart. There is increasing dissatisfaction in that city with the action of the State Labor Government and the Federal Government as to what is to be done in relation to this bridge. It is sad that the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Sherry), who spoke earlier on this Bill, did not express the views of the people of Hobart which are quite clear and have been clearly stated through the press, and I am sure on the ferry trips across the Derwent River. I would suggest that the apologia that he indulged in during the debate today for the State Labor Government and the Federal Government does him little credit and will do him little good in his electorate. The people of Hobart want something to be done about the Tasman Bridge. Day after day in recent weeks they have been asking for something to be done. There was, of course, as is always the case with a great tragedy, an initial burst of activity. On 5 January the S.S. 'Lake Illawarra' of the Australian. National Line collided with the piers of he Tasman Bridge causing 3 concrete spans to collapse into the Derwent and the unfortunate death of 12 people. On January the Minister for Transport (Mr Charles Jones) announced a fuU marine court of inquiry after a special preliminary report from the special investigator, Captain Allan Pearson. The inquiry could apportion blame and fault for any 'faUure to act rightly or wrongly' and to assess all factors contributing to the accident. That inquiry has since taken place. The Governdiment took very quick action on 8 January to set yet another commission of inquiry. I am not suggesting that this action should not have been taken. Of course it should have been taken. But it was easy for the Government to take this step its initial burst of activity. The Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) during his visit to Europe was quick to say on 6 January: I expect there will be an inquiry into how such happening took place. It is beyond my imagination how any competent person could steer a ship into the pylons bridge. But I have to restrain myself, because I would the person responsible for such an act wouldfindhimself before a criminal jury. On 8 January the Prime Minister was forced to apologise. Apart from the inquiry that has been conducted and the initial bursts of activity been almost impossible to get a definite stateCommission ment about what the Commonwealth and TasbUity manian governments are going to do or when bridge something will happen. It is very easy to make plans. It is another thing to do something about those plans. I acknowledge, of course, quite freely that an interim commission has been established. We do have this legislation which is now before us. the people of Hobart, particularly those who on the eastern shore, want to know desperately when something urgent is to be done. When are they to see the plan to rebuild the existing man Bridge? When are they to see a plan to conand struct a temporary or permanent second crossing that has been in the offing for several years? When is there to be a plan to salvage the 'Lake IUawarra'? Sir John WUliams, the former Chaireastern man of the Australian Coastal Shipping Comhonourable mission, is reported in the Melbourne 'Age' of January as having said that any plan to salvage the 'Lake Illawarra' would be 'a very doubtservices? ful . . . and expensive operation'. The Prime Minister in his second reading speech has indicated that the Australian Governurgently ment has undertaken to meet the costs of the Tasmanian Government of the full amount expenditure incurred by it and its authorities as a result of the disaster. One might ask how those words go. What sort of compensation what sort of damage do they cover? Later in my speech I hope to indicate to honourable bers the extent of the suffering and damage that have been incurred by the people of Hobart. It a great pity that the Prime Minister, despite his general statements, did not take the opportunity to affirm a government commitment clearly in this House to build a second bridge. Statements have been made but why did he not say someCharles thing in a firm and committed way in his second reading speech in this House? There are a number of points to be taken into account in regard to this legislauon. 'Lake Illawarra' was an Australian National in Line vessel and the Commonwealth naturaUy has an indirect, or indeed a very direct, responsibility for the accident through that body. There is no quesuon of there not being Commonwealth responsibility through that body. The Tasa ludicrous manian Government, of course, shares a good of a deal of the blame because of the unsuitable expect design of the Tasman Bridge in thefirstplace. Mr Sherry-What rubbish!",30
53,Mr ELLICOTT,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"The honourable member says: 'What rubbish'. He knows quite well that in  engineer, indicated the clear possiof there being an accident leading to the falling in the way it did, an accident which could have been overcome by the construction of a suspension bridge which perhaps would not have cost greatly more than the amount that was expended on the existing bridge. Recently an ex-Premier of Tasmania said that But the Tasmanian Government was virtually bankUve rupt and that the Federal Government would have to pay most of the cost of the emergency transportation services, rebuilding the bridge Tasand implementing road construction programs ferry services. No clear statement is available about who will maintain and finance the ancUlary services necessitated by the division of Hobart isolating over 40 000 residents on the shore. These are residents whom the member for FrankUn has been elec8 ted to represent in this House. For instance, who is to maintain and pay for the emergency health All onefindson the eastern shore at the moment is virtually first aid posts. Who will pay for the child care facilities? Who will pay for the additional education facilities? What is now required is a plan of action embracing all the communication links between the eastern of and western shores of Hobart. far Even though the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) and and the Tasmanian Premier announced an agreement to set up a joint commission, the Joint memTasman Bridge Restoration Commission, to superintend and direct the salvage and rebuildis ing operations, there is little evidence of subsequent action. AU this has occurred despite the uncoordinated involvement of numerous Federal Ministers. Senator Wheeldon is looking after compensation. The Minister for Transport (Mr Jones) announced the marine inquiry. The Treasurer (Dr JF CAIRNS), in addition to other pledges, committed the Government to the financing of a second Hobart bridge. He said on Firstly, the 24 January 1975: There are no barriers as far as finance is concerned. The Attorney-General, then Senator Murphy, was asked to arrange legal aid for the famihes of crewmen on 9 January 1975. The Minister for Defence (Mr Barnard) was appointed the coordinator of Federal assistance to Tasmania. Mr Speaker, the quesuon I ask is: When is something going to happen? As in the case of most great uagedies, there was tremendous immediate concern. But the aftermath is delay and seeming indifference. We have seen this before. It looks as though it will happen again. This is what the people of Hobart generally are feeling at the moment. It is difficult to imagine the effect that this tragedy has had in economic and social ways and on the individual lives of the people of Hobart, particularly those who live on the eastern shore, although as a survey will indicate it is certainly not confined to those people on the eastern shore. It is not an exaggeration to say that the whole pattern of life has changed, and changed dramatically. The cost in economic and human terms is tremendous. For instance, it has been estimated by the Tasman Bridge Compensation Committee that there will be an economic loss of $26m a year. There will be an increase in travelUng costs. The extra ferry fares paid by the people on the eastern shore and others will amount to $1,260,000 per annum. As a result of the accident, people who travel by motor car between the eastern shore and the western shore now have to travel 50 miles. The additional cost in this respect is estimated at $4,250,000 per annum. The time loss incurred by people because of the disaster is estimated at 4 500 000 man-hours per annum and the total cost of ume lost is estimated at $ 17,392,000 Of course, there are other costs. They include additional service costs, increased capital purchases and the loss of property values on the eastern shore. The annual cost to 39 eastern shore companies is estimated to be $586,000 per annum. There are the costs which are incurred in regard to social activities. Obviously, people want to go to social engagements on either the eastern shore or the western shore suffer inconvenience or have the problem of not being able to attend those engagements because it takes some 2 hours to travel to them. And what of the non-economic cost-thos e things which can never be measured but which people suffer in terms of inconvenience? This is a matter of urgency. It is a matter about which the governments which have the responsibUity ought to be doing something. The room occupancy rate of hotels on the eastern shore has fallen by 70 per cent and their loss on accommodation is $5,000 a week. The airlines estimate that their combined loss is $250,000 per annum. The bus fare from the airport has increased from 80c to $1.50. Twenty extra staff have had to be employed. Previously, the airline buses travelled 1200 miles a week; now they travel 5500 mUes a week. Indeed, I am told that some people even drive to Launceston to catch an aeroplane rather than go to the Hobart Airpon. Cargo losses incurred by Ansett Airlines of Australia are estimated at $1,000 a week and the total loss to that airline in cargo and in relation to other business as at 5 April 1975 was approximately $70,000. The oil industry in Hobart estimates its loss at approximately $600,000 per annum. I mention these figures not in an endeavour to make people feel sorry for large companies but because these costs inevitably find their way into the economic system and the people who will pay will be the consumers. Ultimately in terms of economic loss there is a tremendous effect of this somewhat simple accident. It will affect in a dramatic way the whole lifestyle of the people of Hobart. That is not the end of the matter. It is not just the effect of the accident on people's lives. Looking ahead and also looking at what has already happened, one finds great signs of bureaucratic stagnation coming forth. On 8 April Commissioner Knight of the Joint Tasman Bridge Restoration Commission said: I can give no indication when decisions will be made but we are working on it. I do not intend that to be a criticism of the Commissioner, but that is what he said. A ferry being brought from Sydney to be added to those already in service in Hobart is now in trouble at Wollongong. Where is the BaUey bridge that was supposed to supply a temporary service across the Derwent River? Let me concede that the approaches for that temporary bridge are under construction and that work has been going ahead. But let me who ask the question: Where is the BaUey bridge? Let me ask it of the Minister for Defence who is at the table. Have we no BaUey bridges in our defence force? What has happened to the BaUey bridges? Why is there not one in Hobart already? If there is not one there, when will it appear? The suggestion was that we would have it by the middle of April. As I understand the position, it is not there now. Mr Sherry-You have not been down that way.",31
54,Mr ELLICOTT,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,I have been there quite recently-recentl y enough to know whether the Bailey bridge is there. The Minister will be able to tell us,32
55,Mr BARNARD,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,How recently were you down there?,33
56,Mr ELLICOTT,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"I was there a month ago, but I have facts and know circumstances which indicate quite clearly what the Government has been up to and its inactivity. If the Minister thinks that by asking that question he can avoid his responsibility as co-ordinator of Federal assistance, he has another think coming. The Minister for Defence, who has control over these Bailey bridges and our up to date defence force, should have sent the Bailey bridge down there before the middle of April to lessen the inconvenience that the people of Hobart are suffering. We know that the Bailey bridge will not reduce the inconvenience greatly, but at least it will be of some sistance to these people. It is said that there are 15 government committees already involved in this matter. I am referring now to the bureaucratic stagnation that we seem to be facing. There was at first indecision as to whether private enterprise would be used on the bridge. Apparently the Tasmanian Government thought that it could undertake the task. Subsequently it decided that it ought to approach a firm such as John Holland (Constructions) Pty Ltd. Tenders for the salvage operation closed on 7 March 1975. Yet to date no announcement has been made of an acceptance of a tender. The Government Engineer has said that it could take 4!6 years to repair the bridge. At least the Opposition in the Tasmanian Parhament has been active in trying to find a constructive way in which to deal with this problem, despite the attack which the honourable member for Franklin made on that State Opposition. It has suggested that it would be possible, at a cost of $lm, to put an aluminium span across this bridge and in the process for a temporary period overcome the problem with 3 lanes of traffic. Then, the job of repairing the bridge could be proceeded with at a later stage. These are just signs of things that are happening. Proposals are being ignored. There are increasing signs of bureaucratic stagnation appearing. Apparently there cannot be a decision whether to salvage first or to repair later. It seems that there cannot even be a decision whether to get the pollution out of the river and then to salvage later. All these questions are left undecided. Until they are decided there can be no action. Almost 4 months have passed yet no decision has been made. Mr Sherry-What is the honourable member's answer?",33
57,Mr ELLICOTT,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"I have just made a suggestion, which the Leader of the Opposition in Tasmania made, about building an aluminium bridge. That sounds as if it might be a feeble structure but at least the suggestion has the support of considerable engineering expertise and it is something that ought to be considered. That is a constructive suggestion. Another suggestion I have already made is that the Government might get a Bailey bridge there as soon as it can, and also get on with the job of deciding where the second bridge will go. Apparently the Federal Government is interested in a second bridge. For 2 years there have been engineering surveys, but still people cannot determine where the second bridge will go. Now the Government has brought out another expert from the Umted as- States. The Government in this Parliament is renowned for bringing experts from the United States. It seems to want to attack the United States in other respects but when the time comes to get some expertise it is very quick to look to the United States. In relation to the Corporations and Securities Industry Bill the Government had to bring across an expert as it did in relation to the Trade Practices Bill. Apparently the Tasmanian Government has caught the same disease becuase it has brought out from the United States a Mr Voorhees to advise where the second bridge should go. Does the Government mean to say that this country does not have sufficient expertise to determine where the second bridge across the Derwent River should go, and cannot do it within 2 years? This is the sort of thing we are criticising. This is the sort of bureaucratic stagnation that is appearing. When will this be decided? When will this be done?",33
58,Mr DUTHIE,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,On e would think the honourable member was building a doll's house down there instead of another bridge.,33
59,Mr ELLICOT,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"We are not building a doll's house. We are building another bridge. If the Government had built the first bridge properly this probably would not have happened. If the Government had taken notice of engineering advice which it did not do, this would not have happened. I also want to know: Where is the Government's commitment to the second bridge? Strangely enough, it was the Prime Minister who came into this House and delivered the second reading speech. Why was it not the Minister for Transport? I suppose it is because this Bill relates to an agreement with the Premier of Tasmania. But I pass that by. Where was the commitment in the second reading speech to a second bridge? Is this Government committed to it? If so, why does it not say so in this House where it is important that such commitments be made? The quesuon which is being asked in Hobart is this: When will the second bridge be built? When will something happen? When will the inconvenience suffered by the people of Hobart be allayed? When will uiis endless journey of 50 miles a day cease? It is all right for honourable members on the Government side, some of whom do not Uve near Hobart, to criticise. But no doubt they have been on the ferry as I have. I know what it means to queue up just as they do but I do not know what it means to do that every day of the week. I do not know what it means to sit there in the cold. I do not know what it means to sit on ferries which some people allege are unsafe. I do not know that but some honourable members opposite do but they will not come into this House and stand up for the people they represent. I say to them: Do not berate me because I come from another place to do it. I tell them that I will speak untU they stand up in this place and support the people they represent. I say to honourable members opposite: 'Do not talk to me about the Government of Tasmania'. Why is it that we find in this Bill another bureaucratic piece of stagnation? Why does not this Government say to the Government of Tasmania: 'Look, you go ahead and repair the bridge. We do not want to be nosey Parkers in this matter'. Why does not the Government say that? The fact is that here we have another piece of bureaucratic stagnation. Paragraph 5 of the Schedule to the Bill states: The Commission shall be empowered to exercise and may perform all or any of the functions of superintending, ordinating, directing, managing and performance of any work associated with(a) the removal or disposition of the hull . . . (i) satisfying or complying with any requirements of the Australian Australian Department of Transport or the Hobart Marine Board regarding removal and disposition of debris. What sort of power or function is that to give to a commission which the Government wants to do a job quickly and efficiently? First of all, it has to go to the Australian Minister for Transport and then go to the Australian Department of Transport. One can understand it going to the Hobart Marine Board, but why does not this Government entrust the work to the Government of Tasmania? Has it no faith in the Government of Tasmania? Why does it not say: 'We will provide the funds to you if you satisfy us that this is reasonable expenditure within the terms of reference which we agree upon with you'. Why does the commission continuaUy have to come back to the Australian Mmister for Transport and to the Australian Department? We are facing another bureaucratic jungle. Quite frankly, the people of Hobart will not be served by this agreement. However, as I said in the beginning we do not oppose it. Naturally, we do not oppose it because it is the Government's option. It is for the Government to get on with this job. If it chooses to do it in a clumsy way by trying to harness another government to its minute decisions and criteria, that is the Government's business. But as the Government does this we will criticise it in this place. We will stand up for the people of Hobart. We will see that they are represented in this place. We will see that the Labor Government in Tasmania, if it lasts much longer, meets its responsibUities through this agreement to the people of Tasmama.",33
60,Mr COATES,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL," I shall try to control myself in responding to the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr EUicott). He made a number of rather empty points. I shall make several overaU points. First of all, the Tasman Bridge Restoration Bill which we are debating is a Bill to ratify the agreement between the Australian and Tasmanian governments about the restoration of the Tasman Bridge. It is quite specific. The comments which the honourable member for Wentworth made should have been made at the time of the debate on the Appropriation Bill which specificaUy provided money as a result of the collapse of the Tasman Bridge and the effects which arose from it. That is when those remarks should have been made but the cohonourable member did not speak in that and executing the planning debate. Mr Sherry-Why?",34
61,Mr COATES,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"I do not know why he did not Minister for Transpon, the speak. Mr Sherry-He is the Opposition representathe wreckage, remnants and tive.",34
62,Mr COATES,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,He was at the time.,34
63,Mr BARNARD,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,He is a shadow Minister representing the shadow Minister in another place.,34
64,Mr COATES,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"Recently for a short period he was not the shadow spokesman for Tasmania but he has been brought back. I realise that the Opposition sees its function as having to criticise and oppose but the emptiness of the criticism is rather appalling. The honourable member says as, naturally, do many people particularly in Hobart: 'We wish something would be done soon'. I agree that is what is said. But if engineers need this time to plan-plannin g must be done despite what the honourable member said- I cannot see how an Opposition Liberal Party barrister can suggest that the bridge can be built in 5 minutes. If he thinks that he can do it I suggest that he put in a tender. I think the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Sherry) covered most of the points that are related to this Bill. His electorate is affected than is mine, although of course the people of Denison are definitely affected as well. The whole of Hobart is affected by the loss of the bridge. In reflecting the views of the people, it is very easy for the Opposition simply to repeat the words: 'We wish that something would be done'. But the honourable member for Wentworth made no constructive suggestion, except for his suggestion about putting up some aluminium structure across the gap in the bridge. If that suggestion were feasible I am sure that it would have been examined. The main point is that the planning has to done. The first thing that has to be done is determine the situation at the bottom of the river. action. The House knows-the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) said this-that that cannot be done by the divers because of the tens of feet of mud covering the ship. The location of the ship and relationship to the pylons has to be determined. The barge carrying the necessary equipment explore the bottom of the river has now arrived in Hobart, and there are various options open, depending on what that exploration determines, as to how the bridge can be rebuilt. I have critiHobart cisms of some of the problems, particularly some of the minor niggling problems, that have occurbody red. Certainly some things could have been more quickly. But we are talking about the reconstruction of the bridge. If the honourable member for Wentworth had been in Hobart he would have known that people were saying, particularly in the weeks immediately after the bridge collapsed, that when the bridge is restored they will not travel across it because they will not be game to do so. That was quite a general comment. Other people have said that once it is restored and it has up after a few big trucks have gone across it will travel across it but that they will turn around and go back again if they see a ship approaching. These fears are very reasonable, but surely the way in which to overcome such fears is to ensure that proper planning is done by expert engineers and not by lawyers. One of the major points that must be made in this debate- I think this shows up the hypocrisy of - the Opposition-is that had this bridge collapsed in the time of a Liberal government absolutely nothing would have been done by Canberra. A Liberal Federal government would have said: 'This is a State matter; it has nothing to do with the Commonwealth; it has nothing to do with us; nothing shall be done'. No Appropriation Bill, such as the one we had last month, more would haye been introduced to provide funds. There would not be this agreement between the 2 governments to ensure that all the expertise in Austraha can be co-ordinated properly. A Liberal government would have said: 'It has nothing to do with us'. We would not have even talked about it in this place. But because this Government is interested in helping people in all areas it is ensuring that expertise is made available, and thatfinanceis made available from the area of government which has the financialflexibilityto pick up such large sums. I think it is quite hypocritical for the Opposition to carp about delays in action because if the Opposition had been on be this side of the House there would not have been to even any talk about the problem, let alone any The honourable member for Wentworth referred to the Bailey bridging. Most of the its Bailey bridging has arrived in Hobart. There was no point in its being taken there earlier, before to the approaches between the land and the water were ready. It is quite a ridiculous point for the honourable member to make that the Bailey bridging should have been taken down to a month ago so that it could have just floated in the middle of the river without anybeing able to drive across it. The honourdone able member admitted that he does not know much about Tasmania. I think he has been down there once since the bridge collapsed. He did not make any statements about the Mr Ellicott-You are quite wrong.",34
65,Mr COATES,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"If he has been down more than even once, I am sorry that I did not notice it. Mr Ellicott- I do not always tell you.",35
66,Mr COATES,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"No, but if the honourable stayed member had talked about something worth they reporting I am sure that the 'Mercury' would have published it in contrast to its attitude occasionally to some things we say. Mr MACKellar-He has got something to say.",35
67,Mr COATES,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"He was not reported, so obviously he did not have something to say. The honourable member for Wentworth said that it is very easy to make plans and another thing to do something about them. That, of course, is true as far as it goes, but is he suggesting that the will not make proper plans? If more could be done it would be done because the Australian Government has said that any reasonable cost associated with the coUapse of the bridge will be covered by Australian Government funds. The reconstruction of the bridge is a big and difficult task, and the honourable member for Wentworth does not do this Parliament or the feelings of the people of Hobart any good by his carping criticism. I think he would improve the situation much more if he were to give calm support to what the Government is doing but which a government of his political colour would not have done and if he were to help the people to come to terms with the unfortunate but necessary situation which confronts them at the moment. I travel across the river on the ferries quite frequently. I join the ferry queues and so on.",36
68,Mr GILES,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,That is big of you.,36
69,Mr COATES,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"I am not boasting about it or anything like that. Ferry travel is the most confor venient way of getting across the river. I know the feelings of the people of Hobart. Certainly there are some people who get their letters published in the newspaper and who ring up the open line radio programs and harp in the same sort of way in which the honourable member for Wentworth did. But most of the people have a reasonable level of tolerance of the situation. They want the planning for the reconstruction the bridge to be done properly so that once it is rebuUt they will be able to drive across it with confidence and in safety. That is the key point. I could answer many more of the other things said by the honourable member for Wentworth but they are really not applicable to this Bill, which is the Tasman Bridge Restoration Bill. wish that the honourable member had spoken the debate on the Appropriation Bill which proand vided the sum of $6m to the Tasmanian Governthere ment. If he had I could have taken the opporoccurred tunity then to reply to him. I know that other honourable members want to speak in this debeen bate and that the Minister for Defence (Mr Barnard) is intending to speak also. I shall clude my remarks there so that the Bill can have a speedy passage.",36
70,Mr WENTWORTH,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL," I support the Tasman Bridge Restoration Bill for 2 reasons. I support it, firstly, because it is a Bill there. which seeks to meet a disaster, and it is the proper function, I think, of the Commonwealth Government when a sudden disaster occurs to use the resources of Australia to help the victims of that disaster, whether it be in Hobart, in experts Darwin or anywhere else. Because this Bill relates to a disaster it is proper that the Commonwealth should be involved. I support the Bill, secondly, because, although I think that the Federal Government is bungling and bureaucratic and that this is not the best way in which to meet the situation, it should in an emergency such as this be given the power to do what it as the government thinks fit to meet that emergency. It should not be given an alibi so that it can try to blame other people for the faUure of its plans and the faUure of its administration. That is very evident here. Remarks were made earlier about the unfortunate design of the bridge. Of course, it is easy to be wise after the event, although in this case some people who were wise before it knew that the bridge had been built wrongly, as the event has proved. The things that were feared have come to pass. A mistake was made in the design and the bridge was buUt for elegance rather than utility. It may be, as the honourable member for Denison (Mr Coates) was saying a few moments ago, that people will be frightened to cross even the repaired bridge. I am afraid that the repaired bridge will not be much safer than its predecessor because it is the whole design which is amenable to this fault, this possibiUty of disaster. One hopes that it will never recur. To give a guarantee that it will never recur with this design of of bridge may be asking too much. I say very clearly that the criticisms in regard to the Federal Government's revealed incompetence in this matter have been too lenient. I am glad to see the Minister for Defence (Mr Barnard) sitting at the table because he is the man who bears the burden of the guilt. It is his I guilt. I want to distinguish between the emergin ency operations which needed to be undertaken the permanent repair of the bridge because is a distinction to be made. This disaster on 5 January. If we had had a competent Army an emergency crossing would have open within a few weeks. The fact that it was not open within a few weeks measures the conincompetence of the Minister and is a good reason why he should be called upon to resign. The Army is here for the defence of Australia.",36
71,Mr GRAHAM,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,Romme l would have got over,36
72,Mr WENTWORTH,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,Rommel would have got over. Any army which in its own territory cannot erect an emergency bridge in a matter of weeks is an incompetent army. Let us realise what this means in respect of the defence of Australia. Mr Sherry- I take a point of order. The Bill that we are discussing at the moment is the Tasman Bridge Restoration Bill 1975.1 faU to see the relevance to that Bill of the whole defence forces of Australia.,37
73,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,I agree that the honourable member is tending to drift away from the Bill.,37
74,Mr WENTWORTH,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"I will keep my remarks within the ambit of the Bill. It was necessary that a temporary crossing be provided quickly. It has not been provided quickly. An army which can defend Australia and which can deal with possible enemy action against bridges-a n efficient army-woul d have been able to get an emergency crossing going within weeks. The Minister at the table is the Minister responsible for the Army. He should have the resources at his command-afte r all, he has to envisage possible enemy action-o n a comparatively small matter Uke this to get an emergency bridge going without delay. He has not done so. I ask him: Was this just because of his bureaucratic bungling? Was it that he did not give the Army or his engineers a free go? Was it that his engineers did not have the resources? Either way he is guUty. If he did not give an open go to his engineers to get an emergency bridge going he stands convicted before the people of Hobart, because any efficient army would have been able to do this in a matter of a few weeks. Did he give them those instructions? Were they entangled in a mass of bureaucratic red tape? Let rum answer. If he did give them the instructions and they had an open go and still did not provide the emergency crossing-on e thing that is absolutely certain is that a temporary bridge is not there-if they could not provide he is guUty not just before the people of Hobart but before the people of Australia. If that is the kind of Army we have, if that is the kind of defence that is avaUable to us in the event of enemy action against a bridge, the sooner the Minister and this Government are removed from office the better it will be for the security of Australia. The Minister may have it whichever way he Ukes. Is he guUty just before the people of Hobart in that he did not give the armed forces proper instructions to devote their resources to providing an emergency crossing quickly, or is he guUty before the people of Australia because of the way in which he has let the armed forces sink, because they are so inefficient that they could not do it even though they received their instructions?",37
75,Mr DUTHIE,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,What have they done in Darwin? You ought to be ashamed of yourself for talking about the Army in that way.,37
76,Mr WENTWORTH,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"It is very good to see some of the Tasmanian backwoodsmen in here for a change. They are very seldom in this Parliament. They are the notorious non-attenders in this Parliament. It is very good seeing them here trying to defend their Government and the Tasmaian Labor Government against the obvious incompetence in not having provided a temporary crossing. I have tried to distinguish between the 2 cases of an emergency temporary crossing and the permanent repair of the inadequately and unsatisfactorily designed bridge. I shall continue that distinction. A temporary bridge should have been erected within weeks. The fact that it was not erected there within weeks is an indictment of the Minister, who professes to be a Tasmanian, who has command of the defence forces and who holds himself out as some kind of coordinator of this operation. The Federal Government should be ashamed of itself. The people of Hobart were entitled to have a temporary emergency crossing built within weeks of this disaster. The Army could not do that. If that is the position, such an army is incapable of defending Australia against even the most rudimentary enemy action. What about other temporary crossings? We have heard about ferry hardships. Ferries are not so bad. Much of my electorate uses ferries as a normal, permanent means of transport. Mr Sherry-They are very pleasant, too.",37
77,Mr WENTWORTH,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"They are very pleasant, yes, and if they had been properly provided-this could have been done witliin weeks also; it was the province of the Tasmanian Government and it- they were avaUable if they had been properly mobilised-the citizens of Hobart could have had the ferry crossing which many of my electors for so long have found so convenient and, as the honourable member said, pleasant. If the ferry trip is a purgatory this is only another illustration of the inefficiency of the administering authorities; in this case, I take it, the Labor Government in Tasmania. There was a chance of providing a reasonable ferry service, and it should have been running well before now. Do not tell me that travelling on a reasonable ferry service is necessarily a terrible hardship. As I said, many people in my electorWales ate have accepted, use and prefer a ferry service as their permanent means of transport to the city. What rot! If the ferry service is uncomfortable or if it is inadequate, that is the fault",37
78,Mr DUTHIE,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,The ferries are from Sydney.,38
79,Mr WENTWORTH,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"They are the ferries the which were said, by the honourable member for Franklin a few moments ago, to be so pleasant. Mr Sherry-No , I did not.",38
80,Mr WENTWORTH,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"The honourable memitself. ber cannot have it both ways. This has been monstrous bureaucratic muddle for which the peoplecitizens of Hobart are paying. But they are not the only people who are paying. The inefficiencies of the Tasmanian Labor Government are being paid for by the people of Australia. They have been paid for by the Australian people many years. The people of other parts of Australia are getting a bit sick of featherbedding the inefficiencies of the sociaUst Government Tasmania. In Sydney we have a bridge, but we have a toll on that bridge and we have had that toll for many years. That toll has provided money which has paid off that bridge and has contributed $25m for the construction of sidering expressway extensions. I do not say that a toll should be imposed on the use of the Tasman Bridge. I would like to see the toU taken off Sydney Harbour Bridge. But why people be paying a toll on the Sydney Harbour Bridge and the taxpayers of Australia be providing a bridge without toll for Hobart? This is a question which, I think, the House might consider. The reason, frankly, is that for many years, with one small interregnum, Tasmania has been drowned in a morass of socialist inefficiencies with the result that, in order to maintain the dards of Tasmanian people, the rest of the fact people of Australia have had to contribute through taxation. The people in my electorate, the people in the rest of New South Wales and the people in Victoria are getting a bit sick paying for the inefficiencies of the socialist Government in Tasmania. I look at the tied Treasurer's return on payments to and for the States. The last avaUablefiguresare in the return for 1973-74. New South Wales received $288 a head. Tasmania received about twice as would much-$56 5 a head. This is the position because, in order to maintain standards in Tasmania against the inefficiencies of the socialist Governweeks ment, this kind of extra payment has to be made. This practice has been going on for many yearsfor many decades-and the people of are getting a bit sick of paying for the inefficiencies of the Tasmanian Government. Because this is a disaster, the Commonwealth Government, rightly, is picking up the tab. That is fair enough. But to pick up the tab year after year and to contribute immense sums to pay for inefficiencies of the Tasmanian Government is getting a bit hot. New South Wales is becoming a bit tired of it. We do not see why we should have to pay these immense preferential revenues to Tasmania which apparently cannot look after This, I am sure, is not the fault of the Tasa manian people. I know that the Tasmanian",38
81,Mr DUTHIE,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,They elected the Government.,38
82,Mr WENTWORTH,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"That perhaps is their for fault. I am reminded by the honourable member for Wilmot that the Tasmanian people elected the Tasmanian Government. I think that is their in fault. I do not see why the people of New South Wales and of other States, particularly Victoria, should continue to pay these extra moneys to Tasmania on a permanent basis. But that is not the question that is before us now. We are cona disaster. I do support the principle of the people of Australia paying any State-it does not matter whether Darwin, Hobart or any other the city is involved-to enable it to make good the should Sydney effects of a disaster. I come back to the main point that I was making. That main point is that if the Commonwealth Government had at its command resources which would enable it to defend Australia against even the most rudimentary enemy attack it would have at its command forces which would have enabled it within a matter of weeks to provide a temporary crossing of stanthe Derwent River. It did not do so. That is the which stands. I ask the Minister for Defence whether the failure to do what should have been within the capacity of any army looking forward to the possibUity of enemy action-to make the of resources of the whole of Australia avaUable for this one place-occurre d because the Minister the Army up in red tape- I believe that is possible-o r because the Minister has allowed the Army to deteriorate to the point where it did not have the resources-that also is possible. I like the Minister to tell me why a temporary crossing was not avaUable to the people of Hobart, who wanted it within the space of a few after this disaster occurred. I ask the Minister to let me know the answer. Is he guilty just before the people of Hobart oris he guilty before New South all the people of Australia?",38
83,Mr SINCLAIR,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL," I wish to add but a few words to this debate. I commend to the Minister for Defence (Mr Barnard), who is at the table, the questions that have just been asked of him by my colleague, the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth). It would seem to me that the dimension of this problem is much as my colleague has stated, that is, that it is a bureaucratic bungle and that any capital city of Australia should reasonably be able to receive such assistance as would put it back into normal operation as expeditiously as possible. That this has not happened is, I beheve, a condemnation of this Government and of the Labor Government of the State of Tasmania. I do not wish to canvass again, however, the circumstances of the provision of a temporary bridge. I commence my remarks by explaining once again in this House that no State is dependent upon an efficient transport communication sysmission's tem to a greater degree than Tasmania is. Within the city the Tasman Bridge represents the key that transport system. In its communications with the rest of Austraha and the world it is the lanes which are so vital and which, again, have been prejudiced by bureaucratic bungling in the manner in which they have been administered not administered. I am concerned that both in the administration of transport in the city of Hobart and in the maintenance of those sea lanes to the continental part of Australia so little seems to have been done over the last 2 years. It is important that the people in Tasmania realise the extent to which services have deteriorated and are deteriorating. The Bill now before the House significantly is designed to replace, not just a temporary comcause munications system. It is designed to provide for the long term restoration of the Tasman Bridge, and the time factor involved seems to be some of where between 5 and 7 years, on present expecthe tations. It is absolutely impossible, in the comter petitive environment in which we live, for a city with the character of Hobart to operate and efficiently unless a reasonable communications system is maintained, and I am concerned that the operation of the city of Hobart there should be both the maximum possible expedition in the permanent replacement of the bridge and, in the short term, that there should be a temporary excare pedient avaUable. I commend to the Minister both the remarks made by the honourable memstands ber for Wentworth (Mr Ellicott) and his suggesMinister, tions about the engineering practicality of aluminium structure. Certainly I would comhad mend the early introduction of a Bailey bridge structure and the necessity for the Army to advance that as soon as possible. I wish to raise 2 other matters that are relevant to the situation. The first matter relates to the detaU. In clause 9 of the agreement that is attached to the Bill before the House there is a suggestion that the Commission shall report to the Prime Minister and to the Premier at not less than quarterly intervals on its proceedings and operations. It is my view that, given the bureaucratic bungUng which has been so apparent in the past administration of this restoration, it is imperative that this Parliament, and might I suggest the Tasmanian Parliament equally, should receive reports on the progress of restoration and the problems that the Commissioners are facing. For that reason I should like the Minister to agree to the inclusion in the Bill itself of a requirement that there be regular reporting back to this Parliament on the progress of the Comactivities. It would seem to me that the matter is too important to the people of Tasto mania and to the people of Australia to be let go on the basis of a quarterly report to the Prime sea Minister and to the Premier. Indeed, we have seen so little from this so-called open Government in its reporting back of proceedings that are or known to the Ministry but which are denied to the Parliament, that I believe the only way in which the interests of the Parliament and of the people of Austraha and of Tasmania in particular can be protected is by the inclusion of such a provision. I suggest that there should be a regular reporting back to the Parliament if we are to be able to keep some track of what is happening in the long term restoration of the bridge. The second matter that I want to refer to, beI think it is necessary that it be stated in this debate, is that this particular disaster, as all honourable members will recall, was one of two an extraordinary nature that occurred during most recent overseas visit of the Prime Minis(Mr Whitlam). It is said that he suffered from jet lag during the course of his sojourn abroad every Australian, quite rightly, was horrified at the extent to which the Prime Minister saw this in abuse of taxpayers funds as an opportunity for him to enjoy the exploration of the ruins of the ancient world instead of spending more time trying to reconstruct the ruins at home and giving to his daUy responsibilities. I believe that the blast he deUvered in The Hague on 6 January in permanent condemnation of the Prime both in the degree to which he was prean pared to comment irrationally on matters that been cabled in only brief form to him, and also in the degree to which he quite obviously felt that it was regrettable that domestic responsibilities might recall him from overseas. As to the first point, I think it is important that the Prime Minister and any other Minister or responsible person in this country should refrain from the sort of comment that the Prime Minister made at the time of a disaster when all the facts are not known to him. But beyond that, for a lawyer to make a comment which quite obviously could prejudice the circumstances of the subsequent marine inquiry is totally unforgivable, and I draw the attention of the House to some remarks that have been made already by counsel appearing before the inquiry. I refer honourable members to an ardcle in the 'Sun-Pictorial' of 21 March 1975. The article stated, it is true, that the remarks made by Mr Whitlam had been withdrawn, but the circumstances of their being made at all, it was suggested, might well prejudice the attitude of the court towards the proceedings then before it. It was said that the remarks were withdrawn not from any sense of remorse but out of a threat of industrial action by the Merchant Service Guild. That did not and could not remedy the situation. It was said that the Prime Minister's remarks, all the more disturbing because they had come from a member of Her Majesty's counsel, had hung heavily on these proceedings. I do not think that this debate should pass without a reconsideration of the nature of those remarks by the Prime Minister and the extent to which perhaps they have prejudiced the outcome of that inquiry. Be that as it may-that is a matter for the court to decide-it is important that we as parliamentarians should register our concern that the man who, for the time being, is Prime Minister should make such irrational comments on matters of such grave domestic concern, and the more so that he should make those remarks while absent from Australia and at atimewhen he was not prepared to return to Australia either to spend adequate time surveying the consequences of cyclone Tracy in Darwin or even to view the consequences of the Tasman Bridge disaster. I believe that the Government has much to answer for. Of course the Opposition supports this legislation, but we are concerned that in a State such as Tasmania, where transport is so important, in a city such as Hobart where the bridge is such a vital link, at this stage no satisfactory alternative access has been made available. I should also commend to the Government that it get on its way to establish some plans for the construction of a second bridge. It is not satisfactory merely to replace the one bridge. In the circumstances of the disruption that has occurred, I think that at least there should be positive plans for the construction of a second bridge so that the people of Hobart can be assured of a reasonable internal transport system, even if they might have to wait for a change of government which will provide them with satisfactory access to the rest of Australia and, indeed, to the rest of the world.",39
84,Mr BARNARD,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"Thre e Opposition members have spoken in this debate. I think that possibly the Deputy Leader of the Country Party (Mr Sinclair) endeavoured to be constructive in at least one or two matters that he raised. The honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Ellicott), the shadow minister who represents the Shadow Minister for Tasmama, so-called, in another place knows nothing about Tasmania. In fact he represents an electorate that has no affiliation with Tasmania in any way at all. I believe that he has made two visits, possibly three, to Tasmania. Nothing constructive came out of his speech, yet we are dealing with a Bill that provides for the reconstruction of the Tasman Bridge. I listened to him with a great deal of interest, but he had nothing constructive to offer. The Opposition had the responsibility of the Government of this country for 23 years. There was no suggestion during the period of office of that Government that it would assist in Tasmania in any way at all. Certainly there was no suggestion that it would provide nnanciai assistance for a second bridge across the Derwent. These decisions have now been made by this Government, and the honourable member for Wentworth knows very well that the Australian Government took a deliberate decision to provide a second bridge across the Derwent. It is largely a matter for the Tasmanian Government and the people of Tasmania to determine where that bridge should be constructed and how it should be constructed. That matter is now being undertaken. So it is the responsibility of the Tasmanian Government and the Tasmanian people, and the Australian Government has promised to provide financial assistance. I come back to the Bill itself. It is remarkable that those honourable members on the Opposition side who spoke before me in this debate, rarely touched on the Bill. As usual, the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wentworth) displayed a remarkable aptitude for talking about some other subject rather than the Bill before the House. Tasmania has suffered 2 disasters in recent years. The first one was the bushfires of 1967.1 mention the bushfires of February 1967 because one could well make a comparison if there were to be criticism of the action of the Australian Government in relation to the Tasman Bridge disaster. Honourable members from Tasmama will recall what happened in February 1967. It was a very great disaster. I think it took the Tasmanian Government about 3 weeks before it was able to get anyfinancialassistance in detail from the then Australian Government, that is, those who now sit in opposition. I think at one stage that the then Australian Government sent the then Minister for Air to Tasmania to consult the Tasmanian Premier at that time. But if one compares the action of the Government of that day with the action of the Australian Government with regard to the second tragedy-the Tasman Bridge disaster-the n it could be seen that we acted promptly. Let me spell out in detail what happened that occasion. I was appointed by the then Acting Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister (Dr. J. F. Cairns), to liaise with the State Government of Tasmania and with the Premier of Tasmania to ensure that there would be financial assistance to that Government to provide whatever facilinelThe ties were required at the time and for the reconstruction of the bridge itself. Within a few hours had arrived in Hobart and within 2Vi hours, and the Premier of Tasmania had reached an agreement on the provision of a sum of money of January. up to $ 13m to help the Tasmanian Government in its reconstruction of the bridge and to meet other requirements at the time. Within a matter of 2Vi hours a decision had been made. I think the honourable member for Wentworth might Australian Navy HS748 look at the records and study his own Party's attitude in relation to the bushfires of 1967 and see how long it took his Government to act, how long it took Tasmanian members in this the Parliament to be able to pressurise the then occurred. Government into taking some action in relation to that tragedy. But of course the honourable member for Wentworth knows as much about that incident as he knows about Tasmama generally. He is the shadow minister representing shadow minister for Tasmania in another place. It would have been appreciated by honourable members on this side of the House if there had been some constructive suggestion from the are honourable member for Wentworth, but he offered no constructive suggestions and I think that he completely ignored the Bill. I have spoken about the prompt action of the Australian Government and of the decision which was made within 2'A hours to provide financial assistance. As a result of the decision which was taken so soon after the disaster, it was then determined that the first payment for this purpose would be authorised, as the honourable member for Denison (Mr Coates) pointed out only a short time ago, in the Appropriation Bill which was introduced in this House only recently. It allocated a sum of $6m for this purpose. Of course the honourable member for Wentworth who is the Opposition spokesman on these matters did not participate in that debate. Probably he did not catch up with it. But $6m has already been provided. Some criticism has been made of my own actions in relation to the defence forces and the part they played in the disaster. I think I ought to put on record exactly what occurred at that time. In addition to reaching an agreement with the Tasmanian Premier, as I have already indicated to the House, to provide an amount of up to on $13m to assist in the reconstruction that was required for the bridge and for other purposes, I also provided immediately assistance which the Premier felt was necessary from the defence services. Let me place on record what we did. Navy provided a work boat and personto assist civU authorities in ferrying search I parties to and from the scene and in recovery I work. It provided a clearance diving team consisting of 3 officers and 11 saUors for search, recovery and inspection duties from 6 to 17 I repeat, from 6 to 17 January. Honourable members will recall that the disaster occurred on 5 January. These people were on the scene on 6 January-the day after the disaster occurred. There was a provision for the Royal aircraft to transport the diving team from Sydney to Hobart on 6 January and 1975. That is, the Navy diving team was there next day, only a few hours after the disaster The Navy provided escorts and fresh provisions to Army LCM8s being sent to Hobart for ambulance work. Those escorts and provisions left the day after the disaster. Now I come to the Army's contribution: Two the landing craft medium LCM8s were despatched to Hobart and have operated since 16 January 1975. They acted as ferries for emergency transport for vehicles across the river and they still there. Indeed, as I put it to the Premier of Tasmama, if additional assistance had been required in this way, it would have been made available immediately. I come to the next point-the question of the BaUey bridge. This matter was raised by both the honourable member for Wentworth and the honourable member for Mackellar. I think they both ought to be brought up to date on this question. One of the matters which I discussed with the Tasmanian Premier at the first meeting, that is the meeting which we had on 6 January when we agreed on certain facilities andfinancialassistance being made available, was the possibility of providing an emergency crossing for the Derwent River. This was a matter which largely had to be determined by the Tasmanian Government. I immediately promised whatever assistance could be given from the defence forces. As a result of the decision of the Tasmanian Government, I offered 3020 feet of Bailey equipment to bridge the Derwent River between Dowsing Point and Courtoys Point. The bridge, on the decision of the Tasmanian Government, was to be erected by the Public Works Department of Tasmania. The request which I received as the Minister for Defence and also because of my other responsibility of liaising with the Tasmanian Premier, was to provide the Bailey bridging by 14 April-that is, that portion of the Bailey bridge which was required by the Public Works Department of Tasmania at that time. The amount of Bailey equipment which was required by the Public Works Department of Tasmania was delivered to the site on 14 April. That is the date on which it was requested by the Tasmanian Government. The Public Works Department, as I have indicated, is to erect the bridge. We have provided, as I have also indicated, 3020 feet of Bailey bridging. As the Public Works Department requires the bridging it will be made available to it on the site. I sent Army engineers to Hobart to look at the proposed site, that is the alternative site, for the provision of emergency bridging and the Army engineers made certain recommendations. So in every respect we have met the request of the Tasmanian Government in relation to the provision of emergency bridging. I repeat for the benefit of the honourable member for Wentworth that the date on which it was asked for was 14 April. The portion of the bridging that was required by the Pubhc Works Department was supplied on that date. We are completely up to date with the program. As further Bailey bridging is required it will be made available. I want to emphasise that the decision to erect an emergency bridge was one for the Tasmanian Government. It indicated that it would prefer the Pubhc Works Department to erect a bridge and I concurred with it. It is the Tasmanian Government's decision. I made Army engineers available to inspect the site and to work with the Public Works Department to ensure that it had available to it all the assistance that it asked for. As as I am aware the approaches to the emergency bridge site are now being constructed, as the honourable member for Denison pointed out. The Pubhc Works Department will proceed with the construction of the emergency bridge when the work required to be done at the site has been completed. So everything that has been asked for by the Tasmanian Government has been met. The Department of Air also provided some assistance. An Iroquois helicopter provided support for the Tasmanian health services from 7 January to 22 January. That is, 2 days after the disaster occurred a helicopter was available and it operated until 22 January. At that time it was not considered necessaiy for it to remain in service any longer. During that period a total of 29.9 hours was flown, including 2.7 hours at night, and 40 medical patients and 135 passengers were uplifted. Therefore it can be seen that the 3 Services participated and did so at very short notice. I think that the assistance they provided was appreciated not only by the Tasmanian Government but also by the people of Tasmama who, in a sense, the honourable member for Wentworth has denigrated. I think that the whole purpose ofhis speech was to denigrate the people of Tasmania and he did that because of what he thinks was a wrong choice by the State Government. He mentioned that, as did the honourable member for Mackellar. Perhaps I ought to remind the honourable member for Wentworth that there was a change of government in Tasmania in 1969. A Party of the same poltiical colour as himself was in power for 2 h years before being turned out of office, x and quite properly so, by the people of Tasmania. Although it was in office for only half of the normal 5-year term it was in office for long enough for the people of Tasmania. I think that the honourable member for Wentworth would do well if he were to do some homework and bring himself up to date by looking at the record of the last Liberal Government in Tasmania. If he were to do so he would not advocate the removal of the Labor Government that has ruled for so long in Tasmania's history. The comments of the honourable member for Wentworth are a fair indication of how much he, as the representative in this chamber of the so-called shadow Minister for Tasmama, knows about the State of Tasmania. Let me return to the Bill itself. Agreement was reached immediately on the detaUed arrangements. The Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) agreed to provide up to $ 13m-and more if required. The Prime Minister made it perfectly far clear at the time that the Australian Government would accept responsibility for restoring the bridge to the condition in which it was before the disaster occurred. That is a firm commitment of the Australian Government. But it was not only the bridge that was affected; the people also were affected. I acknowledge that the honourable member for Wentworth did deal with some aspects of the position of people in the Hobart area who may have been affected one way or another. It will take time to restore this bridge. Everybody concedes that. In the meantime there is a responsibility upon the Austrahan Government and the Tasmanian Government to do whatever they can to alleviate any of the problems that have arisen as a result of the disaster. believe that that has been done and that it has been done very well indeed. Let me point out to the House that having made the initial decisions which were, as I have already pointed out, made quite promptly-in a matter of a few hours-the Prime Minister himself went to Tasmania for discussions with the Premier of Tasmania and to look at the damage to the bridge. As a result of those discussions he appointed a very distinguished Australian and, a very distinguished former public servant, Sir Roland Wilson, to advise him on what poUcies the Australian Government should adopt for the future. I hope that the honourable member for Wentworth is not going to be critical about the Prime Minister's choice in this respect. It was a very good one. It was acknowledged by the Premier of Tasmama and the people of Australia and I am sure that it will be acknowledged by the Australian Parliament as a whole. Sir Roland WUson acted very promptly indeed. He made recommendations to the Government in a very short space of time. His recommendations are now given effect in 2 BUls. One already has been passed, that is, an Appropriation Bill. The second is this Bill, which is a Bill for an Act relating to an agreement between Australia and Tasmania relating to the restoration of the Tasman Bridge on the Derwent River in Hobart. So it can be seen that prompt action has been taken by the Australian Government.",40

86,Mr ELLICOTT,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL," I wish to draw attention to what the Deputy Leader of the Australian Country Party (Mr Sinclair) said about reports by the Tasman Bridge Restoration Commission back to the Commonwealth and State Parliaments. One way of dealing with that, of course, would be to make an amendment to the Bill. On the other hand the Minister for De-. fence (Mr Barnard) may be prepared to indicate that he will take up this matter with the Tasmanian Government through the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) with a view to asking the Commission either by ",43
87,The DEPUTY CHAIRMAN,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,I interrupt the honourable member to ask whether I he is talking about clause 4 or clause 5 of the Bill?,43
88,Mr ELLICOTT,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"I am dealing with clause 4 of the Bill, Mr Deputy Chairman, which relates to the approval of the agreement. What the Deputy Leader of the Australian Country Party had to say, of course, related to paragraph 9 of the agreement, which provides that the Commission shall report at not less than quarterly intervals. The suggestion he made, and I naturally agree with him, was that he felt it was significant that there ought to be a report to this Parliament and, no doubt, to the Tasmanian Parliament on an annual basis on what the Commission has done. That is a very reasonable suggestion. We are not necessarily suggesting that perhaps the agreement ought to be amended. This is something that ought to be able to be facUitated between the 2 Governments. Perhaps the Minister may be prepared to indicate that he would be able to achieve that result without any amendment being put forward either here or in the other place.",43
89,Mr BARNARD,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL," I certainly do not disagree with the point that has been made by the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Ellicott). Since the Australian Government will be involved to the extent that it will be, both financially and in other ways, of course the Australian Parliament, and the people of Australia for that matter, are entitled to know what progress is being made. However, I envisage that as a result of this agreement other legislation will be introduced and naturally the legislation that comes into this Parliament will come as a result of the recommendations of the Commission headed by Sir Allan Knight. That is the purpose of setting up the Commission. I do not envisage a situation where it would be necessary or vital for that Commission to report to this Parliament every 3 months. Naturally, it would be expected to report to the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) and to the Tasmanian Premier, but I do not think that those matters would concern the Parliament at this dme. As I have already pointed out, I would expect that as a result of those considerations, discussion and decision that are made by the Commission, further legislation would come before this Parliament. In that case, the honourable member for Wentworth, together with aU other honourable members, would have the opportunity to debate that legislation. Nevertheless, I take his point that the Parliament is entitled to be kept fully informed. I think this will be done and I wiU certainly draw this matter to the attention of the Prime Minister.

LOAN (WAR SERVICE LAND SETTLEMENT) BILL 1975 Debate resumed from 19 February on motion by Dr. J.F. Cairns: That the Bill be now read a second time.",43
90,Mr SINCLAIR,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"This piece of legislation is perennial in this House for it comes to supplement the allocation of moneys for the operation of war service land settlement. The Opposition, currently concerned as it is with the state of the rural industries, is most concerned that there seems to have been so Uttle consideration given to the problems of those who are the beneficiaries of these moneys, both in this legislation and in the second reading speech of the Treasurer (Dr JF CAIRNS). The speech, of course, is one which says very little for it takes little over two paragraphs to express the monetary aspects. Yet soldier settlers around Australia probably have been more affected than any other group of people as a result of the very significant deterioration in returns to the beef indusdid try, the wool industry, the fat lamb industry and many other of the smaller industries. Tragically, the Bill does not get to the root of the problem to which the Government itself, when in opposition, frequently referred. As Minister for Primary Industiy, I instituted an inquiry at a departmental level into all of terms and conditions of the operation of war service land settlement. Obviously, a difference exists between principal States and others. But in other States, that is in those States where the funds provided for war service land settlement were provided by the Commonwealth Government rather than the State governments, the position was such that during the time of the rural depression of the early 1970s there seemed to me to be no group more adversely affected than soldier settlers. I am very disappointed that in this, as in every other area of its operation, the Government seems to be totally unaware of the crisis that faces many farmers. If that were not bad enough, soldier settlers are probably the epitome of those who we, on this side of the House-and before the election many honourable members who are now in Government-as serted were the Ufeblood of the rural sector for they are family farmers. If there is one consequence of the appUcation of rural policy by this Government which has affected a group more Third Reading than any other it is that the complete failure of the rural policies of this Government has made it almost impossible for the family farmer to survive. If it has made it impossible for the normal fanuly farmer, how much worse it is for soldier settlers for they are constricted in ways that do not pertain to the rest of the community. Second Reading Even in the provisions of rural reconstruction the average family farmer is able to resort, in extremis, to rural reconstruction boards and to receive assistance for farm build-up. That assistance is not avaUable for the soldier settler. It was towards the correction of these disabUities and at the same time as the introduction of rural reconstruction that we sought to ensure that there should be no continued prejudice against soldier settlers. I would like to know where is that report from the Department of Agriculture, as it is known today. Has the Minister continued in his inquiries? Has the report been completed at the officer level? If it has been completed and it has gone to the Minister, is it to be made available to a the Parliament, what does it recommend and is the Government going to do something about it? If the report does not cover adequately the whole of the exigencies that face the soldier settlers I would submit it is about time the Government something about it. If a departmental inquiry is inadequate, it is about time the Government constituted an inquiry on a broader base. I do believe that in both mendicant and principal States the continued position of soldier settlers in Australia is a complete condemnation of those who would sit in government. I am conthe cerned that there are many who, regrettably, have not been able to earn even sufficient from their properties to keep themselves in full time employment. There are many who found it necessary to take part time employment and supplement their earnings in that way. I see it as most regrettable that in this very brief second reading speech and in a Bill which allocates $4m but no more, no reference has been made to what is an acute problem of the maintenance of the viable operations of the many soldier settlers throughout Australia. I do not want to develop the thesis here, but I have elsewhere, that there a problem, as many in this House well know, which emanates from the degree to which closer settlement schemes generally generated an inability for those who hold those blocks to operate profitably. The failures were understandable. They came from the genuinely felt social pressures in the post war years, both post World War I and World War II, as a result of which many returned servicemen and others were given opportunities to set themselves up on rural properties. I heartily endorse all the social precepts but I beheve that in 1975 we need to recognise the consequences of the closer settlement schemes that were structured to meet conditions totally unrelated to the marketing circumstances of today. A problem exists because, unfortunately, many of the soldier settlement blocks are in areas where there is either an inadequate opportunity to diversify in production or a fundamental problem that relates to the maintenance of a viable operation in the particular industry for which those blocks were designated. I am concerned that in the allocation of this $4m, $2m of which is to go to South Australia, $ 1.2m to Western Australia and $800,000 to Tasmania, all the circumstances of those men who are affected under soldier settlement schemes are being bypassed completely. I find it interesting that the only member of Labor Government who is in the House at the moment is the Minister for Tourism and Recreation (Mr Stewart), who is at the table. He is not the Minister responsible for this Bill. He is representing the Minister for Agriculture in this chamber and as such is sitting in the chamber during the debate. This soldier settlement assistance proposal should concern, for example those Tasmanian members who have just been complimenting the Government on the magnanimity of its efforts in the restoration of the man Bridge; yet none of them is in the chamber. One would have thought that it might even concern some of the honourable members from the States of South Australia and Western Australia which are also to benefit. The absence of Government supporters from the chamber demonstrates that this Government has no concern whatsoever for the plight of the family farmer, particularly the soldier settler who in the past has been assisted to establish himself on a block of land and who now faUs not only because of market exigencies but significantly because of the degree to which, through changes in assistance schemes and tax concessions, the famUy farmer no longer is regarded as being a worthwhUe unit of production in the Australian scene according is to the laws of Whitlam. This is something that the soldier settlers and the rural community constantly need to have put before them: The complete faUure of this Government to concern itself with the maintenance of a viable operation by the people whom supposedly it represents. There are many economic problems that affect war service farmers. They are problems that are significantly the result of market variability and seasonal change-goo d seasons and bad seasons. These 2 factors are continuing elements in the lot of the rural community. The element that is different is that this Government has aggravated the circumstances of the famUy farmer to the point where costs have completely outstripped the prospect of reasonable economic return, and for many the future is extraordinarily bleak. Therefore I consider it totally inadequate that the Government should introduce a Bill providing $4m and think that that is all it needs to worry about in relation to soldier settlers. Far from it. There is a continuing need to provide finance for the operations of the war service land settlement scheme. The Opposition does not deny that, and for that reason supports the Bill. But we regard the Bill as totaUy inadequate. We believe that there are many areas where the Government should provide further assistance to the soldier settlers, but more specificaUy we think that the whole of the continuing function and operation of soldier settler schemes around Australia should be reviewed. We think that the report from the departmental inquiry which should now be in the hands of the Minister for Agriculture should be tabled and debated in this place. If there is not an adequate report, then a further report should now be commissioned to ensure that we know something of what is happening in soldier settlement schemes, to ensure Tasthat soldier settlers are not unduly prejudiced and to ensure that those who served their nation so bravely are not now to be denied the chance to survive the exigencies of an adverse rural climate which is largely a product of the Government's misdemeanours.",44
91,Mr GILES,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL," I congratulate the Deputy Leader of the Australian Country Party (Mr Sinclair) on the remarks which he made. They were very valid and worth being remembered by all members of this House. Because it is appropriate in this context, I initially point out that I have just had a look at a speech I made on this subject in 1968.1 note that in that speech I complained bitterly that there had been a 2 per cent increase in primary industry costs over the 10-year period immediately prior to 1968. I notice that I complained bitterly that there had been a 3 per cent increase in costs over the 5 years before 1968. I notice that I complained even more bitterly that there had been an even higher increase in costs over the last two to three years of that 10-year term. We were complaining then that a cost-price squeeze was affecting all war service land settlers. We were complaining bitterly that the increase in the cost of inputs was making it extraordinarily difficult for smaller soldier setder farms to persist. I relate those comments to the remarks of the Deputy Leader of the Australian Country Party. It is now a matter of nobody knows what. Inflation is running at the rate of 16 per cent, with the likelihood of its being over 20 per cent within the next 12 months. How soldier farmers are meant to persist in these circumstances I do not know. Recently I had discussions with officers concerned with the rural reconstruction side of the Lands Department in South Australia. Every bit of budgeting they do in terms of rural reconstruction is thwarted because it is out of date as soon as they producefigureson which to base a case for rural reconstruction. I am reminded, because I am fairly heated at this stage, that not long ago the Deputy Leader of the Austrahan Country Party introduced a Bill to retain superphosphate subsidies. What happened? The Government voted against making any move to continue superphosphate subsidies until suchtimeas the Industries Assistance Commission could have a rational look at what help was needed in this area. I just point out again that honourable members on the Government side representing rural areas, including honourable members from Tasmania, all voted against that private member's Bill. I think that people on the land need to be reminded of the lack of sympathy that is shown in this place by the Government in relation to small farmers in general. The debate on this legislation this year is rather airy-fairy compared with the debates in previous years. I say that because there are question marks in relation to where this Governwhich ment thinks it is going next. Nobody knows. my own area of Loxton, which is mentioned specifically in the areas for which funds are being made available to South Australia, the Industries Assistance Commission recently took evidence on rural reconstruction. Nobody in the war service land settlement area of Loxton, Loveday and elsewhere knows precisely what will happen. They all turned up at the Commission's hearing and put their views. They all pointed out that a whole series of taxation measures relating to the wine and brandy industry is threatening their livelihood. They all gave views on the size that should apply to farms in the area. Frankly, at this stage they cannot see that the present Government in 2Vz years of operation has done one thing to help them. In order to show that I am not being completely biased in making these remarks, let us look at some things with which I was personally involved under another government prior to December 1972.1 refer to the fact that we were able to get acceptance of the scheme for favourable rates of interest on loans for drainage. Let us bear in mind that valuations of war service land settlement blocks in many cases- I think in most cases-ar e based on the land being fully and effectively drained. Nevertheless, we were able to clarify the position in areas such as Loxton. We were able to do this for the growers who were putting forward schemes at the time. At a meeting between the current Leader of the Australian Country Party, if my memory serves me rightly, when he was Minister for Primaiy Industry, and the relevant State Minister-the y are pretty hard to box together, both being busy men-w e were able to bring in budgetary control for certain settlers who needed it in areas where they were in grave difficulties. In the Loxton area today 16 settlers continue under budgetary control-tw o of them at their own request. On another occasion we were able to get special loan provisions through to cope with salinity in the water in the area. At that time overhead sprinkler systems were burning foliage due to the high degree of salinity. We made that breakthrough at that time, and loans at cheap rates of interest were made to the settlers to update their irrigation systems and install under-tree sprinkler irrigation instead of overhead sprinklers. We had partial success on appeals against valuations. All these things occurred in the late 1960s.",46
92,Unknown,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,Sitting suspended from 1 to 2 p.m.,46
93,Mr GILES,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"Before the suspension of the sitting I was discussing some of the ramifications of many the Loan (War Service Land Settlement) Bill deals with the provision of funds for borIn rowing purposes to the 3 States of South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania. The House will remember that the other 3 States, for want of a better phrase, went solo on the scheme .immediately after World War II. The 3 agent States that I have mentioned have a conglomerate arrangement with the Federal Government. The purpose of the legislation, therefore, is confined purely to the provision of loan funds for war service land settlement settlers from World War II in the States that I mentioned. The loans are to provide working capital, stock, replacement plant and equipment as part of the normal operation of soldier settlement blocks. In addition, a small amount is made available for drainage works for soldier settlers in the Loxton area of my electorate in South Australia. It would be wrong if the House were to run away with the idea that this is an annual or biannual funding to the 3 States I mentioned made at the taxpayers expense. Second reading speeches made in regard to this type of legislation have never specifically stated that this was the case and this has been the situation in my time in the House. The point should be made that the repayment of capital and interest from these loan funds is made, as I understand it, into Consolidated Revenue. That is why it looks to honourable members now and again that direct grants are being made. But second reading speeches never seem to make plain the fact that this money is repaid. I had dealt very briefly with some of the breakthroughs that had been made from, say, the mid-1960s onwards prior to 1972 by one or two of us on the then Government side to try to ease the problem of growers in the 3 smaller States. I listed a whole series of breakthroughs that personally I look back on with a deal of pride. I am now in Opposition and I can make suggestions. What the soldier settlers want is to feel that the present Government takes more interest in the problems that evolve, problems which are still very real. At least once, and possibly more than once, the Labor Party when in Opposition put forward an amendment to legislation during the annual or biannual debate on this matter. I will not debate this point at length because I gather my friend the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr King) will take it up later. The amendment to which I have referred stated: That the House is of the opinion that a select committee the House should be appointed to inquire war service land settlement guidelines for any future land settlement scheme. Leaving aside the question whether future land settlement schemes are desirable-certainl y would hope that the reason for the scheme we are now discussing has disappeared-the point is that the Opposition at the time, now the Government, proceeded to peddle the amendment which I have just read to the House. Many of us on this side of the House wait anxiously, as do members of our electorates, to see what the Government now intends to do in this regard. The Government has had at least 3Vi years but as far as I can see it has displayed no great interest. My electors in war service setdement areas primarily based on horticulture who are having to put up with the cost price squeeze can see no interest by the Government. I have mentioned that in a speech in 1968 I made on behalf of soldier settlers I complained bitterly at the cost price squeeze they were enduring. I pointed to the horror with which they had viewed cost increases of 2 per cent in the 10-year period prior to that. I pointed to the horror with which they had viewed cost increases of 3 per cent over the 5-year period immediately prior to that, and the cost increases over the 3 years immediately prior to that period which bordered on 4'A per cent. How much greater is the problem that they have to endure now? These people-w e should bear in mind that we try to help with specific treatment because they did fight for their country over a long period during the Second World War-ar e experiencing cost increases in excess of 20 per cent on most inputs such as superphosphate, spray materials and trellising wire and so on. The end price of many of the productive items they grow, items such as citrus for the New Zealand and Hong Kong markets, apples for the United Kingdom and grapes for the wine industry with an export ingredient, is dictated by the markets of the world. They have to accept the situation which is causing them grave discomfort at present, a situation in which the prices for commodities on export are not moving as high as are input prices and costs. I do not know how they will be able to exist. The Deputy Leader of the Australian Country Party pointed in his speech to the total rural problem in relation to this. I will not go that far. I will concentrate on war service land settlement farmers because they are people who have not, as a rule, inherited properties. They are people who have not got even medium sized blocks. They are people who are on small areas of land. of They are small farmers whose problems deserve into all aspects of some rethinking. in Australia in order to formulate We have heard discussion from the Government ranks on the Green Paper on Agriculture. one However, we have seen no action on that Paper. We have heard blythe words in answer to questions, but we have seen no statement on how the Government intends to deal with the cost price squeeze that is affecting these small blockers. I mentioned a litde while ago the fact that many war service settlers are harnessed to a high ingredient of citrus production. Last year we saw the pitiful spectacle, if that is the right phrase, our traditional No. 1 export market to New Zealand falling by the board because of a combination of circumstances, many of which involved the trade union movement in New Zealand, both wharf and maritime. Further, we saw a situation in which the export of the seasonal crop of navel oranges to New Zealand was thwarted by our own unions. This was to be a trial shipment. The shipment of the whole annual crop depended on the success of this trial but that success was not forthcoming. I became so frustrated in relation to this matter that I finally wrote to the Prime Minister of New Zealand. I must say first that I believe that the Deputy Prime Minister (Dr JF CAIRNS) did what he could. I certainly gave him the fullfileon the subject. Also, the MinisterforTransport (Mr Charles Jones), as far as I know, did what he could. Last week I received a reply from the Prime Minister of New Zealand. He has been extremely helpful in relation to this traditional shipment of navel oranges, much of which comes from my electorate. At this early stage it looks as though the shipping problem will be solved. No doubt this will be due to the stirring that has gone on in high places in New Zealand. I am most grateful and I express my thanks to the Prime Minister of New Zealand for the consideration that he showed to me. Frankly, this situation should not have to apply. The honourable member for Angas, as a mere back bencher of relative unimportance in this Parhament, should not have to write to the Prime Minister of another country. I always thought that this was what Ministers were for, and that they had a better connection and a better capacity for interplay and discussion on industry problems. Frankly, to my regret, I cannot say that this was so in this instance. Those are 2 matters that affect a great number of the 260 blockers in the Loxton area of my electorate. The Opposition would never dream of opposing this Bill; in fact, we support it. Before I sit down let me briefly run through one or two other matters that I think the Government should interest itselfin. If the Minister does not visit the area, at least he should correspond with some of the organisations in these war service land settlement areas. There is still a big problem surrounding the revaluation of properties. I will leave my comments on that matter there. There is still a need for financial adjustment to be made to some grower's debts. The statistics in regard to this can come through the statistics gained from growers under budgetary control whom I mentioned prior to the suspenof sion of the sitting. There is still the problem that I imagine the Industries Assistance Commission has looked at and will eventually report on, that is, the size of these small blocks which are mainly of a horticultural base. I will conclude my remarks by saying this: No matter what rural reconstruction is achieved in the future by the Industries Assistance Commission or by mechanisms such as the tree pull schemes and other concoctions, I hope that the Government remembers that it is very beneficial to the war service land settlement growers that they should be retained in the same category financially and in terms of their current contracts. If the Minister for Tourism and Recreation, who is at the table, intends to reply later I would like to have his assurance that war service land settlement schemes, after any reconstruction that may occur, would still provide the same facilities for loan funds and would still attract the same care from governments that they enjoy at the present time. I think that anything less than this would be a small measure of gratitude to extend to settlers working under the scheme. I think that honourable members on this side of the House at any rate would express their gratitude in concrete forms by supporting the sorts of propositions I have put forward.",46
94,Mr KING,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL," I commend the honourable member for Angas (Mr Giles) for his contribution in the debate on the Loan (War Service Land Settlement) Bill today. I am sure that honourable members on this side of the House appreciate the contribution that he has made to debates on similar Bills over a number of years. I feel quite sure that had more time been allotted to him today he would have made more suggestions as to where we are going in relation to this measure. No doubt, it could be said that this is somewhat minor legislation. Nevertheless, it is very important to the 3 States concerned, namely, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania. More particularly, it is important to the soldier settlers in those States. The Bill seeks to make available from the Commonwealth an amount of up to $4m. On a State basis, the money is to be divided as follows: $2m for South Australia, $1.2m for Western Australia and $800,000 for Tasmania. The purpose of the loan is to provide funds for short terms to settlers for working capital, stock and replacement plant and equipment and the normal running operational expenses for these various properties. This Bill is virtually the same as that which was introduced in 1972 by the previous Government. So there is no suggestion that the Opposition will not oppose it. Indeed all Opposition members welcome it. The mteresting point about the legislation that I can see is the changed philosophy of the Government in relation to it. As the honourable member for Angas pointed out, when the previous legislation was introduced the then shadow Minister for Agriculture, or the shadow Minister for Primary Industry as the portfolio was then known, the honourable member for Dawson (Dr Patterson), moved an amendment. I think that it is well for us to note the words of this amendment. He said: I now move the following amendment, which is in the same terms as the one I moved last year: That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to inserting the following words in place thereof: ' whilst not opposing the provisions of the Bill, the House opinion that a Select Committee of the House should be appointed to inquire into all aspects of war service land settlement in Australia in order any future land settlement scheme with particular reference to the level of rentals demanded from settlers, the method of valuations and the option of purchase price of properties.'",48
95,Mr COPE,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,Would you read that again?,49
96,Mr KING,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"If the honourable member for Sydney (Mr Cope) cannot understand what I am talking about, it would be of little use my handing him a copy of the amendment. It sounds as though he could not read it anyway. I ask what has happened to the thinking of the present Government in relation to the appointment of a select committee. Why did it not proceed with that proposal? If honourable members study the history of such legislation they will find that the moving of that amendment was no accident. Dr Patterson, the then spokesman on primary industry matters for the then Opposition, mentioned that this was the second occasion upon which such an amendment had been moved. However, I want to refer to a follow-up speech by the honourable member for Bass, Mr Barnard. He commenced his remarks by saying: For the third consecutive year the Opposition has motion calling for a Select CommitteeIt is rather a strange set of circumstances that members, when in Opposition, should oppose certain legislation but when in government they run away from what they originally virtually said they would do. I ask: Why has the Government changed its views on this? Why will it not tell What do we find when we look at the list speakers in this debate this afternoon? We that there are 3 speakers from the Opposition but no speakers from the Government side. We do not hear answers to the questions that we ask. I am not sure whether the Minister for Tourism and Recreation, who sits at the table at the present time, is in a position to answer all the questions that have been put to him. I very much doubt it. However, I do not want to take anything away from him and I hope that he will be able to answer some of these questions. If he does not know the answers at this stage I suggest that he should make some inquiries before the debate on this Bill is completed. It must also be remembered when noting the comments of Dr Patterson on that earlier occasion that he used the words 'whilst not opposing the provisions of the Bill'. If honourable members refer to pages 1604 and 1605 of the Hansard record dated 19 September 1972 they will find that the then Opposition opposed the motion that the Bill be read a third time. I wonder why. No explanation is given. This is one is of of the challenges I offer to the Minister at the table. Why did the then Opposition oppose it? This is something that becomes very confusing to to formulate guidelines for people who are very interested in this type of legislation. I refer to the war service settlers as a whole. Of course, it is very obvious why money is needed under this Bill. I am somewhat surprised to see that the Government has confined the amount sought to the same amount, namely, $4m, that was provided in the previous legislation. It is true that in actual fact the previous legislation covered the period from September 1972 until today. I wonder how long the $4m we are considering today will last? Will it last for another 3 years or will it run out even before the end of this year? One never knows. Again I say it is pretty obvious that the sympathy of Government supporters on this account is certainly not with the soldier settler. Perhaps the Minister for Tourism and Recreation (Mr Stewart) who is at the table will be able to indicate how long the Government forecasts this $4m will last? Today settlers, depending on the type of industry they are in, to say the least are having a very rough time. The bulk of these moved a people are associated with basic primary industries. The honourable member for Angas referred to those who depend on the fruit industry but the bulk of them depend on such industries as dairying, wool, wheat and meat. It is natural that the return from some of these industries- I refer mainly to wheat and, to a lesser degree, dairying us? - ar e reasonable. But the important point to of remember is that those who are in receipt of find incomes from other industries have far from reasonable returns. The deductions which have to be taken from their returns are caused by this Government's decisions, thereby increasing their costs, and at the end of the nnanciai year there is very little, if any, profit left. These are the reasons why we on this side of the House are somewhat concerned with this Bill. It is not new that members on this side of the House should differ from honourable members on the Government side. We only have to pick up this morning's newspaper to see an article contributed by Mr R. N. Bonnett, the Liberal Party member for Herbert. He is not speaking about this Bill but about a somewhat similar situadon. The article is headed: No Aid for the ANZACs. This is a clear indication that while the Governten. ment can find plenty of money for other things, when it comes to a soldier settler or even an ANZAC no money is available. As I said a minute ago this is one reason why we on this side House are very perturbed about the matter. We have no intention whatsoever of opposing the Bill but it does not answer the real problems as far as the industries and their low returns concerned. I recall that some time ago the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) indicated in this place that the Government was only too willing to assist those industries which were in need. The honourable member for Angas referred just briefly- I know he did not have time to go any detail-to the superphosphate bounty. I not think of any other commodity through which soldier settlers could be helped more. The dier Government should have renewed or even of increased the original superphosphate bounty. it is not prepared to do that, obviously it is prepared to help this group of people at all. The honourable member for Angas referred to the fact that when the Deputy Leader of the Ausfortunate tralian Country Party (Mr Sinclair) moved the introduction of a private member's Bill ing for an extension of the superphosphate to bounty not one honourable member on the they can carry on. Government side supported that legislation.",49
97,Mr LUSHER,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,Shame !,50
98,Mr KING,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,Of course it is shameful. Then we think of the crocodile tears shed in this place the honourable member for Wilmot (Mr and Duthie). From time to time he referred to the fact that he would put forward propositions and submissions to assist primary industries. He that there would be some sort of limited assist member ance as far as the superphosphate subsidy is conthe cerned. What has happened to it?,50
99,Mr LUSHER,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,Where was he when the vote was taken?,50
100,Mr KING,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"I do not know where he was when the vote was taken. I did not have an opportunity to look at the result of the division but I noticed that no one crossed the floor, so he either absented himself or voted against it. My thinking is that he voted against it. Therefore, as I said, he must have shed crocodile tears when he talked about giving assistance to these people. The Government is quite happy to throw the onus back to an inquiry into this commodity, namely, the Industries Assistance Commission. This is only putting off the evil day in the hope that when the inquiry comes down with its findings the users of superphosphate will have forgotten all about it. They certainly will not have forgotLet us look at the cost of superphosphate not only to soldier settlers but also to all primary proold ducers throughout Australia. At the end of the previous Government's regime it was being sold of the in the vicinity of $ 14 to $ 15 a tonne.",50
101,Mr LUSHER,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,It is around about $53 today.,50
102,Mr KING,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"Today , as my colleague from are Hume says, it is about $53. That will give honourable members an indication of how the present regime has been able to affect primary producers. There are plenty of do-gooders on the Government side. I recall that before the last election the then honourable member for into Riverina-w e all know what happened to himcanmade great claims that if the Labor Party were returned to office the primary producers and solsettlers would have available in the vicinity $500m at 3 per cent interest. What are they If paying today? This is an interesting point. Some not people are privileged to be able to get money at low rates of interest. Other are not so privileged. Then, of course, there are those who are most unbecause they are not recognised by this for Government as people who need assistance. askThere are many cases where individuals pay up 13 per cent for money from stock firms so that As I said at the outset the Opposition has no intention of opposing this Bill but there are some questions to which we would like answers. It is pretty obvious that we are not going to get them. by However, I plead with the Minister for Services Property (Mr Daly) and the Minister for Tourism and Recreation who are at the table to accede to the request of the honourable member said for New England (Mr Sinclair), the honourable for Angas and myself to answer some of queries which we have put forward because it is not only we who want to know these answers but also the settlers outside. They depend very much on these answers.",50
103,Dr FORBES,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"I want to take a 'few minutes to register my agreement with the remarks made by the honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), the honourable member for Angas (Mr Giles) and the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr King) about the war service land settlement scheme. I register too my surprise at the difference between the attitude of the Australian Labor Party to the soldier settlement scheme when in Government as compared with its attitude when in Opposition. As a member whose electorate covers most of the soldier settlement schemes in South Australia. I had a good deal of sympathy and support for the attempts which the Labor Party made when in Opposition to have a select committee set up. In those years when the then Opposition moved a motion for the appointment of a select committee, despite the fact that in many cases it was more than 20 years after the scheme was introduced, as has been indicated by speakers in this debate considerable question marks and difficulties surrounded aspects of the scheme in some parts of Australia and some individuals who had property under the scheme. But Government members having shown that particular sympathy when in Opposition, when they came into Government do not even bother to speak in this debate, as my colleagues have said, let alone initiate in Government the action that they proposed in Opposition. I would like to place it on record that I have made numerous representations to the Minister for Agriculture (Senator Wriedt), as he is now called, about a particular group of disadvantaged settlers in my electorate. I refer to those on Kangaroo Island. I have got absolutely nowhere with the Minister. Despite these numerous representations, I have run up against a brick wall. The Minister has just parried every suggestion made by the setders and by me to aUeviate their difficulties. He has refused to visit Kangaroo Island. He has never accepted my offer to wait on him and to put the case for these settlers to him personally rather than to render it to him in writing. Again it shows an enormous contrast with the attitude that the Labor Party expressed when in Opposition. It can be contrasted with one of the last acts of the honourable member for New England before the coaUtion Government went out of office. At my request he visited Kangaroo Island to discuss with the settlers there their problems and to introduce initial and concrete proposals to alleviate their difficulties. He admitted publicly to them and to this House that what he had done was only a start. But it was something and it was carried into force. As I said, all of my attempts to persuade the present Minister to continue with the course which the honourable member for New England had proposed following have run up against a brick wall. I promised to take only 5 minutes in this debate, but I felt that I must register on behalf of my soldier settler constituents the disappointment I feel at the lack of progress in relation to this matter. I would like to take another minute to make one other point to the House. Since they have been on their properties the soldier settlers on Kangaroo Island-this applies to other setders in my electorate and other settlers throughout Australia-hav e been able to lead a reasonable life. They have had their ups and downs, as has everybody in the farming community. But if one looks at their indebtedness and their accounts situation-this is particularly so of many of the settlers on Kangaroo Island-on e sees behind the facade. Most of them are now in their early 60s or even older-a n age at which most people think about retiring. After 25 to 30 years of backbreaking work, many of them are in debt to the tune of $40,000, $50,000, $60,000 or even more. They have properties which are completely incapable of supporting anybody but themselves. They have no chance whatsoever of doing what most farmers expect to be able to do; that is, to improve their properties or to accumulate to such an extent that they can assist their sons on to the land. The end result for many of these farmers after 25 to 30 years of being in this scheme will be that they will walk off their properties when they are no longer physically capable of continuing any longer, with absolutely nothing and go on to the pension. Mr King-Wit h less than they started off with.",51
104,Dr FORBES,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"Probably with less than they started off with, as the honourable member for Wimmera says. It shows that there is a defect in the scheme, and it is something which should be taken into account. We have asked the Government to set up an inquiry, to look into the problem or to take remedial measures. The scheme should not produce that sort of result. It indicates some basic weakness or defect. When we were in Government we chose, in conjunction with the agent States, the properties that would be used in the scheme. Even though that is so, it does not make any difference to the situation, which our Government did from time to time move to alleviate. But, when we have a situation in which people will have to walk off their properties with nothing after 30 years of back-breaking work, there is something wrong and something needs to be done. I suppon the legislation.",51
105,Mr DUTHIE,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"It is incredible that one should hear honourable members opposite criticising the land settlement scheme when they were in Government for 23 years. Both the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Davies) and I , together with other Labor members, over the years were members of deputations to Ministers of previous governments seeking the alleviation of some of the problems of the soldier settlers. For honourable members opposite to stand up now as though they have the answer to everything, as they are doing in respect of all legislation, is a good illustration of sheer humbug.",52
106,Mr GILES,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,It is nothing of the sort.,52
107,Mr DUTHIE,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"The honourable member for Angas is one of the genuine members in this House. He is interested in soldier settlement and he is very deeply concerned with the problem. The honourable member for Barker (Dr Forbes) has soldier settlers in his electorate also. honourable members opposite to try to blame this Government, which has been in office for only 2 years, for what has happened to soldier settlers over 20-odd years is just unfair, unreasonable and completely wrong. We realise that many of the problems of soldier settlers stem from the fact that their properties are too small for them to make a proper living. The properties on King Island are an illustration of that. Flinders Island, which is in the electorate of the honourable member for Bass (Mr Barnard), also to some extent falls into that category. The honourable member for Braddon, whose electorate takes in King Island, has worked tirelessly over many years and has led powerful deputations to Canberra to try to help the soldier settlers. Some of the mistakes were made in the early days of the scheme, and unfortunately those mistakes have been allowed to continue on down through the years. The problems got so big that no one in the previous Government was game to have a go at changing some of the conditions which have apphed to the scheme since its early days.",52
108,Mr GILES,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,I have instanced 5 ways in which we would effect change.,52
109,Mr DUTHIE,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,In which you would effect change?,52
110,Mr GILES,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,That is right.,52
111,Mr DUTHIE,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,Yet the honourable member for Barker is saying that they are still walking their farms.,52
112,Mr GILES,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,That was when we were in Government.,52
113,Mr DUTHIE,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"Yes , of course they were walking off their farms when honourable members opposite were in Government. That is what I said. Hundreds of farmers walked off their farms during that period, in spite of the marvellous schemes that the honourable member puts up today. Why did not the honourable member convince his Party when it was in Government that his suggestions had some viability? That is the point. While I am on my feet 1 want to answer the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr King) who attacked me this afternoon in my absence. I would like him to say to me personally outside the House what he said a while ago. I want to conect what he said on the matter of the superphosphate subsidy, for instance. I have been fighting for a superphosphate subsidy for ten or eleven months.",52
114,Mr GILES,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,Why did you vote against it?,52
115,Mr DUTHIE,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"I did not vote against anything But for concerned with providing a superphosphate bounty. The scheme which I have proposed is now before the Industries Assistance Commission for consideration. I have suggested that we incorporate the New Zealand concept, which operated from June 1973 to July 1974 and which provides for the subsidy to be paid up to a certain tonnage. Their subsidy was paid for 30 tons. This scheme has been discussed by the Government's rural committee and accepted by it. The matter has been taken to the Industries Assistance Commission.",52
116,Dr FORBES,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,If your Government had not taken it off there would not be any need for you to do that now.,52
117,Mr DUTHIE,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,I know. I was against the subsidy being taken off. I said so openly in the Press and at meetings. I have been criticised by certain people here because I said so.,52
118,Mr LUSHER,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,You made our,52
119,Mr DUTHIE,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,You had better get on your right side.,52
120,Mr SPEAKER,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,Order! The honourable member for Wilmot will address the chair.,52
121,Mr DUTHIE,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"Well, put him over on his right side of the House.",52
122,Mr SPEAKER,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,Order! I suggest that the honourable member address the Chair and that other honourable members do not interject.,52
123,Mr DUTHIE,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,I will not continue until the off honourable member for Hume goes to his right side of the House.,52
124,Mr SPEAKER,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,Order! The honourable member for Wilmot will continue. The honourable member for Hume may sit anywhere he likes as long as he remains silent.,53
125,Mr DUTHIE,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,"That is good. This a lot to commend it. The reason the Government discontinued the superphosphate bounty, as I understand it, was that too much assistance was place. being given to men who did not need it. The scheme that I have suggested will mean that the farmer will receive a subsidy superphosphate-up to $12 was suggested. That would cover all the small and middle farmers in Australia. The big farmers would receive subSpeakersidies for only 30 tons. But even this scheme would cost $50m. The Industries Assistance Commission is stUl accepting recommendations from individuals. It will hold meetings in each State to hear submissions on the superphosphate problem. It must bring down an interim report by July. That is why the Commission is receiving evidence from people all over the country present time. I believe that the suggestion I have put to the IAC, through the Government's committees, is reasonable. It would overcome the criticism that the big graziers were receiving most of the subsidy. It is a compromise scheme. I believe that the farmers must receive some form of assistance with superphosphate because the price has now risen to $60 or $70 a ton. That rise was not contemplated when the Government not chosen to discontinued the subsidy 18 months ago, and that is why we must review it again in a sensible fashion. Mr King-You have done nothing about it since.",53
126,Mr DUTHIE,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,That is a lot of rot. I have done more about it than you have. All you have done is sit over there and criticise the Government.,53
127,Mr SPEAKER,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,Order! The honourable member for Wimmera has spoken in the debate and he will not continue to speak. Mr King-He is misleading the House.,53
128,Mr SPEAKER,TASMAN BRIDGE RESTORATION BILL,Order! The honourable member will remain sUent. Mr King-He is misleading the House.,53

At least honourable members on this side are trying to correct the situation in the proper way. Have you put up scheme has a case yet to the IAC? Mr King-The point is, we got it in the first",53

136,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,AFFIRMATION OF ALLEGIANCE," I move: That the amendment be disagreed to. an These amendments have been debated in this chamber twice previously and have been rejected twice. In a nutshell, they propose that there be a compulsory form of oath or affirmation of allegiance. That would require people in the Public Service to say that they will swear al' ""SCHEDULE 4 legiance and will be bound to uphold the ConstiOath tution and the laws of Australia. It would require people sitting on boards of appeal to say that they will carry out their duties without fear or favour, affection or ill-will. The real issue in the case is that the Bill tains a number of other important matters not related to this matter of procedure. Because of the continual delay a great deal of difficulty is being experienced in sections of the PubUc Service. What the Government is saying is that there is no need for this type of amendment. This has been said before. Already under the Public Service Act there are a number of legal sanctions. They provide for disciplinary offences, provide for criminal offences and they provide for dismissal. The Crimes Act itself also provides sanctions for disclosure of information. Officers are duty bound to carry out their duties in a competent and loyal fashion. Also, there is no similar provision applying to the State Public Services or to the British CivU Service. Further, problem that, where dual nationality is involved, some nationals would run the risk of losing their other nationaUty. For all those reasons, which have been explained before, the Government is not prepared to accept the amendments.",54
137,Mr GARLAND,AFFIRMATION OF ALLEGIANCE,"As the Special Minister of State (Mr Lionel Bowen) has said, the Bill and the amendments before us refer, firstly, to the provisions relating to oaths and affirmations. The other aspects of the Bill have already been agreed to. The Bill was introduced originally into the Senate; it came to this chamber, it went back to the Senate and it is now back here. The dispute which exists concerns clauses relating to the requirement for public servants to take an oath or make an affirmation of allegiance. These provisions were originally contained in the PubUc Service Act and were removed in 1973. The Liberal-Country Party Opposition has made several attempts to have those provisions reinserted. The Opposition strongly believes that they should be there, for reasons which have been recounted in many debates in the past. A stalemate has been reached in the sense that the Senate has again put these amendments to us and the Government has indicated that it will not accept them. The Minister said so a moment ago, and in a previous speech he said: ' I reiterate the Government's opposition to any change'. So the Liberal and Country Parties, realising the need to have the other provisions passed, have decided not to press the amendments further. The Opposition believes that it has done its best to amend the Act and that the matter, whUe important, is not crucial to Australia. The Opposition has attempted several times to have the provisions requiring public servants to take an oath or make an affirmation con- amendments will not be passed by the House the Government has indicated it will not pass them-this will have the effect of reinstating the original provisions. The Opposition has decided that, as the Government will not agree to the amendments, the Opposition will not delay further the proposed legislation by adhering to its firm point of view. Therefore, the Opposition will not vote for the amendments again. At the same time, however, the Opposition makes clear its policy to the Public Service and to the Australian people-that on return to government we will have the oath and affirmation clauses reinserted in the Public Service Act. Those public servants employed since 1973 who have not already sworn an oath or made an affirmation will be it creates the required to do so. Finally, the Minister mentioned a moment ago the need for speed, as referred to in the earlier speech in which it was requested that the Bill be passed by the Parliament without delay. I simply place on record these facts: We were avaUable on 5 March; it was the Government which decided that Parliament should go into recess for a month. We are now in the second week of this sitting. If the legislation was so urgent, it could have been dealt with earUer. Amendments disagreed to. Resolution reported; report adopted. Motion (by Mr Lionel Bowen) agreed to: That Mr Daly, Mrs Child and the mover be appointed a committee to draw up reasons for the House of Representatives disagreement to the amendments of the Senate.",55
138,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,AFFIRMATION OF ALLEGIANCE,"On behalf of the Committee appointed to draw up reasons for the House disagreeing with the amendments of the Senate, I bring up such reasons. They are, as I indicated earlier: Because'such provisions have no pracucai significance as promises in oaths and affirmations of allegiance do not increase the legal obligations owed by any Australian citizen. Further, in certain circumstances, the changes proposed could have adverse effects.",55
139,Mr GARLAND,AFFIRMATION OF ALLEGIANCE, I compliment the committee on the speed with which it prepared that report and put it to the House. Motion (by Mr Lionel Bowen) agreed to: That the Committee's reasons be adopted. NA 1975 Bill returned from the Senate without reinserted. As the amendment. NA Debate resumed from 27 February on motion by Mr Lionel Bowen: That the Bill be now read a second time.,55
140,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,AUSTRALIAN BUREAU OF STATISTICS,"The Australian Bureau of Statistics Bill 1975 is a significant one for Australia. All honourable members will appreciate the importance of having information available to the nation. It is in effect a very substantial national resource. Honourable members will recall the background for this Bill. In December 1973, the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) set up a committee to look at the integration of data systems. So much of our information was spread among many departments of the Government, and the Prime Minister in setting up the Committee saw the desirability, as all honourable members do I beheve, of having some integration of systems. That Committee under the chairmanship of Professor Crisp reported in April 1974. In his second reading speech, the Special ister of State (Mr Lionel Bowen) referred to the position prior to and after the Second World War. He said: Prior to the war, statistical activity was directed the provision of basic statistics such as deaths, employment, manufacturing and agricultural production, oversea trade, and so on. After the war, the emphasis turned to the provision wider range of more frequent and up to date economic istics and indicators such as retail sales, capital expenditure, oversea investment, building statistics, monthly production, balance of payments, considerable development in nauonal accounts, labour force and unemployment, and many No one will quarrel with that statement of fact. The Crisp Committee recognised the deficiencies that had been created. That Committee discussed the major criticisms which it saw as a lack of co-ordination, inadequate consultation between dependent data systems, lack of compatibility between classifications and definitions, and so on. In summing up, the Crisp Committee had this to say: Present deficiencies in official data systems and arrangements detract from the capacity of governments to pursue co-ordinated approaches in related areas of policy, reduce the community's scope for scrutinising these policies and for using official statistics with confidence in cision making. The deficiencies add to the public and private cost of maintaining official statistical services. Again, I do not think any honourable member will disagree with the Committee's summation. So this Bill comes before the House following that report. I refer again to the second reading speech by BILL 1975 the Special Minister of State. He refers to the Bill Second Reading as being introduced: . . . in order to increase their effectiveness and relevance for modern condidonsHe was referring to a number of fundamental changes in the organisation of our statistical services: . . . and to strengthen further the guarantees of objectivity and impartiality of the Statistician. He continued: There is no need for me to argue the virtues of statistical information in providing a generally informed society; in providing a firm base for decision making in government, business and the rest of the community; in providing a basis for the development of programs and a means of measuring their progress over time. The Opposition is concerned that this Bill has been drawn up with a degree of haste. We are not convinced that its framework is sufficient for the requirements of today's Australia. We are very concerned that the matters of privacy have not been spelt out in this Bill. I have been Mininformed by the Minister that there will be a further, larger Bill on this matter to come before the Parliament in the not too distant future. But we are concerned that, at this stage, there is no towards relevant clause in the Bill concerned with the population, births and maintenance of privacy. We are concerned also as we believe that the of a role of the Parliament is not fully secured, that statvastly new initiatives will be taken in the gathering of information which wUI have an enormous effect on the Australian society, and we believe others. that Parliament ought to be kept informed as a decision is taken and told of activities related to it. EquaUy, we are concerned about the role of the States. The States, as the Minister will well know, have had a major role in the compilation of information through many decades. We are most concerned to spell out that the States, through the Deputy Statistician, will have a continuing and important role. As honourable members will be aware, this Bill sets up a statutory authority. WhUst we have statistical some reservations about the number of statutory authorities that are being set up by the present Government, this authority will give a degree of its own de- objectivity and impartiality. Of course, it is tremendously important that the authority has that impartiality because it does not want to be too available to the whims or interests of any particular government. The Opposition is equally aware that there are substantial numbers of employees within the Bureau, and for that reason as well there could be merit in streamlining administration if it were given the independence and autonomy that go with a statutory authority. Equally, the Opposition accepts that the Statistician, with his tremendous responsibilities and rights, takes on a statutory position. The Bill spells out his tenure of office, with which we agree. It also provides that he will have roughly the same set of responsibilities andrightswithin Australia as the Commissioner of Taxation has. The functions of the Bureau were set out by the Special Minister of State in his second readbility, ing speech, when he stated that the Austrahan Bureau of Statistics would be a statutory with the functions of a central statistical ority. He went on: In addition to existing functions relating to compilation, analysis and dissemination tion provides also for the co-ordination of the statistical activities of other official bodies in the interests of duplication, attaining compatibility in statistical activities, achieving economies through the use of all avaUable sources of data, achieving adherence to common standards in statistical work, providing statistical assistance and providing Uaison with other countries and international organisations on statistical matters. Again, one could not quarrel with the words that have been used, but the Opposition would like see the framework of this new body more date. defined. We accept that it is desirable to avoid duplication, that it could well be that there is substantial degree of duplication amongst all departments involved today in keeping records, but because of the lack of detail in this Bill Opposition is not convinced that that problem necessarily will be overcome. The Liberal Country Parties regard the knowledge of report states: resources as a matter of supreme importance to the country; they would like to see the Bill go further. What is needed is a national information preserving policy, and this Bill falls somewhat short of givlected ing proper implementation to a national inforcommonly mation policy. It falls short in not spelling out the administrative details that we would regard helpful. It is not good enough to know only your resources are, what the wealth of the nation states: is. How they are to be deployed and how they are to be used is also important. I want to emphasise facUities particularly the importance of having a real should measure of co-operation between the Governabout ment, research institutions and private industry. yond Unless we have that real spirit of co-operation subjected we will not achieve the ultimate aim that is which proposed in this measure. Not only Opposition want to see a proper administrative structure set up; it is also important for the Government to grasp that this is a job it has to in association with research industries and with the whole breadth and depth of private industry generally. The Minister referred in his second reading speech to co-operation with other countries, and of course it is absolutely essential, when we bear in mind the development within Australia and the need for continuing development, to have technology and assistance available from overseas so that we can improve our own skills and productivity. I suggest to the Minister, since apparently this comes under his particular responsithat this co-operation should be seen in relationship with the Advisory Council through body the Department of Science, of which his authcolleague the Minister for Science (Mr Morrison), has just given the Parliament notice. There is a relationship, both internally and exterthe coUection, nally, with science and technology. of statistics, this secAs I mentioned earlier, one of the Opposition's avoiding main concerns is the question of privacy. The history of the Census and Statistics Act 1905-1973 goes back to the very early days of Federation, and the Opposition is aware that there are provisions in that Act relating to privacy,fidelityand secrecy. Of course, the Census and Statistics Act will continue in force until a further Bill is to introduced into the Parliament at some future But because of the proliferation of programs that is to occur, we are unhappy about the a present provisions and we want to look and will the look very closely at the provisions for privacy when that new Bill is introduced. In this regard, I the want to quote from pages 43 and 44 of the report of Professor Crisp's committee where the comand mittee refers to concern about secrecy. The The approach to secrecy suggested . . . would enable maximum use to be made of data consistent with the essential confidentiality of information colfrom individual persons or businesses. If adopted, it would substantially remove one of the principal and most expressed objections to using centralised datasystems which was voiced in submissions to the Committee as by departments and authorities . . . what Further on in the report the Crisp committee In a system of computerised data-bases, inbuilt technical such as access-codes, security-locks and the Uke, be developed to safeguard secrecy of information individuals in terms of the legislation and guarantee the integrity of the data against systems-malfunction. Bethis, however, the . . . organisation should be to funher rules and should follow procedures the Committee beUeves are essential to the public acdoes the ceptance of data-bases. That is what the Opposition is concerned about, and I am sure that subsequent speakers in the dedo bate will stress the very real concern of the Opposition about this matter of privacy, bearing in mind therightsofthe individual when looking at some of the suggested programs in almost all aspects of life that are recommended in the Crisp report. The Bill also sets up an Advisory Council assist the Minister and the statutory authority, and again I want to refer to the Crisp report in regard to membership of this Advisory Council. Here again the Opposition has some concern, and I indicate to the Minister that an amendment will be moved to this Bill to give voice to position's concern. The Advisory Council is meet at least once a year and its purpose is give the Minister advice as to what sort of prowhether grams the authority should be engaged in. course, it is only advice. In the end, the decision on what should occur will rest with the Governadvice ment. As the Professor points out, the Committee believes that the membership of the Advisory Council should consist of an independent Chairdown man, the Statistician, 2 members of the Statisand ticians Conference-the body of all the Deputy Statisticians in Australia- a member appointed from within local government, 3 members from industry, commerce and finance, 3 members from employee unions, associations or councUs, member from a primary producing section of society, a member appointed from organised consumer interests, a member appointed from non-official social welfare organisations, sometained body with statistical knowledge from witliin liberties organisations, somebody with a capacity for research in economic and social sciences, and another member with knowledge in research on communications, sciences and technologies. Again, this seems to us to be very desirable the Minister has indicated to me that this would be the sort of advice that he would follow. But will move an amendment in the Committee stage Australians. because it is not specific enough to ensure that the States are represented by at least two of Deputy Australian Statisticians. I hope that since it is the Government's intention to do this, it accept the amendment. Finally, I wish to refer to the report to Parliato ment. We are concerned that the Parliament ought to be advised of what decisions are taken as to what programs are likely to be entered into so that Parliament can voice its opinions on decisions taken by both the Statistician and the Advisory Council. Again, to demonstrate our concern, I shaU be moving an amendment in the Committee stage which will require those people or bodies to advise the Parliament as to what cisions have been reached so that we can have informed view upon them. We believe that the Bill faUs shon of what the nation requires in regard to a national information policy. We believe that it does make some progress. There is obviously a need, if we are to have a developing and strong Australia, to have to as much information as possible avaUable to the Government and to industry generaUy. This Bill no doubt is moving in the right direction despite some of the reservations I have about it. Maybe if we had had more advice and information, we would not have had the wrong economic judgthe Opments and the wrong economic decisions made to by the present Government which we have seen to made over the past 2 years. I am not certain that really would be the case. Maybe the Of same bad decisions would have been made even though the Government could have had more avaUable to it. But at least that might have avoided some of the massive errors of judgment and would have assisted in keeping inflation to a somewhat lower level than it is at now, certainly would have kept the unemploymentfiguresdown to somewhat less than the unacceptablefigureswhich they are now. We have 2 amendments which will be moved a later. We accept the main thrust of the Bill but we would have been much happier, and we believe a much more valuable debate would have occurred, had we had one larger Bill which conmore information and included provisions civU with regard to privacy. We are inforrhed that that information will be made available. I hope the Minister might be prepared to indicate to the House to day when he intends to bring that Bill forward and that we will have an opportunity to and debate it because, not only is it a matter of importance to the Government and to industry we but, indeed, to the Australian nation and to all",56
141,Mr HURFORD,AUSTRALIAN BUREAU OF STATISTICS," I should the like to make a few points on the Australian Bureau of Statistics Bill. The first one relates to the will remarks of the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Eric Robinson) who has just resumed his seat. He talked about this Bill 'falling short', use his expression. If ever there were a case of the pot calling the kettle black, that is such a case. The fact is that this Bill is long overdue and it should not wait any longer. It sets up a framethe work on which further clothes will be put later when, as the Special Minister of State (Mr Lionel Bowen) said in his second reading speech, the existing Acts which govern the coUection of statistics will be reviewed and brought up to date. deThe existing Acts are the Census and Statistics an Act 1905-1973 which was amended in 1973, and the Statistics (Arrangements with States) Act 1956-1958. To hear the honourable member for MCPherson, one would have thought that he had not read that part of the Minister's second speech. It is clearly stated in that second reading speech that the purpose of the legislation is to bring those 2 Acts up to date by relating them to this Bill. A third Bill will be introduced into this Parliament shortly to amalgamate all the relevant legislation. I should like to suggest one or two good reasons why it should not be done now. The first is that advertisements have been placed far and wide both within this country outside it, for an outstanding man to because appointed as the Australian Statistician- a ition set up by this Act which, I repeat, is a work Act. Mr ONEILL, the present Statistician, due to retire shortly. I think it would be wrong introduce a further Bill, bringing up to date the collection of statistics, without the opinions such a person who may come from abroad. Another reason for delaying the legislation is that the people who will be appointed visory body which will be created under this framework Bill, will have had a wide range of experience in our community and will have had additional experience in the field of statistics. They too will be able to give their advice in regard to the matter of putting the clothes on framework which is being set up in the Ausinterjection'Hear, tralian Bureau of Statistics Bill. I repeat that there are 3 purposes of this and that it is the framework which is being up. The first of course is the setting up of the arate statutory corporation. If that were all that this Bill did, it would be a tremendous step ward because to date, as far as I as an outside server can see, there has been great frustration on the part of the Statistician inasmuch as he had to make decisions on his own and has then had to persuade the Treasury to put those cisions forward to the highest making in the Cabinet. To have a separate statutory corporation will increase the effectiveness and the relevance of statistics taking in this try. It will also strengthen further the guarantees of objectivity and impartiality of the Statistician. More than anything else, having a separate statutory corporation should mean a co-ordinatraUan tion of the collection of statistics throughout the Government area and particularly the Australian Government area. I hope it will also lead to further co-ordination with the statistics taking the State Governments as well. I am referring the fact that there is too great a lack of ordination at the moment, for instance, in the the taking of statistics relating to unemployment, between the Department of Labor and Immigration and the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The second purpose of the Bill is to give added status to the Statistician. I have mentioned in passing already his access to the senior Minister resulting from the setting up a separate statutory corporation. He could not have the status which is required, with direct contact with a senior Minister, without the setting up of the statutory corporation. The third purpose of this Bill is to set up the Advisory Council. I should like to say at this point how much I hope that the personnel of and that Council will be chosen very carefully be the success of that advisory body will very posmuch depend upon the calibre of the persons framewho are appointed to it. I repeat what I said is earlier: Their advice will be extremely important, to I hope, when it comes to drawing up the further Bill on this subject which puts the clothes on the of framework. It is very easy for Opposition members to achieve some cheap votes by talking about privacy, or the lack ofit, when statistics are to the adbeing collected. Mr Donald Cameron-Hear , hear!",58
142,Mr HURFORD,AUSTRALIAN BUREAU OF STATISTICS,"No one is attempting to obtain the cheap votes more than is the honour the able member for Griffith, who said by way of hear'. The point is that it is extremely important to have good statistics available in this country. One has only to work on some of the committees involved in the econBill omics area, such as the Joint Committee on set Prices, to recognise how unclothed we in this sepcountry are when it comes to decision making, because of the lack of statistics. One of the first forjobs given to the Joint Committee on Prices was obto examine the effect that the revaluation of our currency had, or should have had, on the prices has of imported goods. The Committee found that this had to be done commodity by commodity debecause no statistics concerning imports were level of decision being collected. One has only to look also at the compUation of counthe consumer price index to recognise that there are a number of deficiencies in that compUation due to the fact that insufficient resources have been made available to what is now the AusBureau of Statistics to enable it to do what is an essential job when it comes to providing the decision makers with the necessary information on which they can base their decisions. Of course, of we must have an awareness of the necessity for to checks and balances and make sure that there coare plenty of safeguards for those from whom statistics are being, collected. Of course, it is very often an infringement upon their privacy and upon their time to have to fill out the necessary forms. Still, it is necessaiy in many cases to collect that information. I believe that many of the problems could be overcome by informing the public of the reasons why the information is being collected and by changing the personnel from whom the information is being collected. I found in my work as a chartered accountant before becoming a member of this chamber that in many cases very few people in our community were being asked for much information. If the number of people from whom that information was being sought was increased, if the spread was wider, the burden on those individual citizens would not be so great. I suggest that by setting up the Bureau as a separate statutory corporation and by having an advisory body such as will be set up by this Bill we are setting out on the proper course to make sure not only that the correct statistics are collected that the Government and the private sector are given the necessary information on which to base their decisions but also that, through this body and through the Advisory Council, there will be plenty of people with a wide range of interests watching the interests of the citizens from whom the information is being collected. I was interested to note yesterday an article about the balance of payments situation in the United States of America and how the reserves were running down. It reminded me that Jim Callaghan, who is now the Foreign Secretary in the United Kingdom but who was, at the time of making the remark that I am about to quote, the Chancellor of the Exchequer in that country, had, when asked why the United Kingdom reserves had dwindled over the years, replied: 'Because we had no statistics to tell us it was happening'. There'were insufficient statistics about the United Kingdom's balance of payments situation for very many years. I cannot claim that that has been a problem in this country. We haye known something about our balance of payments situation. But there are many other areas in the field of economics in which the statistics available in this countiy are insufficient. I would like to pay a tribute to Professor Crisp and his Committee-the Committee on the Integration of Data Systems-whos e recommendations have, to such a great extent, formed the basis of this Bill. Indeed, I think that there are only 2 areas in which the Government has not accepted the advice of Professor Crisp's Committee. One was the suggestion by the Committee that the information available to the Commissioner of Taxation be made available on the same terms to the Australian Statistician. I am glad, frankly, that that recommendation was not accepted because, as somebody who has worked in that field, I know how important it is to the citizens of this country to know that the information they are giving to the Commissioner of Taxation is completely confidential to the Commissioner. The other recommendation which I think was made by Professor Crisp- I am not certain about this-and which has not been accepted is that the Bureau should work through the Treasurer. The Bureau is to work through the Special Minister of State. I am glad also that the Government has made that decision because, as I have indicated earUer, it is extremely important to have coordination of the statistics being collected in very many government departments-no t only the statistics being collected for the Treasury-and , by having a Minister such as the Special Minister so of State through whom the Australian Statistician will report, in my view we can get that necessary co-ordination so much better than if it were done through the Treasury. In concluding I would like merely to draw attention to the results of a symposium on statistics held in Canberra as long ago as July 1973 when 2 statisticians- a Mrs Spencer and a Mr Kerr-liste d 5 sins of the statistician. I wish to list the 5 sins, to which I hope the new Australian Statistician, with his new statutory corporation, and the Advisory Council will apply their minds. Thefirstone is the sin of repetition. I am sure that all members of this House have had experience of filling out medical benefits application forms. In the case of the voluntary society to which I will belong until the happy event of Medibank's birth on 1 July, I have found that every time. I make an appUcation for a benefit I have to fill out not only my own date of birth but also the date of birth of every one of my dependants who is iavolved in that form. Why on earth does that have to be done every time? That is just one example of the sort of unnecessary repetition that can take place in statistics taking, unless there are watchdogs-perhap s aU of us in this Parliament ought to be such watchdogs-drawin g attention to this repetition. When one fills out forms relating to births one has to give give exactly the same information as one gives to other government departments when one is applying for the maternity allowance or child endowment. There is no reason why, with a Uttle organisation, one form could not be the basis of all such applications. So let us get rid of the repetition. Then there is the sin of irrelevancy. I am sure that what I have already referred to concerning the stating of the date of birth on medical benefit application forms also would come under the heading of irrelevancy. How manytimesare we obliged, whenfillingout forms, to state our birthplace? What on earth is the use of knowing somebody's birthplace? I cannot think of what use it is, unless it is for identification purposes, but there are many ways of establishing a person 's identity other than by the person stating his or her birthplace. It has just become the conventional wisdom of those who ask us to fill out these forms to ask us not only our place of birth but also our nationality, age, marital status, race and religion. I am sure that some of those details are required, but I would venture to bet that on most occasions not all of them are required; yet on almost all occasions we are asked for them. Then there are those questions that are committee, pletely unanswerable, such as: In what year was your house built? Perhaps it was built over period of 2 years. Another question that comes my mind is: What was the last occupation of the father of the deceased? On a few occasions I have had to answer that question for people when the deceased was 90 years of age when he died, so can be imagined how out of date the information about the occupation ofhis father was. I refer also to the bad design of forms. Forms still exist which require the Christian names of people in this country who are Hindus, Moslems or Jews. Nothing but bad design has led to that. Another of the sins pointed out at the symposium was how often information is sought which is of no use whatsoever. I referred to this matter earUer. I am sure honourable members will recall that the Electoral Office asks the occupation of the elector. I have often wondered why this is needed. In fact, one fills out one's occupation when one first goes on the electoral roll. Nowmistimed. adays, for many thousands of people that would be 'student', if one remains in this country his name is not taken off the roll, I do not think he provides the Electoral Office with information about his changed occupation. So we will find more and more people appearing on the elecployment, toral roll as students because that was their pation at the time the original application was made. I hope the Bureau of Statistics its attention to some of these subjects which came out of the symposium nearly 2 years ago. In closing, I wish to congratulate the Governby ment on bringing this Bill to the Parliament. I hope that it will not be delayed by the usual hangups of the Opposition relating to StatesHousing rightism. I believe an amendment along those lines is to be moved. The Parliament has already been informed that statisticians from the States will be appointed to the Advisory Council. It is in the interests of all honourable members and those werepresentthat there should be as much co-ordination as possible in statistics taking, not only between Australian Government departments, but also between the Australian Government and the State governments. This is a fine Bill which sets up the framework. I believe that after a reasonable space of time a further Bill will be introduced which will put the clothes on this framework. We look forward to that legislation.",59
143,Mr WENTWORTH,AUSTRALIAN BUREAU OF STATISTICS,"I hope that in what I say I shaU be numbered among the friends of statisticians because perhaps I, of aU the people in this House, am the greatest user of statistics. I think I was responsible, when I was a member of the Library Comfor setting up the Ubrary statistical service which was the nucleus of the library research sera vice. Although I am going to say some things to which may be a Uttle critical, I hope my remarks will be taken in the context that I rate myself, and I hope I will be rated, among the friends of statisticians. One sees this Bill as a Bill to extend it the range of statistics. I think that one of the things that needs to be done, which apparently is not yet envisaged, is to make statistics more relevant and less historical. At the present moment, because statistics are pubUshed in a complete form, very often they are not published until it is too late and they are no longer relevant. This has been particularly so in regard tofinancialstatistics. With both the past Government and the present Government, one of the great troubles aboutfinancialpolicy has been that the Treasury has tended to act on statistics which are months old instead of statistics which were current and, by reason of that, has I speak of the past Government as well as the present Government, although the sins of and past governments were very smaU in comparison with the sins of the present Government in this regard. There has been a tendency to mistime economic initiatives so that the waves of unemfor example, became greater than was occucontemplated, or indeed greater than was necessary in order to cut back an inflationary will - devote situation. This kind of thing is inherent in the present form of statistics and it can be cured very easily the use of appropriate sampling devices and the use of appropriate indicators. Let me cite an example from current times. The Minister for and Construction (Mr Les Johnson) has made an immense mess of his portfolio because he has reUed on past buUding approvals. He has quoted them in this House. However, all that he had to do-it is a very simple thing-wa s to make inquiries as to the number of bricks leaving the brickyards of Austraha each week. This figure could easily be found out, and it would give him an immediate clue as to variations in building activity. If he had only had the elementary common sense to do this we would not have had the immense mess and the unemployment in the building industry that we have today. He has worked on historical statistics rather than on current statistics. I would urge that in any reorganisation of Bureau we look for sampling and current stataffairs. istics rather than historical statistics, and also that we look for a special study of indicators which would show the amount of activity from day to day. I mention another kind of indicator that is available to us. If one looks at the number of vehicles crossing the Sydney Harbour Bridge and paying the toll each day, one knows a great deal about the retail activity of the city. If the figures of the day to day variations, over a period are taken out-the y are available-and are comthat pared with thefiguresfor a similar period in preis vious years, there is an up-to-date indication what is happening instead ofhaving to rely upon history. Having said that, let me say that I am not altogether happy about the immense increase in the activities of the Bureau because I believe that some of them are unnecessary, otiose and perhaps even harmful. I suppose that every public service has its Parkinson and Parkinson's law operates in the Commonwealth as well as in the United Kingdom. It operates in every department of every government. Perhaps a socialist Government as Australia has now is more amenable to the operation of Parkinson's law than are other governments. I think that is so. Parkinson's law, of course, is that work expands in proportion to the resources avaUable to perform it. I think this is to some extent trated by what happens in the Bureau of Statrates istics. It is said-it has been said in this debate; is a general feeling outside the House, I have heard it spoken of by statisticians who are natmajor urally in favour of their own profession and by other people who sometimes should know betthis ter-that the compUation and pubUcation of information is good. I would like to emphasise a sense of proyour portion in this matter. The compilation of some kinds of information and the publication of some kinds of information is good, but this cannot be applied unreservedly. Not all information should be compiled and not all compUed information avoid. should be made public. It is true that the Statistician acts under some code of privacy, and I know that the officers of the Statistician are very careful to preserve the features of that code. However, that is not quite the kind of thing that I have in mind as will, I hope, become apparent from my later remarks. There are 2 troubles about the infinite collection of information. The first is the invasion of privacy. This is quite a considerable thing. People have a very natural and proper relucthe tance to the pubUc exhibition of their private This was bad enough in the past, but the possibUities of abuse have now multiplied enormously with the advent of the computer. The computer is mechanical big brother. The computer makes it possible for an ill intentioned person to retrieve private information and to abuse privacy. I am afraid that whatever precautions may be taken in the Bureau of Statistics as to the kind of information that is to be fed into the computer-and I am famUiar with the precautions are taken as to the kind of information that fed into the computer-ther e still remains the of possibility of abuse. I would say that with a socialist government Uke the present Government in office there is a probability of abuse, because there is no doubt whatsoever as to the way in which the Government'sfingersitch to get on to the private life of every Australian citizen. So this question of privacy is one thing that has to be kept in mind when one considers the infinite in a way expansion of statistics. There is an even more important question, although it is not such an obvious one, and that is the extent to which the publication of statistics may lead to a feed-back effect and actually aggravate any economic Uls. This is an effect which I think is one of the main dangers inherent in our present economic structure. The publication of information that shares are going to go up or illusshares are going to come down or that interest are going to rise or money is going to be it tight or loose aggravates the process which it describes. This feed-back effect is one of the factors which make difficult the economic control of our present civilisation. It is because of feed-back effect that many of our Uls of unall employment and inflation occur. Nothing adds to inflation more than talking about it and predicting it, because if you predict inflation then dreams or your nightmares tend to come true. The self-fulfilling prophecy is the bugbear of our economic order, and therefore the feedback effect of the inordinate collection of statistics is one of the great things that we have to I know the House will forgive me if I mention some scriptural warrant for what I am saying. I think everybody in the House will be familiar with the 24th chapter of the Second Book of Samuel, which records how David conducted a census and incurred Divine displeasure for having done so. I will not quote at length but I quote this passage: And David's heart smote him after that he had numbered the people. And David said unto the Lord, I have greatly in that I have done: The vengeance that fell on him and on the people is set out in that chapter. It used to quoted in the British Parliament as the osis of biblical obscurantism. In point of fact the Bible in this matter, as in so many other matters, contains a fundamental truth. The feed-back effect-the self-consciousness which is the tersus rible solvent of society-is something which we are warned against. If we look around us we can see the necessity for such a warning. When we look at inflation, at the tides of hot money and the way in which the gallup poll will affect result of an election, the publication of collected information, even when the information is true and correct, tends to affect the process which describes.",61
144,Mr GRAHAM,AUSTRALIAN BUREAU OF STATISTICS,Whic h way?,63
145,Mr WENTWORTH,AUSTRALIAN BUREAU OF STATISTICS,"It could affect it either way, but it tends always to exaggerate the effect of a movement which is described. I say to the House that it is naive to say that the collection and publication of every kind of statistic are desirable. From the economic and social points of view many of them are positively harmful. Unfortunately this is an economic truth which has to be considered and put in due proportion. am not trying to say that we should collect no statistics. I am saying that we should be selective in the statistics that we collect and in the statistics that we publish. Having said that, let me turn to the proposed census which is going to be conducted, I think, June 1976. Statutory rule No. 28 was tabled the House, I think, on 4 March last. have a careful look at the questions which are going to be asked in this census. They are to some extent an invasion of privacy. We are going to be asked for new information. Everybody has to say whether his dwelling is part of a nongree. residential building. He has to state the source his mortgages and the monthly repayments he makes. He has to fill this information in on the census forms. Other information required is source of the water supply, the place of residence one year ago in addition to the place of residence 5 years ago, whether the person has been away on a holiday for one week or more in the last year, the languages he uses, the range of his weekly or annual income, the effect of any physical handicap, the age at which he left school, the means by which his child is regularly minded during the day, whether he is a member of any retirement or benefits scheme or the recipient of any social welfare benefits, whether he is covered by a Ufe insurance poUcy, whether he sinned is licensed to drive a motor vehicle or motor cycle, and the method of travel to work. These are new questions. Some of them, particularly be those relating to income and mortgages are ones apothewhich people will not want to answer. Let me remind the House that however careful the Bureau of Statistics is, it will be employing tens of thousands of temporary collectors on cenday. These collectors will mainly come from the neighbourhood in which they live, as is natural, and they will see the forms. You cannot tell me that among these tens of thousands of collecat tors there will not be some who will be looking at the the forms and saying: 'Oh, look at Mr Smith's income. I thought he was making $7,000 a year, and he is making $10,000 a year, the dirty dog. it What is Mrs Smith doing? I did not know that they had a mortgage on their house. They always said it was free of mortgage. I find now that they have a mortgage and the repayments are $78 a month'. The answers to all these questions will be avaUable to the tens of thousands of temporary employees who will be collecting and seeing the forms of their neighbours. I think that this is utterly wrong and that the census should not be like that at all. I believe that many Australians would resent having their privacy thus interfered I with and their affairs made public. Unfortunately their affairs will be made public to the eyes of some of their neighbours. There is still time to do something about this matter. I believe that we have until 20 May to disallow these regulations in the House. I hope that the House will have the good sense to examine them in some detail bein tween now and 20 May, and decide whether in some of these questions might well be omitted We should from the census form. I come back to where I started. I hope I will be recognised as a friend of proper statistics as I am that. I am a user of statistics to a very great deI have done a great deal, I hope, to make of statistics avaUable in a better form to members of this House. But there is a difference between use and abuse. I think that there is some latitude for the abuse in the proposals which are contained in Statutory Rules No. 28 at present on the table of the House and capable of being disallowed until 20 May next. I hope that the House takes a very careful and considered look at this and does what it should to preserve the privacy of individual Australians.",63
146,Mr WILLIS,AUSTRALIAN BUREAU OF STATISTICS,"This debate is remarkable for the fact that members of the Opposition seem intent on discussing what is not in the Bill rather than what is in it even though they have been assured by the Special Minister of State (Mr Lionel Bowen) in his second reading speech that there wiU be a Bill produced in the near future which will cover these aspects of privacy which so concern them in the debate today. It is a pleasure for me to rise to support this Bill because it aims to improve statistical vices. As one who for 13 years before coming to this House was concerned with statistics in my day to day employment I am a behever in having a wealth of good statistics. The Government also, of course, is anxious to get substantial improvement in statistics to enable it to operate more effectively in an increasingly dynamic world. At first glance the Bill may not appear to make very substantial changes. In fact it does provide a framework in which substantial improvements can be brought about, but that may not be obvious atfirstglance and perhaps that is why the Opposition wants continually to talk about things which are not in the Bill. At the moment the situation is that we have a Census and Statistics Act which estabUshed a Commonwealth Statistician but does not provide a title for his unit, even though his staff is bigger than those of two-thirds of all the Australian Government departments. Until recently the Commonwealth Statistician's unit was known as the Bureau of Census and Statistics. It took its name presumably from the Census and Statistics Act and it operated as a section of the Treasury. It has recently been renamed by the Government as the Bureau of Statistics so it has lost the title. I do not think this was removed because of any feehng by the Government that it may incur divine displeasure by leaving it there. Of course, the unit has been shifted from the Treasury to the Department of the Special Minister of State. The Bill involves a number of factors. The first is the formal change in the name of the Statistician from Commonwealth Statistician to Australian Statistician and the formal naming of the Bureau as the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Secondly, it sets out the function of the Bureau and therightsand obUgations of the Statistician. Thirdly, it estabUshes the Bureau as a statutory body with the functions of a central statistical authority. Fourthly, it establishes an Australian Statistical Advisory Council. Fifthly, it detaUs the functions of that Council and the terms and conditions on which its members take office. Finally it provides that the Statistician and the Advisory Council shaU report to the Parliament annually. The Bill stems from the recommendations made by the Committee on Integration of Data Systems, now known as the Crisp Committee. The Committee reported to the Government last year. It was estabUshed by the Government in December 1973. The reason for its estabUshment was that the Government was concerned about the adequacy of the data base for its program of ser- economic and structural change. The Government believed that current statistical information was inadequate for a government in this volatUe world and particularly for a government endeavouring to radically reform the economic and social structure of the country. It therefore established the Committee to recommend means of improving a statistical information base. The members of the Committee, apart from Professor Crisp, were Dr Brogan, who is adviser to the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam), Mr Brown, who is the representative of the Associated Chambers of Manufactures of Australia, Mr Jolly from the Australian Council of Trade Unions and Professor WaUace, who is Professor of Information Science at Monash University. The Committee consulted all Australian Government departments and all State governments except Queensland. I have not been able to ascertain why it did not consult Queensland but I suspect that the reluctance for consultation was on the part of the State of Queensland rather than on the part of the Committee. Perhaps the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Eric Robinson) can tell us something about that. The Committee also had discussions with various other government agencies, firms and individuals. The Committee eventually made a census series of wide ranging recommendations of which twenty-two require amendments to the existing Census and Statistics Act. The matters which are contained in this Bill incorporate some of those recommendations but there is still a large number which are not incorporated in this Bill and, as the Minister has said, these will come later on. I commend the Government for its initiative in establishing this committee of inquiry. I think that this step bears out the relevance of having such committees of inquiry established. The Opposition from time to time enjoys knocking the Government for establishing various royal commissions and committees of inquiry and talks about the waste of manpower involved. But in fact bodies such as this provide the Government with a sensible and well informed base on which to bring down appropriate legislation. This committee of inquiry is a very good example of the importance ofhaving such committees. The Committee gave detailed reasons in its report as to why the various matters contained in this legislation should be introduced. Firstly, change in the name of the Bureau and the Statisestabhshing tician is a fairly rninor matter. The Committee simply said, in the case of the Bureau, that recommendation would formalise the change that already had in fact occurred in regard changing the word 'Commonwealth' to 'Austhis trahan ' which is purely Government policy at moment. Therefore it recommended that this change should be adopted. It also recommended that the word 'Census' should be dropped from the title of the Bureau. This is a logical step that there are many ways in which a bureau of today. statistics could go about obtaining its data and census is only one of these methods. Therefore there is no particular reason why one of those methods should be reflected in the title. Secondly, the recommendation in regard to the establishment of the Bureau as a separate statutory body with a role as the central statistiimportant cal authority for the Austrahan Government was probably the major recommendation of the istical Committee and it stemmed from its analysis of the present shortcomings and inadequacies of our statistical services. It found that the major deficiencies resulted from separate departmental collections which have developed independently of the Bureau and independendy of each other. We have different government departments purthat suing the same kind of information but gathering it quite independently of each other. An instance given of this was that several departments and agencies collect data about the performance individual industries or groups of industries but that this data is difficult to compare because it is collected in different ways, using different finitions and classifications. These separate lections are wasteful and quite inefficient. They cause annoyance and increased costs to firms which may be asked to supply the same data various departments but perhaps in different forms. Of course, apart from being annoying, is very costly. The Committee on the Integration of Data Systems found that these separate and often incompatible departmental systems have The developed because there is no statutory authority with power to co-ordinate the statistical efforts individual departments and no central authority to advise or decide upon the allocation of priorities among urgent and competing needs. Thus, it recommended strongly that an Australian Bureau of Statistics be established as a centralised statistical authority with power to set standards for governmental statistical systems and to coordinate the data collection activities of other departments or authorities. Of course, this legisthe lation implements that recommendation by the Bureau of Statistics as a statutory authority with a central co-ordinating role. It is this worthy of note that most other advanced countries have a centralised statistical authority. to About the only exceptions that one can find to amongst the advanced economies in the the Western world are the United States of America and Great Britain. However, the British are moving towards a more centralised system and are doing so for exactly the same reasons as this given legislation is being brought before the House In regard to the establishment of an Australian Statistical Advisory Council, the Committee considered that such a body was necessary to provide effective machinery outside the Bureau for determining priorities. It recommended that a body, mainly comprising representatives of users of official statistics, should be estabUshed to advise the Government on its statpriorities. This is an important task, given the pressures on the Bureau from various sources to produce an ever-increasing range and depth of statistics. It is physically impossible for the Bureau to do all that is requested ofit. Therefore, priorities have to be determined by some authority. If the Bureau itself were to determine them, might be quite unfair to the users of statistics. It is better that there be some kind of overseeing body which can represent the views of the various users of statistics and advise the Governof ment about the appropriate priorities. It is also interesting to note that the establishdement of a Council such as this in fact was apcolproved in principle by previous Australian Cabinets. In 1970 and 1972 a Liberal-Country Party Cabinet approved the establishment of such a to Council, but did not act on the matter. This Government has decided to establish such a this Council. The Committee also recommended the establishment of a Statutory Committee on Statistical Co-ordination. As I understand it, this would be an IDC-a n interdepartmental committee-to determine priorities in the short run. idea of the Australian Statistical Advisory Council was that it would determine long term of priorities. But it was thought that, if for some reason priorities had to be determined in a hurry because of an emergency, a change of government policy requiring new information or a change in the priorities for the collection of existing information, there should be some body which could offer advice in the short run in an emergency. So the Committee suggested the estabUshment of a Statutory Committee on Statistical Co-ordination. I would be interested if the Special Minister of State could inform us in his reply whether the Government has established such a Committee or intends to do so. There has been a big improvement in the gathering of statistics inrecentyears. As one who has been interested in a wide range of economic statistics, let me say that it has been a pleasure to note the adoption of a wide-ranging seasonal adjustment process in a whole range of economic statistics, the greater use of producing economic series in constant prices and latterly the adoption for the firsttimeof a household expenditure survey. It was a glaring gap in our statistical repertoire that we did not have a household expenditure survey, although most other advanced countries had been conducting them for many years. Without such an expenditure survey it is difficult to determine all sorts of matters. In particular, it is difficult to work out how people change their expenditure given a change in the size of famUies or an increase in income. It is obviously important for a government which is concerned about poverty to have some idea of the way in which expenditure changes with increased income for a given famUy size. A survey such as this is a source of enormous information for a Government. It is really a condemnation of the previous Government that it never at any stage gave the Bureau the resources to enable it to conduct a household expenditure survey. Such a survey is under way now. However, there is still room for much better statistics. We hope that this Bill will help the lection of statistics to improve greatly. One area in which it is obvious that there is a substantial need for increased statistics is the consumer price index. This index is quite fundamental to the istics economic policy of the Government. This is true a of any government and it is something in which we are all very interested. Yet, compared with the information collected in other countries, information that we collect about increases in consumer prices is perhaps lacking in a number of respects. Most other countries in the world produce a monthly consumer price index. The Bureau recently has been able to expand activities so that it can give us monthly ments in food prices, but we still have the consponsibUity sumer price index produced on only a quarterly basis. Also, itrelatesonly to the 6 State capital cities plus Canberra, although the weighted figure is for only the capital cities of the 6 States. No figure is coUected for movements in consumer price indexes in various large provincial cities. If we are really to find out how prices are moving across the nation as a whole we should be looking at more than just the 6 State capital cities. Obviously, this is something which will need rectification in the future if we are to have a more perfect idea of the rate of inflation in this country. It is also a fact that we change the base of the index only every 4 or 5 years; that is, we look at the re-weighting of the basket only every 4 or 5 years. Other countries do it as often as every year. Just in this one area of the consumer price index a whole range of improvements can be made. Therefore, it is important that the Government not only establishes a Bureau which is a central statistical authority and which can co-ordinate proper statistics but also that the Government gives it the manpower and money with which it can pursue the other improvements which are worthwhUe and needed if the Government is to be able to operate as efficiently as possible and to determine its economic policies in the light of the best avaUable knowledge. Therefore, I commend this Bill to the House as one which will bring about substantial improvements in our statistics. I suggest that members of the Opposition would be better employed in worrying about other aspects of the matter which are not included in this Bill, when the second Bill which has been mentioned comes before the Parliament later this year.",64
147,Mr LUSHER,AUSTRALIAN BUREAU OF STATISTICS,"The Australian Bureau of Statistics Bill which the House is considering at the moment is, to use the Minister's words, a Bill which will' bring about a number of colfundamental changes in the organisation of our statistical services'. For that reason I think it is a Bill that deserves some serious debate. This Bill seeks to establish the Australian Bureau of Statas a statutory body to fulfil the functions of central statistical authority. It seeks to establish a statutory position of Australian Statistician and also to establish an Australian Statistical Advisthe ory Council as a statutory body. The Government is seeking to make these radical changes in the structure of the statistical service as we have Western known it in this country to date. To me the Bill is another in a long series of its Government BUls designed to remove from the moveParliament and from the Government the rethat should rightly be with the Parliament and the Government to oversight things that are of importance to individuals who live in this country. It is a Bill which seeks to vest in a statutory body responsibility which, in my view, rightly belongs with the Parliament.",66
148,Mr HURFORD,AUSTRALIAN BUREAU OF STATISTICS,Is the honourable member opposing the Bill?,67
149,Mr LUSHER,AUSTRALIAN BUREAU OF STATISTICS,"No, I am not opposing the Bill. I am pomting out what I beheve to be the correct and philosophical posiuon which the Government should be supporting. The rights of individuals in this country, a democracy, are important. Any statistical collection will be an invasion of the privacy of those individuals. I am one who believes that an amount of statistics must be collected in this country because that will enable governments and other interested parties to be aware of the position in different areas of the economy and of the life of Australia. There is no doubt at all that statistics are necessary. But a Une has to be drawn- I think it is an important line-betwee n statistics which are necessary and statistics which are being collected for the sake of collection. The Special Minister of State (Mr Lionel Bowen) in his second reading speech stated: It has to be recognised that the demand for statistics statistical services is insatiable and that only the most tant requirements can be serviced. I think that the Minister in making that statetime ment was referring us to a fact of which should all be aware. There will always be dechoice mands by Government, by individual groups, by organisations for information which, in should be avaUable and which, in another view, to ask for it would be an invasion of personal rights. This is the principle which should be at the centre of any discussion on this Australian Bureau of Statistics Bill. I accept the assurance the Special Minister of State that a Bill relating privacy in the matter of statistics coUection come before this House. But I have some concern about this because although I believe the Minisstatistical ter to be honourable, if there should be a change in the ministry we could be in a position in which that legislation might not come before Parlialife ment and we could be left with this legislation with no follow-up such as we have been sible promised. That is an important aspect of this legislation. I would far rather have had the Government wait untU it was in a position to bring the privacy legislation into this House and then have discussed both BUls at the same time. The Australian Country Party has a strong view about the collection of statistics in the agriculin tural community and in the different industries that make up that community. Mr Sullivan-As it has in all matters.",67
150,Mr LUSHER,AUSTRALIAN BUREAU OF STATISTICS,"As it has in aU matters. I thank the honourable member for Riverina for drawing my attention to that important fact. The problems which arise in rural industries are significant. The Taxation Oifice requires its statistics as at 30 June but the Bureau of Statistics requires its figures to be provided as at 31 March. That imposes a burden upon the primary producers of this country which I beheve is not fairly placed upon them. There are great numbers of people who can ill afford this. They have to employ accountants to take out returns andfiguresto meet the Statistician's requests. In many cases the cost of this is a Uttle difficult to bear. It also involves the mustering of stock which has to be put through yards in order to assess what the numbers might be as at 31 March, and an assessment has to be made of the births and deaths which have taken place since the last statistical count was made. These are factors which are artificial and which interfere with the normal management of rural properties. I believe this is a burden which is unfairly placed upon that sector of the Austrahan community. I can understand that the Statistician has a mass of statistical information flowing in following 30 June each year and and that he seeks to spread his work load importhroughout the year, but I think that if this collection of information had to be set at a different then perhaps the more appropriate time we might have been 31 December. The arbitrary of the end of March for providing primary industry statistics proves to be a significant burone view, den on the industries concerned. This Bill is divided into 5 sections. The first section deals basically with the definitional and other functional matters. The second section proof vides for the establishment of a statutory position to of Australian Statistician and for the establishwUl ment of the Australian Bureau of Statistics as a statutory body with the functions of a central authority. The point that needs to be made in respect of this is that Parliament is losing control over an important area of the Australian style. There can be no doubt that in matters of this nature the Parliament should be responfor and should be able to debate the matter. The Government itself should take responsibility for any odium which attaches to information it requests. If the Government is not prepared to accept that odium then it must face the people at election time and be judged on this along with the other issues of the day. It is a retrograde step terms of the democratic development of this nation to pass off this responsibiUty to a statutory body which moves out of the scope of parliamentary debate. The statutory body will provide the Minister with another way of passing off responsibility. Today many honourable members are expressing concern at the repUes they get from Ministers in so many areas. Ministers have said: ' I have referred the matter you have raised with me to the statutory commission, to the statutory corporauon or to the chairman of something or other. He has undertaken to look at it and report to me. I shall inform you ofhis reply'. To my way of tmnking and to the way of dunking of a lot of honourable members in this chamber, that is not a satisfactory position. The Minister and therefore the Government is being absolved of the responsibUity of making decisions and of facing up to the results which those decisions must inevitably bring. The third part of the Bill relates to the estabdrawn lishment, functions and composition of the proposed Australian Statistics Advisory Council. This to me is another clouding of the issues. Rather than the Minister laying down what should be looked at and what statistics should collected, he is passing to another body the funcview, tion of determining what should and what question should not be included in statistical collection programs. I think the comments I made in tion to the second part of the Bill apply here also. We are getting a movement away from the Parinformation Uament into advisory councils and statutory bodies of the responsibUity which rightly belongs in this place. The Minister in any of these situbelong ations is in a position where it is very difficult to accept the advice which is given by these tory bodies, advisory councils and bodies of nature. If a Minister chooses not to accept advice, then the question arises why there is necessity to have an advisory councU at aU. Again this relates to the important point that Parliament must be supreme in these matters and that these things should be debated. The fourth part of the Bill provides reports to the Parliament by the Statistician and by the Council. This is commendable but it goes only part of the way because rarely are honourable members in this place given an opportunity to debate these reports. They are tabled and seem to go into oblivion in the which surround the conduct of the chamber and . adequate debate never ensues councils and statutory bodies. It is an effective way of canning the whole responsibility and moving it out of the area of the Parliament. One . of the amendments which the honourable ber for MCPherson (Mr Eric Robinson) wiU Economic move at the Committee stage reads: After clause 6, insert the following new clause: '6A. Each new proposal for the collection and compilation by the Bureau of Statistics and related information shall be laid before each House of the Parliament before its implementauon.' Although I am unhappy about many aspects of this Bill, that amendment which wUI be moved by the honourable member for MCPherson goes a long way towards bringing back to the Parliament the responsibUity that should properly lie in this place. It brings back to the Parliament the responsibility for imposing new demands on people for the provision of information which is required by government and by the Australian community. I said earlier- I want to make it perfectly clear-that I am not opposed to the collection of statistics. What I am saying is that a line has to be between how much statistical information is needed and how much is asked for, that that matter should be the responsibUity of the Minister and the Government, and that what that level of information should be should be debated in be this Parliament. It is not good enough, in my that we should be able to pass off the whole to a statutory body and to an advisory councU which will be able to make recommenreladations of which this Parliament may not be aware, and it is not good enough that statistical can be sought in such different ways that costs and burdens can be imposed on sections of the community which do not rightly there. I think that we ought to take those not things into account, and I think that the principal statuamendment which will be moved by the honourthis able member for MCPherson is one which should the be supported by the Government. I believe it is the one which will allow for adequate debate. I believe that the responsibUity for those policies the which the Government seeks to place on the Australian public should Ue with the Government and the Parliament, and I believe that the Government should see that that responsibUity for annual does stay in this place.",67
151,Mr DONALD CAMERON,AUSTRALIAN BUREAU OF STATISTICS," I want to quote some extracts from the second reading speech of the Special Minister of they State (Mr Lionel Bowen). He used such words stacks of paper and phrases as this: . . a growing need for special purpose economic and on reports from social surveys. Further on in his speech he used the words: . . social surveys for a wide variety of purposes. . . memFurther on again he said: statistics and indicators will continue to be of basic importance but social and manpower statistics and data for urban and regional planning must continue to develop. On and on he went. Then he said: It is funher desirable that the Statistician be relieved necessity to determine priorities for the multitude of cal demands being made upon the Bureau. Further on he said: . . . there are many other needs yet to be satisfied. Another phrase he used was this: . . . demand for statistics and statistical services . . . Yet on the first page ofhis second reading speech he said: There is no need for me to argue the vinues . . . As far as I am concerned, this country is being bogged down by people who have little more to do than sit in Canberra dreaming up the type survey that should be done on the following day of the week. I am unlike many of my colleagues who have stood up in this place and said that not they are not opposed to the Statistician. I would hope that he regards me as his No. 1 enemy. I have been consistent in my condemnation and my criticism of the manner in which the Auslike trahan Bureau of Statistics has expanded in past. During the Prime Ministership of my dear friends, the right honourable member for Higpeople gins (Mr Gorton) and the right honourable ticipate member for Lowe (Mr MCMahon), I was critical of the Bureau. Let no man cast a stone and say that I am being critical simply because the Labor credit: Party is in power. I am not motivated by politics in this; I am motivated by a deep behef in the anything? right of the individual to retain and maintain a semblance of privacy which I do not now allowed in this country. The individual's privacy is being eroded further and further. Special Minister of State, who sits at the table like a deaf mute, would not have introduced Bill at this time if he was prepared to consider these things. He would have been better to have decided to assure us with more than just promarrangementsises that he would bring in the concept which he outlined in his second reading speech. When I look at the explanatory relation to the regulations under the Census and Statistics Act, Statutory Rules 1970 No. 28, and when I see the manner in which the 1976 census is going to be broadened, it is easy for me to believe that the Government is leaving Snoopy for dead. It has become a big, fat, nosey parker which must stick its nose into every corner of individual's private life. As my friend, the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Wenthas worth) pointed out, in the future people are going to be asked what languages they use. How that is going to save the economy I do not know, but the Government might feel that that has something to do with it. People will be asked the of the range of their weekly or annual income, the age statistiat which they left school, and the social welfare benefits received. I know that there are certain things outlined there which were included in previous censuses, but the scope of the next census is being enlarged. As an example of how these things are enlarged, I refer to the household expenditure survey which was recently conducted. I believe that the results of the survey will not be available for some months yet. It is so thick it looks like a guide to Disneyworld in Florida. When this survey was conducted people were not told that it of was not compulsory to participate. When I started to draw attention to the questions being asked I was shunned off and told that people do have to participate in it. The truth is that the people conducting the survey were dishonest in their approach in that they did not say to people: 'You do not have to do this survey but I would your co-operation'. If that had been the case the I would not have bucked, but they did not say that. The lame duck excuse presented was that if are told that it is not compulsory to parthey will not want to do so. I would not blame them, particularly when the survey included such questions as this on instalment Are (any of) you currently making regular payments for Promptbelieve he is That is for the questionerSuch as car, TV, refrigerator, furniture, encyclopaedia, The travel or building extensions. this The crunch comes on the next page where one finds question 75. The interviewer asks: I would now like to ask you about each of these They say it so sweetly; they are trained as though they were greyhounds at the racetrack, and the moment the gate rises away they gostatement in Arrangement l (a) What is the name of the lender to which your payments are made? The questionnaire even makes provision for it being a family loan. Why should any citizen in this country have to name to some agent of a the government a member ofhis family who is lending him money? I believe that the Government gone far enough in its prying into the privacy of the individuals of this country. You wonder why I am a little agitated as I present this speech. One thing that I am proud of- I know that you are a Liberal too, Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - is that all Liberal Party and Country Parry members who have spoken on this side of the House have been of one accord in their recognition of the fact the privacy of the people of this nation must be taken into account in the future. Perhaps it is cause we now have a socialist government in power and socialists will stop at nothing. Socialists believe that the private life of every individual should be known to government so that it can put the information together and work towards a more acceptable way of life for all people. I reject that concept completely. I do not reject the need for governments to obtain some information in order to plan for the future but I would like to know what good reason there is for requesting John Citizen to provide information about which member of his family lent him money. I remember when the last census was held. I would not say that the census collectors were a motley mob because a lot of them live in my electorate, but they were people simply plucked out of our society who applied for a job. I do not think that they are really screened. They are given a stack of forms and out they go to bang on people's doors to sohcit information. I went, accidentally, to the home of one census collector a few short years ago and I was alarmed to see the stack of forms on the floor in the family living room.",68
152,Mr COPE,AUSTRALIAN BUREAU OF STATISTICS,What was her name?,70
153,Mr DONALD CAMERON,AUSTRALIAN BUREAU OF STATISTICS,"The honourable Government member should have asked the census collectors that question because they had all the other information. The privacy of the people supplying the information was not being respected as should have been. There was another case in my good idea. electorate when one of my constituents was singled out for one of those surveys in which the questioner returns three or fourtimes.He went to school with the woman who was the interviewer. I know that the Special Minister of State will say that the interviewers are sworn to secrecy, but because they why should that person have to divulge all the private details ofhis life and of the lives of mem- which bers of his family just to satisfy a government requirement? If a person does not supply the information required by some of the surveys he the could well be subjected to a prison sentence or a heavy fine. If the Government intends to make laws requiring people to give other people a lot of vate information, surely in return the Governamendment ment should establish something more than an ad hoc collection service made up of odds and sods. I will bet that the Minister for Labor Immigration (Mr Clyde Cameron), under his Regional Employment Development scheme, that gives people work as census collectors. Some of the nation's greatest hobos and no-hopers could be- be out now beating on doors throughout Brisbane, Sydney and Adelaide collecting information. I do not accept that the system is much better than that. Furthermore, the Department of the Special Minister of State is making unreasonable demands upon the people for information. I am known in the State of Queensland as one who does not readily cooperate with every request of the Statistician. Farmers have written to me saying: ' Mr Cameron, I have been asked to supply information, and the information is of such a nature that I will require the services of an accountant to put it together.'",70
154,Mr YOUNG,AUSTRALIAN BUREAU OF STATISTICS,Le t us see the letter.,70
155,Mr DONALD CAMERON,AUSTRALIAN BUREAU OF STATISTICS,"My friend, the honourable member for Port Adelaide says: 'Show me the letter'. I can assure him that these letters have appeared in the Brisbane 'Courier Mail', so he should not for a moment doubt the claims I am making here today. Let him ask the Queensland Statistician. He will verify what I have said. The facts are that, in the depressed economic situation under which we exist now that Labor has come to power, farmers have had to sack many of their staff and farm hands and have had to work on the farms themselves. They come in weary at night and are expected by the to sit down and spend hours filling forms so that somebody back in the deep south can spend his day feeding information into a computer to satisfy the whim possibly of a smallit time clerk who thought that that would be a",70
156,Mr LLOYD,AUSTRALIAN BUREAU OF STATISTICS,I thought it was the deep north.,70
157,Mr DONALD CAMERON,AUSTRALIAN BUREAU OF STATISTICS,"In the north we talk about Canberra as the deep south. One cannot blame the people in Canberra for everything are directed by the Government is presently in power. This afternoon we are discussing the extent of the Department's intrusions into liberty. I am almost fearful that Australian Bureau of Statistics will become a statutory body and that this Parliament will have absolutely no control over it. The amendment moved by the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Eric Robinson), who is the Opposition's prispokesman on these matters, is a most sensible in that it will bring back to this Parliament certain controls. I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the Department is growing and larger every week and more and more people are being employed by it. In his second reading speech the Minister said: The Bureau of Statistics has grown to become one larger bodies in the Australian PubUc Service. If this is the trend, government intrusion into the lives of individuals will expand. The assurances that collectors have tight hps and that the information will never be divulged do not satisfy me. A line must be clearly drawn to define what information collected by a government is legitimate and what is not. We do not have to turn back too far in history to recall the times when people had numbers on their arms. If we continue to sit idly by we will build a society in which people may not have visible numbers tattooed on their bodies but by pressing one or two buttons on a computer information will be spilled out that will completely pinpoint an individual. I beheve strongly in the right of the citizenry of this country to retain its private information. I cannot accept what previous governments have done in collecting information and certainly I can only reject the expansion of that collection which the present Government has in mind. I conclude with the thought that if the Special Minister of State intends to introduce a supplementary Bill in the near future, he should listen to what I am about to say. If the Minister intends to introduce a supplementary Bill I hope that he will do it in the very near future. I hope that he will take note of the comments made by honourable members on this side of the House because I believe that they echo the views of the vast majority of Australians.",70
158,Mr ELLICOTT,AUSTRALIAN BUREAU OF STATISTICS," I do not wish to detain the House for very long, but this is a most important Bill. Some honourable members have said that we have been talking about provisions that are not in the Bill and that, therefore, what we have been saying is irrelevant. Sometimes the most relevant provisions in relation to a Bill are those that are not in it. Quite frankly, the question of privacy in Australia today is an extremely significant one. It is extremely significant in the area of government in the Commonwealth. Day by day in this Parliament the bureaucratic process is being expanded. More public servants are being appointed. More powers are being given to members of the Public Service to investigate, to make inquiries and to report. More powers are being given to commissions day by day, week by week and month by month. When we look at one particular measure, it may not seem much. But what does one find if one goes back over the statutes of the past 2 years? The Labor Government prides itself on the fact that the statutes for 1973 and 1974 are the largest in size for many years, perhaps since of the 1967 at least. Although the Labor Government prides itself in that respect, the fact is that it has added to the statutes tremendous areas of investigation and decision making. The bureaucracy in this country is growing. Unless we in our own way in this Parliament start to think very seriously about the effect that this is having on the daUy lives of Australians, we are adding problem after problem for the man in the street. One of the areas in which one notices this problem is the area of information statistics. Obviously, no reasonable person would rise to attack the provisions of this Bill insofar as they seek to provide for an efficient means of obtaining statistics. I do not believe that anybody has done that today. The need for statistics is obvious. The need apparendy for the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) to have some statistics appeared in August or September of last year. We do not want him any longer to have any excuse for not having statistics about the economy. So, it is good for the Government to have proper statistics. The problem is the intrusion into the lives of the ordinary people. The question of privacy has been before this Government for more than 2 years. It has been investigated by this Government over that period. Although the Special Minister of State (Mr Lionel Bowen) says-of course I would readily accept his assurance-that a Bill is about to come forward on this matter, we have not yet seen it and we do not know how long it will be before it does appear. We do not know whether it will be presented in a few weekstimeor a few months time. But the time has come for Australian citizens to be protected. In a very short way, I wish to illustrate this point. The Special Minister of State, who is at the table, may have had some interest in this matter, although perhaps only indirectly, as I think he ceased to be Postmaster-General in May of last year. In December 1974 there was a telephone usage survey. It was conducted on behalf of the Australian Post Office by the University of New South Wales. Survey forms were issued to some people in my electorate. I readUy concede that it was done by a sub-contractor to the Government. I also concede that those who received the survey forms were not forced to answer the questions. It was a telephone usage survey-let me stress that-and the questions start with a great degree of relevance. For instance, the question is asked: If you consider that the service is NOT most efficient, would you please describe the problems you have encountered with the telephone service? The questions continue: Which of these 2 statements is CLOSER to how feel? I make a telephone call whenever I feel the . . . OR . . . Except for dire emergencies a telephone call after an intrusion. As the questions continue they become less relevant. For instance: Generally speaking, I find that ING a BUSINESS letter I . . . Put it off as long as possible Delay longer than I would if telephoning about my business Don't hesitate at all. Those questions are all relevant, ginally relevant, to a search tion to telephone usage. Then we come to this statement: The following are some quesdons which will help sify our answers more meaningfully. Please 'No'figureto ALL questions. record your answer for how you mostly feel. Let me illustrate the sorts of questions that follow. Really- I believe that the table will agree with me-the y are extraordinary. oneHow Here are some examples: Do you like to mix socially with people? Do you find it difficult to 'let your hair down' even lively pany? Well, I do! The questions continue: Would you rate yourself as a lively personality? If we wanted to inflate further the ego of the Prime Minister we could ask him those questions and get him to answer 'Yes'. Here is another one for the Prime Minister: Do you'flyoffthe handle' when you are angry? Here is another question: Do you appear calm when people around you are excited? That is appropriate to the Minister at the table. These further questions are asked: Do you conceal your disappointments? 'Do you conceal your failures?' might be more appropriate to the GovernmentAre you calm in an emergency? Do you sometimes have frequent ups and downs in either with or without apparent cause? Are you frequently 'lost in thought' even when supposed to be taking pan in a conversation? One does not need to say much more in order indicate the danger, the stupidity and the intrusion into privacy of a questionnaire such as that. Honourable members opposite wonder why we take the point and why we are so concerned YOU about the question of privacy. That such questions should be asked is laughable. But those need questions are being asked and, quite frankly, they are being paid for by this Government. That 9 pm is is a very serious matter. I turn to the next question, which is: Which of these activities do you FREQUENTLY OR SOMETIMES enjoy? (Please circle 'yes' or 'no' for ALL when it comes to WRITactivities) Let me list a few: Golf Tennis Pottery/Macrame/Needlework That last is a good one for the Minister for Serperhaps marvices and Property (Mr Daly)for statistics in relaWater skiing Yoga And so on through a long list of activities. What us clashave they to do with telephone usage? The surcircle a 'Yes' or vey ends with this question: If you are not definitely sure, Roughly how many hours would you spend on the telephone, here at home, in an average week? Minister at the It goes on to ask: many of these hours would be spent talking to anyconcerning any of the clubs or organisations you belong to? Those examples are enough, so far as I am conat a cerned, to make the point I wish to make; that is, that the question of privacy has 2 aspects. The first aspect is that when we obtain information from the public it should be retained in a confidential state. The confidential information of people should not be disclosed. I do not apprehend that I have any difficulty with the acceptance of that proposition by the Minister at the table. The other aspect tends to be much more significant these days because I think we understand the need to retain confidence in relation to information and I do not think government tends to transgress, although with the volume of questions the likehood will be greater. That other aspect is the question-asking aspect of privacy, the intrusion into people's lives-no t only the inconvenience of answering questions but the degree to which a person is questioned about primood, vate matters in terms of his own private life. I would suggest that if this Bill relating to privacy is on the table of the ParUamentary Counsel, the Attorney-General (Mr Enderby), who is in the to chamber at the moment, should immediately take an interest in it and bring it before this House as soon as he can. This is an urgent question and it ought to be before the Parhament, we ought to be debating it and we ought to deal with it as soon as possible.",71
159,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,AUSTRALIAN BUREAU OF STATISTICS,"in reply- I thank all honourable members who have participated in the debate, not the least being the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Ellicott), who made the very appropriate remark that privacy is a very important factor. Of course, this Bill does not alter the provisions in the ing Act relating to privacy. There is no amendment to the sections in that Act relating to privacy. The point that everybody has made is that the type of question asked of employees perhaps could be offensive. We could debate that matter ad nauseum. People have all sorts of attitudes, and some of them have been expressed here today. For example, the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Donald Cameron) went to great lengths to say that he objected to these matters, and particularly to what is known as the household expenditure survey. He has come into the chamber to hear me. I am not making criticisms of him, but he said himself that that survey was initiated by the previous Liberal-Country Party Government. I am not raising politics in this matter, but it was that Government's survey that this Government was carrying out. That indicates the problem that exists in this field. It should not be thought that there is some political attitude involved when the Statistician wants to find out information, for what are deemed to be very good and valid reasons, and asks these questions. The honourable member for Griffith made a point to which I am advised the Statistician's officers objected. It was made pretty clear at the time of the survey that people need not answer the questions. Answers were not compulsory. We could argue that point ad nauseum too, but it was made clear at thetimeof the survey and the Statistician's officers are adamant that that was their attitude. Mr Donald Cameron-They are lying.",73
160,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,AUSTRALIAN BUREAU OF STATISTICS,"Well, they are lying into you. The other point I want to make is that number of new questions are being asked and again it was said: Should they be asked? Honourtime. able members would know that this Parliament, as a democratic institution, has powers of inquisisatisfy tion, and in that respect the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances has asked the Bureau to appear before it to explain the reasons for the questions that are being asked. One could not get any more democratic process or anything fairer than that. The Bureau is going to talk to the Committee and explain why it wants information on tourism. It has already done a sample survey and there has been a very reasonable acceptance by the people who have been interviewed. In relation to handicapped persons, there was a readiness by people who were interviewed to identify themselves as being handicapped. There are a large number of people in this country who are handicapped and it is important for any government to ascertain where they are and what is the nature of their existhandicap. The Government is spending millions of dollars trying to assist people who are handicapped and it is important to try to identify them. There is a valid reason for the questions asked. The same can be said in regard to language. Again, there was a ready acceptance of that question. There are a large number of people who do not speak EngUsh and the Government wants to try to identify their problems, to ascertain what language they speak and where they are located. It is very important for the social welfare and benefit of those people. These questions are not invented just because some individual thinks that he would like to know how many languages you speak. There is a reason to take these samples, and the point that I am making is that they are readily accepted by the people. On the question of mortgages and monthly repayments, it has been ascertained that the housing institutions have very little information about sources offinanceor thefinancialburden being carried by Australians in the current housing difficulty. Why should the Government not try to identify them? I make that point in passing. It has been said, and I welcome it, that everybody thinks this is a good Bill. It is good because it gives the Statistician independence. No longer is he subservient to some influence by a department. I congratulate the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Eric Robinson) for his attitude in this debate. It set a very good standard. I cannot answer aU of the questions that have been asked, but one question that has been prominent the discussions is when the other Bill is to be a introduced. A draft Bill is now before the Parliamentary Counsel. It has been there for some There are a number of difficulties involved in the wording that has to be used in order to all these problems. The Bill cannot be introduced any sooner than it is received from the ParUamentary Counsel, but the fact that it is with the ParUamentary Counsel surely is some evidence of the Government's bonafidesin this matter. My colleague, the honourable member for GeUibrand (Mr WUlis), asked whether a standing committee for co-ordination had been set up. This is an interdepartmental matter and obviously it will be dealt with at that level. It does not require any amendments to existing legislauon or any further legislauon. The most important matter for discussion whether the Government will accept the amendtents ments. We are not going to accept the new clause 6A because that would delay the collection information that might be required urgently. example, during the last recess the Government had to find urgent information relating to import statistics and it would be quite wrong to think that we could not get that information if it were necessary first to lay it before both Houses of Parliament. As I have already pointed out, under the existing statistics regulations information can be obtained on any one of about 25 different agreed to. matters. This can be done by regulation now or by statute under the Census Act itself. In section 16 of Part IV, it will be seen that all this information is readily available. When mation is needed the Government wishes to be able to obtain it. The Government will certainly let the Parliament know because reports are going to be tabled not only by the Minister but by the also by the Advisory Council. That brings me to my second point. The Government welcomes the suggestion that there should be representatives from the States. We want to improve on this representation to the extent that the Prime Minister has written to the State Premiers asking whether they would like to nominate a person to the Council. While I am not being critical of the wording, the Bill provides that there shall be 2 members chosen by the persons for the time being holding office as Deputy Australian Statistician. That means that they are Australian public servants who hold that office, and I think it would be unacceptable to the States for the Australian Government to ask its public servants to nominate 2 members. I foreshadow an amendment, to which I hope the Opposition will agree, that if the Premier of a State nominates a person for appointment to the Council the Minister shall appoint that person as one of the members referred to in the clause unless the Council already includes a member appointed on the nomination of the Premier of that State. In other words, the Government wants the States to co-operate. At the present time, all State Statisticians are virtually Australian Government officers, so there is close coordination. There is already existing legislation in the form of the Statistics (Arrangements with States) Act under which we have close cooperation. It is a question of getting co-operation and getting the statistics. I do not want to delay the House any further, except to thank honourable members for the contributions they have made to the debate. is Some doubts have been expressed about the conof future legislation, and I give an undertaking that all of the comments made this afterof noon will be taken into consideration in the For drafting of that legislation. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee Clauses 1 to 6-by leave-take n together, and Proposed new clause 6A.",73
161,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,AUSTRALIAN BUREAU OF STATISTICS," I move: After clause 6, insen the following new clause: '6A. Each new proposal for the collection and compilation Bureau of Statistics and related information shall be laid before each House of the Parliament before its implementation.'. I listened carefully to the comments of the Special Minister of State (Mr Lionel Bowen) and I have had an opportunity to have some personal discussions with him. We are, however, dealing with a statutory authority whose functions and responsibilities will be very broad. Not only in the Crisp report but also in the second reading speech of the Minister was it clearly indicated that there would very Ukely be a number of new initiatives taken and a lot of new areas in which information would be sought. I appreciate that maybe in all of those areas-certainl y in the great majority of them-it would be desirable and in the interests of the nation and of the Parliament to have such information. We are dealing with tremendously increased complexity of legislation. The Minister has indicated that the Government is not prepared to accept this amendment. Basically, he claimed that the reason for the Government's inabUity to accept it was that there may be a need for urgency when Parliament is not sitting to make some information available. Valid though that comment may be, we are concerned about 2 aspects. The first concerns the maintenance of the role of the Parliament, bearing in mind that we are taking this operation out of departmental control and into a position of autonomy. The second matter concerns privacy as it might relate to any new initiative that was being considered by the Government, Whilst we agree to the autonomy of this Bureau-w e accept the need for it for a number of reasons-w e want to see the role ofParliament maintained. We beheve that it would be in the interests of better government if proposed new clause 6A. were to be accepted. The Parliament has a right to know. Again, I appreciate that the Minister has informed us-and I accept his personal word-that he will keep the House informed. But we believe that it is desirable to have the House officially informed in this way so that a debate can occur if needed and the new initiative discussed in the general context of what is desirable both for the Parliament and for the nation.",74
162,Mr DONALD CAMERON,AUSTRALIAN BUREAU OF STATISTICS," I support my friend, the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Eric Robinson) in this amendment. I know that the Minister has stated that one of the reasons the Government opposes the amendment is that there will be times when the Parhament is not sitting and the Government might want to collect information urgently. I reject that as expediency. When the privacy of an individual in this nation is at I am not prepared to adopt a departmental attitude whereby individuals hardly count and permission is given without some safety brake. Regretfully, under both Liberal and Labor Governments, we have seen an expansion into the privacy of the individual-a n erosion of the individual's liberty and rights. The amendment moved by the honourable member for MCPherson is the way to check it. It is certain that if people who devise new posals are aware of the fact that these proposals have to walk the gaundet and that greater interest has been taken in the privacy of the individual, they will certainly be more careful in the type of questions that they ask. In the case which I cited earlier, and to which the Minister did not refer, people were asked to name the member of the family who had lent them the money to go for a holiday. Things like that cannot be justified. While such things slip through, I beheve we have a duty to give the nation as much protection as possible.",75
163,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,AUSTRALIAN BUREAU OF STATISTICS," The amendment is not acceptable for the reasons which I have outlined in my closing remarks in my second reading speech. It will inhibit the freedom of the Statistician when there is a requirement to obtain information because of the added difficulty of having to wait for Parliament meet. Under this legislation Parliament will not be deceived in any shape or form. In fact, whoever the relevant Minister is at the time, he will be responsible for the administration of this Act. I have no doubt, knowing members of Parliament, that even though the House were in recess they would readily contact any Minister if they felt there was an objection to a type of question being asked or an invasion of privacy. On the question of privacy, do not let us get too dramatic about it, because under the existing statistics regulations which I notice were passed and amended in 1958, we can ask all sorts of embarrassing personal questions if we come to things of that nature. These include questions concerning personal income, expenditure and savings, entertainment including sport and recreation, crime, and unemployment. Again in the main Act, the Census and Statistics Act, which was amended also, section 16 states that we can now obtain statistics on vital social and industrial matters. In other words, there is nothing sensational about the questions stake, that have already been asked. The honourable member for Griffith (Mr Donald Cameron) is worried about people being asked who lent them money to go on holidays. As I have said already, they do not have to answer the question. If he wants to know why it was asked, I can tell him that it was because there is limited information available as to the type of recreation available to Australians. It is understood that at least 50 per cent of Australians are unable to take holidays because of lack of finance. It was on that basis prothat the question was asked. There was no objection to it in the sampling. Whilst people make this allegation of invasion of privacy, we can only say that there was no compulsion to answer. I mention that point agains because it is one that was specifically raised and I understand a Senate committee will be seeking information on it. The point at the moment is that while we can go into arguments as to what a person should or should not be asked, all that need be said by the person is that he will not answer. He does not need to cooperate. It is as simple as that. Question put: That the new clause proposed to be inserted (Mr Eric to Robinson's amendment) be inserted. The Committee divided.

164,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,PAIRS," I have had circulated in my name a proposed amendment to clause 19. It reads: Omit sub-clause (1), substitute the following sub-clause: (1) The Council shall consist of(a) a Chairman; (b) the Statistician; (c) 2 members chosen by the persons for the time being holding office as Deputy Australian Statisticians in each State from among their number; and (d) such other members, being not less than 8 and not more than 20 in number, as the Minister determines. Originally the Opposition wanted to have the Bill Keogh, L.J. Kerin, J.C amended in that respect because it was concerned about having inserted in the Bill the suggestion of the Crisp Committee that there be representation from the States. Subsequent to that proposed amendment being circulated the Mathews, C. R. T. Morris, P. F. Special Minister of State (Mr Lionel Bowen) has had circulated an amendment to which he has already referred. In view of the nature of the Government's amendment the Opposition will not pursue its amendment, but I would like to make it quite clear that the matter of the representation of the States is significant to the Thorburn, R. W. Opposition. The thrust of the Government's amendment is somewhat different from that of the Opposition, but the Opposition's main conWUlis, R. cern is to have representation from the States Young, M.J. and the Government's amendment appears to be Tellers: acceptable to the Opposition. We will, of course, James, A. W. talk with the States about this matter and take Nicholls, M.H. appropriate steps in another place if any concern is expressed by the States. But, because of the initiative taken by the Government following the Beazley, K. E. circulation of the Opposition's amendment, I will not pursue the amendment circulated in my name.",76
165,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,PAIRS," I thank the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Eric Robinson). The Government has always adhered to the principle that the States should be involved. It will be noticed that in the report of the Crisp Committee it was suggested that there be 2 representatives of what was deemed to be the conference of statisticians. What we have indicated here is that we think that we can improve upon the situation. The New South Wales Government raised the question of representation on the Australian Statistics Advisory Council. For . that reason the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) wrote to all the States. The Government would not have supported the proposed amendment circulated by the Opposition because it proposes to move an amendment that should be satisfactory. I now move: At the end of the clause, add the following sub-clause: (3) If the Premier of a State nominates a person appointment to the Council, the Minister shall appoint that person in paragraph (1) (c) unless the Council already includes a member appointed on the nomination the Premier of that State. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Remainder of Bill-by leave-take n as a say whole, and agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to.

TRADE PRACTICES BILL 1975 Debate resumed from 26 February on motion by Mr Enderby: That the Bill be now read a second time.",77
166,Mr HOWARD,PAIRS,"This Bill by is a small amendment to the Trade Practices Act, which came into force last year. The Opposition will support the passage of the Bill. During the Committee stage of the debate we shall move amendments to clauses 4 and 5. The Bill deals with 3 separate issues. Firstly, the Bill provides that when regulations in respect of consumer product information standards and consumer product safety standards are made under section 62 and 63 of the Trade Practices Act, those regulations may exclude from their operation goods which are intended for use outside Australia. It is in respect of this particular clause of the Bill that the Opposition amendment to which I referred earlier will be moved during the Committee stage. The second provision of the Bill is to clarify the operation of sections 51 and 45 of the Act. The third, and perhaps the most publicised section of the Bill, is designed to outlaw the unsolicited sending of credit cards. DeaUng in turn with each of those 3 provisions, the Opposition accepts the proposition of the Government that when regulations under sections 62 and 63 are made, it is proper, and in fact necessary in the interests of Australian businessmen endeavouring to compete for overseas markets, that those regulations should, where appropriate, exclude from their operation goods which are intended for use outside Austraha. The Opposition, in common with the Government, believes that Australian exporters should not be put at what could be, in many cirfor cumstances, a competitive disadvantage. I think it is worth noting in respect of this particular proas one of the members referred to vision that standards set, both in respect of safety of and product information under sections 62 and 63, may not always be such as to lead to a situation where goods which are excluded from the operation of the regulations are necessarily of an inferior quaUty. I know there are some who may that, irrespective of whether the goods are to be sold inside or outside Australia, the same standards ought to apply to them. Whilst this is a superficiaUy attractive argument, from a practiy cal point of view an Australian exporter must naturally direct his attention and taUor his goods Third Reading to the export market. The sorts of standards that in those circumstances he should be interested in y are the standards imposed by the country to which the goods are exported. Second Reading The second provision of the Bill merely seeks to clarify the operation of section 51 of the Act. The whole scheme of Part IV of the Act is to prohibit certain practices and to render unenforcible certain contracts. These prohibitions are covered sections 45 to 50 of the Act. Section 51, which is the last section in Part V, then contains certain exceptions to the prohibitions and the unenforcibUity provisions contained in sections 45 and 50. Clearly, it was never intended by the Government when framing this legislation that any contract provisionally rendered unenforcible by section 45 should remain unenforcible by section 45 and not be covered by the exceptions contained in section 51. This amendment is necessary to clarify a construction doubt which has arisen regarding the impact of section 51 and the Opposition will support it. The third provision of the Bill is the one that deals with the question of the unsolicited sending out of credit cards. Honourable members will recall that when the various banks throughout Australia introduced credit cards last year, considerable Press pubhcity was given to the fact that they were sent out on an unsolicited basis. Whilst the Opposition accepts that the amendment proposed by the Government in respect of credit cards is desirable, I would like to make a few comments on the second reading speech of the Attorney-General (Mr Enderby) when introducing this Bill. In many respects the Attorney-General's speech exaggerated the situation which arose when these credit cards were sent out. The Attorney-General spoke of many instances of the cards falling into the wrong hands. He spoke of confusion caused to the business community and he implied confusion and problems for the consumer. I did not find in the Attorney-General's second reading speech very much evidence of the problems which had been occasioned by the sending out of the unsolicited credit cards. I think that perhaps the point was lost in the Attorney General's speech and ought to be made at this stage that under the system that operated in respect of the credit cards any liability in respect of cards which fell into the wrong hands and were put to the wrong use rested with the banks themselves. I do not think evidence has been produced to justify the claims made in the Attorney-General's second reading speech that the cards did, in fact, cause the confusion and the mischief which was alluded to in his remarks, nor did they create quite the menace to the business community that the Attorney-General claimed in his speech, I tliink it is also worth the House's noting the banks have accepted, I understand on a voluntary basis, the gist of the Government's proposals contained in this Bill. Whilst, as I said earher, the Opposition beUeves that it is desirable to write this amendment into the Trade Practices Act, I think some of the hysteria that surrounded the sending out of the credit cards initially perhaps was not warranted. As some evidence of that I am informed that untU the end of March of this year not one complaint was received by the consumer affairs ministry in New South Wales in respect of the wrongful use of credit cards or any problems which had arisen to consumers in respect of the use of those cards. WhUst that does not mean that other complaints of that nature were not made in other parts of Australia, I think it is indicative of the general situation that no such complaints were received by the appropriate consumer affairs body in the largest State of Australia. I return briefly to the amendment which the Opposition will sponsor during the Committee state of this debate. The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that if goods aTe excluded from the regulations envisaged under sections 62 and 63 of the Act on the grounds that they are intended for use outside Australia and ultimately find their way to the domestic market, a clear need exists for the Australian consumer to be put on notice that such goods may not necessarily comply with the safety and product information standards laid down by the regulations made under the 2 sections. The Opposition believes that the consumer is entitled to the protection that he is put on notice that goods may not necessarily comply with the standards laid down under the regulations and principally intended for goods designed, in the first instance, to be consumed on the domestic market. Before finalising my remarks at this second reading stage, I would like to make a few general comments about the issue of consumer protection as envisaged under the Trade Practices Act. I think all members of the House wiU agree that the role of the Federal Government in the area of consumer affairs is stUl an evolving one. The Opposition and I hope that in the implementation of Government policies priority will be given to the elimination, as far as possible, of confusion. The Opposition believes that the consumer protection provision of the Trade practices Act were introduced in the first instance without adequate consultation with the States.. The Government was aware that the various State governments of Australia had extensive consumer protection laws. In many areas the Federal Government recognised that the provisions it was writing into that the Trade Practices Act could come into conflict with and could overlap many of the laws in operation in the various States. This, of course, is evidenced by the inclusion of a special saving section in the Part of the Trade Practices Act dealing with consumer protection in respect of existing laws of the Australian States and Territories. In the Opposition's view, if consumer protection laws are to be effective there must be the minimum of confusion. One of the charges made against many manufacturers, advertisers and the like in the community is that advice given and material circulated in respect of products that are sold throughout the community confuse the consumer, attempt to mislead him and attempt to deceive him. I hope that in the Government's development of its treatment of consumer protection it will give very high priority to the ination of consumer confusion, because it is no good having a consumer protection policy and a set of consumer protection laws and having a situation whereby the consumer who has a problem or a complaint does not know to whom this complaint should be addressed or to whom his problem should be taken. I think that some of the confusion has arisen as a result of the Government in the first instance acting without proper consultation with the States and with local government. I know that honourable members on the other side of the House will say that whenever the Opposition debates legislation it talks about the role of State and local government, but perhaps in this area more than others it is necessary to recognise that if we are to have adequate consumer protection laws there must be agencies and authorities at the local level to which a person seeking information or wishing to make a complaint can go. It is no good establishing a fairly remote commission unless as part of the establishment of that body adequate provision is made for the ordinary consumer and the ordinary citizen at a completely local level to take complaints and to seek information. The final point I would like to make relates to the question of confusion. I think those in the community who are interested in consumer protection-the consumer movement-and also this House are entitled to have resolved the confusion which apparently exists regarding which Minister in the Government is to be responsible for consumer protection. The House will be aware that apparently there has been a difference of opinion and a dispute in the ranks of the Government between the Attorney-General and the Minister for Science (Mr Morrison). Announcements have been made and Press reports have been circulating in recent days as to who has won the battle and who is finally to be in charge. In the interests of the consumer movement, this dispute has to be put to rest. In the interests of the consumer there should be no confusion. The ordinary consumers and citizens of this country ought to know as a very minimum who is to have ultimate ministerial responsibility for and control of what is a very important area. In concluding my remarks, in general terms I commend the Government for bringing forward these amendments to the Trade Practices Act. The Bill will ceive the support of the Opposition.",77
167,Mr MORRIS,PAIRS," I welcome the opportunity to speak in support of the Trade Practices Bill 1975. At a later stage I will make some comment on the progress made thus far in the implementation of the provisions of the main elimAct, the Trade Practices Act 1974. The object of this Bill as stated is,firstly,to amend the Trade Practices Act 1974 to prohibit the sending of unsolicited credit cards and, secondly, by amendments to sections 62 and 63 of the existing Act, to permit consumer product safety and information standards to be prescribed so as to exclude goods which are intended to be used outside Australia. This will overcome the problem of Australian exporters having to attempt to comply with incompatible standards; for example, where Australian standards differ from overseas standards. It also will prevent inconsistencies arising with regard to standards set pursuant to Australian export regulations. In our present business world a large percentage of trading is conducted on credit, and it is in the area of credit transactions that credit cards are coming to fulfil an increasingly important, convenient and in many ways desirable function. The need for these amendments was demonstrated by the large scale dispatch by Australian banks last year of unsolicited credit cards and also by the large number of complaints surrounding the dispatch of Gold Key credit cards in Queensland. The effect of the amendments in respect of credit cards will be that credit cards will be able to be sent only in pursuance of a written request by the person who will be liable on use of the card or to replace a card which had been previously requested in writing or properly used by the person, such as would be the case where a person properly made use of an unsolicited card sent by mail. It is true that the present Trade Practices Act has provisions relating to unsolicited goods, but these are inappropriate for credit cards. The terms and nature of the credit standing of a citizen with a creditor is a personal and private matter of concern between the citizen and the creditor-be it bank, lender or vendor-and , as such, detaUs of credit rating should be privy only to the citizen and the creditor involved. The mass distribution last year of unsohcited credit cards showing limits of credit available was a serious breach of that privacy. A number of other undesirable events flowed out of that mass distribution of cards. In some cases the issue of cards re- was duplicated. People received and used cards to which they were not properly entitled. People whose cards were fraudulently used by other persons were put to the unnecessary trouble of proving that they had not used the cards. Some people were caused anxiety because on receiving the credit cards they felt they had some committhe ment to use them. The Bankcard executive itself admits that there have been some 80 to 100 cases of frauduPractices lent use of bankcards since their introduction, involving amounts on average of $400 to $500 interim but ranging up to $2,800.1 return to the point privacy. Tne Bankcard credit rating accorded each of the 1.5 milhon citizens who received solicited bankcards last October was shown on the attachment to the bankcard sent out, to seen by anyone who happened to have access the unsolicited mailing whether he was properly entitled to see it or not. This happened in many cases of errors in addresses, changed addresses and fraudulent possession of the cards. I repeat dealing. that the terms and nature of credit arrangements are a matter of the utmost privacy which ought be known to the borrower and the creditor only and certainly ought to be made available to third parties only with the borrower's express pose permission. There was a ume when the best way to buy was with cash; a consumer's best bargaining power was the ability to pay in cash. However, service stations, is an indication of an un with the expanding use of credit cards and the commission that sellers have to pay to the card organisations, the position now is that cash customers, through the price they pay, are tributing a component to help offset the comhotel mission or service fee, which ranges from 3 cent to 7 per cent, that the seller has to pay to credit card company or organisation concerned. To this extent then credit cards are inflationary as they are an addition to selling costs. In dition, the expansion in readily available credit following the mass distribution of credit cards was an inflationary influence. I am sure that honourable members opposite would agree with the principal objectives of Trade Practices Act and the amending legisgroups lation now before the House-the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) has indiwhich cated that they do-in that it seeks to give businessmen and consumers a fair deal and to cUitate free competition in all areas of the ketplace. I believe it is true to say that the Practices Act has been generally well received the world of commerce. No longer can the large corporation dominate a market by its abUity restrict smaller businesses from competing. The Act has been in existence now for a little over 6 months and although some of the major authorisation provisions relating to restrictive trade practices came into operation only a little under 3 months ago, I think this is an appropriate time to review operations of some of the provisions of the Act. Generally, the public is becoming increasingly aware of its rights and remedies under the Act. However, one area of the Trade Commission's activities that has come in for criticisms is in the large scale granting of authorisations of existing contracts or arof rangements in restraint of trade or exclusive dealing arrangements. The Act allowed the unCommission to grant clearances for either class of conduct where the effect of the restrictions be upon competition was insubstantial. The Comto mission could also grant authorisation where substantial public benefits not otherwise available arose from the particular contracts or arrangements in restraint of uade or exclusive to The Act also aUowed the Trade Practices Commission to grant interim authorisation if it considered that it was proper to do so for the purof enabling due consideration to be given to the application. I have had it put to me in my electorate that, in particular, the failure of the Commission to date to act against the brewery monopolies and oil company arrangements with L wUlingness on the part of the Commission to act credit on behalf of consumers and in consumers' interests. In the case of breweries, I have had concomplaints not only from consumers but from proprietors as well. I am aware that the per Commission was literally swamped with applithecations in the last 3 weeks of the time period for applications. But it needs to be made abundantly clear that interim authorisations by the Comadmission are in no way to be interpreted by the public or the parties concerned as a rubber stamping of existing contracts in restraint of trade or exclusive dealing. I can appreciate the work load and pressures the involved in trying to deal with the 2100 odd of applications received prior to 1 February and the trickle that has come in since, probably would boU down to about 200 both issues if common issues relating to the same faindustry were linked. The facts are that to the marend of March 1975 only 61 clearance appliTrade cations and 13 authorisation applications have by been decided. Of these the Trade Practices Commission has rejected on merit 9 clearance applito cations and one authorisation application. Among the authorisation applications granted are 3 cases where the Commission has issued an following a certificate issued by the Attorney-General stating that there are special considerations relating to the particular acquisition that make it desirable in the interest of national economic policy that the authorisation be granted. I refer here to the B. F. GoodrichOlympic merger, to the Peek Frean-Arnott's take-over and to the Marrickville Potato CrispsAmatil merger. If the work load facing the Commission is such that additional staff and facilities are required to speed up the processing of appUcations, the additional staff and facUities should be made avaUable as a matter of urgent pubUc interest. My own view is that the public interest may have been better served if the interim authorisations had not been granted but rather each application had been dealt with and resolved as time permitted. Again, I appreciate that this course may have caused some difficulties to parties to existing arrangements but I believe the pubhc benefit to be of greater importance. I would be interested also to know whether any cost benefit analysis was made to justify the continuation of agreements untU they are examined by the Commission. Certainly, a discontinuation of the existing arrangements across the board would have entaUed a cost to the companies concerned in disbanding existing arrangements. But against that has to be ranged the considerable cost to the pubUc in allowing the agreements to continue pending their examination by the Trade Practices Commission. To date the Trade Practices Commission has launched only 3 proceedings for injunction, namely against the Sharp Corporation in relation to resale price maintenance in respect of calculators, against the Hammersmith Storage Module Sales for misleading advertising in respect of cardboard storage modules represented as pyneboard modules, and against Vapor Nordic for misleading advertising in respect of fuel injection systems.",79
168,Unknown,PAIRS,Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m.,81
169,Mr MORRIS,PAIRS,"Prior to the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was referring to the 3 proceedings for injunctions instituted by the Trade Practices Commission in respect of the Sharp Corporation, Hammersmith Storage Module Sales and Vapour Nordic. To date no prosecutions under the Trade Practices Act have been launched by the Trade Practices Commission. I want to turn now to the consumer protection provisions of the Act. My observations are that the pubhc is not sufficiently aware of the level of assistance avaUable from the Australian Legal Aid Office in respect of complaints under this legislation and the principal Act. The public does not seem to be aware that the Australian Legal Aid Office will give legal advice and also give legal assistance by way of instituting court proceedings to people who are eUgible for such assistance, being people of limited means or people for whom the Australian Government has a special responsibUity such as pensioners, migrants or infants. I suggest to the Attorney General that there is a need to focus greater public attention on what the Australian Legal Aid Office can do to assist people in connection with this legislation. A particular practice that has been brought to my notice in my electorate by some of my constituents is that foUowed by some major discount houses in buying in sUghtly imperfect products, or seconds as they are known, from manufacturers and marketing these products as specials at reduced prices in a style that leads purchasers to believe that the products are first quality. When a complaint was made recently to a discount house the staff said words to the effect: 'Well, you knew that the product was slightly damaged when you bought it'. One product that comes to mind is New World clothes driers. Clearly this is a breach of the Act and I reiterate to the Attorney-General that more public attention needs to be focused on the assistance available to people from the Australian Legal Aid Office in matters such as this. The legislation now before the House will strengthen and broaden the existing Trade Practices Act. The public of Australia had great expectations of a new deal for consumers when the principal Act was passed. The legislation promised a dramatic change in consumer rights and a dismantling of agreements and conduct in restraint of trade. I hope that those expectations will not be delayed by tardy implementation of the provisions of the Act. In concluding my remarks I want to make a brief reference to the proceedings in the Industrial Court today instituted by the Attorney-General's Department against the Sharp Corporation in relation to advertisements of the Sharp Corporation for microwave ovens. The fine of $100,000 imposed on the Corporation by the court points out very clearly that the Trade Practices Act has teeth, that it can be very effective and that it heralds the beginning of a new deal for consumers in consumer advertising. I commend the Bill to the House.",81
170,Mr RUDDOCK,PAIRS,"As has been indicated by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), the Opposition supports the Trade Practices Bill. The purpose of the Bill, as has been mentioned by a number of honourable members already, is to prohibit the issue of credit cards when they are not solicited by individuals as well as to cure the difficulties that are alleged to have arisen in relation to the issue of bankcards and in relation to the issue of certain cards which were referred to by the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris) in Queensland. It seems to me that the introduction of this legislation is somewhat Uke bolting the stable door after the horse has gone. Certainly, the only major organisation that would issue cards in this way would be the organisation involving the banks and the cards known as bankcards. It seems to me that the Commonwealth, with the Commonwealth Trading Bank of Australia as a party to the organisation issuing bankcards, was in a position to ensure that in its operations the sorts of problems that were spoken of in the issue of those cards would not have arisen. I wonder why we see the mshing in of an amendment of this type to deal with credit cards when there seem to be other sections of the Act that need to be looked at and reviewed in the light of circumstances that have arisen since the Bill was introduced, passed and more recently promulgated. The second major provision in the Bill overcome a drafting problem. I wish to refer later to a number of drafting problems of which I have become aware. To deal with one in relation to clause 51 (4) and not to look at others time is a defect in this legislation. This ought encourage the Attorney-General (Mr Enderby) to look promptly at the Bill and its more general operation. We also have included in the Bill amendments to sections 62 and 63 of the Act. These sections are to provide for regulations to be made for the purpose of excluding from their operation goods of a kind specified that are intended to be used outside Australia. Mention has been made already by the the honourable member for Bennelong of the need for that section to be reviewed. There is good reason for the clause to be limited in its opertions. ations by referring to goods that are intended be used outside Australia. It does allow for goods to be made with that intention but in fact them still to be marketed in an Australian situam ation. I think that this is clearly a defect, if intended to overcome the manufacture of goods in Australia and then to prohibit are defective in some way. I recall a situation that recently came to the notice of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Road Safety. The Committee was inquiring into use of car seat belts. Honourable members will be aware that seat belts have to be included motor vehicles manufactured and sold in after Australia. The Committee ascertained that Austers tralian manufacturers, who agreed that it was desirable for seat belts to be included in their motor vehicles and who agreed that the use of seat belts saved Uves, were quite prepared to take those seat belts out of motor vehicles manufactured for the export market. They did that for what they deemed to be commercial reasons without reaUy giving any thought to whether the vehicles they were manufacturing ought to be made safe for the people in the export markets to whom they were selling those vehicles. I wonder whether we as an Australian people, if we believe that regulations ought to be drafted that deal with the quality of goods and the safety matters pertaining to goods that are manufactured for Australian markets, ought to allow the export of goods that do not conform with those standards. I hope that in drafting regulations the Attorney-General will take very clear cognisance of the words' may exclude'. I hope that very clear supervision will operate to ensure that we are not selling on overseas markets goods that we do not believe are suitable for our own markets but which for commercial advantage we are quite seeks to prepared to see sold overseas. There are several other points that I want to raise in this debate. I was particularly grateful for at this the speech of the honourable member for to Shortland because I think that he highlighted the need for a more widespread review of the Act now that it has been in operation. He highlighted certain problems of which he had become aware. Although I do not agree with his approach to authorisations and particularly his criticisms of interim authorisations I believe that he has validly raised some of the problems which are quite obvious in relation to the Trade Practices Act. I mention specifically sections 49 and 88 of Act. Already there has been a good deal of comment in articles appearing in the 'Australian Financial Review' relating to each of these secI am not privy to the sort of information to which the Attorney-General would have in his office or in the office of the Trade Practices Comfor mission about the detaUed complaints which I sure would come to his notice but some pracit is titioners have seen fit to draw to my attention certain defects which have already operated in their use if they this area. I have also noted some comments on the Trade Practices Act prepared by the Company the and Commercial Law Committee of the Law Society. These comments appeared in the Law in Society Journal of November 1974 fairly shortly the Act was promulgated. One of the matin that journal dealt with the problems the profession was having relating to section 45. I shall mention that section as well. In that article of the Law Society in relation to section 45 it states: The effect of Section 45 is that contacts made before the section comes into force will be unenforceable. It will be unlawful to make such contracts after the commencement of the section or to give effect to (defined to include 'enforce') such contracts made before or after such commencement. There is provision in section 87 (3) entitling a party to apply to the Coun for a variation of contract made before the commencement of the section or an order 'directing another party to the contract to do any act... that the Court considers just and equitable'. The question is moot as to whether the common law rules as to severability apply to pre enforcement of that part of the contract (if severable) not constituting a restraint. Without canvassing the arguments both ways, some assistance for the view that common-law severability does apply is found in the words 'to the extent that' in section 45 (2) (b) and 87 (5) as to powers of the Court not being affected by the powers conferred by section 87. However in the absence of amendment or a definitive decision one cannot really place the matter higher than to advise. This is speaking of how practitioners might advise clientsthat the matter is doubtful and to come to one's own conclusion as to the preferred view . . . Of course, as in most of these things, when one is dealing with them if one has to come to a preferred view somebody can suffer a loss. This can be quite expensive. It can lead to real difficulties. The articles which have been appearing in the 'Australian Financial Review' in relation to section 49 deal with price discrimination. Honourable members will be aware that section 49 of the Act prohibits discrimination as follows: . . . between purchasers of goods of like grade and quality in relation to(a) the prices charged for the goods; (b) any discounts, allowances, rebates or credits given in relation to the supply of the goods; (c) the provision of services or facilities in respect goods; or (d) the making of payments for services or facilities provided in respect of the goods, if the discrimination is of such magnitude or is of such a recurring or systematic character that it is likely to have the effect of substantially lessening competition in a market for goods, being a market in which the corporation supplies, or those persons supply, goods. The sorts of comments which appeared in relation to this section relate to oil producers and vice stations. An article which I read indicated that these sorts of agreements which have led restrictive trading-that is trading in one brand country areas-hav e led to a situation where products and so on are sold much more cheaply than they otherwise would be if a number of people were trying to market in a hmited area. Some of the commentators have asked whether it is not in the public interest that such specialised economies be made. In fact, a greater service to the public can be effected in rural areas by arrangements which would be quite contrary to this sort of provision. I ask the Attorney-General to look at this provision in the Act to see whether some review can be made which would permit of certain economies, particularly in rural areas. Section 49 raises certain other problems. A matter which was referred to my attention related to the Australian Tin Smelters Association. I understand the matter is generally of some public knowledge. In that case agreements or post-Act contracts enabling which had been operating for some considerable time were terminated. Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd had a special arrangement or a close relationship with the company in which it had had shares, as I in the general words of section understand it. Other shareholders were allowed a certain discounted price as well as BHP while other purchasers had to pay a slightly higher price. Ultimately because of the operation of this section BHP, as a major user of the tin products, had to pay higher prices. Other shareholders who perhaps had market interests had to pay higher prices. These higher prices would have been passed on to the community and to the users for the goods they were buying, such as tin cans. It is regrettable that when one operates in these sorts of situations and when one abolishes discountsthis has been seen in operation-on e generally does not get a lower price at all. This is part of the problem with which the Prices Justification Tribunal has had to try to deal. In fact higher prices are charged because these are necessary to maintain a market situation which the producer needs to be able to maintain a viable business. Other situations have emerged as well. It has been ascertained that long standing contracts have provided that goods be sold to of the a particular person at a reduced price. Of course these are contracts in which parties and suppliers of goods have had vested interests. Such contracts have been avoided by the operation of this section. This has also led to higher prices. I think this is quite contrary to the original intention. We should have seen competition that would have led to lower prices. In the few minutes that remain I shall deal serwith section 88 which relates to authorisations. It was this part to which the honourable member to for Shortland referred. I ask the Attorneyin General to investigate this section with a view to oil perhaps amendment if necessary to provide that the Commission be entitled to look at numbers of areas in which contracts are the same. So contracts will not have to be looked at individually in areas in which they are of a rather similar operation such as those oil companies which we have mentioned. Other areas have been revealed in an article in the 'Austrahan Financial Review' of 22 January which indicated that business bares its trade secrets. I notice from the article that there were arrangements between the Herald and Weekly Times Ltd and the Newspaper Proprietors Association governing the rules and agreements affecting newsagencies. There are a number of other arrangements involving newsagencies which were mentioned in the article and some involving breweries. There was some suggestion that these agreements be looked at not so much individually-whic h appears to be the case because of the small number of agreements which have been already processed as described by the honourable member for Shortland-bu t that they be looked at in a group so that we can see these situations and doubts being resolved quickly. I put these proposals to the Minister because believe that, in these areas and in many other areas about which I understand he has been informed by people who have now had some exthat perience with the operation of this Act, it has come apparent that the Act needs reform in many more areas than those referred to Bill that we have before us. I ask the Minister consider the matters that I have put before him and other matters that I know are coming before him, with a view to a major review of the being undertaken to ensure that those sorts of problems which have emerged, particularly those that have led to higher prices for goods, remedied as quickly as possible so that we may have the benefit of a good trade practices law without the sorts of problems which have besively. come quite apparent in the operation of the curfurther. rent legislation. Notwithstanding my remarks relation to the need for a general review, the position supports the limited proposals consort tained in the Bill which is before the House.",81
171,Mr LUCOCK,PAIRS,"Before commenting on any matter related to the Trade Practices Bill, I would just like to make the comment that the Australian Government should have a look at its own trade practices. It might have a look at a situation which has arisen in Canberra and which involves, I understand, the purchase of monthly bus tickets. In the present situation, course, there are no buses upon which people who hold such tickets can ride, and I think it would be a good idea if the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Bryant) and perhaps the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Fry) and the honourable member for Canberra and Attorney General (Mr Enderby) had some discussions to see what can be done in the way either of refunding to the people concerned some of the money that they have paid in the purchase of their tickets or of making theticketsvalid for travel in the Australian Capital Territory next month. I do not think it is a very good trade practice for this Government to allow people to buy tickets to travel on buses which are not running and therefore upon which they cannot travel. So I suggest that the Minister might have a look at that matter with his coUeagues to see what assistance can be given to the people of Canberra in the present situation. I do not want to go into detaU in regard to the Bill. The detaUed matters have been covered by my colleagues, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Ruddock). As has been said already, this amending Bill is designed mainly to prohibit the sending of unsolicited I credit cards to people. In one sense it appears from a perusal of the legislation that this Bill represents only the first of many amendments are to be made to the trade practices legisbelation. It is perhaps unfortunate that legislation which was enacted, so recently after much long in the debate and many amendments has to be to amended further. It is continuing proof and a further Ulustration of the Government's inability to present legislation to this House in a form in Act which it can proceed immediately to become law. Two or three pieces of legislation that have been presented to this House recently have had are to be amended in the same way. Not the least of those, of course, was the Corporations and Securities Industry Bill which was amended extenThat legislation still has to be amended So the legislation which was presented in and which passed through to the Senate was a Opsort of a hotch-potch. It appears that the same of procedure will have to be foUowed in relation to this legislation. One other point that I want to make is that this legislation is indicative of the attitude of the present Government towards private enterprise. It places upon private enterprise all the restrictions it can, and with the maximum speed. I admit that there is a need for some control over private enterprise and private businessfirms,but of I think we should have an appreciation of the contribution that private enterprise has made to the development of this country. In the comment and discussion on the spate of legislation that is being presented by the Government, that factor appears to me to have been overlooked. In the course of his speech the honourable member for Parramatta made a comment about the Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd. I sometimes wonder just what progress and development we would have achieved in Australia without organisations such as BHP. As I said, I think we need to have a look at this factor because our country has progressed and developed because of the contribution that has been made by private enterprise. I want to emphasise that in my opinion the Trade Practices Commission should have discretionary power, and I believe that such power should be provided for in the legislation. To illustrate my point I would like to read to the House a letter written by my colleague, the honourable member for MCMillan (Mr Hewson), to Mr St John who is the man in charge of restrictive trade and consumer protection in the Business Affairs Division of the Attorney-General's Department. The letter illustrates the need for some discretionary power to be given to the Commission. My colleague wrote: I write in support of the tified Seed Potato Growers' Association who have been in existence for some 20 years and who now seek clarification of their position in relation to the Trade Practices Act. I have ascertained that they are not listed amongst the exempted industries under the 2nd Schedule of the old regulations, therefore it is necessary in view of their normal price agreement to seek exemption or authorisation. To support their claim to be exempted or authorised, I submit that their normal practice is beneficial to them as seed producers, to the commercial grower, and to the consumer and can only be so under their present arrangement of a price agreement. The history of this Association's activities is a very commendable one and one which I trust you will seefitto uphold as one which guarantees(a) a plentiful supply of to the commercial grower; (b) a product grown under the Victorian Government supervision and standards; and (c) seed which produces quantity and quality to the consumer. It is essential that this procedure of potato supplies public is maintained, because it safeguards all three from exploitation by inferior quality orfluctuatingprices. In conjunction with the Victorian Agriculture Department, who initially propagate new varieties and climatic conditions, the Gippsland Certified Seed Potato Growers' Association members purchase their new seed from what is known as the foundation growers who multiply the tested seed for the seed growers' purposes. This is done under strict supervision of Government inspectors to maintain standard certified seed. It would be most unfair to place this most important section of the industry on the same basis as the commercial grower who, because of the quantity he grows or because of seasonal conditions, creates afluctuatingmarket price. The price agreement arrangement has been acclaimed by the industry as one of the greatest safeguards guaranteeing at all times sufficient seed for commercial growers. It is a price agreed upon direct to clients with no third party involved and at no time reflects pricefixingto the consumer. I believe it is in the public interest that the Gippsland Certified Seed Potato Growers' Association be allowed to continue their commendable action to preserve standard and quality for consumption. I therefore very resolutely defend theirrightto do so and respectfully request that your favourable consideration results in the Association being granted, if not exemption, authorisation. It was signed 'Arthur Hewson, member for MCMillan'. I think the letter illustrates 2 things: Firstly, it illustrates the need forflexibUityin the regulations of the Trade Practices Commission. Secondly, it emphasises the need for discretionary power to be given to the Commission. I understand that at the moment the matter is still being considered. I ask the Attorney-General (Mr Enderby) to take this matter up with the Commission, to see what can be done and to see whether a favourable reply can be given. As has been indicated by other honourable members on this side of the House, we support the legislation but ask that these amendments and other factors be given consideration. application by the Gippsland Cer",84
172,Mr ENDERBY,PAIRS," I wish to reply briefly to some of the contributions made in this debate by honourable members. Let me deal first with the remarks of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Lucock). He asked us to consider certain suggestions and we will certainly do that because, in a changing society, the law relating to that changing society must also change. Consideration of the relationship between society and the law also should be continuaUy under review. There is nothing novel in that proposition. It is just an indication of the need for constant study. guaranteed quahty certified seed At the risk of being abrasive or striking a discordant note, because I welcome the support which the Opposition is giving to the Government's measure, I have to say that I cannot help being a little amused by some Opposition to the spokesmen, particularly the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Ruddock) who spoke about closing the stable door after the horse had bolted. My God. I ask honourable members to suitable to various soil reflect on the facts, not so much on the words that the honourable member used. For 23 years Liberal-Country Party governments closed no door. For 23 years they kept the door wide open. For 23 years they did not even have a buUding. They tore down the Uttle buUding that did existthe Australian Industries Preservation Act-and replaced it with a shanty made of cardboard which promptly blew away when it was exposed to the first challenge in the High Court. When this Government introduced its legislation the Opposition opposed it vigorously. How many times did this parent Act-this magnificent piece of legislation-hav e to face challenge in the Parliament before the Government eventually forced it through? Whence came the opposition? It was from honourable members opposite. Was it 3, 4 or 5 times that the legislation had to face challenge in the Senate or in this House? How manytimesdid my predecessor introduce it into the Senate, have it rejected out of hand, then have it brought down here and have it come up in the Senate again? Now unanimously the public applauds this legislation. Australia has the best piece of anti-trade practices legislation in the world but the Government received no help from the Opposition in reaching that result. Yet honourable members opposite stand up here and say that the Government is closing the door after the horse has bolted. My God, what else does one have to listen to? The honourable member for Lyne said that there are too many restrictions on private enterprise. Although that point wanders from the legislation a little- I am sure he knew that it was wandering a Uttle from the immediate purpose of this amending Bill-it calls for an answer. The parent Act is called the Trade Practices Act. It is the one for which the Government fought so hard to have enacted, the one that is so universally applauded these days. Perhaps it could be better called a competition Act. It does not really impose restrictions on private enterprise. It imposes restrictions on those practices in which private enterprise sometimes engages which negate competition. It is a pro-competition Bill. It is criticised because it exposes private enterprise to the winds of competition-fre e competitionthe very tbing for which honourable members opposite are supposed to stand. It was introduced by a Government which they often criticise and abuse for being socialistic. But procompetition Bill. I put to the honourable member for Lyne who talks about restrictions on private enterprise, that competition tends to give way to monopoly. Monopoly does not always work in the public interest. Businessmen tend to enter into negotiations and agreements to restrict competition in their own interests. The paramount section is section 45. What does it do? If honourable members opposite want to call this a restriction on private enterprise they may do so by all means, but I would suggest that it is the opposite. A contract in restraint of trade is unenforceable. Long before this was enacted the common law had a healthy resentment of contracts in restraint of trade, a resentment developed over hundreds of years because the common law-the judges themselves-recognise d that businessmen often put their heads together, not in the interests of their customers but in their own interests. This Bill is a pro-competition Bill. It could well have been called a competition Bill. It does not impose restrictions on private enterprise; it imposes restrictions on agreements and arrangements that sometimes go against private enterprise, in which private enterprise sometimes tends to indulge. I just put that to the honourable member for Lyne because he raised the subject, although I think he recognised that it was outside the scope of the amending Bill. May I congratulate the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Morris), who is not in the chamber at the moment, on an extremely good and thoughtful contribution to the debate. As I pointed out earlier, when trade practices and business practices continue to change the law has to watch them continually and perhaps adapt itself to change. There can be no absolute, unyielding, unchanging law these days, if ever there could be. The honourable member drew attention to some criticisms directed at the Commission, of which the Government is well aware. For example, he said that at times the Commission is a little too slow. It is far quicker than the old procedures that operated under the law, if one can caU it that, before this Government changed it. Let me pause at this stage and say that the prosecution of the Sharp Corporation of Australia Pty Ltd that was referred to by one honourable member could never have taken place without this piece of legislation. What was it all about? A well known corporation in Australia decided to pubUsh advertisements that were without doubt a fraud on the Australian public. The Corporation said that its product had been approved by a body of high repute in the it is a community when it had not been approved by that body at all. 'Deceit' is the old fashioned word for it. Without that law that this Government made, that deceit would never have been exposed. It is true it can be said that in the past the States have tried to make laws to expose deceits of that sort but they faUed miserably. It was the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) who touched on the question of State rights in a kind of State rights-centralist context. We all know that the consumer protection provisions of the various State Acts have been totally inadequate. The Sharp Corporation prosecution is the biggest single testimony to the success of this legislation in the short time in which it has operated-les s than a year. I think it was Mr Justice Joske who said something consistent with that in his judgment today. One could go on but I will not take any more time except to touch on one aspect that the honourable member for Bennelong mentioned. One is always amazed at the capacity of the Opposition to oppose something vigorously, oppose tently and, when it eventually goes through, try to take some credit for it. Opposition makes political capital of the position adopted. The honourable member tried to suggest that there has been some difference opinion between the Minister for Science (Mr Morrision) and me on this matter. Let me assure him and the House that there has been no such difFerence of opinion. I read the articles that the may honourable member read in the 'Australian in the Financial Review' by someone named Robert Australia.'. Haupt. I can assure him that when I read those after articles I hoped that there might be a provision somewhere in the Trade Practices Act concernmay exclude ing misleading representations that would apply in the regulations to those articles because they relationship to the true situation. The same I move: newspaper made some other contributions, if they can be given that name, at the same time pUed dealing with other measures which the Governbe soaused'. ment has been putting forward. I mention that just in passing. In conclusion let me say that the Government accepts the amendments put forward by the Op- (a) position. Indeed, the Government had it in mind to do this itself. As I am sure the Opposition will admit, we corrected the grammar, put the syntax right, gave the Opposition access to Parhamentary Counsel and wrote out the amendments for includes the Opposition. It is important that the legiscapsule, lation be kept under continuous review. We all know what the 2 major measures are. One is to pUed exempt from goods that are intended for export be so used'. the standard provisions that are appropriate in Australia because the country to which go will set its own standards. It is proper that they should set their own standards. Unsolicited credit cards have been a nuisance to many people. They were not wanted; they were an invasion of privacy. The sending of unsoUcited credit cards was an irresponsible act and was recognised as such overseas, where they have been outlawed. This Government is only doing includes what many overseas countries quiterightlyhave capsule, done themselves. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

'(2C) A reference in sub-section (2B) to a covering a reference to a stopper, glass, bottle, vessel, box, case, frame or wrapper and a reference in that subsection to a label includes a reference to a band or ticket.'."". The Attorney-General (Mr Enderby) was kind enough to pre-empt me on the subject of collaboration between myself and officers of his Department regarding the preparation of these amendments. I do acknowledge, as I had intended, that collaboration and the assistance of the Attorney-General in the drafting of the amendments. As I indicated during the second reading debate, the purpose of these amend of ments is to make it perfectly clear that any which, by the regulations made under sections and 63 of the Act, are intended to be used outon side Australia should not come within the ambit of those regulations. Quite clearly, circumstances in Austraha may require standards and informaunder tion regarding products which are not appropriagree ate for overseas countries. Let me again emphaamount sise that the Opposition in no way wishes a situfrom ation to arise whereby Australian exporters encouraged to export goods of a quality inferior to that of goods sold on the domestic market. merely seek a situation where Australian businessmen in a competitive export situation alone should not have to pay undue regard to conthe sumer standards other than standards the countries for which their goods are intended. The other matter that I should like to add is that, notwithstanding that there is genuine conor fusion in some areas of consumer protection a need to clear it up- I do not think it can pushed aside by some references to State rights versus centralism-the Opposition believes quite strongly that an area in which the Government indisputably has a direct interest and ought have a direct involvement is the laying down and enforcement of product safety and information standards and the labelling and packaging of goods. These are areas in which the Commondifferent wealth Government, quite properly, does have an interest and they are areas that I hope the present Government will continue to review, while it has custody of this Act, in the light of cumstances as they change. In respect of the consumer protection section of the Trade Practices Act, I think that there perhaps more need there than anywhere else for this process of fairly constant review because it an area which is still evolving. It is a comparaOne tively new area for a Commonwealth Governseeks ment and there is still a tremendous need for greater consultation between the Commonthe wealth Government and the States. I hope the course of drafting its legislation for the consumer affairs commission, to which some attention has been given recently by the Minister for Science (Mr Morrison), there will be a level of co-operation and consultation between the Federal Government and the State governments which the Opposition believes was absent when the consumer protection provisions at present force under the Trade Practices Act were Australia prepared.",87
175,Mr ENDERBY,PAIRS," I will be very brief, Mr Deputy Chairman, because the amendments are a matter rise consent between my friend and myself, by argoods rangement. (Quorum formed) The honourable 62 member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) touched the confusion that is sometimes said to exist between the various State laws on consumer protection and Part V of the legislation which is consideration tonight. I think one has to with him on this subject. There is a certain of uncertainty, but one should not draw that the conclusion that the Australian Parare liament should not have laws on consumer protection. We have already seen the deficiency in We the State laws, and I often wonder how many people, how many members of this House, let citizens, realise the absurdity that exists in Australian legal system when it comes to laws in force in of this sort. As a consequence of our history we have eight nine sets of laws. Certainly we have 8 sets of and laws on defamation, company law, securities be law, consumerism, criminal law, land laws, the law of torts, the law of nuisance, the law of negligence. The laws of New South Wales and Victoria and Western Australia and Tasmania and to the Austrahan Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, to go on without mentioning all of them, are as different from each other for practical and legal purposes as the law of Paraguay is from the law of the Soviet Union and are treated as such in terms of public international law. I just touch on this and I put it to the honourable member that, when he talks cirabout confusion, it is a confusion resulting from our history. What absurdity it is that when a motorist drives a motor car from the Australian Capital Territory to New South Wales and is crosses the border his entitlement to damages suddenly depends upon whether he is a few hunis dred yards south or north of an invisible line. gets quite absurd situations. This legislation to take a step in the direction of a kind of uniformity and avoidance of that confusion that honourable member singles out for attention that in and regret, and which I also regret. The answer to the honourable member's criticism is not to abdicate the field as his Pany did when in government, but to try to occupy the field where possible and to try to negotiate with the States. I refer to those pans of Australia called States. That is all they are. They are not in something above criticism. They are pans of as such and just merely in passing are called States. We must try to bring some sense to that exists in the country because we have so many sets of laws. That give to confusion. If that is called a States' rights or a centralist argument, so be it. But this legislation is a step in the right direction.",88
176,Mr HOWARD,PAIRS,"All I wish to say is that I am most pleased to hear the Attorney-General (Mr Enderby) acknowledge that in this field there is a need for negotiation between the Australian Government and the governments of the various States. It was precisely the absence of such provision for negotiation and that sort of attitude when this Act was being processed that drew some of the criticism which has come from this side. I do not advocate that the Austrahan Government in the present situation withdraw from the activities which are laid down in Part V. I am not advocating that at all. I am simply urging the Attorney-General to direct his attention again to the need in the interest of consumers for the least possible differences and the least possible confusion between the laws of the Australian Parliament and the laws of the various States. He knows, and I am glad that he has acknowledged, that the best way in which that can be achieved is by the process of negotiation. Amendments agreed to. Bill, as amended, agreed to.

NATIONAL GALLERY BILL 1975 Second Reading Debate resumed from 5 March, on motion by Mr Whitlam: That the Bill be now read a second dme.",89
177,Mr CHIPP,PAIRS,"It might seem to honourable members that there is an incongruity in my leading for the Opposition in this debate because of my almost complete ignorance- a confessed ignorance-in matters of art and art galleries. Therefore, I will leave it those more expert honourable members who follow me to deal with the specific issues raised by the Bill. The Opposition shadow Minister responsible for this area is Senator Rae. He has asked me to say that, in his usual diligent fashion, he has circulated the State governments and the directors of the State so-called national art galleries on this legislation. He has not yet received any response from any of the State governments but he has received no adverse comment from any of the directors of the State galleries. In fact, what he has received from the directors of the State galleries has been commendation for the Bill. For that reason and for the reason that the Opposition finds no objection to the Bill itself, I declare on behalf of the Opposition that we support the Bill and commend the Government for introducing it. I strike one small note of discord at the beginning of my speech which my friend the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Hunt) will follow up with some detail. In reading the second reading speech delivered by the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam), one could be led to believe that he was the only person interested in this subject and that he has been the champion of establishing a national gallery because he uses the first personal pronoun so many times in his speech. For example, he states: Honourable members will be aware of my long standing interest . . . Other such expressions may be found in that speech. Mr Daly-Quit erighttoo.",89
178,Mr CHIPP,PAIRS,"I do not deny that the Prime Minister has a long standing interest in this matter, but that claim looksridiculous.The history of this gallery goes way back before 1968 when former Prime Ministers Gorton and MCMahon took an extraordinary interest in the establishment of a national gallery. The first point I wish to make is that this is not an initiative of the Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, or the Labor Party. It is an initiative which was shared, I think, by all members of this House and is now simply being carried on by the Labor Party in Government. As I said, the Opposition supports the Bill. I wish to make a few points on the second reading speech of the Prime Minister. First, the Prime Minister says: The affairs of the gallery will be conducted by a council including a director of the gallery and not more than 10 other members chose with regard to their knowledge and experience with respect to the visual arts or other areas of knowledge relevant to the affairs of the gallery. to The constitution of that Council does concern me a Uttle. I am not an expert in art and I do not pretend to be, but what I do say is this: If those people who are vitally and specifically interested in the arts think or believe that this national gallery should be something only for those people who are expert and who can stare at a painting for hours and get all sorts of sublimated joy out of it, it would be a tragedy for our national gallery to develop that way. I would like to think that this should be an opportunity to create our national gallery and to develop it in a way in which it will broaden the interest in an among more people in Austraha. It would be ghastly if the council of this gallery was specifically inclusive only of an boffins, directors of an galleries, or artists or people who follow that pursuit. I would have thought that that council should include people such as those interested in social welfare who would know the needs and the wants of people who at thistimein Austraha do not appreciate the niceties of a classical painting or a classical graphic drawing but who can be stimulated to satisfy their minds more in a way in which would add to their enjoyment of life. I would hope that in choosing the council the Government might be directed to that point and might include people other than an boffins and might in fact include simply an ordinary guy-someon e who is not specifically interested in art but who might look at the whole concept of the national gallery and try to get it to interest the ordinary people of Australia. Another feature of the Bill which I commend and with which I agree is that it has 2 statutory officers, the director of the Australian National Gallery and the secretary and manager of that gallery. It is provided that the Director shall the overall responsibility to the Council for ranning of the Gallery in its The Secretary-Manager, under the Director, shall manage the day to day administration of the affairs of the Council. I thoroughly agree that provision because although it is not an breakable rule, artistic people are not notorious as good managers and conversely good manother agers are not notorious as artistic people. I think that this is a very sensible balance that Government has made in the construction of Council. The last point I wish to make about speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) cerns the part where he said: Much has been said over the last year or two about of the Gallery's acquisitions of contemporary art from seas. On balance, I think this has been for the good. art-interested Australians have been obliged to some of their values and tastes and I believe that this is a salutary experience for us all every once in a while. I quote from an article by Bernard Smith in 'Australian' newspaper of 22 February which begins like this: 'What do you think of Whitlam?' a Sydney taxi-driver said to me recendy in a state Gogh Whitlam.' 'What,' I said, 'Don't you like Van Gogh?' 'Yes,* he said, ' I like Van Gogh but I don't those bloody awful things Whitlam's buying now.' I think that Ulustrates the Prime Minister's point. There you have a taxi driver-on e of people whom some journaUsts and others call that 'ockers'-interestin g himself in art. I think that controversy in this area, as long as a person is interested in the field of art, is not necessarily a bad thing. But when we talk about art, what are we talking about? Art can take many forms. I should like to take 60 seconds to give my personal philosophy. It comes to the basis of why any of us should be here, in this House of Parliament as parliamentarians. Surely the only reason that we are here, or should be here, or should remain here is that we can do something to make Australians happier or less unhappy. If none of us meet either of these conditions, I believe we should not be here. This leads me to a definition of happiness. I have found that the one which satisfies my criteria is that happiness is a state where there is stimulation and satisfaction of the 3 components of the human being-the mind, the soul or the spirit, and the body. Art is one of those things which can almost simultaneoulsly satisfy and stimulate both the mind and the soul. I believe, and I hope, that the Council of the Gallery would not be carried away with any other criterion than that. Members of the Council should try to provide some stimulation and satisfaction to the minds and spirits of the Australian have people. How can they best do that? I should like the to make a few brief comments as to show how artistic direction. they might. They should not get carried away. Members of with the Council who are on reasonably high salaries unshould not expect that everybody in Australia can visit and view and enjoy the paintings and works of art in the National Gallery. Canberra is a place which is 200 mUes from Sydney, the 300 mUes from Melbourne, 2500 miles or more the from Perth and 1000 mUes from Adelaide. The the Commonwealth, with virtually unUmited money, conwas able to buy 'Blue Poles' and other well known works of art. I do not wish to enter into a some controversy as to whether' Blue Poles' was worth overbuying or not as I am not an expert. But if this Many Council were to think that all of Australia can see reconsider these works of art it would be mistaken. I advocate that one of the first concepts the the Council should adopt is that the paintings and works of art acquired should be moved around Australia as much as possible so that everybody can see them. I have heard directors of gaUeries saying that this is not possible. They say it is of irritation. ' I call him Van Gough or impracticable because precious works of art Uke should not be moved. It is said that they cannot be transfened, it is expensive to insure them and so on. I point to the exhibition brought to the Australia by Mrs John D. Rockefeller. I know she should not get all of the credit for it but whoever organised the bringing of that exhibition of impressionist paintings to Austraha should certainly get credit. I believe 8000 people in Sydney are now queuing up for admission. This gives the lie for ever to the statement that works of art and exhibitions cannot be moved around the country. I would like to think that the first concept which the Council adopts is that the precious things which they can buy with the preference that Commonwealth agents have over the States and other people, could be shown to the people in Port Adelaide, the people in Hotham people all round Australia. They should have the opportunity to view them. I believe the visiting Museum of Modern Art exhibition has illuswarn trated that this is feasible, practicable and possin ible. As somebody who is a confessed non-art should boffin, I beheve that the Director of the Gallery should assume when he is doing the layout of the Gallery-the layout of the paintings and the works of art-that most of the people who will to that Gallery are not experts in art. It should laid out with simplicity and with some backartist, ground explanation to people who are interested enough to go to a gallery. I believe that the Dioversight rector and the Council have a duty not only put on works of art for display but to do it way that will interest anybody who comes to them. They should try to be evangelistic and try to win to an interest in art the tourists who are now nocking into Canberra. If there is a beautibourne, ful building and a beautiful layout the tourist goes there because it is on his schedule to visit in Canberra. A director should have imagination and enough humility to be able to appeal to the lowest common denominator. not use that word in an offensive sense. He should be able to appeal to a person like me should be able to say: 'There is a painting there is an explanation under it concerning its origin or its author or what he is getting at.' would then interest me to look at the painting work of graphic art longer than if I simply saw something that my finite mind in this field of art might not otherwise appreciate. Mr Crean-That is a pretty moralistic descripwUl tion of evangelism.",89
179,Mr CHIPP,PAIRS,"Is the Minister for Overseas Trade (Mr Crean) suggesting that evangelism should be Umited to proselytising only religious matters? If not, I do not understand his kind interjection. Mr Crean- I do not understand the term 'evangehstic' in your suggestion.",91
180,Mr CHIPP,PAIRS,"There are a lot of things which I say which the Minister does not understand. That does not bother me at all. Maybe an exhibition could be set out in chronological order. Maybe it could be set out in the order of development of an in particular country. At least it should be put in such a way that the ordinary person can understand it. I am told that in the Capetown Art Gallery- I have never been there-ther e is a smaU note under each painting which says what the artist is trying to do and something about the artist. It certainly adds to the enlightenment and understanding of the and the people who visit the gallery. There is another matter which I should like to the Council about: It is my experience that the art galleries in some States, the directors have personal prejudices against some style of art, some period of art and indeed some artists. I think that one of the jobs of the Council would be to ensure that such prejudices are not expressed. I wiU give just 2 illustrations. I understand that there are no oil paintings by David go Boyd, who although he is not quite as well be known as his famous brother is an accomplished in the galleries of New South Wales or Victoria. I wonder whether that is simply an or is due to the prejudice of the directo tors of those galleries? There are many Ausin a tralian artists who have won big prizes and see whose works are not displayed in any of the galleries. Is that due to the prejudice of the directors? I cite the case of Wesley Penderthy of Melwho won a Sulman Prize for a mural. To my knowledge, none ofhis murals is hung in any of places Australian art gallery. I think the Council has a responsibUity to look I do at the actions, aspirations, concepts and philosophies of the artistic director of this Galwho lery. I will not mention any names, but I am and appalled by the kind of people who have been appointed to the councils of art galleries in some It States. They know less than I do about art. They or have been appointed simply because they are belted earls or patrons of the arts in those States. Friends of the directors of art galleries also have been appointed to the councils of those art galleries. I hope that the Council of this GaUery exercise some responsibUity in that respect. I conclude by speaking about something which is barely relevant to this Bill but about which I feel very strongly. Anybody who knows a person who is close to the War Memorial or to the Government in Canberra can be led down to some dark vaults in the War Memorial and can view something like $100m worth of beautiful Australian works of art that are hidden down there. It is very difficult to get down there to see them. Apparently the view of the Government- I am not being critical of the Labor Government in this respect because the position is exactly the same now as it was when the Liberal-Country Party Government was in power in that both governments have been influenced by the bureaucrats-is that they are not good enough to be hung in government buildings throughout the nation and they are not bad enough to be allowed out into government offices; so they are stored in these deep, dark vaults in the War Memorial. It is like trying to extract a tooth to get one of these paintings to hang in, say, the Parliament Offices in Adelaide, Melbourne or wherever. If it is worthwhile to have these sorts of riches in Australian art in store, I should have thought that it would be worthwhile to show them off to the people of Australia and to have them adorning some of the walls of government offices. I should think that it would be a ridiculous exercise for a member of Parliament to try his luck by asking the appropriate authorities to lend one of these paintings to him to hang in his office, as such a request would be refused outright; yet they are being kept where nobody can see them. These works of art are being wasted. The Opposition supports the Bill, with the warnings I have sounded and with the point that my friend the honourable member for Gwydir and perhaps other speakers will make, namely, that this initiative is not entirely the prerogative of the Labor Government. We on this side of the House take a great deal of pride in sharing the fulfilment of a dream which began many years ago.",91
181,Mr YOUNG,PAIRS,"The honourable member for Hotham (Mr Chipp) thought it was ironic that he should lead for his side of the House in the debate on this Bill. I think we on this side of the House have matched that, because most of the painting I saw being done in my youth was done with a tar brush. Like the honourable member for Hotham, I am sure that I will be followed in the debate by a colleague who has far more expertise in this matter. I will be followed by the Minister for Urban and Regional Development (Mr Uren). Not only has he a great love of the arts, but his very features have been submitted in an entry for the Archibald Prize. The entry was unsuccessful; nevertheless it was submitted. A couple of points made by the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) in his second reading speech are worthy of repeating. Firstly, in talking about history of a National Gallery, the Prime Minister pointed out to the Parliament that the establishment of a National Gallery was, of course, part of the original master plan of Canberra. It is a great tragedy that the original master plan was not acted upon much sooner than it has been. Secondly, he said that in the establishment of a National Gallery we have the beginnings of an institution which it is his hope and the hope of the Government will be a source of pleasure and artistic stimulation for generations of Australians to come, a worthy addition to our growing national heritage and an endeavour in which we might all take pride. I think that we all do take such pride, although we might have different priorities, we might place different degrees of importance on the particular forms of art that will be displayed in the Gallery and we might also lay different emphasis on the role of the Gallery in terms of the Australian community. I have taken an interest in the establishment of the Gallery because I happen to represent a very underprivileged area. I hope that the Gallery will play some part in bringing the artistic works, particularly of Australians, to those areas which previously have been devoid of the opportunity to see them. I believe that the very concept of a National Gallery is both stimulating and exciting. It is in no way contradictory that it is a Labor Government which has introduced the Bill for its establishment, as no government has done more for the arts than the present Labor Government has done; nor has any Prime Minister done more for the arts than the present Prime Minister has done. It could be simply put, of course, that by sheer weight of money we have done more, but in the final analysis one cannot and should not make judgments on the basis of the amount of money allocated. People should understand firstly that there always will be criticism of government action in this field. Art being what it is, there is no final criterion for judgment. There is a good deal of subjective pride in the performance of artists and, as in industrial relations, in relations between governments and creative people there is no perfect recipe. The Government has taken giant strides in its drive to involve the community. If honourable members look at clauses 5 and 6 of the Bill they will see inherent in them the maintenance of this principle. Involving the community is not a oneway traffic. The artists themselves should be and must be involved. Really, as the Prime Minister pointed out in his second reading speech, the estabUshment of the National Gallery cannot be the separated from the Government's support for the Australia Council. The Gallery and Council boards involve artists. They themselves become the refiners of policy and they themselves become the decision makers. Notwithstanding all the steps that have been taken, there have been many disputes; but I put it to the House quite seriously that no one will get on better with the artists than a Labor Government will. I believe that we have seen demonstrated over the past 2 years a common commitment by both the Government and the artists to excellence and quahty. There can be no doubt that we share this commitment. Nowhere is that principle demonstrated in Hotham, more depth than in the Government's brave lack policies on the arts, and in the vanguard of those policies would be the policies on the acquisition of art. The acquisition of art should never be without question, but the questions raised on it should be raised on a rational basis and not of merely because of prejudice against quality. However, all artists, especially painters, will have a fundamental sympathy with the Governimportant ment's pursuit of excellence. Both the Governvery ment, and the artists have another common ment ground, because the artists instinctively want their works to be displayed in the pubhc domain berra. and not in private collections, although I quite understand that the private collector quite often helps to keep the wolf from an artist's door. It is important, when speaking on this Bill, stress that the Government does not consider the pubhc domain to be one fine building in Candebating berra for the local people and the 300 000 tourlery. ists a year who journey to Canberra. Both Government and the artists have the desire communicate and, as I have said, clauses 6 (1) (b) and 6(2) give the Gallery Board freedom. Whether the Gallery is bringing students to Canberra or taking exhibitions from the Gallery to the people, it will be an exercise communications. Commumcations in this case should include the utilisation of all the up to equipment, such as audiovisual methods, to porthat tray to the people the works of art that belong the people of Australia. There can be no doubt that one of the Government deUghts for any citiPrime zen of this country is to visit an Australian exhibition. The great tragedy is that too few people in Australia share that experience. Since the war there has been a great resurgence in art and our artists have performed superbly in truly reflecting the Australian spirit. It would be incredible not to Unk the Australian landscape with the names of Drysdale and WUUams. As a result of the estabUshment of this Gallery, the experience of the few will be the experience, I would hope, of the majority. I reiterate that this Government is not all about cocktaU parties and opening nights, where the photographer taking photographs for the next days papers invariably shows the people with their backs to the paintings. The GaUery should sponsor not only travelUng exhibitions to all Australian cities and regional centres, but also should sponsor the artists to go out into the community as much as possible. In joining with the honourable member for I say that there are many underprivileged areas in this country, underprivUeged from of gaUeries, lack of libraries, lack of child care centres, all the matters that go to make a proper quality of life. Indeed, the National Gallery of Australian can play an extremely important role in bringing to all of those people some the efforts, some of the artistic talents, some of the works of art that may be avaUable to them in the National Gallery. I think it is an extremely institution to be established, and I am pleased to be associated with the Governwhich has introduced this Bill to finally see the establishment of a National Gallery in Can",92
182,Mr CONNOLLY,PAIRS,"Some weeks ago this House had the pleasure of debating in a totally bipartisan manner the establishto ment of the Australia Council. Once again, tonight, we have the pleasure and the privUege of the Bill to estabUsh the National GalI reiterate the point made by the honourable this member for Hotham (Mr Chipp)-the National to Gallery did not just suddenly appear with the 5 (2), advent of the Labor Government in 1972. great Although the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young) is quite prepared to say that artists could not possibly find any governin ment more amenable to their desires than his own Labor Party, the same could be said of his date Party and the unemployed. I wish him to realise as early as 1965 Sir Robert Menzies announto ced the establishment of the National Art Gallery Committee. Ever since then, successive Ministers have gone out of their way to art emphasise the need to estabUsh a national gallery in the national capital in accordance with the original plans laid down by Walter Griffin. As I said during the earlier debate on the Australia Council, we have indeed come of age as a nation. We are therefore in a position at last where we can afford a national collection of the highest quaUty and to have a buUding in which to place such a collection. The original quotation of the cost of establishment of the National Gallery was some SI3m. Due to innation and other factors brought upon us by the present Administration, no doubt this construction will now cost as least $20m. We might even have another Opera House on our hands and the cost could well be higher than that. Regardless of these mundane matters concerning cost, however, as the honourable member for Port Adelaide pointed out the important thing is the quality of Ufe. But when we refer to this excellent term 'quahty of life', surely what we must be trying to achieve is an upgrading of the standards of excellence within our community and an appreciation by as many Australians as possible of the beauty and the conception of excellence as seen through the visual and the plastic arts. Since 1973 Canberra has had an estimated I 277 000 visitors annually which is, of course, a fairly stantial number. But then Canberra is the national capital. What concerns me, however, is that of that number only a fraction in fact will visit the National Gallery. Those who will visit the Gallery will probably come merely to goggle at a construction made of iron, cement, ferroconcrete and perhaps a Uttle marble, somewhat simUar to the National Library which is situated at the other side of the parliamentary triangle. The major problem, therefore, is that the Australian people should be given the opportunity, through our institutions and especially through the National Gallery, to appreciate more than just the tradition of art which we have in Australia. I am very pleased to say that Mr Mollison and the other members of the Council have gone out of their way in the last few years to ensure that the national coUection has the most excellent cross-section of art since the early days of the colony at Port PhUUp. Notwithstanding that, because of our isolated position Australians must also be given the full opportunity to appreciate that we are merely a small segment of mankind, and for that reason we need to buUd up satisfactory collections of a high standard of Asian, South American, African and European art. This again is something of which the Council has been well aware and is a principle which I certainly would support. Mr Mollison, the Director, has been reported by the Press, probably incorrectly, as suggesting that the Gallery's educational program for schools would consist essentiaUy of lending minor but interesting objects to schools within a radius of approximately 150 mUes of Canberra. This again gets to the crux of the problem as I see it. I would be the first to appreciate the obvious technical difficulties of moving collections around Australia. But the facts still remain that Australians, as a nation, are not going to come to Canberra-onl y a small section does so-and therefore the national collection, which will be the heritage of the Australian people and paid for by them through their taxes, must be taken, to some degree at least, to the State galleries as well as throughout outback Australia. I am not suggesting for a minute that 'Blue Poles', for example, has to be carried around. We then would read ankles about flecks of paint falling off the edges and so forth. This would be unfortunate. We are dealing with very finite objects. But the principle must be accepted and maintained at all costs. In clause 5 of the Bill we notice that nothing prevents the National Gallery extending outside the Australian Capital Territory or outside Australia its exhibitions of works of art from subthe national coUection. I have not doubt whatsoever that on the construction of the Gallery we will see probably on an annual basis the movement of fairly large consignments of Australian art overseas to show the rest of the world the standard of our culture and our excellence. However, I honestly suggest that our first responsibility is to give the Australian people every opportunity to participate in and appreciate this high standard of excellence which undoubtedly we are going to achieve. Through the Australia Council various amounts of money have been made available to the Visual Arts Board and so forth to enable an upgrading of the standard of Australian artists. It is worth remembering, however, that in 1974 a survey was carried out in Melbourne which showed that only 3 per cent of all students going through the various technical colleges and so forth to qualify as artists were still practising professional artists one year after graduation. Is this a human cost that we can allow to be perpetrated indefinitely? Why is it that only 3 per cent were still artists? Was it because the other 97 per cent merely wanted to spend two or three years of their lives learning more about art before they went into other aspects of life? Perhaps this is the case. Perhaps, indeed, the standard of excellence will be found in only one per cent of the community. I venture to suggest it is considerably less than that. What does disturb me is that in our great search for excellence we might well lose sight of the fact that the national collection in a national gaUery we would need to see at any specific time a reasonable amount of work prepared by young artists who obviously have shown a standard of talent but who are not yet fully recognised. It is through a national collection and the fact that their art will be on display that many young artists will be given a first class opportunity which they are not going to get otherwise, unless they are given some form of official recognition by what will in fact be the highest standard of art criticism in Austraha. Many Australians, regrettably I believe, have seen the purchase of'Blue Poles', 'Woman V and so forth as merely flamboyant examples of conspicuous waste but, as I said earlier, I think that Australia should now be a nation which has come of age. We have the right and the need to establish in this nation an appreciation of the depth, the quality and the capacity of the human abUity to produce beautiful things. These symbols of beauty must form a part of Australia's future heritage. That is what we are in fact buUding up- a high standard of excellence, but above all a heritage that we can pass on to our future generations. I commend this Bill to the House.",93
183,Mr UREN,PAIRS,"As the Minister responsible for the National Capital Development Commission I welcome the introduction of the National Gallery Bill. The NCDC has worked closely with the Prime Minister's Department in the lead-up to the buUding of the great new National Gallery. I am glad that this Bill now sets the seal on the new Gallery, and I am sure it will be warmly supported by all members. I am pleased by the attitude expressed on both sides of the House. I think the Gallery represents a coming of age. It will provide a home for the works of Australian artists and all artists of the human race. Wefindart expressed in many different ways. Art is an expression of an artist's attitude to life, his aspirations, his frustrations, his ecstasy or her ecstasy. It is the expression of the artist who has eyes to see, a mind to think and a heart to feel. Some artists who have been oppressed and still are oppressed are expressing their attitude to freedom. We owe much to the artists of the past, and of course even to the artists of the present. I am indeed happy that we are creating this National GaUery to house their works so that the present generation and future generations can enjoy the work they have done and the expression of attitudes they have given to their fellow men. One of the most important features of the National Gallery is the way it will enhance the concept of the parliamentary triangle in Canberra. In broad terms this is the area bounded by Commonwealth Avenue, King's Avenue and Lake Burley Griffin. At the apex of this triangle stands Capital HU1 with the present parliamentary buUding in front of it. It is a formal area of great natural beauty which has been supplemented by careful landscaping. Already the triangle includes the National Library buUding, which by any standard is a fine piece of architecture. Now we are engaged in building a High Court building and the National Gallery. The GaUery will give Canberra a building of international stature. Honourable members will recall the criticism of the British expert, Lord Holford, when he visited Australia about a decade and a half ago. He said that the only building of international distinction in Canberra at that time was the National Library. Of course we now have other fine buildings which together with existing buildings will give Canberra an even greater character than it has had. The addition of the National Gallery to the parliamentary triangle will take much of the sting out of this sort of criticism. As honourable members are aware, we are making progress in the planriing of a new Parliament House. When aU of these projects are completed I am certain we will have created a formal centre for our city of great distinction. It is one of the hallmarks of national capitals that they provide the legislative and creative heart of the nation. Formal areas of this sort are not always successful. They can be contrived in a way that is artificial with buUdings and landscaping at odds with perspective and the natural environment. So far we have avoided this problem. By careful planriing aimed at blending new buUdings into the great backdrop of lake, mountain and sky, I am sure we can make the parliamentary triangle a formal area of unsurpassed quality. I do not want to go into great detaU on the nature of the buUding. The plans and specifications of the Gallery have been well publicised. There have been some changes in detaUs of design,finishand programming since the NCDC published a descriptive brochure on the Gallery in August 1972. In essence the plans for the Gallery remain the same and I commend this paper to honourable members who want more information. There is some new information on the cost and completion date of the Gallery which should be suppUed to my Department. When the contract for construction was let the cost of the Gallery was $13,168,792. In view of the sharp rises in costs in recent years some revision of this cost has been inevitable. According to the latest information I have, the estimated cost of the Gallery is now $15,696,782. This is an increase of around 20 per cent. Of course we are not happy about this extra cost, but I suggest that in view of the upward revision of all estimates in the past year it is a moderate one. I assure the Parhament that we are very conscious of the dangers of cost escalation, and care is being taken to control costs. When the contract for building the Gallery was issued by the Government 2 years ago it was expected that the Gallery would be completed in August 1977. Despite progress made on construction, it is likely that this completion date will have to be extended. Again the NCDC is conscious of the fact that the nation has waited many years for this Gallery. It is no cause of satisfaction to the Government that a great art collection is stored in warehouses and crates. We want the Gallery to be finished as soon as possible to put this vast holding of art treasures before the Australian people at the first possible moment. With this aim we will press for the completion of the Gallery at the earliest possible date. The Gallery floor plan includes the greatest possible allowance to show the collection to the best advantage. About a third of the floor space will be devoted to display galleries and the circuSpending lation links between them. By comparison with other great galleries of the world this is a good ratio of display space to totalfloorarea. The lery will also provide a number of other amenivirtual ties and facilities. It will stress the educational side of a Gallery with the provision of 2 theatres and 2 lecture rooms. This will allow an ambitious art. program of art education with a key emphasis on our Australian art history. It will have a library 45,000 books, again with a strong leaning to Australian art. It will provide a restaurant to seat over 130 people, a museum shop, storage space, a photography department, and space for workto shop and building services. The library will lack none of the resources and services needed to supduties port and sustain a great collection of art lery treasures. Another important feature of the new Gallery will be its closeness to the lake and to the gardens on both sides of the lake. One of the cessful events at the recent Australia '75 Festival in Canberra was the outdoor sculpture display the Commonwealth Gardens across the lake in from the Gallery site. Displaying pieces of ture and other works of art in an outdoor setting is one of the better ways of putting thefinefeaRupert tures of an art collection before the people. When the new g Mery is built I hope it will be possible to display sculpture and other suitable the pieces against a rich backdrop of lake, mountain and sky. I want to conclude with some comments about the National Gallery collection. This has source of strong comment in the past 2 years. I think it is a pity that critics should focus on single works of art rather than on the broad sweep of this great collection. There will always be strong differences of opinion about the merits of individual art works. Only by looking at the range of a collection and the forms of art it includes is it possible to make a sound judgment of its total worth. The range of the National Gallery's collection is truly impressive. Some of the impact of the collection can be measured by looking at the additions made to the collection in the past 5 years. Too much attention has been given to 'Blue Poles' and 'Woman V . This has distracted attention from the excellence of many other pieces of art that have been bought. One of the significant trends of these years has been a decline in the number of Australian works acquired as a percentage of total acquisitions. Austrahan works were 96 per cent of the collection in 1971-72. In the first 6 months of 1974-75 they dropped to 68 per cent of new purchases. on Australian works as a percentage of the total has fallen even more sharply-fro m 95 per cent in 1971-72 to 3 per cent in the first 6 Galmonths of 1974-75. This reflects 2 factors-the completion of the Australian collection to the present day and the adoption of a policy of buying pieces which represent other schools of Any national collection of paintings is never of complete. There are always gaps to be filled and which can be filled as for one reason or another pieces of historical art come on the market. There is also the constant need to keep a collection up date with new works by established artists and the work of new artists. I am confident that these will be discharged faithfully by the Galin its acquisition policies in the years ahead. If this is assured, it makes sound sense to build up collections of ethnic art and of paintings, sculptures, drawings and other pieces from the most sucgreat heritage of world art. A careful look at the purchases of the past 5 in years shows that the gallery has done afinejob building a balanced collection. A wide range sculpof Australian paintings has been bought. It includes famousfiguresfrom our art history like Bunny, Streeton and Tom Roberts. It includes also the works of artists now working at a height of their powers, great Australian painters like Fred Williams, Clifton Pugh, John Olsen, Albert Tucker and Frank Hodgkinson, just to name a few. Fine, rich collections of Australian sculpture, crafts, prints, drawings photos been a and posters have also been assembled. In step with the build up of Austrahan work has gone a gradual expansion in purchases of worldwide art and ethnic art. To my mind this is an extremely sensible way of approaching the task of building a great nadonal art collection. When the collection is unveiled in this new gallery I am sure that its breadth and richness will silence any lingering criticism of purchase pohcies. In recent years the ranks of the great art galleries of the world have been joined by some fine new galleries. The Van Gogh Gallery in Amsterdam and the new gallery in Rotterdam are two that come to mind. When this art gallery is completed and its treasures are put on display I am sure that it will not be overshadowed. It will be a great and enduring monument to our artists and a source of pride to the Australian nation. This national art gallery above all is a part of developing Austrahan character. It is a part of the development of our people. This gallery is for people. It is for them to draw from and to express themselves. It will give them the opportunity to give and share their contributions to our human family. I think that is the whole basis for this gallery. I think that the Austrahan National Gallery will show the maturity that the people of this country have reached. I am not giving the credit for its estabUshment just to this side of the House because I know that the seed was sown years ago when the Government of honourable members opposite was in office. But I think all members in this Parliament must give credit to the drive, initiative and inspiration of the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) in giving men like Molhson and the men who are now in charge of the gallery a fair go and the moral support that is necessary to make it a great gallery. I think that we should all give full support for this measure which expresses the growing maturity of the Australian nation.",95
184,Mr HUNT,PAIRS,"The Opposition welcomes the National Gallery Bill as an extension of the efforts made by many distinguished people and indeed by several Liberal-Country Party governments over a long period of years. I have no basic argument whatsoever with the speech just made by the Minister for Urban and Regional Development (Mr Uren). I think that he set out to be very fair to the Opposition and to those people who have been associated with the early history of this project. We support the legisberra. lation and see great value in the administrative procedures outlined in the second reading speech made by the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) which provide for 2 statutory offices, namely, the Director of the Australian National Gallery and the Secretary and Manager of the Gallery. The Director is to have overall responsibility to the Council of the Australian National Gallery and for the running of the gaUery and its artistic direction, and the Secretary and Manager shall under his direction manage the day to day administration of the affairs of the gallery and act as Secretary to the Council. The Prime Minister said that this provision has been introduced to avoid the problems which have arisen so often elsewhere where unlikely and unreasonable combinations of different expertise and experience have been demanded of the person usually with unfortunate results. I think that is a very commendable approach to try to arrive at the right form of administration of what will be one of Australia's most important artistic institutions. our However, the Prime Minister exhibited one ofhis worse shows of vanity in his second reading speech. In his not unusual extravagance he stated one ofhis most obvious untruths. He said: . . . this is another historic iniuative taken by the present Government to promote interest and activity in the arts in Australia. He went on to say: Our commitment was reiterated in the Policy Speech for the 1974 elecuon and confirmed in the Governor General's Speech on 9 July 1974. The last sentence is in fact correct. But it is quite unfair and it is untrue to try to claim the full credit for an initiative that has evolved over a period oftimewhen so many people have been involved in the development of this concept. Just for the record I want to run through a true account of some of the contemporary history of the National Gallery. In August 1963 the Government agreed in principle to the establishment of a national centre on Capital HU1, the first buUding of which was to be the National Gallery. Subsequendy the then Prime Minister appointed a committee of inquiry, under the chairmanship of Sir Daryl Lindsay, to examine and report on the requirements for the National Gallery. The committee's report, presented in March 1966, included recommendations on the purpose and size-12 5 000 square feet-of the buUding. In October 1967 the Government of the day approved the then Prime Minister's recommendation that planning and design should proceed and authorised the construction of the Gallery as the next major prestige buUding in CanIn this decision it indicated that it did not regard the then estimated cost of $4m as setting a Umit for planriing purposes. That was the figure that was contemplated at that time. From 1963 untU 1968 planriing proceeded on the basis of the site being on Capital HiU. However, in 1968 the Parliament rejected the lakeside site for parliasome ment house and the Government's the Camp Hill site in 1969, with its implications concerning Capital Hill, necessitated a reexamination of the site in question. I think it is very important to get into the context some of the difficulties that the Governapproved ment of that day experienced, particularly with relation to the siting of the Gallery. Following the decision that the new and permanent parliaagainst ment house should be sited on Capital Hill, the National Capital Development Commission, association with architectural and traffic consultDepartment, ants, carried out a comprehensive review of the planning and design of the parliamentary triis-offere angle and the central area of Canberra. Follow1969 ing this review, sites for the High Court of Australia and the National Gallery were rectotal ommended in the north-eastern sector of the liamentary triangle. These sites were approved April 1970. The Lindsay Committee, in its report to the then Prime Minister in 1966, recthat ommended in general terms accommodauon ommended totalling 125 000 square feet. Following the appointment of the Interim National Gallery Council in July 1968, with sponsibility for the planning and construction the Gallery, a joint working group was formed, consisting of representatives of the Interim Council, the Prime Minister's Department and the NCDC. The first task of the preparation of the brief for the building. In this the working group was assisted by Mr James Sweeney of New York, an art critic and gallery director of world repute who was engaged by NCDC as a special consultant to advise from the point of view of a gallery director. Of course, there was some controversy in respect of Mr James Sweeney. But in my time as Minister for the Interior I found the man to be extremely helpful. He came to Australia on two or three occasions and gave us sound advice on the general construction and planning of the proposed Gallery. I will not forget his comment on his last visit to Australia in my time ter for the Interior. He said that he was satisfied that the planning and the project were meeting with general satisfaction. He was right. He went back to America believing that this Gallery ultimately would become one of the great galleries of the world. I think that we should place on record our great appreciation to this remarkable man, Mr James Sweeney, for work that he did in assisting in the development of the National Gallery. It is regrettable in a sense that the Prime Minister did not think to pay areTenders tribute to him and to the services that he decision on gave this country. However, the working group, starting from the basis of the Lindsay report, prepared a preliminary brief, setting out requirements totalling total some 185 000 square feet, which was formally by the Interim Council in October 1968. This brief was further examined by the working group and the architect and tested conditions and practice in galleries overseas. The final brief was approved by the Interim in Council in March 1969. The Prime Minister's which was then the sponsoring department for the Gallery- I think it probably still d no objection when advised in May of the building area and other requirements set out in the brief. The significant increase in area from that recommended by the Lindparsay Committee resulted not from any great in increase in display and pubhc areas but because further comprehensive investigations indicated the working and storage areas recin the Lindsay report were quite inadequate for the efficient operation of the appropriate gallery. Then, of course, in 1968 a limited competition was conducted to select an architect for the project. The successful contestants were rethe Sydney firm of Edwards, Madigan, Torzillo of and Briggs Pty Ltd. The final brief, calling for preparation of sketch design and cost estimates, was issued shortly after Government approval had been given to the site for the Gallery in the group was the parliamentary triangle. That is some of the history-it is an accurate history-of the development up to that time of the the concept of the National Gallery in our national capital. I join issue with the Prime Minister in his rather extravagant statement that this is yet another historic initiative taken by the present Government. Quite frankly, I am proud to say that I was involved in a very small aspect of the historical development of the Gallery. I want to incorporate in Hansard, just for the record, a Press release by Mr Howson, the then Minister for the Environment, Aborigines and as Ministhe Arts, issued on 16 August 1972.",97
185,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAIRS,"Is said that the syntax leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted. (The document read as follows)the PRESS STATEMENT ISSUED BY THE MINISTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT, ABORIGINES AND NA for the Australian National Gallery in Canberra expected to be called before Christmas this year. In a joint statement the Minister for the Environment,  for the Interior, Mr Ralph Hunt, said today the Government had approved inclusion of the gaUery in the National Capital Development Commission's 1972-73 Works Program for an estimated cost of $ 11.3m. The architects, Edwards, Madigan, Torzillo and Briggs Pty Ltd, are now preparing final drawings and specifications for the gaUery. The architects' initial sketch design which was approved by the Government was prepared in association with a working group representative of the GaUery Interim Council; the Depanment of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the National Capital Development Commission. Mr James J. Sweeney, an eminent world authority on galleries and gallery operations, acted as a special consultant. Mr Howson said the Director of the Gallery, Mr James Mollison, had been closely associated with the final planning of the buUding and was working in co-operation with the architects and the NCDC in the production of final drawings. 'The four-level gallery is acres set some 450 feet back eastern sector of the ParUamentary Triangle, towards Kings Avenue Bridge', Mr Howson said. 'The site for the proposed High Coun buUding for which the design is to be decided by a two-stage design competition is some 370 feet to the west and somewhat nearer Lake Burley Griffin. 'The gallery will have afloorarea of about 220 000 square feet, of which some 75 000 square feet will be devoted to exhibition space', Mr Howson said. CANBERRA, A.C.T. 16 August 1972",98
186,Mr HUNT,THE ARTS AND MINISTER FOR THE INTERIOR,"I want to mention one man who has been at the butt end of a lot of criticism. refer to Mr James Mollison. What an excellent job he has done. He was appointed by Prime Minister MCMahon. On 27 October 1971 the 'Sydney Morning Herald' reported his appointtralian ment under the headline 'National Gallery Digallery rector Named' in this manner: Mr James Mollison, 40, is to direct the new National Gallery in Canberra. The Prime Minister, Mr MCMahon, appointment in the House of Representatives tonight, ending a long-standing controversy between the Government and its an advisers. Mi MolUsoii's appointment was exclusively forecast in 'The Sydney Morning Herald' on 8 October. A former director of the Ballarat Art GaUery (1967-68), he has been with the Commonwealth PubUc Service since 1969 as exhibitions officer. He has wprked with the Commonwealth Art Advisory Board on the development of the national collection and detaUed planning of the Australian National Gallery buUding. Mr Mollison has suffered much abuse for his choice of art and, as I said earlier, has been at the butt end of a lot of unfair criticism. However, he has remained calm throughout. I found it a great pleasure to work with him when I was Minister for the Interior and I have always admired his dedication, his quiet strength of character and his sense of purpose. I do not join with those who unfairly criticise his contribution to the National Gallery in Canberra. I think that he has had a difficult job in trying to satisfy the art tastes of all sorts of people. I am sure that when the National Gallery opens Mr Mollison will receive great applause for the job that he has done in helping to select a range of art to suit the tastes of people generally. I commend the legislation and look forward to its progressive development. I hope that we do not hear again this hogwash and nonsense which the Prime Minister utters in his moments of fantasy as when he said that this is yet another historic initiative taken by the present Government. It does not do him justice; it does not do his Government justice, and it does not do justice to a great body of people who have done so much to see this Gallery come to fruition. to be located on a site of about 5 from the lakeshore in the north",99
187,Mr WENTWORTH,THE ARTS AND MINISTER FOR THE INTERIOR,"I have undertaken to conclude my remarks within 5 minutes. I shall do just that. I shall make a couple of points. Firstly, this is a National Gallery. I hope it will maintain its character as preeminently an Austrahan gallery. I do not mean that it should not have works from overseas. In terms of world art I do not think it will ever be a great collection but it can be the best collection in the world of Australian art. I hope that that will be achieved. Secondly, I hope that co-ordinately I with this Gallery we will press on with an Australian museum in Canberra-the Australian museum presently is in Sydney-and that in that museum we will have what is pre-eminently Ausand is of world importance, namely, the of southern man with Aboriginal relics, civilisation and artifacts. Co-ordinated with that, An I hope we have artifacts from other parts of the southern hemisphere so that the display can be announced the seen in perspective. It is time now to press on with this and other public buildings. The building industry is in a state of depression and is likely to remain so for sometime.The building of the Gallery will be an appropriate alleviation. It will be appropriate that we should use this construction as a means of tapering off the unemployment which will otherwise occur in the building industry, particularly in regard to large buildings. I know that pubhc buildings such as hospitals and schools will and should take up the major part of this slack, but as far as the industry as a whole is concerned, there will still be need for employment. This is an opportunity for us in the next decade to undertake in Canberra works of monumental significance of which the Gallery is one. I hope that the Canberra museum with its gallery of southern man will be the other.",99
188,Mr MCMAHON,THE ARTS AND MINISTER FOR THE INTERIOR," I would not have come into the House and spoken on the Nauonal Gallery Bill except that I heard the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Hunt) limited refute some statements made by the Prime Minter to do so. ister (Mr Whidam) this morning. The Prime Minister's statements were totally pletely inaccurate. I appointed the Director of the National Gallery, Mr James Mollison. I had several people to choose from and I chose him. I asked Mr Sweeney to come out States to talk over the matter with me. He agreed that the most appropriate appointment was Mr Mollison and he said that he would be prepared to give Mr Mollison assistance whenever it necessary. I , with Mr Hunt, and I believe, Mr Howson, approved all of the plans for the construction, for the architectural developments and the estimates which were to be made. Apgives proval was given to those estimates National Art Gallery. This is all set out in the records of this House, in Hansard and, if we care to look, in the 'Sydney Morning Herald' of August which reports: Gallery tenders 'before Christmas'. Tenders tralian National Gallery in Canberra called before Christmas. They were, and we approved the finance. There was an initial appropriation of something like $ 11.3m. Those are the facts. I regret that Prime Minister always wants to get the credit for what has been done by other governments and not by himself. It is deplorable. It is a disgraceful performance. I set the record straight. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith.",100
189,Mr UREN,THE ARTS AND MINISTER FOR THE INTERIOR," I move: That the Bill be now read a third time. I do not think it is of much use callirig the Prime Minister names. I think it must be clearly stated that the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) has given the thrust to the National Gallery. Mr Chipp- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. Standing Orders state that speeches at the third reading stage must be devoted entirely to the provisions of the Bill. It and out of order for the Minister to canvass any speech at the second reading stage, and particularly the true remarks of the right honourable member for Lowe.",100

194,Mr UREN,THE ARTS AND MINISTER FOR THE INTERIOR,"I wish the honourable member 17 for Hotham would not be so much of a prima donna.

197,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,THE ARTS AND MINISTER FOR THE INTERIOR,"I uphold the point of order but I do not think the transgression is serious enough to call for an exclusion from Hansard"" Has the Minister concluded his comments?",100
198,Mr UREN,THE ARTS AND MINISTER FOR THE INTERIOR,"I have, Mr Deputy Speaker. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a third time. GRANTS COMMISSION BILL 1975 Second Reading Debate resumed from 5 March on motion by is quite improper Mr Lionel Bowen: That the Bill be now read a second time.",100
199,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,THE ARTS AND MINISTER FOR THE INTERIOR,"This is a rather simple and short Bill. seeks to amend the Grants Commission Act 1973. Before addressing myself to two or three of the major provisions of the Bill I remind the House that the history of the Grants Commission goes back to 1933.1 believe it was introduced in the days of the Lyons Government. Its purpose was to assist the less populous States and to make certain that they could function at standards not appreciably below the standards of other States. To my knowledge, over the years the reports of the Grants Commission have never been rejected or refused and there is no doubt that the smaller States have obtained a great deal of assistance amounting to considerable sums of money over more than 40 years. The Grants Commission Bill was introduced in 1973. It is now the Grants Commission Act 1973. Its purpose was to allow local government authorities to appear before and obtain assistance from the Grants Commission. That was one of the pohcies of the Labor Party when in Opposidon, and I am bound to observe that it was one of the reasons why the Labor Party achieved office at the end of 1972. It achieved office for other reasons as well, but that was one of them. Assistance was needed then and is needed now. All honourable members would agree that, when one looks at the trend in the availability of finance to various units of government in Austraha, there is no doubt that finance made available to local government authorities to enable them to discharge their responsibilities has lagged behind that made available to both State and Federal governments. One of the purposes of this Bill is to increase from six to seven the number of members of the Commission. In his second reading speech the Special Minister of State (Mr Lionel Bowen) pointed out that the appointment of an adAustralian ditional member to the Local Government Divcouple ision is necessary to relieve the work load of four existing full time members, and I am well aware that the reasons stated for the appointwhose ment are accurate. The work load in this new tion of the Grants Commission has been substanhas tial. It has required a considerable amount of travel on the part of members of the Grants Commission. I am aware myself of the amount of travel that has been done throughout the State Queensland and, indeed, my own electorate. Therefore it is obviously essential that we appoint sufficient people under the Act to disincumbent, charge the duties that have to be undertaken. the Opposition does not oppose the Bill. However, we wish to make one or two obserIt vations. We are concerned that what is proposed here is another indication of the sort of empire building that has been going on at the Federal level since Labor came into office in 1972. We have seen a great proUferation of committees and commissions, not only in the area of the Grants Commission but also in many other areas, such as education. We make the point that when we are returned to Government we will not continue with the same format which the Labor Government has adopted in relation to making money available to local government authorities. We accept that local government authorities come within the constitutional responsibility of State governments, that they are the children of State governments. Indeed, the method of assisting local government authorities which has been adopted by the Australian Government has come in for a great deal of criticism. The report of the Grants Commission has by no means been a happy one for all local government authorities throughout Australia. When returned to government we will see that assistance is given to local authorities so that they are able to maintain a standard which is not appreciably below that of the larger and better established local authorities. But we wiU set up such a mechanism within the States where decisions can be reached at a level which is much closer to the people affected. We believe that a better judgment wiU be ensured and that therefore a greater degree of acceptability, efficiency and effectiveness will result from the decisions reached. The Opposition is concerned about clause 3 (b) of the Bill. Its purpose is to give to the Chairman of the Commission who, immediately before his appointment, was a judge of a Federal court or of the Supreme Court of a State or Territory, the same designation, rank, status and precedence as a judge of the Supreme Court of the Capital Territory. We wish to make a of observations in that regard. We are far the from convinced that a judge is necessarily the best person to put in charge of a commission main responsibUities lie within the field of sececonomics. The present Federal Government chosen to appoint a judge to that position. The Opposition accepts the view that the person concerned should have the rank, status and precedence of a judge, but we do not accept that he of should have the designation of a judge. I hope that honourable members realise that that is in no way meant to be a criticism of the present but as a matter of principle and bearSo ing in mind the number of commissions being set up by this Government we do not accept the fact that a judge who may accept such an appointment ought to continue to have that panicular designation. I shall be moving at the appropriate time an amendment to delete the word 'designation' from clause 3 (b). The purpose of the other major provision in the Bill is simply to update the Grants Commission Act so that it falls into line with the Remuneration Tribunals Act. We accept that that is now desirable as the Remuneration Tribunals Act now deals with the remuneration to be paid to the holders of public offices. The existhave ing remuneration provisions of the Grants Commission Act 1973 are obsolete. So we accept and give our suppon to the updating of that particular section of the Grants Commission Act. The Bill has our support, but we will take the opportunity at the Committee stage to move the amendment that I have outlined.",101
200,Mrs CHILD,THE ARTS AND MINISTER FOR THE INTERIOR,"We are delighted to learn that the Grants Commission Bill 1975 has the support of the Opposition. I would like to comment on one or two remarks made by the honourable member for MCPherson (Mr Eric Robinson). He expressed concern at what he calls empire building since Labor came to office, and I think he mentioned education as an example. It was of great necessity that a structure, an empire, be built which gave some attention to education in Australia because it had been starved by successive Liberal governments for many years. I was interested to hear that the Opposition will discontinue the format that we are using in making grants available to local government authorities. They are given free, without strings. have been told by councillors who have given evidence before the Grants Commission that they have been extremely delighted at the hearing they have received and at the extent to which they have been able to put and present their cases. I do not know that Melbourne would be any better situated than is Canberra for ascertaining the needs of Victorian local government authorities. If the Opposition intends to regard local government authorities as the children of the State governments, then I would say that the States have been starving their children for years - in fact, since Federation. The Grants Commission Bill provides for the appointment of a further full time member of the Grants Commission to relieve the heavy burden that has fallen on the four existing full time members of the Local Government Division of the Commission. I would point out that it is just coincidence that the present Chairman of the Commission, Mr Justice Else-Mitchell, is a judge. I do not think it is the intention of the Government constantly to appoint a judge to that position. I am sure that no one in this Parliament will oppose the Bill, as everyone must be aware of the tremendous amount of time that the commissioners have put into the hearing of evidence from those engaged in local government all over Australia. There are some 900 local government bodies in Australia, including semi-government authorities. Their submissions to the Commission have been sophisticated and detailed, and they given a lot of evidence to back up their submissions. As well as that, the commissioners travel quite extensively so that they can have a first hand look at many of the projects for which local governments bodies are seeking finance. I think that it would be true to say that the Grants Commission has rejuvenated interest by councillors and councils who for many years considered that they were quite invisible to both State and Federal authorities and governments. In fact, they have for so many years been neglected by previous governments and starved by State governments that it is a wonder that the men and women who voluntarily service local government bodies have had any enthusiasm left to give. One of the aims of this Government has not always been to upgrade the role of local government. Recent years have seen a resurgence of interest in that area of government that has long been the Cinderella of the 3 tiers of government in this country. Anything I might say in criticism of local government should not be taken as a criticism of the dedicated men and women who serve in the I cities, shires and municipalities of Australia. Indeed, they have fought for better local government, for better services, for a better financial deal, and they have fought against very heavy odds. Evidently they have now fought against their mother or father-whicheve r the States are presumed to be-if they are their children. There is much that they have accomplished and much that they have been prevented from accomplishing. The fault lies in the whole system of intergovernmental relation. The remedy lies in balancing the functions and the finances of the 3 levels of government-local , State and national. There is a resurgence of interest and concern for local government. It marks the end of a long era of public apathy. We have Uved through the years of cynical public indifference in council elections, in sullen resentment over the burden of increasing rates, and in irrational criticism of the services the councils have provided. Why can they not provide the services that people are now demonstrating they want? It is because they have been denied for far too long the means by which they might provide those services. Incredibly, local government was forgotten by our forefathers who framed the Constitution. It was again ignored when the nnanciai agreement between the Commonwealth and the States was drawn up. It was not until 1936 that the Loan Council began dealings with the borrowings of semi-government authorities. Since then more and more demands have been placed on local authorities, and at the same time their financial difficulties have grown. When it came into office this Government in moved to correct such an injustice-to correct system that had been allowed to worsen year year. For years nothing had been done to check the intolerable burden of rates and charges imposed on Australian families, on pensioners and on those who Uve on fixed incomes. We passed a new Grants Commission Act authorisand ing the Commission to inquire into applications for assistance by regional organisations of government. Assistance thus recommended by the Commission and approved by the Australian Government is paid to the States under section 96 of the Constitution, and passed on by them the organisations concerned. The Commission's recommendations have been universally acthetiermost cepted. All poltiical parties have implemented them. The Grants Commission is a respected body and I am quite sure that its commissioners are also respected, in spite of the criticism of political bias that was raised when the last grants were made. Recently the Government initiated the free grants under the Grants Commission, and last all year $56m was distributed amongst councUs without any strings at all. This Bill simply appoints a further Commission to share this workload. These 2 innovations have been widely acclaimed by those connected with local governand ment but one thing is needed desperately. Even though it is not contained in the Bill I intend voice it. It is that local government should have voice of its own on the Loan Council, At the Premiers Conference in 1973 the Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) proposed that local government have both a voice and a vote on the Loan CounBut cil and that the Australian Government be tainly. empowered to borrow money on behalf of local governments. This could have been effected quite simply by agreement between the Premiers and the Austrahan Government to amend the financial agreement. The States refused. We held a referendum. The people refused. But I still say that the Australian Government and the local adjourned. authorities should be able to deal directly with each other and in the pubUc interest/If if is good enough for the States and the Australian Government to deal directly with each other, why is it not good enough for the Australian Government to deal directly with local government? Why should local government not have the same opportunities to deal with the national Government and to participate fully in the system? This national Government has a responsibility to ensure that every level of government will be a position better to perform its assigned duties a for the better welfare of citizens wherever they by live. Anyone who has had the experience of unsewered suburbs, poor health services, inadequate local transport, neglected environmental standards, shortage of playing fields, shortage of community centres and opportunities for culture recreation knows that higher rates are not the answer. People no longer accept that they local must go without aU .these services. They no longer accept the need for ever increasing rates and charges. There' is a greater awareness of local government and a greater endorsement of to its role'. Local government faces a tremendous task. It is the grass roots of government and it is closely associated with its people. It cannot continue to serve the people adequately iii 1974-75 with the antiquatedfinancingfrom which it has suffered for decades. I beUe.ve that local government must have its own voice and vote on the Loan Council and that councillors in all cities, shires and municipalities should be fighting for a voice on the Loan Council. I believe that they must not be conned by the old argument that the federal Government wants to gobble them up. Until the voice vote on the Loan Council is obtained local governments will limp along getting further and to further in debt. I believe that local government a will be restrained and, indeed, crippled for generations if left in its present state. The Grants Commission gives some help. The grants can be used in any way the council needs to use them. this is only one avenue- a needed one, cerLoan Council representation would be the final and complete answer, the answer that will make worthwhUe the work that the men ""and women of Australia perform on local councUs. Debate (on motion by Mr Hodges) NA ' Constitutional Qualifications of Members of Parliament-Australia's Trade Routes Motion (by Mr Crean) proposed: That the House do now adjourn.",102
201,Mr CORBETT,ADJOURNMENT,"The question of the interpretation of the Constituuon relative to actions of members of Parhament which may put them in breach of the Constitution has recently received a considerable amount of publicity. Mr Daly-Why don't you resign, Jim?",104
202,Mr CORBETT,ADJOURNMENT,"I do not know of any way in which I have breached the Constitution, but I am very concerned about the situation in which many honourable members may find themselves. There may be many of us who are in breach of the Constitution without being aware of it. In any case it would be appropriate for any honourable member to look for a fair and just solution to a problem which has arisen in regard to possible breaches of the Constitution, and I look for the support of honourable members on both sides of the House in an endeavour satisfactorily to resolve this disturbing situation. The"" Prime Minister (Mr Whitlam) has stated: Now if wefindthat many of us have transgressed the Constitution and placed our seats in jeopardy, then the to ignore the Constituuon but to ask the people to The weakness of this approach is that there is no guarantee that the people would be prepared to amend the Constitution. The whole history of referenda in relation to amending the Constitution is that the Australian people are very reluctant to make any change. However, I think that this matter must be clarified. I feel that it is a very important question and one which could affect many honourable members. As I have said, as far as I am aware, I am not affected by it myself but I think that if we were to give some thought to the matter we might find that quite a few honourable members would be affected, and who knows who would be included. Quite a few honourable members might be in technical breach of the Constitution. I want to emphasise that I am referring only totechnicalbreaches of the Constitution or breaches that have occurred without honourable members being aware that their actions could be in breach of the Constitution and where no impropriety is associated with the action. I am concerned tiiat these breaches could be very widespread and could reach a position which the Prime Minister has called a farcical situation. If this is the case, then clearly the matter must be cleared up. The Government in the Senate has. proposed that a question currently under discussion should be referred to the Court of Disputed Returns for determination.",104
203,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,Order! Before the honourable gentleman goes too far I would point out that he is not entitled to debate in this House a question which is before the Senate.,104
204,Mr CORBETT,ADJOURNMENT,"I will accept your ruling on that, Mr Speaker. I will not refer to that matter insofar as it is concerned in the Senate. I believe that there is no real need for any matter which applies to this House to be referred to the Court of Disputed Returns to be resolved. I am at a loss to know why that course should be proposed, despite the statement this morning by the Prime Minister that this is a seemly way to do it. Section 47 of the Constitution makes it quite clear that it is for the Parliament itself to determine questions relating to the qualification of a member of this House to take his place in the Parliament. Section 47 states: Until the Parliament otherwise provides, any quesdon respecting the qualification of . . . a member of the House of Represen tativesThat applies to a senator as wellor respecting a vacancy in either House of the Parliament, and any question of a disputed elecdon to either House, shall be determined by the House in which the question arises. cure is not Although I have no legal training, that section amend it. seems quite clear and unambiguous to me. Any matters such as those that have been discussed in this House this morning of which I believe there could prove to be many is to be determined by the House concerned. It is quite true that the Commonwealth Electoral Act provides for such questions to be referred to the Court of Disputed Returns if the Parhament so resolves, but such a referral is not mandatory. I repeat that either House can itself deal with these matters and I submit that the House concerned should deal with matters such as the ones to which I have referred. I should Uke to suggest that the Parliament ought to work out some guidelines to help members and senators decide just where they stand in relation to the Constitution. Clearly, the provision in relation to this matter in the Constitution is wide and hard to interpret and we ought to have guidelines laid down. I put that suggestion forward in the hope that Parliament will give serious consideration to it. I am sure that all members of this House share my concern that this matter should be cleared up and cleared up in a proper way with reasonable expedition. I submit that members on both sides of this House should give serious consideration to the position in which they or their colleagues could find themselves, and if the Parliament can resolve the issue in a fair and satisfactory manner then I contend that the Parhament should take that action.",104
205,Mr DRURY,ADJOURNMENT," I want to express my concern regarding the future of Australia's trade routes, particularly our trade routes to Great Britain and Europe. To do this I must first refer briefly to certain aspects of the Middle East situation. A few weeks ago a South CaroUna Republican, Senator Jesse Helms, told the Umted States Senate that he agreed with the Administration decision that it was time for a reassessment of Middle East policy. A United States labour leader, George Meany) went further and urged a review of the entire policy of detente following the collapse of Middle East peace negotiations and communist gains in Portugal and in South-East Asia. Very shortly after those 2 statements were made, King Faisal of Saudi Arabia was assassinated. This tragedy heightened anxiety with regard to the Middle East, where at the best of times there is gree of uncertainty and tension. King Faisal's main objective strategically was to preserve Western influence in the Middle East and to exclude Soviet influence. The great strategic importance of the Middle East to Australia and to many other countries cannot be overstated. OU supplies, of course, of great significance, but I am thinking particuphotostat larly of our traditional trade route across the Indian Ocean, through the Red Sea and the Canal to the Mediterranean and thence to Great Britain and Europe, a trade route that unfortunain part: tely has been denied to us and to others for the past 8 years. The Soviet fleets in the Indian At Ocean and in the Mediterranean and the Black increasing. Sea could well be in a position to hinder if they desired the free use of the Suez Canal route when it is re-opened next June. Since the closure of the Suez Canal in 1967 our main trade route to BriPeople's tain and Europe has been via the Cape of Good Hope. As I see it, this route is an uncertain and deteriorating situation in the southern part of the African continent. I am convinced that the international pressures on that area are based primarily on strategic concepts and only secondarily on racial issues. I say that because racial issues also exist in quite a number of other countries that are not subjected to similar pressures. To Ulustrate my point, I refer to the strategic raUway built in recent years, with the help of Peking, from Dar-es-Salaam on the eastern coast of Africa right down into the southern part of Zambia. For what reason other than strategic reasons would China have played a major part in the construction of this raUway in the southern part of the African continent? If Australia were to be deprived of its vital trade route to Britain and Europe via the Cape of Good Hope, as well as the more direct route via the Suez Canal, then I put it that certainly we would be in a difficult and even dangerous situation. For very many years a significant proportion or our imports and exports haveflowedalong one or other of these 2 trade routes, and most of our migrants also have a high de- come to us across the Indian Ocean. FinaUy, with regard to the matter of detente to which I referred earlier, surely Australia and the rest of the free world should take careful note of a speech reported to have been made by the Premier of the People's RepubUc of China, Chou En-lai, at the Fourth National People's Congress are in Peking last January. I have in my hand a copy of News Bulletin No. 7503 dated 26 January 1975 issued by the People's Republic Suez of China. Time will permit me to quote only briefly from this buUetin. The reported text reads there is no detente, let alone lasting peace, in this world. present, the factors for both revolution and war are so I think we would aU agree that these are very disturbing words, to say the least, and if in fact there is no detente in the eyes of the leaders of the RepubUc of China then surely it is high time that the free world made a re-assessment of also threatened by the situation.

206,Mr BEAZLEY,ADJOURNMENT,"The answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows: There are several areas under my authority where activities associated with research and development work are undertaken. (a) The Australian Advisory Committee on Research and Development in Education. 1. All ten members are part-time.

The officers are employed in Canberra and the committee normally meets in Canberra. 3. The committee advises me on priorities in educational research and onfinancialsupport forresearchproposals. It initiates proposals and may guideresearchprojects which it funds, but does not conduct projects itself. 4. The 1974-1975 budget for funded projects is $700,000. In addition an estimated $62,000 is available to meet the committee's direct and indirect costs, of operation. 5. I decide the nature of projects for support on the advice of the committee, within the terms ofreferenceof the committee. (b) The Research and Investigation Committee of the Commission on Advanced Education. 1. All six members are part-time. The equivalent of 1.5 persons is employed full-tune as a secretariat. 2.

It does not conduct research projects itself. 4. Over the 1973-75 triennium $300,000 is available for grants to projects. The cost in salaries of the secretariat is about $ 15,000 in 1974-75. 5. All projects recommended for financial support require my approval. (c) The Curriculum Development Centre. 1. The Interim Council of the Curriculum Development Centre has a full-time chairman members. Eleven full-time staff are employed exclusively on the activities of the Centre. 2. Seven of the staff are located in Canberra and staff are located in Melbourne. The Centre is expand staff numbers considerably in the near future. NA upon notice were circulated: 3. The Centre's functions are: to undertake curriculum development tasks and to (Question No. 874) develop teaching and learning materials for use in schools; to commission and support curriculum and materials development; to display equipment and materials; to publish assessments and information about equipment and materials; to provide advisory services relating to curriculum and materials development; to arrange the printing and marketing of materials. 4. The Centre direcdy undertakes some curriculum development projects, and other outside projects are comor projects missioned and funded by the Centre. 5. Within its terms of reference all projects initiated by the Interim Council require my approval. (d) The Research Branch of the Department. 1. An average of 16 full-time staff. 2. Canberra. 3. The Branch conducts several in-house projects. Current projects in this category include a survey of the income and expenditure of tertiary students, studies relating to the enrolment and progress of tertiary students, and a survey of schools with high migrant density. The Branch also commissions and arranges for the funding of outside projects such as a project evaluating the Aboriginal Secondary Grants Scheme, the Tertiary Education Entrance Project, a project examining the unsettling effects of periodic movement faced by soldiers' children. There are also research projects on the English proficiency of migrant children and the bi-lingual teaching of Aboriginal children. 4. An estimated $600,000 in 1974-75 is being spent on activities associated with research and development. In addition the Branch administers the Australian Government's half share in the funding of the Australian Council for Educational Research. The budget for this item is $185,000 in 1974-75. 5. Major research projects conducted by the Branch and any research projects commissioned through it and conducted by outside agencies require my approval. Decisions on the remainder of research conducted by the Branch are made within the Department. Within other areas under my authority there are units which perform tasks which could beregardedas research and development, for example, the development of language teaching materials for migrants, within my Department. Some aspects of the functions of the Schools Commission are also related to research and development. The innovations program worth $7.2m in 1974 and 1975 is an example. It is difficult, however, to reasonably quantify the resources which can properly be attributed to research and development only. Other costs are not identifiable.
