29,Mr MORRISON,BILLS," This government: every February rolls around and time a new Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, before this parliament and asks for more money. put forward a budget, every year they blow and they ask this parliament for yet more taxpayers' money. Just to remind the House of this government's border protection failures, it is worth going government whose failure to manage our borders manage a budget. These two failures are hardwired, blow-out from the original budget, as revealed The following year, 2009-10, the blow-out in million. In 2010-11, the blow-out from the original 2011-12, the budget blow-out leapt to a whole estimate first advised by the government was government's original estimate of the expenditure exponentially gone to a whole new level. In will spend $2.2328 billion on asylum seeker original estimate, when the estimates for estimates, of $2.1263 billion. This is a level of border cost blow-out which government's failure on our borders. We know financial costs are also significant. They have as they see billions upon billions of dollars failure, drawing resources from other important funding-resources that, at the very least, would the stratospheric levels it has been A habit, a practice of border protection constantly underestimating the costs and constantly ask for more money. The cumulative budget blow-out of the increase in the refugee and the humanitarian is more than $6.5 billion over the last four Let us reflect on what the government have appropriation bills have come before this brought forward the appropriation bills, now sought $54 million extra for recurrent and $34 the following February of 2011, they came into we have some more?' They asked for $298.5 million $192.956 million for capital-a grand total for that is not committed to getting rid of it is Australia's social capital. We are a leafy, life, and I am proud of the investments has become an annual event under this every February the immigration minister-this taking the place of the last one-comes It happens every single year. Every year they that budget and every year they come back here failure in the area of budgeting for their back and just looking at their history. This is a has directly translated into its failure to one to the other. In 2008-09, the budget in the additional estimates, was $2,257,000. that budget from the original estimate was $167 estimate for that year was $765 million. In new level, and the variation from the original $1.3256 billion-that was the blow-out from the for that year. In the current year it has 2012-13, the government is now estimating that it management costs. That is a variation from their this year were first published in the forward has no precedent. There are many costs to this of the chaos, we know of the tragedy, but the gone beyond testing the patience of Australians having to be sucked into this whirlpool of border objectives that a government should be be ensuring that the deficit would not be at at under this government in recent years. failure, has led to this habit and practice of having to come before this parliament and as at this point in time, when the costs program to 20,000 are taken into account, years. $6.5 billion-that is the level of blow-out. asked for over the last few years as these parliament. Following the 2009-10 budget, they acts, No. 3 and No. 4, and in those bills they million extra for capital-some $88 million. In this parliament and they said, 'Please, sir, can in recurrent appropriations and a further that year of an extra $491.5 million on top of what had already been appropriated to the following year, in February 2012-groundhog extra $332.546 million in recurrent and a further $341,815,000 extra to cover the recurring through asylum seeker management-year on year on year.

Once again, here we are in February, November, and the government is now asking, $64.7 million in recurrent and $32.4 million total of these additional appropriation acts As we reflect on those numbers, it is the of their border failure. They are failures which you just can't go around asking for that much notice that you always have your hand out to in this area. Asking for that much money in this again, and the parliament is asked to shell government have gone even further on this bill, were released last Friday are a record. There $85 million for asylum seeker management inherited management of these issues, to the years. Remarkably, next year they say that are going to fall by a billion dollars, and then another billion dollars. Within the space of cost for asylum seeker management by $2 billion. You would have to think that a reduction thing: that they had actually stopped the portfolio additional estimates, which was saying years, down to $871 million and $833 government in those out years to just $451 question in estimates yesterday, through Senator when you stop the boats?' The answer was government have missed one fatal point, and that in place which stop the boats before you bank failed to do that consistently.

But get this right. They can stop putting across these measures when they prepare the estimates to table the letter that was sent to the Secretary and the Secretary to the Department of the Treasury highlighting these very points that there has upon which costings will be based.

Not only is it mean spirited; it is that the Labor Party has had to face since out of the migration debate. What we have seen is that, for political purposes, asylum seeker centre with no cooperation from both sides of of the country.

Both sides of the because they are a finetuning, a time of the budget. Before, the budget used to be in September; now it is in May, and you finetuning is there. The basic philosophy behind this government the protection of jobs and job creation. That we are dealing with in the appropriation bills additional appropriations there would be job effect on our community. The proudest thing that I saw at the time government was the infusion of money into included Building the Education Revolution, Liberal and National Party electorates, all jobs, but it also created infrastructure that communities, and the communities are repaying Social housing was another classic example.

Of course the is that we have placed importance on jobs, comes through in the additional expenditures that that are before us today, because without those cuts, and those job cuts would have a multiplier of the global financial crisis when we were in our community on a host of programs that where schools throughout Australia, in Labor, had capital expenditure put on them. That created created better learning environments in all the investment that the government put in.

In a difficult area the a little bit annoyed at the cant and hypocrisy members on the other side, because they advantage in that human misery.

It is always difficult to follow a quality I will do my best to bring to this chamber an very relevant to my state of Western Australia. At the outset I want to cut to the chase damaging Australia's mining sector. Why is it out of existence. I will explain this as we rather than hinder the nation's most important advantage. However, the policies produced by that they are uninterested in supporting this both the Rudd and Gillard governments have multinational miners BHP, Xstrata and Rio have produced mines and resource companies Forrest. They should be applauded rather than them by the Labor Party, particularly the They should be applauded rather than scorned. We have spent a lot of time in this place I will not spend too much time on it tonight carbon tax is a direct assault on the mining particularly Western Australia, as that is where resources and mining. We are all aware today MCGowan, has tried to dissociate himself from want her in the state for the state election and to her policies. In fact, he has made it quite a carbon tax. He is also dissociating himself taxation policies take a direct aim at our clear that he is very aware of this and this Australia and dare I say Queensland. As Kevin Rudd, the member for Griffith, has the Treasurer, Wayne Swan, as a result of Ken to the then Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, and Wayne Swan, the Treasurer, sold to him in details because it has been enunciated beautifully in the fact that it has raised only 10 per cent first 12 months on their modelling it would raise programs that will be paid for by this $2 billion. whole lot of other wages support but in Western program to produce roads to the airport and be one of the largest road projects in Western billion dollars, which they are going to open in tax. Let us take a middle figure of $700 million only raised $126 million in its first six months, the taxpayers of Australia are going to pay for anyone's measure. It is just ridiculous that this massive amount of money from a mining saying it is a variable tax so it will go up and down. and say that this Labor government is intent on intent on doing that? Because it wants to tax it go. Any responsible government should support industry and Australia's unique economic this government have made it abundantly clear industry in any meaningful way. Furthermore, shown a preference to do backroom deals with rather than dealing with Australian people who from scratch such as Gina Rinehart and Twiggy the disgraceful attacks that have been made on Treasurer, the member for Lilley, Wayne Swan. exposing the flaws associated with a carbon tax so other than to explain to this House that this and resources industry of Australia and most of the action is happening in terms of that the West Australian Labor leader, Mark the Prime Minister, Julia Gillard. He does not he does not want her over there at all in relation clear in the last few days that he does not support from federal Labor's mining tax. Federal Labor's mining sector. Indeed, Mr MCGowan has made it tax is a taxation of envy on states like Western pointed out today, this was a tax generated by Henry's investigations into taxation. He sold it Kevin Rudd today has said that this is a tax that a flawed way. We will not go through the whole by the shadow Treasurer, Joe Hockey, today of its income predictions. They said that in the $2 billion. They attached to it a whole lot of Those include not only superannuation and a Australia, dear to our heart, there is a in association with the airport which is going to Australia, closer to a billion dollars than half a July this year. It is all dependent on the mining and it is based on the mining tax and that has who is going to pay for it? Not the mining tax, it. They have fallen short in their estimates by they would come out and suggest they would raise tax which they now put this florid language on, When it went down, I could understand that. record heights, and the spot price is up to $190 variable and not raising the So at the end of the day, yes, Kevin Rudd tax. It is the responsibility of the Treasurer Minister Julia Gillard with the three major mid-caps. Fortescue Metals is a company that has been vilified by this government because resources industry. But you hear the Treasurer successful like Gina Rinehart. He lambastes thing by employing Australians, paying a lot people in the mining sector.

To start a mine, a business, a resource Think about South Africa, other places in Africa, South America-they are far cheaper because this committee is about to ask this government exemptions. This decision by the Labor government government in 1986 imposed the fringe benefits remote communities. That has been blamed said that if you gave concessions to people pay full tax on it; you could not get the subsidised a worker's house in Wickham, Karratha So it generated a proliferation of fly-in fly-out electorates like mine and the rest of Western people buy a house in electorates like mine for a week and they continually supply this projects, which generates billions of dollars rest of Australia.

48,Mr SYMON,BILLS," I speak in support 2013 and the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2012-2013 appropriation of just over $1.27 billion being of topics and subjects. Some are things which quite out of the box. One of the first things that I picked up additional expenditure for the now superseded Redundancy Scheme, GEERS, which, although topped up by $48 million to cover claims that that I have been a critic of GEERS for many, that. What we have done now with the changeover Entitlements Guarantee is put in a system embedded within the administrative scheme scheme was introduced by the current opposition time as Minister for Employment, Workplace 2001-the very same member who proclaimed would not like to have him as my friend.

Since 1 July, for been two-thirds of the 15 per cent increase business, according to the Australian Industry in electricity prices attributable exclusively to intent is to increase electricity prices. The carbon tax does not work on the supply side-we see Australia's emissions going up from 560 work on the demand side-it causes considerable pain. In Western society, electricity is close to service. What does that mean? It means that cases, they are not in a position to make significant means that it is the pensioners, the small-business parents and the farmers-those most vulnerable-who much greater part of their expenditure So this is a tax which not only fails to achieve emissions according to every one of the Australia's emissions go up-but it also specifically Again, there is no debate or doubt about that. pay a far higher proportion of their income That is the nature of it. It is impossible to target the lowand medium-income earners. That only need to go back to all of the papers review or the government's own analysis. So, against that background, we have heard hours, pointing out that this tax does have an where jobs are being lost and where the carbon job losses and aluminium job losses. We are being lost.

There is no great is no compensation package for the new homebuyers. tax does not change practice but does change And then, to make matters worse, what we Senate is two new findings. Firstly, we have carbon tax advertising which is available, but tendered, so the government is simply accepting them. Only those who had the inside word on it. Only those who were in a position to submissions would know that there was a market more than $110 million of total advertising another $2 million-but reserved families around the country the carbon tax has in electricity prices; for small and medium Group, there has been a 14½ per cent increase the carbon tax. So its purpose, its design and its problem with that, of course, is twofold. The know that the government's own estimates million to 637 million tonnes. And it does not the most inelastic of goods. It is an essential people pay higher prices but, in the vast bulk of changes to their overall consumption.
