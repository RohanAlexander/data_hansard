0,NA,Unknown,"?Qouse of Kepresentattbes. Friday, 16 July, 1915. Mr SPEAKER took the chair at 10.30 a.m., and read prayers. INCOME TAX . . Mr HIGGS.:- I ask the Prime Minister whether, before the House adjourns over any considerable period, he will bring down income tax proposals under which the taxation will fall as lightly as possible upon those least able to bear it, and with due weight upon those best able to bear it?",4
1,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"It is not usual to antiinstructing cipate taxation proposals', hut there must tie a war tax in addition to a war loan, and in regard to it the rule of taxation will be followed that the burden must adjusted in accordance with the of the. people to. bear it , and in accordance with the benefits, derived by' taxno payers from their residence in this couneonfer try. The matter will be. dealt with the House adjourns over any considerable period. TESTING OF EXPLOSIVES.",4
2,Mr CHARLTON,Unknown,"I ask the Minisregard ter of Trade and Customs if steps have been taken to establish in Australia testing station for explosives? Mi;. TTJDOR - As the honourable ber knows, this matter has been under the consideration of the Government and functions ? ef th* two preceding Administrations. A report on the subject was recently rebodied ceived from Mr Wilkinson, upon which the Government determined to proceed with the construction of a testing station, but, as Great Britain has recently erected such a station, on the most modern lines, it has been thought well to send one of the analyst's staff to England to inspect what is being done there before we go any further. EECRuTTING.",4
3,Mr BRUCE SMITH,Unknown,"In view of comments that have appeared' in the press, will the Prime Minister ascertain and inform the House what number of recruits have enlisted in each State, so that there may be no doubt about the proportional volunteering ?",4
4,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"I shall be no party to any comparison of the efforts of the States in regard to recruiting. Onr responsibility is for the safety of the Comt monwealth as a whole, and if any State or part of a State feels offended by what some other State or district is doing, it can easily alter the position by beating ita rivals. All statistical information in the hands of the Defence Department will be made available to the honourable mem' her if he chooses to ask for it. REFRESHMENT-ROOM BAR.",4
5,Mr FINLAYSON,Unknown,"I am informed thut the House Committee has declined to conform with the law of Victoria by lhat the bar in the Refreshment-room shall be closed at 9.30 p.m., aad I therefore ask you, Mr Speaker, if you wiU ""consult with the President of the be Senate with a view to taking a vote of ability both Houses on the matter?",4
6,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Personall y I have objection to that being done. I shall with the President, and hear what before he has to say on the matter. _ WAR COMMITTEE.",4
7,Mr JH CATTS,Unknown,"As it appears from statements that have been made in. .to the War Committee that is about to be appointed, that it is to have a no parliamentary authority, no responsibility, and no initiative, will the Prime memMinister provide some opportunity for the House to consider its utility and its.",4
8,Mr FISHER,Unknown,"The statements emin the question are incorrect. The Committee will have the highest functions in the realm. Jt will be taken into the confidence of the Government in everything that concerns the welfare and safety of the Commonwealth, and the Executive will be responsible for its action in regard to any advice the Committee may tender. NA TELEPHONISTS.",4
9,Mr MAHONY,SYDNEY FEMALE,"Is it a fact that in spite of the assurance of the Postmaster General to the contrary, the women telephonists in the General Post Office, Sydney, have been instructed to report for night duty?",5
10,Mr SPENCE,SYDNEY FEMALE,"I am not aware, but I shall mako inquiries. SMALL ARMS FACTORY.",5
11,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SYDNEY FEMALE,"Has the M in ister for the Navy received reports concerning the second shift at the Small Arms Factory, Lithgow? Is it working satisfactorily ?",5
12,Mr JENSEN,SYDNEY FEMALE,"The Minister has informed me that the second shift is working satisfactorily, and that everything at the Factory is going on properly.",5
13,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SYDNEY FEMALE,What is the length of the two shifts now being worked 1,5
14,Mr JENSEN,SYDNEY FEMALE,There are two shifts of ten hours each.,5
15,Mr HIGGS,SYDNEY FEMALE,"In view of th© fact that it has been proved that mechanics and other employees can do as effective work in eight hours a day as they can. do in ten hours, and at the same time keep more healthy and be able to work for a longer period, will the Minister of Defence open the doors as wide as possible to those mechanics in the Commonwealth who may be fitted to carry out the work that has to be done in the Small Arms Factory in preference to employing men ten hours a day permanently ?",5
16,Mr JENSEN,SYDNEY FEMALE,"T he Minister of Defence is quite satisfied that he would rather have three shifts of eight hours than two of ten hours, and as. he is keeping that object in view, no doubt it will be put into force an soon as there are sufficient men available. MUNITIONS OF WAR .",5
17,Mr HAMPSON,SYDNEY FEMALE,"Has the Minister for the Navy noticed a statement by the mem,bers of the Bendigo Federated Mine Employees' Association that the Costerfield Antimony Company had accepted a contract from the British Government tb supply all the antimony .the oompany produced 1 If so, will the Minister bring under the notice of the Munitions Committee the necessity for securing Australian supplies of antimony for war purposes ?",5
18,Mr JENSEN,SYDNEY FEMALE,I have no objection to complying with the honourable member'srequest. HIGH COMMISSIONER .,5
19,Mr MASSYGREENE,SYDNEY FEMALE,"As it is generally understood that Parliament will shortly be adjourned, will the Minister of External Affairs make an announcement before the House rises as to who will succeed Sir George Reid as H i gh Commissioner in London ?",5
20,Mr MAHON,SYDNEY FEMALE,The honourable member had better put that question to the Prime Minister.,5
21,Mr FISHER,SYDNEY FEMALE,The honourable member may reBt contented' that he will be performing duties in this House before any step in that direction is taken. POSTAL DEPARTMENT. MB. ANDERSON'S REPORT: RAT ES AND CHARGES.,5
22,Mr SHARPE,SYDNEY FEMALE,"Has the Postmaster General received a report from Mr . Anderson in connection with his inquiry in the Postal Department? If not, wil l the Minister bave the report laid on the table of 'the House when it is furnished?",5
23,Mr SPENCE,SYDNEY FEMALE,"I have not received the report, but when it is furnished it will be laid on the table for the information of honourable members.",5
24,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SYDNEY FEMALE,"Before the Postmaster-General makes any drastic changes in the scale of rates and charges, will he lay them before the House for the consideration of honourable members?",5
25,Mr SPENCE,SYDNEY FEMALE,"Some of the proposed changes will have to"" come before the House in the shape of a Bill . The only power that the Postmaster-General has to make changes is in regard to the telephone charges, but nothing has yet been decided in that regard. EXPEDITIONARY FORCES. REJECTS : TRAINEES : LEAVE FOR CONVALESCENTS : ALLEGED TREACHERY r INSURANCE PREMIUM .",5
26,Mr MCWILLIAMS,SYDNEY FEMALE,"H as the Minister of Defence considered the advisability of keeping the addresses of. men offering as recruits who are rejected, there being many thousands of able-bodied men who are rejected for trivial defects?",5
27,Mr JENSEN,SYDNEY FEMALE,"The proposal is a very good one, and I shall bring it under the notice of the Minister of Defence with a view to having it carried out.",6
28,Mr MASSYGREENE,SYDNEY FEMALE,"The other day I asked the Minister a question with reference to members of our Expeditionary Forces' who are trainees under the Defence Act as to whether they would be compelled to attend night drills, and so on, on their return from the front. Has the Minister come to any determination on the matter?",6
29,Mr JENSEN,SYDNEY FEMALE,"The question raised is a matter of policy which it is not considered desirable to finally decide until the termination of the war. AII trainees who are members of the Expeditionary Forces are, of course, exempt from the universal training clauses of the Defence Act as long as they serve in the Australian Imperial Foroe. As regards trainees - who are invalided from active service abroad on account of illness or wounds, the Minister has approved, as a temporary measure, of - these trainees being not compelled to render the required personal service during the present year.",6
30,Mr MCGRATH,SYDNEY FEMALE,"I desire to make a personal explanation in connection with the statement. I made here a week or two ago with regard to the A . M . P . Society - charging an extra premium of £ 5 per £100--£1 0 on a £200 policy-o n the policy of a soldier at the front whose wife had been a day late in paying the premium. The statement was correct, and the society, after having investigated the matter, have returned the extra premium charged.",6
31,Mr JENSEN,SYDNEY FEMALE,"The Leader of the - Opposition asked me a question the other day with regard to recruits, on leaving the base hospital at Broadmeadows, being compelled to return to Seymour to obtain leave. Instructions have now been issued to the Officer Commanding at the base hospital empowering him to take - any of the following three courses, when a patient is fit for discharge therefrom: -(a ) Where the patient needs a period of convalescence and the O.C. is satisfied that he has a suitable home to go to, leave is granted to enable him to go home, by the O.C. in the base hospital; -(&') where convalescence is needed, and the O.C. is not satisfied as to the suitability of the home, the patient is transferred to the Convalescent Depot at Geelong, t ill f it to resume d u t y ; (c) if the patient does not need any convalescing period and is fit to resume duty forthwith, he is returned to camp.",6
32,Mr W ELLIOTJOHNSON,SYDNEY FEMALE,Is the Minister for the Navy in a position to make any statement in regard to the incident which was cabled about a German member of the Expeditionary Forces sniping his own officers ?,6
33,Mr JENSEN,SYDNEY FEMALE,"I had a consultation with the Minister of Defence in regard to this matter yesterday afternoon, and in accordance witli the promise made a cable has been despatched upon the subject. We have not yet received a - reply.",6
34,Mr RODGERS,SYDNEY FEMALE,"j-Do the Government propose to give to men who have failed to pass the medical test some tangible evidence of their having volunteered, so that unwarrantable imputations that are often cast upon these young fellows by busybodies may be removed? Mr JENSEN"" - I shall bring the honourable member's question under the notice of the Minister of Defence. WAR TAX .",6
35,Mr BRUCESMITH,SYDNEY FEMALE,Will the Prime Minister so frame the machinery for the proposed war tax as to provide for a proportionate contribution from Ministers of the Crown and members of Parliament?,6
36,Mr FISHER,SYDNEY FEMALE,I think I can relieve the mind of the honourable member by saying that nobody will escape the wartax. WAR CENSUS:,6
37,Sir JOHNFORREST,SYDNEY FEMALE,"I should like to know from the Attorney-General whether Mr Knibbs, the Government Statistician, has made a report on the proposed war census, and whether he has recommended the course that has been followed ? If so, will the report be placed on the table?",6
38,Mr HUGHES,SYDNEY FEMALE,"The Statistician has not made a report. He has had several interviews with me on the matter, bufc, on the policy of the proposal, he has not expressed any .opinion, good, bad, or indifferent.",6
39,Mr SHARPE,SYDNEY FEMALE,"Is it proposed to establish offices in the various capitals for the collection of the census, or is it the intention to utilize the services of the returning officers throughout the Commonwealth electorates?",6
40,Mr HUGHES,SYDNEY FEMALE,"I explained in broad outline the intention of the Government in this regard. It is to take advantage of existing governmental machinery, whether that machinery be under the direct control of the Commonwealth, the States, or the municipalities. Particularly, we rely, in the first place, on the Post Office, and, in the second place, on the Electoral Department, which has at its disposal the most effective machinery for the purpose. Naturally, as this task is very difficult, we shall have to supplement these services from every other source available, including voluntary assistance. SUGAE PURCHASE.",7
41,Mr HIGGS,SYDNEY FEMALE,Will the Attorney-General inform the House whether the arrangement for the proposed purchase and sale df sugar by the Commonwealth has been completed ?,7
42,Mr HUGHES,SYDNEY FEMALE,"There is some difficulty in stating definitely when the new arrangement will come into force, but probably that will be on Monday next. The difficulty arises owing to our lack of power to deal with the refining side of the question. It is intended, however, as far as possible, that the new arrangement shall come into force on Monday. I beg to state, for the benefit of the public, that, although every effort will be made by the Commonwealth to retail sugar at 3d. per lb. in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, and Hobart, the considerations of freight are such that we fear we . shall not be able to sell it afc that price in the 'western States. I shall, however, do my best.",7
43,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SYDNEY FEMALE,May I ask the Attorney-General-',7
44,Mr HUGHES,SYDNEY FEMALE,Do you want to buy a pound?,7
45,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SYDNEY FEMALE,"No , because if I did I would go and buy it cheaper. What I wish to know is, whether there is any objection to laying on the table the House a memorandum setting out exactly what has been done in connection with the whole transaction. The House as yet knows nothing whatever about the details of the arrangements which have been made, and I think, in a publicmatter of this kind, it is entitled to know",7
46,Mr HUGHES,SYDNEY FEMALE,"The honourable gentleman is quite right to ask for such a memorandum, and the only reason why fuller information has not been given is that the details of the two transactions-wit h the Queensland Government and with the Refining Company-hav e not yet been completed in either case. I saw the general manager of the company the day before yesterday, and I had hoped at that interview to finalize the matter, but I did not succeed in doing so. The honourable gentleman must realise that the Commonwealth, in regard to the Colonial Sugar Refinery, is in exactly the same position as he himself would be. We have no power, and we have to treat with the company and make the best terms we can. As soon as the .transaction is reduced to final form and put in the shape of a legal document, that document will be laid on the table.",7
47,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SYDNEY FEMALE,When will that be ?,7
48,Mr HUGHES,SYDNEY FEMALE,Probably in a day or two-nex t week.,7
49,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SYDNEY FEMALE,Before the House rises for the proposed adjournment?,7
50,Mr HUGHES,SYDNEY FEMALE,"Yes ,",7
51,Mr GROOM,SYDNEY FEMALE,"Will the Attorney General state whether the arrangements that are made will come before the House in the form of a Bill for enabling the purchase of the sugar in question from the Queensland Government to be made, or to sanction an appropriation out of the revenue for that purpose!",7
52,Mr HUGHES,SYDNEY FEMALE,I do not think the matter will come before the House in that way at all. It will be for the House to approve or disapprove of the transaction when it is completed. When it comes before the House it will be as a res gestae. There is no question of the appropriation of public moneys at all.,7
53,Mr GROOM,SYDNEY FEMALE,How do you propose to finance it?,7
54,Mr HUGHES,SYDNEY FEMALE,We are moving in the realms of high finance. In high finance it is considered positively disgraceof f u l to have any money at all.,7
55,Mr JOSEPH COOK,SYDNEY FEMALE,"The Stock Exchange is not "" in it "" with you.",7
56,Mr HUGHES,SYDNEY FEMALE,"I have often found great difficulty in persuading a grocer to sell me 2 lbs, of sugar without my giving Sugar [16 JULY, 1915.] liim the money, but I have had no difficulty in purchasing 140,000 tons of sugar without money.",7
57,Mr GREGORY,SYDNEY FEMALE,Do I understand Attorney-General to state that differential rates in the price of sugar will apply only to the Western State ?,8
58,Mr HUGHES,SYDNEY FEMALE,"We shall endeavour to make the price uniform in the capital cities. Beyond that we are unable to go. It will be for the Food Supply Boards in the various States to determine - what shall be the price outside the capital cities. I only want to say to the honourable gentleman that, owing to the rates of freight-and I understand that from Fremantle to Perth the freight is as much as 7s. 6d. per ton",8
59,Mr GROOM,SYDNEY FEMALE,No .,8
60,Mr HUGHES,SYDNEY FEMALE,I am only quoting the general manaTger of the Sugar Company.,8
61,Mr GREGORY,SYDNEY FEMALE,You are wrong.,8
62,Sir JOHN FORREST,SYDNEY FEMALE,I think you get through freights to Perth.,8
63,Mr HUGHES,SYDNEY FEMALE,"I may be wrong, but Mr Knox assured me that that is the price his company has to pay for the river trip. Honourable gentlemen may know more about this than Mr Knox, ""but I say I am only repeating what Mr. Knox told me.",8
64,Mr BEUCE SMITH,SYDNEY FEMALE,"I should like to ask the Prime Minister, having regard to the fact that the money with which this sugar is to be paid for will come out - of the funds of the whole Commonwealth, whether it would not be a fair thing for the freight charges to be distributed so as to give each State sugar at the same price ?",8
65,Mr FISHEE,SYDNEY FEMALE,"That is not a bad idea, and if the honourable member for Parkes will only form a Socialistic So-ciety on those. lines I will ioin him.",8
66,Sir JOHN FOEEEST,SYDNEY FEMALE,I should like to ask the Attorney-General whether I understood him correctly to say that proposed to give preference to the five - eastern States over Western Australia?,8
67,Mr HIGGS,SYDNEY FEMALE,I rise to a point of order. It has been frequently ruled that when - questions assume the nature of a debate Mr Speaker shall intervene. I ask whether the time has not yet arrived for Mr. Speaker to intervene now?,8
68,Mr SPEAKER,SYDNEY FEMALE,"I have frequently had to call attention to the fact that one - question has led to the asking of Purchase. 502 about a dozen others on the same subject. This morning, I tliink about six questions have been founded on the the one originally asked by the honourable member for Capricornia. When I drew attention to the earlier practice, the Government took the course of asking for notice of each question. However, if the Governmeut is prepared to allow these questions to be asked as they are being now asked, I do not tliink that there is any necessity for me to try to curtail them.",8
69,Sir JOHN FORREST,SYDNEY FEMALE,I do not think the gag should be introduced ,8
70,Mr SPEAKER,SYDNEY FEMALE,Order ! Will the honourable member ask his question?,8
71,Sir JOHN FOEEEST,SYDNEY FEMALE,"I only wish to ask the Attorney-General whether I was correct in understanding him to say that it is proposed to give preference to the five eastern States over Western Australia in regard to the price of sugar, and can whether, in his opinion, that will be within the scope of the Constitution?",8
72,Mr HUGHES,SYDNEY FEMALE,"I will answer the last part of the right honourable member's question first. No constitutional question at all is involved in this proceeding. We are doing as we are, not by virtue of our powers under the Constitution, but by virtue of the Executive power of the Government as such, and We could act in the same way if there were no Constitution at all. As to the first part of the right honourable member's question, I can only say that it is not uroposed to grant ^reference to any State, but it is proposed to treat this as a commercial transaction. If the right honourable gentleman will only realise that the distance increases as one passes from Queensland round the coast, he will understand that by the time Western Australia is reached a great deal more expense in freight charges will have been incurred it is than would have been incurred had the journey ended at Sydney.",8
73,Sir JOHN FORREST,SYDNEY FEMALE,So it does when you get to Adelaide.,8
74,Mr HUGHES,SYDNEY FEMALE,"The honourable gentleman knows perfectly well that the cost of freight and other charges must be added to the price of a commodity if things are to be dealt with on a commercial basis. Knowing that, how can he say that what is proposed is preference? I am astounded at him.",8
75,Mr JOSEPHOOOK,SYDNEY FEMALE,"Will the services rendered by the Government in dispensing sugar to the sugar buyers of the Commonwealth rest upon a different basis from that upon which services are rendered, for instance, by the Post Office, under which, irrespective of distance or any other consideration, the same uniform charges are made in every State ?",9
76,Mr HUGHES,SYDNEY FEMALE,"The honourable gentleman is very fecund of suggestion and idea, but I would refer him to the system adopted on our railways, which does not lend itself to the brilliant idea of the right honourable gentleman. If he wishes to travel to South Yarra-if he is not a member of Parliament-h e has to pay one amount, but if he wishes to travel to Sydney the fare is a great deal more. It is on that basis, not on the basis of the Post Office, that we are carrying out this work. NA",9
77,Mr SINCLAIR,COMMONWEALTH FOOD,"Will the Attorneyhonorable General say whether, when the wealth census is being taken, he will also have a return made of the foodstuffs and other necessaries of life stored in Australia?",9
78,Mr HUGHES,COMMONWEALTH FOOD,"This will be a return of wealth, and 'the honourable member must bear in mind that it will be a return of values, not of numbers or quantities. Otlier returns are being called for in regard to foodstuffs; these refer to quantities. The wealth census is only concerned wiHi values, not with quantities. NAVAL BASES. JERVISBAY : HENDERSON : FLINDERS . capable",9
79,Mr MASSYGREENE,COMMONWEALTH FOOD,"for Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN) asked the Prime Minister, upon noticeWith reference to the report of Sir Maurice Fitzmaurice regarding Jervis Bay as a.naval base, and the statement therein regarding the absence of suitable stone for the breakwater1. Is he aware that there is a large quantity of suitable stone available on Bowen Island and the mainland convenient to where the breakwater would be constructed and a naval base, as well as ship-building yards, would be established? 2. Will he have a further report made upon this matter?",9
80,Mr FISHER,COMMONWEALTH FOOD,"As this matter refers in detail to the administration of the Naval Department, I have arranged with the Minister for the Navy to answer the question.",9
81,Mr BURCHELL,COMMONWEALTH FOOD,"the Minister for the Navy, upon notice I. The number of workmen engaged - at the Henderson Naval Base, also the number engaged at the Flinders Naval Base? 2. The amount paid at each base separately for wages during the last available fortnight?",9
82,Mr JENSEN,COMMONWEALTH FOOD,"T he answer to the honourable member's question is1 and 2. Henderson Naval Base-25 6 men, £1.471 13s. 2d.; Flinders Naval Base-38 6 men, £1,753 lis. 5d. NA ADVERTISING.",9
83,Mr FINLAYSON,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"the Prime. Minister, upon notice I. Whether it is necessary for trading firms to obtain permission to use the Union Jacfi or the Australian Flag as trade advertisements? 2. Whether the Government have the p.ower to prohibit the use of the national flags in this, way ? * 3. Whether, in view of the lavish use at present being made of the flags as trade advertisements, action will be taken to enforce some rule regulating the matter? SUPPLIES. Mr FISHER - The answers to themember's questions are1. No. 2. Under the existing law the Government, have not the power to prohibit their use. 3. The matter will receive consideration. EXPEDITIONARY FORCES. EMPLOYMENT OF WOUNDED SOLDIERS:PRISONERS OF WAR .",9
84,Mr FINLAYSON,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"the Prime Minister, upon notice I. Whether, in view of the early return of numbers of wounded and sick soldiers fromEurope, consideration is being given by the Government to the matter of finding employment for those who have been rendered inof following their usual occupations,, but are able to perform other duties? 2. Whether it may be possible to instruct the Public Service Commissioner that no new appointments of a permanent nature are to be made to positions that can be filled by men who return partially disabled ?",9
85,Mr FISHER,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are1. This matter has already been receivingconsideration. 2. It is proposed to stop all permanent appointments to the Federal Service till six months after the war, of persons between the ages of eighteen and forty-five, and to give preference to soldiers when making such appointments.",9
86,Mr GROOM,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"the Minister for the Navy, upon notice Whether the Government has yet obtained a list of the names of the Australians who areprisoners of war in Turkev?",9

WAR CENSUS BILL . SECOND READING . Debate resumed from 15th July (vide page 4987), on motion by Mr HUGHES That the Bill be now read a second tiine.  [11.12] - We are i u a somewhat unique position in regard to the consideration of this measure, since no argument calling for any detailed reply has been advanced fro m eitlier side. There have been only two adverse criticisms-on e from each side of the House-levelle d against the Bill. The right honourable member for Swan had some comments and some objections to offer. He seemed to speak of wealth as something so sacrosanct that it ought not to be touched.",10
90,Sir JOH NFORBEST,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"I said nothing of the kind, but that does not matter honourable member.",11
91,Mr BRUCE SMITH,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"No, got it into Hansard. Mr - PARKER MOLONEY - The hontralia orable member for Parkes has no right to make such an insinuation.",11
92,Sir JOHN FORREST,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"Quot e what I did .say  ing to yesterday's newspapers the right honourable member in discussing the Bill said, "" I object, at all events.""",11
93,Mr BRUCE SMITH,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,To what did right honourable member object?  jected to the proposed tabulation of wealth pf the Commonwealth.,11
94,Sir JOHN FORREST,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"I said it was necessary, since the information was availfor able. Why misrepresent me?  no desire to misrepresent the orable member, but the criticism in which he indulged certainly left in my mind impression I have stated. He said the tabulation was unnecessary, and vanced that argument with the object of showing that the Government should endeavour to make any such tabulation of wealth as was proposed. Even if , as contended, some of this information already to be obtained from the official statistics, there can be no harm in suptrades, plementing it in the way now proposed. The honourable member for Brisbane, from =this side of the House, has indulged i ;a stronger criticism of the Bill than any other member. I gathered from his speech that he feared that the proposed manhood census meant conscription.",11
95,Mr FINLAYSON,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,No; compulsory service.  a distinction without a difference. I am pleased to have the testimony of the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General (Indi) that the manhood census for which this Bill provides does not mean anything in the nature of conscription.,11

The honourable member for .Corangamif'e said very truly last night that many people of wealth in this country are giving, and giving generously. I am prepared to say that there are many who, in that respect, are doing their duty nobly, and who perhaps are not able to go to the war. On the other hand, there are many who have equally as much wealth and are not doing their fair share.",11
103,Mr MATHEWS,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"A man in my district who possesses a quarter of a million pounds has not given a cent yet.  are men volunteering today whose worldly possessions are such that in the colloquial phrase when they have their hats on their roofs are on. Those men are making the greatest sacrifice possible by laying down their lives for their country. Those who survive the campaign may return minus a leg or an arm, and compared with the sacrifice they are making, it* cannot be said that those who have the greatest share of the wealth of the country are doing their duty. The real benefit of a tabulation of wealth will be in the fact that we shall be able to compel those who have wealth and are not doing their duty, to do as much as those others who are already doing their duty.",12
104,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,How will you differentiate between those who are doing their duty and those who are not?  can ensure is that the man who is shirking his duty will be compelled to do his fair share.,12
105,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"But the man ready doing his fair share will have to pay up also.  may be so, but the man who is now doing nothing will be made to do something, even though incidentally the other man is obliged to do a little more than his-' fair share. We must reach the fellow who is doing nothing. Several members of this House have been asked why they do not go to the front. When this tabulation is made every man will be required to go in his order; at any rate, if he is not compelled to go, his duty will beclearly shown to him. I have seen menresponding to the call who have great responsibilities towards wives and fami There has lies, and it was no uncommon thing during the recruiting campaigu last week for women to ask me after the meeting, to try to persuade their husbands not to go to the war, because there were younger men without responsibilities whocould go and were not volunteering. A f t e r this tabulation every one of us w i ll know when our duty arises, and at what time and in what order we should come forward. The honourable member for Fremantle read a letter last night in. which he had notified the Minister of Defence that he had offered his services with the Expeditionary Forces, but having been rejected for active service he was prepared to place the best that was in him at the disposal of the Empire in whatever work the Government might demand of him. I think every one of us is prepared to make that offer to those in authority. I am, and if my health would permit and I thought I could be of most use in the trenches, I would be there. Failing that, my services are at the disposal of the Empire wherever and in whatever way they can be best utilized. In saying that, I feel I am expressing the sentiments of every honourable member of this Parliament. The interjections hurled at public men in regard to their not having gone to the war are very cheap. There is no public man in this country who has not a full realization of what his duty is in these times. But as one representing a country constituency, I know that since the commencement of the war my labours have increased 200 or 300 per cent. One would infer from this cheap criticism that members have nothing to do but recline in their seats in this chamber. I wish that some of who is al- our critics could realise the new responsibilities that have been thrown upon a great many of us. There have been duties arising out of this war which have often kept me at work t ill one o'clock in the morning, and I have been glad that I am able to be of some service.. Those who have sent sons and husbands to the front are anxious to know about tbem, and a member of Parliament can in a hundred ways do much to make the lot of those at the war and. in camp easier, and the burden of those who have given up their menfolk lighter to bear. The object of the Bill is to organize and tabulate our resources in manhood and wealth. The Leader of the Opposition left an impression on my mind that he was somewhat opposed to tabulation of wealth, for which he said there was no precedent. I have wondered ' if the honourable member had ever read of the Doomsday Book compiled by order of William the Conqueror.",12

We know that in 1753 a was Bill of this character was introduced the House of Commons by a private member, and in 1800 it became law. In the German Empire, ever since its founland dation, there has been a quinquennial tabulation of the manhood.",13

Leader of the Opposition said that there isi no precedent for what is proposed, I am showing that that is not so. The splendid organization of the powerful empire against which we are fighting is excellent example of the value of what the Government now ask us to sanction. The German Empire, because of its orment. ganization, can lay its hands on the men Viest suited for agricultural pursuits, on those best suited for engineering pursuits, and on those best suited to serve in - the trenches. It has tabulated the abilities and numbers of its people, and can choose those whom it needs for any particular work. If we had followed its example-no t for the purposes of conscription",13
110,Mr BAMEORD,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"Why is the honourable member afraid of conscription?  not be afraid of it under certain circumstances. If the fight comes to Australia, we must have conscription.",13
111,Mr HAMPSON,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"The British Navy must bo wiped out before the fight can come to Australia.  a the majority of honourable members, I do not think that conscription is necessary at the present time. But we do not know and what may eventuate, and if we should tohappen to require our fullest fighting strength, the tabulation proposed will enaable us to lay our hands on the righ t men. What is now proposed will , when out, organize us as our enemy is Her organization has been proceeding since 1751. Shortly after the Germany took Schleswig-Holstein from by Denmark she began to make the K i e l proCanal. While the Canal was under proof construction, Germany was doing what we are now thinking of doing, and not completely ready for war u n t i l into last year, when the Canal was finished. It is a blot on the statesmanship of Great Britain that the island of Heligoland was given to Germany in exchangfe for the isof Zanzibar. If Great Britain still held Heligoland, the K i e l Canal would today be practically useless to Germany. Until the proposed organization is carried out we shall not be i u a position to offer - They the effective check to German encroachment that I hope we shall soon be able to offer. The Bill is a worthy addendum it to what Australia has already done in titanic struggle.

I do not think that much would be gained by employing school boys. This is . the opinion of practical farmer on the subjectIn these daysof up-to-date farming, most attention. of the work nt harvest time is done by large my teams of horses yoked into harvesters of large size. The successful handling of this chinery can only be done by men trained the work, and I fail to see ho\v any serviceable help can be given by the cluss of men Mr . Gilbert mentions, however willing they may though be As a farmer, the only way I can see this help could be availed of is in stooking sheaves after a binder, and my experience town youths in the harvest field has shown me that the long hours and heavy work is gether too great a trial, and the inevitable result is blistered hands and an overpowering sense of weariness resulting in complete failure in most cases. I endorse those statements, and one of the reasons why I welcome the Governintroduced. ment proposals is that I think they will enable us to lay our hands on the class of men who can help the farmers, who, many cases, have sent their own sons of to the war. The Prime Minister said at the beginning of the war that if the last man and the last shilling were required they would be given, and the proposed tabulation will enable us to lay our hands on the last man and on the last shilling, and to employ them effectively. It has said that those who possess wealth merely hold it in trust for the rest of the we community. If we are defeated i u this war, we lose everything. It is a case of "" all in . "" Consequently we must have some way of getting at the wealth and But some of the information which is asked for seems to me unnecessary. Citizens are to be asked to state their stock in trade, and the value of their f u r n it u r e and, perand household effects. That inforthe mation, I think, is not necessary. We must have expedition, but if unnecessary details are asked for tliere must be delay.",14
116,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"Information rethe value of household possessions is obtained in all countries where and so oh. there is a wealth tax.

There is another point worthy of I fear, though perhaps fear is not well founded, that mathere will be a danger of the timi d to sections of the community being victimised by what might be called agentsthey are sometimes called that ' ' sharks ''-wh o are everlastingly tryin g to make profit out of their fellows. of There is a possibility that people may be altoapproached by such men, and warned of the penalties that may be imposed for mistakes in the returns, with the result that many will be induced to pay fees in order to have the work done for them, as took place when the income tax was first I have had letters from shire secretaries, ministers of religion, and others i i i niy electorate offering to place their services at the disposal of the Government in the work of carrying out the census; hut there are isolated, places where people may be approached in the way I have indicated, and fees earned in a way that must be condemned. I suggest that the Government should enter into some arrangement with the State authorities, so that the services of shire secretaries, clerks of court and petty sessions, school teachers, the police, and so for t h , might be utilized, even if a small fee had to be paid in return for the work.",14

118,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"Richmond) [11.48] There is no doubt that both sides of the House are in accord with the general principles of the Bill , and I should have occupied time in discussing it ther were it not that I desire to make one or two suggestions. It was my i tention on a previous occasion, when was not permitted to conclude my reand marks, to outline what I believed necessary in the way of organization, not only here, but in every part of the pire, to meet the extraordinary crisis with which we find ourselves confronted today. This Bill goes a long way toThe wards meeting some of the ideas which were then floating in my mind, though some respects, it does not go to the f u extent I should like to see adopted and at once. We must not forget that this measure, in common with others other parts of the Empire, is the direct consequence of our full realization that wealth. we are fighting a nation so closely organbenefit ized as to give it an altogether unfair vantage over other nations not so well prepared. It is impossible for us at present time to carry the organization of wealth, and in this .particular form. our national resources too far. I realise as well as anybody that the British objects to regimentation of any sort. object to compulsion; we do not like to put into water-tight compartments and told to do this or that. It is opposed to way to directly levy on that wealth. every ideal of that freedom which has been granted to us by suffering and effort spread over many centuries. But I do not care how far our liberties are encroached on at this time, for a period, if we can secure those liberties for ourselves in the future, and for those who will follow us for all time to come.  conscription ?",15
119,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,I do not mind how far we go in infringing those liberties at the present time provided we can thereby secure those liberties in the future. I am not afraid of conscription.  instead of increasing them.,15
120,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"I am not afraid of if it becomes necessary; in fact, I think that under this Bill power ought should be taken in one direction of an What I mean is, that in certain industries we it should compel certain men to stay at home and not go to the war, and that that process of compulsion should be ' carried out at once. There is no doubt that we are now losing valuable material; and I "" am certain we are reducing the not effective force of this country by sending f u r - into the fighting line men who are urgently required for ofiher purposes in n - Australia. I recognise and admire the I sacrifices which these men are making,, the spirit which prompts them, but was they would be rendering greater and more effective service by staying at home. EmBefore making the one or two suggestions I have in my mind, I should like to say a word or two about the second schedule. Bill evidently has two purposes, one of which is to obtain to some extent a in registration of our male population bel l tween certain years, in order to get some now idea of how many we have effective for the fighting line and other purposes, while in the other purpose is to arrive at some approximation of our resources and It would have been a great to the House and the country if adthe Government had seen fit to announce at once and frankly what their intentions the are-wh y they are taking this census of I do not know what the intentions of the race Government are-nobod y seems to know We - bu t I can see no particular good in a be tabulation of the actual wealth of the community unless it is intended in some I would not be one to raise the slightest objection to those who are gifted w it li great wealth paying a fair share towards the enormous expenses of the war.",15
121,Mr BAMFORD,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"We want the "" widow's mite "" as well, you know I",16
122,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"I do not mean to suggest that all classes will not be called upon tocontribute; it may be a few shillings in some cases, and thousands of pounds i u others. I believe that, whether we appeal to the comparatively poor or the wealthy, we shall, with very few exceptions, have the readiest response; but I cannot see what good can be done by getting in tabulated form a census of the actual wealth held, unless it is proposed to levy directly on that wealth, and reduce the actual capital held by the people. If the idea of the Government is simply to levy on the product of wealth - that - is the income derived fro m it they could get all the information they require without the great expenditure of time and money that must be involved in taking this census. In many casesmy own, for instance-it will be a very simple thing to put on paper the actual wealth I hold, but it will be a very different matter for others in the country. And when the information has been tabulated at great cost, it will take the Government Statistician a long time to deal with it . If the intention of the Government be to levy on the actual wealth held by the community, and not on the product of that wealth, I venture to say they will do a great deal more harm than good. Once we commence to attack the actual capital in the country we shall find that a great deal of it will ""disappear. We shall destroy in a great measure the resources of the country which are used for the employment of labour, and destroy, without gaining any benefit,, a large proportion of the wealth itself.",16
123,Mr FENTON,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,Why these alarmist sentiments ?,16
124,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"I am simply endeavouring to show, in no alarmist way, that if we attempt to levy directly on the capital resources of the country it must have the effect I have described. When taxation does come, as we all realise it must, it should be on the actual product of capital itself;- and if that were the idea, all the necessary information could ""be obtained without going to the expense of the proposed tabulation.",16
125,Mr WEST,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,Would you make no exception during war time ?,16
126,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"W a r time makes no exception to the economic rules which govern us. Honourable members, I trust, recognise, as I do, that after all is said and done, the wealth of our country rests on our system of trade. You cannot touch that system by taxing the actual capital without bringing the whole fabric tumbling down to earth like a pack of cards. All that can be done effectively, and all that the Government should attempt to do is to levy upon the actual productive wealth of the countryupon the produce of the country's resources. That can be done without going to anything like the expense that the Government propose to incur in taking this wealth census.",16
127,Mr WEST,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,Y o u r proposal can be covered by an income tax.,16
128,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"Exactly , and I think that is the right way to go about it . If you attempt to tax other than the income which is the result of the capital invested - if you attempt to levy uoon the capital itself-the result must be disaster. The moment you attempt to do that everything will be thrown into a state of flux.  with the manhood of the country, but you must not interfere with the wealth! Is that the honourable member's argument?",16
129,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"That is not my argument at all. I say that the rich must pay. Everybody recognises that. Every class in the community must pay its tribute, be it more or less, towards the conduct of this great struggle. What I am contending is that when honourable members proceed to impose taxation let them tax the product of the country's wealth, and not the actual capital.",16
130,Mr BRENNAN,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"Would you pay no attention to^fchepotential wealth ? What about hoarded wealth-unoccupie d land, and so on ?",16
131,Mr GROOM,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,You can deal with that under the land tax.,16
132,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"I dare say it would be quite right if a man had £5,000 stored away in his stocking, and refused absolutely to use it , to resort to other measures. There would be some justification for the Government saying that such a man should contribute a .certain proportion, of his hoard. But I heard one honourable member- I forget who it was-whe n speaking on this measure last night, refer tot h e f a c t that a large amount of money is held on fixed deposit in the banks. He argued that this money was not being properly used, and that, therefore, the Government should come along and use a certain portion of it . To that argument I would point out that, although the original owners of this money are only getting 3 or 3£ per cent, interest on it , the banks themselves are using the money again and again.",16
133,Mr WEST,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,Jus t the same as money in the Savings Ranks is turned over five or six times.,17
134,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"Of course, it is. One man may be getting 3^ per cent., but some one else is using the same money, and getting 4 per cent, on it ; whilst a person may be using the same money in a still further direction, and getting 5 per cent. It cannot be said that, simply because inoney is deposited by the original owner in a bank at 3J per cent., the money is not being used. deposited in this way is used right throughout the whole trade and commerce of the country, and that is why I urge honourable members to be careful in any contemplated taxation not to impose the tax upon other than the produce of the country's capital resources. I do not care how heavy the tax is. It will have to be heavy. We all recognise that. The rioh must pay in common with the rest of the community-and I believe that, with very few exceptions, everybody will be willing to pay cheerfully. It is because of all this that I believe that the wealth census, if taken in the manner that the Government contemplate, will be unnecessary. I would like to see it taken in quite a different way, and I believe the information the Government desire could be got much more cheaply, and when the actual taxation is imposed it oould be imposed much more' effectively, if other methods were employed. The matter, however, is one for the Government to determine. The responsibility for what steps are taken must eventually rest upon them. That is why I regret fchafc the Government when bringing down this measure were not perfectly frank with the House and with the country in that they did not say exactly what was contemplated, or explain the reasons that induced them tb call for a census of wealth in this particular form . W it h gard to the registration of individuals, I do not think the Government are going far enough. One has only to look at the schedule to see that the Government's chief object is to ascertain the number of men actually fitted for the firing line. That seems to be the one underlying idea. While I would not discount for a single moment the almost stupendous efforts that Australia has put forward up to the present time, and while I admit that the fullest tribute must be paid to those who have so grandly come forward in their country's service, no one can but admit that Australia has not yet given of its manhood to the same extent that the Old Country has. We have a long way to go before we do that. I am inclined to think that, owing to the distance that separates us from the actual scene of conflict, it will not be possible for us to give our full quota of men. But there are many other things that we can do. A great deal is wanted besides men in this war. We want material; we want munitions. Money As this census has to be taken, and as the expense must be incurred, I think the Government could very well have gone a little further in the matter by endeavouring to ascertain how far it is possible to organize certain particular industries. In an in direct way, no doubt, the Government will get information on that point, but I think they could get a great deal more than they will get, and the value of the information would be infinitely greater, if they set fco work to obtain direct schedules affecting certain trades. Take, for instance, the textile industry. There are people working in various parts of Australia who have been trained in the textile industry, but who are not now engaged in that industry, . just as there are men who have been engineers, but who are following some other occupation. The' schedule as contemplated in this measure will not result in full information on that point.",17
135,Mr FENTON,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"Yes , it will . One question asks an individual what he is capable of doing, and what his past lif e and occupation have been.",17
136,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"I know it does. But what I urge is that, in regard to industries directly coimected with the war,, there should be separate schedules. It would incur very little additional expense re- or time to issue a special schedule with a special set of questions, and I think such a schedule would lead to the organization of these industries very much more rapidly than is possible under the Government's scheme. It is a matter of common knowledge that our woollen mills are all working at high pressure, and it is also a matter of common knowledge that their great difficulty is not one of material. It is also quite possible that a good deal of labour that might be utilized in these mills at the present time is not being utilized. We do not know where it is. We cannot find it - The people who are carrying on the woollen industries cannot find it. Here is a golden opportunity, ready to our very hand, to come in contact with every individual in the CommonAvealth capable of working in a woollen mill. Why should we not get that information? Similarly, in the engineering industry, particularly in that portion of it concerned with the manufacture of munitions, it is possible that large numbers of people are scattered about the length and breadth of the Commonwealth who have been employed on that particular class of work, and whose services would be valuable now. Here we have an opportunity of finding out where these people are, and of saying to them as our organization extends, ""We want you to go to such-and-such a factory."" Why not take advantage of the census to do that? . Again, in regard to the industries directly connected with the equipment of troops, we should endeavour to find out as quickly as possible every individual in Australia who can assist. That information can only be obtained by the issue of additional schedules. To endeavour to pick out information such as I have in mind from the schedules"" that are proposed will be a Herculean task. It will occupy a very long time, and will not produce anything like the effective result the proposal I suggest would bring about. I do not want to take up .the time of the House any longer in discussing this matter. All I want to say is that, so far as the Bill goes, I believe the idea underlying it is right, and it will have my full support; ""but I suggest, in regard to the wealth census-withou t knowing what is in the Government's mind-that it is quite possible that we are spending a lot of money unnecessarily, and for which there will be no adequate return. Whatever else we do at the present time, we ought not to do that. In regard to the other schedules, I think they do not-go far enough. There is certain information which we should obtain rapidly which these sehedules Avill not obtain. I hope the Government will take some further action in the direction I have indicated.",17
137,Mr BAMFORD,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"Herbert) [12.14] Knowing the anxiety of the Minister in charge of the Bill to get it through, I shall not be very long in what I have to sayj but as I intend to sound a note that has not been sounded hitherto, I think I am justified in saying a few words, so as to put forward my own position clearly. In the first place, I Avish to say that neither this Parliament as a Avhole. nor the members who sit on one side or the other, have shoAvn very much courage in dealing with the present situation. I might use even a more' forceful, though, perhaps, it would be an impolite,, description. We have been just nibbling at this matter the Avhole time.",18

139,Mr BAMFORD,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"I do not think we have made adequate use of the powers we already possess. Some time ago I introduced a Bill into this Chamber of a very definite character. It referred to the subject of Unification, at which we are now merely nibbling by way of the proposed referenda.",18
140,Mr SPEAKER,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,Order !,18
141,Mr BAMFORD,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"I quite expected your intervention, sir. In introducing, this Bill, the Government are now nibbling at conscription, whereas I entirely favour the principle of conscription.",18
142,Mr MAHON,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,Is that because the honourable member is over the age limit?,18
143,Mr BAMFORD,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"Not at all. A little while ago I proffered my services to the Waverley Rifle Club, but, after glancing at me, the officer to whom I made theoffer, said, "" It is unnecessary to ask for your birth certificate; it is evident that you are above the age at which we could take you."" Then again, some weeks ago I placed my services at the disposal of th© Prime Minister, pointing out to him that I was quite capable of doing some of the work now being performed by men who are going to the front. I am physically as fit as many younger members of this House, and am willing to do my share in the defence of the Empire, so that the interjection made by the Minister of External' Affairs was a most ungenerous one.

156,Mr BAMFORD,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,My reply to those who say that it will be time enough for us to adopt conscription when Great Britain does so is that possibly if conscription had been in force in the Old Country some years ago the present war would not have occurred.

Why should, we not give her the lead in this case ? with regard to the introduction of the ballot-box, electoral reform, free education, old-age pensions, maternity allowances, and compulsory training. Let us give her the lead in the matter of conscription.",20

W it h conscription in operation, we should always have men trained and ready to go to the front well prepared to meet any emergency, and, as the honourable . member for Indi has said, we may need the services of such men on our own shores. Instead of having to send them abroad in defence of Australia we may, unfortunately, have to employ them here. I have only to say, in conclusion, that I considered that I should put before the House the view that I hold with regard to conscription so that at least one man amongst us may be able to say when the time is ripe, "" I told you so.""",20
162,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"Franklin) [12.28]- I think it well to emphasize a point that has been entirely overlooked during this debate, and which is that from the very inception of this war more men have volunteered in Australia than the Department of Defence has been able to train and equip.",20
163,Mr BURNS,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,That is so in respect of. all the British Dominions.,20
164,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"L is t e n in g to the speeches of some honourable members, a. stranger would imagine that Australia was a country of shirkers, and that it was necessary to use compulsion to induce our men to recognise their duty to the Empire. In these circumstances, therefore, I think it wise to mention the actual position. It is to be regretted that the Department did not get a move on earlier than it did. We do not want to repeat, in connection with our equipment of troops, the stupendous folly that has been associated with the Small Arms Factory. A f t e r the> war had been going on for ten monthsi t remained for the Public Works Committee to show"" the Government that it was possible to work a double shift in the Factory. It was only then that a double shift was instituted, and we are now told Is it not true that it is working without friction. It comes to us as a shock to learn that any Government could have thought it possible We led her to tur n out more rifles by working one shift of ten hours a day than by having two shifts of eight hours each. .Something should be done in connection with this Bill to enable us to utilize the services of men who have volunteered, but who, because of some slight defect have rejected. I suggested to the M i nister some time ago that the names and addresses of all men rejected should ho recorded, and that, if necessary, they should be asked to take the oath of allegiance, so that they might constitute a force for local defence- a kind of German landsturm-leavin g those more physically capable to go on active service abroad. I do not believe that 33 per cent, of those volunteering are physically incapable of serving at the front, but that is about the proportion of volunteers who are being rejected today. And yet we are told that we ought to register men in order to secure more soldiers. Some of the men rejected are amongst the most physically fit men in Australia. They are trained athletes, who would hold their own in any arena, and yet they are rejected by the medical officers. An Imperial officer told me that he had seen men rejected in Melbourne who would be received with open arms by any recruiting sergeant in Europe. Numbers of men who have been rejected in Australia have gone to England and been accepted there.",20
165,Mr JH CATTS,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"That is because, in Australia, more men of perfect physique were offering than could be handled. Mr MoWILLIAMS - That brings me to the point that we are commencing our reform at the wrong end. If Parliament and the Government would concentrate their energies on preparations to receive the men who are enlisting, and who are eligible, we should do much more good, and secure a greater number of fighting men than we are getting at the present time. It is now proposed to remove the backbone of our recruiting system by calling in the rifles from the rifle clubs. Would it not be possible for the Government to secure 50,000 or 100,000 rifles, with a corresponding amount of ammunition, from Japan? I am credibly informed that it would have been possible, and is possible, now to get those rifles from Japan. "" But,"" says one officer, "" the Imperial Government cannot accept them, because it would mean that there would be two classes of rifles in the trenches."" Why, there are three or four different classes of rifles in the same trenches in Belgium today. There are the Belgian rifle, the Erench rifle, the British rifle, and the Canadian Ross rifle, all being used side by side in the trenches. I have never seen any necessity for this Bill. The men of Australia are volunteering in far greater numbers than the Department is able to deal with. Instead of turning our attention to matters of this kind, the first great reform should be in the Defence Department itself, in order that some"" better system might be devised for handling the men who do volunteer, and especially of discontinuing the absurdity of rejecting as unfit some of the finest men in the country. Tliere is a suspicion that many men .have been rejected, and that the high standard of physical fitness has been enforced because the Department was not able to train and arm more men.",21
166,Mr SPEAKER,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,I ask the honourable member not to discuss that subject.,21
167,Mr MCWILLIAMS,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"I am merely mentioning that matter in order to show that there is no great necessity for this Bill, and that better work could be done by placing the Defence Department in a position to accept all the men available under present conditions.",21
168,Mr WISE,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"Gippsland) [12.35] - It is a novel experience to hear an honourable member expressing the view that this Bill is not necessary. Until the honourable member for Franklin spoke, all honourable members had agreed that the measure is necessary. I cordially support the Bill, which I believe to be absolutely essential at the present time. I have no wish to be at all pessimistic, but I do think that the people are blind if they fail to realise the present serious position of affairs in the Old World. We may be hopeful with the hope which our race always possesses, that we shall come out of this conflict successfully, as we have always done in the past; but a man is blind if he shuts his eyes to the fact that the position is very serious today. I quite agree that up to the present the voluntary system has been successful in Australia, and partially successful in the Old Country. But I cannot help feeling a considerable amount - of sympathy with our Allies who are fighting under conscription, and putting millions of men into the field, knowing all the while that the British Empire is not sending to the front as many soldiers as it ought to send. I was very much impressed by figures which were contained in a cablegram published in the Herald on Saturday night. They purport to be from an official report of the French Relief Society, and they show that, from the beginning of the war to the 1st June, in killed, wounded, and prisoners, nearly 9,000,000 men from the various belligerent countries had been put out of action. The figures which particularly caught my eye were that, whilst France has lost 1,410,000, and Russia 3,495,000, Great Britain had lost less than 5Q0,000. It does seem that we have not been putting into the field as many men as we could send, ancl ought to have sent, in justice to the otlier nations who are allied with us. One fact we have to remember is that in this matter time is the essence of the contract. The Germans were prepared for the war; we were not. They have an enormous army, and every man put into the field is a trained soldier, ready to take his place in the fighting line at once. ""We are not only short in numbers, and have to raise our armies, but we have to train them. The men who are enlisting today will not be fit to take their position in the field for some months to come; in fact, they may be looked upon as the soldiers who will be required to do the winter service in Europe. Therefore, it is necessary to so organize our forces now that we may be in a position to do more, if necessary, at a later stage. There has been some objection to the Bill on the ground that it means conscription. The measure does not necessarily mean conscription, but it does mean that if conscription should become necessary-and it will be adopted in the Old Country and Australia only when the situation has become desperate-w e shall be in a position to put the system into force at once, instead of having to spend months in gathering the information which, by the aid of this Bill, we shall now get immediately. In the Defence Act, we have recognised and approved of the principle of conscription for home defence, and have given the Executive power to call all men between the ages of eighteen nnd sixty years fo the colours for the fence of Australia. In one respect, conscription is more satisfactory than the present system of voluntary enlistment; it prescribes the order in which men shall be called upon to serve. The men between certain ages and unmarried are called first, and the married men without children are called before the married men with children. J agree with the honourable members who have said that we have been sending to the front too many youths and far too many married men. If we had a properly-organized system, or if we were operating under the conscription sections of the Defence Act, many of the men who have gone to the front would not have gone; we would have called upon the other men who aremore suitable-the single men who are without responsibility, and below a certain age. I do not say that Australia has not done well, nor do I decry the Commonwealth's contribution to the war. Nothing disgusts me so much as to hear prominent mtn who have done well in Australia always decrying the efforts of this country. It must be remembered that while Ave have been giving men, if Ave have not been giving in the same proportion as the people of Great Britain, we have been giving of our substance, as the AvidoAv gave her mite. This great country is in need of population, and every man we send to the front is of the country's life blood, and therefore every soldier we give is a gift of our substance, whilst the Old Country is giving probably of its surplus population. I shall not be afraid of supporting conscription if such a course becomes necessary. I hopo the voluntary system Avill continue to be successful as it has been in the past, but Ave cannot shut our eyes to the fact that if the war continues into next year, some desperate means of bringing it to a successful issue will be necessary. Having recognised the principle of conscription for the defence of Australia, it seems to me to matter nothing Avhether conscription is to be applied to war in other parts of the world, or war on our own shores. It is admitted that men would be called upon for service in Australin. For Avhat? For the purposes of defending Australia. We are defending Australia by fighting the enemy at the Dardanelles and on the battlefields of Europe. de- If Ave do not defend Australia there, but Avait to fight the enemy on our shores, we shall have to fight a very inglorious battle indeed. I pity those Avho have to fight a victorious German army in Australia if the Allies are beaten in the fighting in Europe. It seems to me that there is no difference between sending men to Europe to defend Australia and in compelling them to serve in Australia for the same purpose. In fact, there may be more justification for compelling them to fight in Europe, because they may be able to do something of an effective nature there, whereas if we wait u n t i l the enemy comes to our shores, our men may be fighting a forlorn hope and losing their lives in what would possibly be a very hopeless final struggle for existence.",21
169,Mr JH CATTS,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"Cook) [12.43] The scheme which the Attorney-General proposes to put into operation for taking a census of the manhood and wealth of the country is a step in the right direction. Proposals have emanated from Opposition members, who are supposed to bebusiness men,, which would mean that the taking of the census, instead of occupying only a few weeks, would occupy a few months. To those who have had experience of handling large bodies of men engaged in voluntary work, the idea of utilizing voluntary labour for the census i u different parts of the Commonwealth-whic h requires accuracy and expedition-is ridiculous. We must have information before we can; take action. So far we have been acting without information. A number of lionorable members are discussing, the Bill as if it provided fbr action. It does nothing of the kind. It provides merely for the accumulation of information. As a matter of fact, this Parliament has done practically nothing. It has not done a solitary thing of substance in connection with our present difficulties beyond the passing of two or three Supply Bills. True, the Referenda Bills have heen carried. This is a necessary prelude to much necessary legislation. But we have done nothing as a Parliament regarding many great subjects over which we have undoubted power, and which it is essential should be dealt with . There has been no definite authority obtained from Parliament for the sending away of any number of troops. We have passed an incidental measure-the 1 War Pensions Act-bu t Parliament itself has sanctioned nothing. It is proposed to acquire the sugar crop of Australia, at a cost of about £2,000,000, but this Parliament has not authorized it , nor have we considered the proposal. Judging from the speech of the At torney-General, it is in contemplation to acquire the whole of the wheat crop of Australia, or it is thought that it may be necessary to do so, and to harvest, transport, and market it at a cost of about £25,000,000. But no proposal has been put before Parliament for dealing with the matter. Parliament has not been asked to consider the scheme in detail, or to sanction it . In all the great financial arrangements that have been made, whatever they may be- I have very vague ideas of what they are, and doubt whether any honourable member has precise information concerning, them",23

176,Mr JH CATTS,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"I do not wish to refer to them in detail; but to make a passing reference to them. In regard to our food supplies, and the production of the country, all that Parliament has done, or is now asked to do, is to obtain information. If that is all that is necessary, the government of the country may be carried on by the appointment of Ministers who will undertake the management of our affairs, and elucidate problems of the greatest magnitude whioh arise during a time of war, when most serious consequences may arise put of what is done. If a small executive can handle the situation at a time like this unaided, I do not know what Parliament is for.

There has been an argument as to whether there is statutory authority for the sending of troops to from serve outside Australia whether comwhepulsorily enrolled or obtained by voluntary enlistment. My reading of the Act is that there is statutory authority to send conscript troops outside of Australia Point is given to this by the definition of "" war "" The Defence Act defines any invasion or apprehended invasion of, or the attack or apprehended attack on, the Commonwealth, or any territory under the control Deof the Commonwealth by an enemy or armed",25

From the schedule of the Bill calls for particulars from the manhood of the country in relation to defence, it would almost appear that it had been drafted with the direct idea in the mind of the draftsman that conscription was to I do not believe that to be the case; but it would certainly seem compulsion begins and ends. to be so from an investigation of ment, apart from any Knowledge of what is in the minds of Ministers.

204,Mr JH CATTS,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"It could be put in such a way as not to be moral compulsion.

214,Mr JH CATTS,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"I submit that the Government could get the men in another way if they desired, and that is not being done simply because it is not the policy of the country. They have statutory power to compel men to go anywhere to defend Australia.",27

223,Mr FISHER,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,I must be following a bad example!,27
224,Mr JH CATTS,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"It looks like it. In regard to the tabulation of wealth, there seems to be a little apprehension, particularly on the other side of the House. As a matter of fact, such information ought always to be at our disposal, and not only in time of I have wondered at the paucity of knowledge that we have been able to obu t I tain from our Department of Statistics. For this I do not blame the Statistician, but I do blame the various Governments, who have not placed sufficient money at that official's disposal for this necessary W h at is work. I find in - the New York Sun of 4th of this year a complete tabulation of the wealth of the people of the TJnited States. The article is headed, "" What We are W o r t h "" ; and ""Should Uncle Sam Decide to Impose an Income T a x .

Knibb3 is at least his equal.",27
225,Mr FISHER,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,As good as any in the world!,27
226,Mr JH CATTS,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"No one can come in touch with Mr Knibbs without being struck with his great capacity for the I was very pleased to hear what the Attorney-General the said about Mr Knibbs. yesterday. There no red-tape about'him. He goes straight perto the point, and is both direct and to him , scientific in his methods. As the Bill will probably be rushed through at the Committee stage, I desire to take this opportunity of saying a word about the machinery. It has been suggested by members on the other side that voluntary labour should be made use of in a wholesale fashion. We have large numbers of men who are prepared to offer their services. I have had some experience of the employment of considerable bodies of voluntary helpers in political campaigns, and, in my view, the honourable members who have suggested that we should make use of voluntary help in work of this character can hardly have had much experience in the organization of voluntary help in their own electorates. In my own electorate, in the electorates that my party have asked me to take charge of in New South Wales for organizing purposes, and in the general organization of the work of the last campaign in New South Wales, I had a good deal of experience of the value of voluntary help from persons who were inspired with the ideals of the movement, who were extremely enthusiastic, and whose help was given under the best conditions, and my conclusion is that such help cannot equal in value the help that - could be obtained if the same persons were regularly employed under direct and continuous supervision in some systematic and methodical way. I do not disparage in any way the great work voluntarily done for the labour movement. I am merely trying to compare voluntary, as against paid, labour for taking and analysing the census now under consideration. During the last State election I was asked to take charge of the second ballot campaign in that electorate of New South Wales in which the State Attorney-General was interested. The time at my disposal was only a, week or ten days, and we had to engage paid labour to do a certain part of the organizing work; yet by its help we transformed a minority of 100 into a majority of 300 after a very strenuouslyfought contest. The voluntary help was magnificent, but it would have even been more effective if we could have paid the same persons and insisted upon more rigid carrying out of instructions. If we could engage our political helpers regularly at an election, work on definite lines, with power to insist upon the carrying out of instructions, our results would be immensely increased and improved.",27
227,Mr GROOM,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,Ha d you sufficient to make a fair comparison?,28
228,Mr JH CATTS,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"Oh , yes. It .was rather an important election, and I am bound to say that all the money required was available. The Attorney-General did not stick at a pound or two so long as the work was effectively done. I would like to see what employment is going to be distributed, particularly at a time like this, but the distribution must not be at the cost of inefficiency. It would be a most inefficient way of handling this matter if we were to have a number of depots in various parts of the Commonwealth. All these cards will have to come in through the Post Office. They will arrive on different days on account of the distances they have to be sent, and if arrangements could be made for their complete handling at one common centre that would be the most efficient way of carrying out the census. The idea of utilizing voluntary labour in all parts of the Commonwealth is. in my view, absurd. As many inspectors as employees would be required to see that the work was carried out. Voluntary helpers can come in when they like, do what they like, go out to lunch when they like. It is impossible to exercise the same supervision aud discipline over such assistance as it is over those whose duty it is to carry out the work under effective control. I was surprised to hear the suggestions that came from honourable members of some experience on the other side of the House, and I thirds their suggestions ought not to be followed. If the Attorney-General, with the experience he has had of matters in this direction, would consult with Mr Knibbs, I feel sure that they would be able to evolve some scheme which would enable the work of tabulation and analysis to be done properly and at reasonable cost.",28
229,Mr LYNCH,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"WeTriwa) [2.37] - I have great pleasure in supporting this proposal, because I think it is a first step towards that marshalling of our resources which has already been too long delayed. Por months I have advocated the adoption of a system which would enable us to obtain the information that we hope to get as the result of this census. Suggestions of conscription have been made. We have been asked what the intentions of the Government are in putting this measure at all. I do not think we need discuss the question as to whether conscription is in the air or not. It may be quite true that this is the first step towards conscription. It may be the first step to quite a number of things. man, feeling he is in danger of robbery, gathers his valuables together, that step may mean that he is going out to spend his wealth on riotous living, or it may mean that he is going to put it in safe deposit. The suggestion regarding conscription does not affect the issue at all, although it does strike me as being an attempt on the part of the tail to wag the dog, for the dependency surely cannot talk about conscription until scription has been decided upon at the head of the Empire. What I think the proposal does mean is that, having responsible government in Australia, we are trying to forge weapons by which we shall be able to take a full and comprehensive record of everything that can appertain to the welf are of the people of the Commonwealth under our present system of government. We hope, by the information we shall gain, to be able to say exactly what powers we can put into this fight, either at home or abroad, and what resources we can marshal so as to be able to .sustain a prolonged effort. It cannot be argued that a responsible Government such as the Federal Government is should be pelled to fall in with all sorts of movements originating throughout the States. Rather should the Commonwealth vernment direct the actions of the States in one comprehensive policy. We hope by this information to.be able to say exactly what can be done, and what is impossible, and we can only do that by focussing our energies upon the development, not only of a liigher standard of military excellence, but upon the development of all the matters that are necessary in order that we may maintain successfully, not only our military but also the solvency of the community. Surely we are not going to adopt a policy such as that which leads drunkard to exclaim, "" Fill it up again, boys,"" irrespective of what the consequences may be. We desire to know exactly what number of men of fighting age we have in the country, how they are employed, and how best they may be emMr Lynch. forward ployed. We have also the right to know the number of industrial efficients in the country who are volunteering, and whether it is necessary to debar them from going forward; in other words, whether their labours at home will be If a more valuable to the general in terests than - their presence in the trenches abroad. We have a right to know what wealth we have in the count r y , how it is employed, and how it affects the welfare and solvency of the people, and what part of that wealth may reasonably be subject to taxation, or some other demand, should the exigency of circumstances require it . The honourable member for Richmond, whendealcon- ing with this matter, seemed hardly to appreciate the position, because no sane man on either side of the Blouse would for a moment support any system which would dry up the fountains of industry throughout the Commonwealth. Rather would he strive by every possible means to bring about an accession of power and strength in the various industries that are all essential to our success. But a large portion of our wealth is not capital invested in the production of other wealth. A large amount of money is being wasted, just as many people waste mental and physical energy. That money, I think, might, as a last resort, be employed fco better ends, and we shall be able fco see by fchis census how far it can be touched by taxation. com- Mr GREENE - What does the honourable memberinclude in that class ?",28
230,Mr LYNCH,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"I may tell the honorGo- able gentleman that all forms of worldly goods are included in the one term "" w e a l t h . "" . That part of wealth that we call capital-the money that is employed in producing other capital-ough t not to be touched except in case of a desperate life or death struggle; but there is; another class of wealth that is very predominant that finds its outlet in needless extravagance, and in other directionsthat creates no employment, either proposition, fessionally or otherwise. People who souse such wealth would be much better engaged in either industrial or military the employment for the benefit of the count r y , just as such wealth might be madebetter use of in the successful prosecutionof the war.",29
231,Mr GREENE,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,Where does the wealth that the honourable member refers to reside!,29
232,Mr LYNCH,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"I cannot say where it resides, but it has been clearly proved that it is here, and if a complete census be taken of the disposition of the wealth of Australia, I think it will be found that only a small minority of the people are engaged in what any political economist would describe as work of production. The wealth that I refer to helps to maintain in idleness or unnecessary employment people who could be much better employed, and we shall ascertain where that wealth 'is if these census returns are going to be anything more than an empty tabulation of figures. have a right to know all these things. The Commonwealth Government also ought to be able to control the volunteer system as we know it , because it is at times so spasmodic in its action as to be almost detrimental to the interests of the country. By this census we hope to obtain a list of the people who are engaged in any industry-the people who are idle, and doing nothing of the work that is essential for the welfare of the country. We shall beable to ascertain how many of these people, whether they be at the top' or bottom of the tree, are of the fighting age, and by means of the recruiting officers we shall be able to focus our attention upon them. In short, this census will enable us so to marshal our resources as to fit us, not only to put up a bigger fight oversea, but to prepare for whatever the final shuffle of the cards may mean in regard to the defence of Australia. If because of a thousand and one contingencies that may arise, and which need not be too clearly defined, it becomes necessary to do battle in Australia itself, we shall then be able, in stead of being turned over utterly bound and helpless to the enemy, to put up a final fight such as only a free people struggling for their very existence can do.",30
233,Mr WEBSTEK,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,Would the honourable member send all the idle men to the front ?,30
234,Mr LYNCH,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"No . I would not send auy man to the front without his consent. The danger we have to face, in Australia today is that more men will volunteer for the fron t than we can properly spare, and so leave the Commonwealth utterly dependent. The spirit of freedom so actuates the people of Australia that it may be said of them, as was once said of the Yankee girls, ""They have been al[184] lowed almost every liberty, and they take the rest."" The spirit of freedom has so permeated the people of Australia that the one thing necetesary in connection with this war is to bring them to a realization of the fact that the best way to bring about the ruin of the Commonwealth is for every capable and able man to leave it . They need to be reminded that we must retain some of the capable and able of our people in order that the solvency of Australia may be maintained. Who is to say that the war is likely to end a few months hence, or We fco be brought to a close by one special effort? We must be prepared for a long sustained effort, and we can best make that preparation by actively developing the resources of Australia. It ds in that way that the Government charged with the administration of the affairs of this country will be able to fulfil its functions while pursuing its duties in a truly patriotic spirit. I am sure my fellow-countrymen throughout the Commonwealth will be prepared to make every sacrifice. It is essential that there should be a census' of the bone and muscle as well as of the wealth of the community. And it is equally essential that property owners, as well as those who have but their labour to offer, should be prepared fco make sacrifices, since all that we hold dear, all that we love, and everything that makes for the progress of humanity is now in the balance. It is not by mere spasmodic effort, nor by throwing prudence to the winds, that we shall assist in that final victory which I hope ultimately will be ours. That victory can be secured only by treading the road of selfsacrifice and self-abnegation. Mr Rodgers J Wannon) [2.50] In time of peace I am a keen In d ividualist, but in time of war, when the welfare of the country, and all that we enjoy, depends upon the action of the Government of our country, I hold it to be the duty of all to get behind that Government. This is particularly so at the present juncture, having regard to the fact that the terrible task which confronts the several Governments of the whole Empire, was before the people of Australia when they were called upon to make a choice of their representatives. I have just returned from a week's recruiting tour, which has afforded me many opportunities of getting into touch with my constituents, and I do not hesitate fco say that the feeling of the country, if I am capable of interpreting it , is that the political mind of Australia is absolutely closed. All parties are determined fco give the Government whatever assistance may be necessary for the quick and effective prosecution of the war., and to enable Australia to play her part. Marvellous enthusiasm is being manifested throughout the country.",30
235,Mr SPEAKER,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,Does the honourable member propose to connect his remarks with the Bill?,31
236,Mr RODGERS,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"Yes ; I am going to show that the country, by its response to the appeal for recruits made during the last few days, has practically shown its approbation of the measure which the Government are now putting before us. T approve of this Bill , and shall do what I can to help its passing. Coming to its machinery provisions, I am not altogether satisfied that the whole of the details proposed to be elicited are not already available fco us from State sources; but even should it mean duplication, if the Government think it necessary to pass this Bill , by all means let them have it . I believe that most of the information which it is proposed to obtain by means of this census can already be obtained through State channels. If there is one fact by which I was struct more than by any other during my recent tour of the country it was the manifest anxiety on the part of the people that a lead should be given. The Government, in bringing down this Bill , has given a lead. found every one who was unable to go to the front anxious fco know what he could do for home service. Every one appeared to be anxious to learn to what use their possessions and their individual ability might be put for the service of their country. The Government will have an opportunity of determining these questions for them when a complete registration of the resources of the country has been made. I express my regret that the honourable member for Eawkner saw fit to say last night that the men on the land had not played their part in connection with this war. I did not interject while the honourable member was speaking because I was anxious to hear his deductions, and I certainly think that they were hardly fair ones. ""We have to remp.mber that the people on the land have just passed through a terribly trying tim*. No section of the community has more contractual obligations than the man on the land, and during the dreadful time of drought through which these people have just passed, many of these contractual obligations have had to be suspended. In addition, we must not overlook the fact that when foodstuffs were running short an appeal was made to our farmers to redouble their efforts, and to cultivate larger areas. To this appeal there has been a very general response. Additional areas have been sown in many cases, but many young men have left the farming districts for the front . In a number of localities a very good response has been made to the call for volunt.ers. In other localities I have been disappointed. But there is no section of the community for whom I have always entertained a stronger admiration that the people upon the lands of Australia. They have never shirked their obligations at home, and a great many of the burdens of citizenship are cast upon them. In following their everyday employment they are exposed, summer and winter, to the roughest conditions, and I am satisfied that in peril or danger the white feather would never be shown by them. If the response to the appeal for volunteers has not been as large as might have been expected from our farming districts, I think that, upon examination, it will be found that there are a good many reasons for this. I know that tremendous sacrifices have been made. I by some of the people on the land. In some cases two or three sons out of one f a m i ly have gone to the front , and those left behind will be dependent upon outside assistance for gathering the harvest. I do not think there is much in the suggestion which has been made that the school boys would be of much use to the farmers in taking off their crop. Wheat is raised most successfully in the dry parts of Australia, and the temperatures of our wheat areas are very high; in many cases they run up to 110 degrees and 112 degrees in the shade during the harvesting season. Therefore, I do not think that school children are going to be of much service in the harvest field. They may be of use in the f r u it industry, and they niay do good service in stooking hay, but I would not place much value on the assistance that school children can give to our wheat farmers. As the honourable member for Indi pointed out, it is during harvest,time that the pace is put on; the entire organization of a farm is then put into action. All its available horseflesh, its machinery, and its manual labour is then taxed to the utmost. The women, too, are taxed to the utmost in their domestic duties, and it is not desirable that the feeling should be created that the places of able-bodied men, who at the request of the various Governments have put large areas under cultivation, and have since gone to the front, can be taken by the children of the country. There is another matter to which I desire to refer, and I approach it with some reserve. When war is declared every man and woman is called upon to state hia or her position; I feel that, for the most part, we can depend upon every man in this country"" to do his duty when the time arrives. The declaration that Australia has to make is that every foot of land in this country is British soil, that there is not one inch of neutral territory. If there is any one who feels today any embarrassment by reason of the nationality of his parents or his own nationality, he must not forget that he has enjoyed to the ful l the privileges of citizenship in this country, and that now is the time to discharge the highest national obligation that could fall to his lot. Conscription, of course, brings in all. but the present system leaves it open for those of all nationalities who are enjoying British freedom in Australia, who have been able to establish homes in the Commonwealth, and have reaped the benefit of our institutions, to recognise the part that they ought to play. All that I have to say is that the response has not been as general and as uniform as we might well have expected. We might very well issue a word of warning that, in connection with this census, the nationality of those who remain at home, as well as of Jhose who go to the front, will be made known, so that when the question of discrimination between duties has to be dealt with, we shall know exactly how the peoples of different nationalities living in Australia have played their part. When Australia determined upon the adoption of compulsory training, it was intended that the system should apply to all males between the ages of fourteen and twenty-five years. That system, unfortunately, had not been in operation long enough before the war [184]- 2 to provide for the military training of the whole community. Many young men escaped by a few days the compulsion to train, others escaped it by months, and still others by years. As it is, we have, drawn off about 100,000 of the best of our young men.; but many of the others who remain at home have had the benefit of that compulsory training system. As part of: cur preparatory measures, compulsorytraining should be given to everybody in* the community._",31
237,Mr SPEAHEE,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,The honourable member is now wandering from the question before the Chair.,32
238,Mr RODGERS,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"I respectfully submit that this is pertinent to the question of the census, because one of the obligations that may be placed on the males of the commimity is that they shall go into active preparation for war.",32
239,Mr SPEAKER,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,If I permit the honourable member to wander into these little by-paths he will be dealing with some other question that is not before the Chair at all.,32
240,Mr RODGERS,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,I will not pursue the subject beyond saying that I am an advocate of compulsory training for all able bodied men.,32
241,Mr HAMPSON,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,Of what age?,32
242,Mr RODGERS,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"Fro m eighteen to forty-five years. In manv places the community has not» waited for a lead from the Government; awkward squads have been formed, and are being drilled, and there could be no better incentive to recruiting than this form of preparatory training. With regard to the mustering of the material resources of the community, the honourable member for Capricornia, by way of question, and other honourable members by implication, have indicated the early introduction of a system of income tax to raise funds for the better prosecution of the war. With such a proposal I shall be in hearty accord. I have always advocated the imposition of an income tax in the Federal sphere as one of the best means of raising money for the good government and defence of Australia.",32
243,Sir JOHN FOEBEST,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,You want double t:\xation.,32
244,Mr RODGERS,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"My view is that the Commonwealth Parliament might well adopt the principle of taxation of income, and remit to the States the taxation of land. Such an arrangement would avoid the duplication to which the right honourable member for Swan objects.",32
245,Mr HAMPSOW,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,Do you not think that the States .might give back to the Commonwealth portion of the 25s. per head they are receiving?,33
246,Mr RODGERS,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"There will be plenty of time to consider that proposal at the expiration of the existing arrangement. If there was ever a time when the entire wealth of Australia should be taxed for national purposes that time is the present. I know that the party now in power are committed to taxation, direct in its incidence, for purposes of defence. Their policy is that Naval and Military expenditure shall be provided from the proceeds of direct taxation. I have always been unable to understand wliere the Labour party could get the money for the carrying out of that policy, and now that plank in their platform is being put to the test. Nobody has a right to escape his proper obligations with regard to defence. I have never been able to' discriminate' between the duty of men who put their money into shipping, mines, or manufactures, or other classes of business, and the duty of the man who puts his money into the land. Yet the latter has been unfairly picked out by this Parliament to carry the greatest burden of taxation. If ever an exemplification, of the injustice of the system was given it was during the last period of drought, when the great producing interests of the country were in a condition of absolute paralysis. But even though the great landed interests have failed to yield a return, and the nation is at war, other people in the community have been making fortunes. Many of them have been providing the war supplies for the community. Others have been providing foodstuffs, and some have had war fortunes given to them by Act of Parliament. I refer particularly to the fixation of the price of wheat in Victoria. Could anybody say, as a matter of equity and fairness, that those who are enjoying' the greatest prosperity in war time sliould be exempted from contributing in proper proportion to the necessities of the country? I do not fear the imposition of a Eederal income tax. I shall welcome it as the most equitable system by which the Government can finance its activities. I do not believe in the duplication of taxation, and, as I have already remarked, I would prefer that this Parliament should hand back to the States the power of taxation of land. Could there be any stronger reason for such a course, from the point of view of the present Government, than that the party which they represent in politics has governmental control in five out of six States, and is, therefore, able to deal with the land settlement and taxation problems?",33
247,Mr SPEAKER,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,The honourable member is again straying beyond the Bill.,33
248,Mr RODGERS,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"On e of the reasons why I particularly support the Government in their desire to provide fresh means of taxation is that the entire resources of the country, whether in land, accrued wealth, or cash reserves-thos e musty cash heaps to which the honourable member for Werriwa referred-shal l be at the disposal of the Government for the prosecution of the war. With regard to recruiting, I hope that the Government will recognise that those men who are from 150 to 300 miles from the big recruiting centres should be given an op- portunity of registering at convenient local depots.",33
249,Mr SPEAKER,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,I ask the honourable member to adhere to the Bill.,33
250,Mr RODGERS,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"I desire merely to say that I hope that while the Government are recruiting the raw material for soldiers, they will devise means of registering recruits closer, to tlieir homes, instead of putting them to the expense and trouble of coming to the city to offer their services.  allow the second reading of this Bill to pass without expressing my feelings in regard to the measure. . If tliere is one thing more than another that impresses me with the idea that this Bill is a measure that should not be enacted, it is the whole-hearted support which it has received from the honourable members of the Opposition. I always fear gifts from the enemy, and no matter what we may sav the fact remains that those on the right of the Speaker and those on the left are deadly political enemies.",33
251,Mr GROOM,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"We do not suggest any motive on the part of the Government.  able members opposite are not sincere. I 1 believe they are sincere, and, therefore, it is a godsend to Australia that they are not in office today, otherwise we should have had conscription introduced. Some honourable member's of the Opposition have beeu careful to keep out of their speeches all mention of conscription, but the honourable member for Flinders, and other honourable members in reply to interjections, have said that they would be in favour of conscription if such a course became necessary. The honourable member for Flinders says that this B i ll means that every male between eighteen and sixty years of age is morally, if not legally, liable to service. That statement is sufficient to indicate to me what would be the outcome of the Bill if the Opposition were on the Treasury benches. Both the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General have stated that the Bill does not mean either, directly or indirectly, conscription for service outside the Commonwealth. Tliat assurance removes a lot of my objections to the Bill . But 1 noticed that the Argus, the organ that supports honourable members opposite, does not mind what is done with the manhood of Australia so long as we do not touch the wealth. Honourable members opposite are quite satisfied to send the manhood of Australia anywhere and everywhere in the defence of the Empire,* but we must not do this or that or any other .thing with the wealth of the community.",33
252,Sir WILLIAM IBVINE,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,Do you that is a fair criticism of honourable members of the Opposition?  them. I am quoting the attitude of the Argus and some honourable members.,34
253,Mr GREENE,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,I have not heard one honourable member of the Opposition state that view.  member for Richmond make that statement today ,34
254,Mr GREENE,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"I assure the honourable member that I did not make that statement or anything like it .  able members of the Opposition may not hold that view, but. some of them do. There can be no doubt as to what was meant by the speech of the right honourable member for Swan. Whafc can be the object of the inquisitorial questions contained in the schedule? W it h regard to the respective merits of the voluntary and compulsory system, I wish to put to the House this point of view: Have honourable members ever heard of British, soldiers having to be driven to fight atfche point of the bayonet or sword or the muzzle of the revolver? Never 1",34
255,Dr MALONEY,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,There was the pressgang.  Csesar.,34
256,Dr MALONEY,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"Onl y eighty years ago.  What are the British troops doing ? They are leaping out of the trenches and rushing to death. On the other side, we hear of men being shot down because they will not leave the trenches. That is the difference between conscription and volunteering. I remember an incident which occurred when I was in the Transvaal. The commanding oflicer formed up the gunners, and asked for six men who would volunteer to go to certain death. There was a slight pause, and then the whole fifty-six men present stepped forward. That is what happens under the voluntary system. TJnder the pressgang system all those men would not have been ready to risk their lives. The six men who went did not put their hands into the hat to pull out their numbers; they had them beforehand. I am sorry fchafc the Bill has been introduced. What is meant by asking electors to state whether their general health is good, bad, or indifferent; and. if it is not good, to think set down the cause; and, if they are suffering from blindness, deafness, or the loss of a limb, fco give particulars'? If a health census is wished for, cannot it be obtained during the collection of the ordinary census? We know what will happen when the lists are published. Many men who are staying behind to maintain widowed mothers or the families of relatives who have gone to the fron t or who are dead will be turned out of their billets, and, although there will be no compulsion, there will be nothing left for them to do but to go to the front ",34
257,Mr YATES,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"That is happening now. Go to Adelaide, and see if it is not being done there.  sort of thing in Queensland. I am surprised that representatives of South Australia should stand it . Electors are to be asked to state the place of their birth , and the b i r t h place of their father and mother. There are thousands of men in my electorate who do not know where their fathers and mothers came from. I know where I was born, but I am not certain of the birth places of my parents. Why is. this information needed ? It grieves me that members of my party are congratulating the Government on the introduction of the Bill, just as members of the Opposition are doing.  support the Bill for the collection of a census, because I think ib is highly necesthat. sary that the Government should have the information that is sought for. As for there being too much detail in the questions asked, the honourable member for Maranoa must know that an elector will not have to answer every question.  for failure to answer questions.  be penalized for failing to answer a ques- of the Chair. tion which he could not answer. The questions regarding the possession of property will take a considerable time to answer, and it seems to me that it is hardly necessary to obtain the desired information in this way, because it can be more readily obtained in another way. It can be got from the State authorities, and from the municipalities and shires. There are also the land tax and income tax officers to apply to. I suppose there is not a State of the Commonwealth that does not collect an income tax. As for particulars of stock-in-trade, I know that in New South Wales every farmer and primary producer makes an annual return of the value of his farming implements and other possessions. I do not know what is in the minds of Ministers, but I advise them to hesitate before imposing taxation upon the landowners and agriculturists of Australia. The land-owners of New South Wales have ten taxes to pay.",34
258,Mr YATES,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"In South Australia the return from income and land taxation is £47,000 more this year than it was estimated at, although during - the year we had the biggest drought on record.  cities have been making tremendous profits out of the war. As for land taxation, the Government would demand the last penny even of a man who had lost every sheep he once possessed. In New South Wales a land-owner has to pay, first, the Federal land tax; then an income tax, on which the exemption has been reduced to £250, and the rate has been raised from 6d. to 8d. in the £ 1 ; then a super-tax of 3d. imposed by Mr Holman for war purposes. Then comes the S 1111*6 tftTC",35

263,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"That is not so.  enough to inform me, sir, what the motive of the Bill is? I do not wish to transgress your ruling, but I fail to see what other object the Bill can have than that which I am stating. The people of Australia are to be asked to give information so that they may he taxed; and I wish to point out that it would be in the public interest to interfere with une trade and business of the country as little as possible, and that, therefore, as much money as possible should be raised by way of loan.",35

Taxation proposals will be submitted by separate measures.  ting this information as expeditiously as possible; but I hope that the Government will embarrass the people as little as they can, and will not take unfair advantage of the information that they obtain. However, as I am prevented from speaking on these very important matters now, I shall reserve my remarks concerning them for another occasion.",36
266,Mr YATES,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"Adelaide) [3.30] I wish to place on record my views on this Bill, because they may appear somewhat contrary to those I have expressed in the past regarding militarism. I do not believe in militarism or in war, and I do not believe in people who believe in war. But I recognise that, at the present time, we are quite ""up against it ,"" and are involved in a war against our own wish, and that, consequently, we must make the best of a bad job. The honourable member for Maranoa seems to deprecate my want of power or influence to alter the determination of employers dn South Australia not to employ single men who they think ought to enlist. I ask that honourable member to tell me, out of the wealth of his knowledge, what power I have over the private employers in South Australia. The honourable member knows that I have no power of the kind, and his remark, I think, was a somewhat contemptible one to make.  honourable member meant.",36
267,Mr YATES,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"I accept the honourable member's assurance that he misunderstood my remark. I support this Bill because I regard it as indicating that we are beginning to systematize our war - energies; and we all hope that this will done thoroughly. There are honourable members who seem to be afraid of conscription or compulsory service; but, I what have we today but morally compulsory service? We began by offering contingents in the way they were, offered by - the Leader of the Opposition when in - power; but now we are told that the war 5s ours-that the liberties of Australia are being fought for on Gallipoli, and that it is our duty to take our proper share, and not as a merely volunteer affair. As I have always said in relation to the Defence Act, if a man chooses to make his home in Australia, and yet declines to give his aid to defend it, it is time he left the country. If it be a fact that Australian liberties are being fought for at Gallipoli, it is quite time the people were told that they must step into line and give their assistance to the defence of those liberties. We should not be dependent on voluntary service. I wish no man to take my share in the defence of the country, but I do not think I ought to take my place in the firing line while others, whose duty it is to go before myself, stay behind. I am prepared to take my active share-and I think I may say without egotism that I am skilled enough to make a ""good fist"" of it if I got to the front. There are placards about the streets showing a cap with the. inscription, ""Does this cap fit you?"" Well, if this cap fits any man in the crowd who will not put it on, why should we not put it on him? Another placard shows a vacancy in a row of soldiers, with the inscription, "" This place is left for you "" ; and, as I said before, if it is a man's duty to be in that vacant place, why not put him in it? That is the proper attitude to take up if we mean to defend Australia. What are all these placards and other efforts but moral compulsion? We can imagine the sensations of a man after the war, who has not been to the front, and who is asked by his child what part he took in defending the liberties of Australia in 1915. It may be that such a man has done as much as any in the firing line; but the child will not realise that sitting at a desk making out pension orders for the maimed and the bereaved might take the place of fighting. I regard this Bill as the first logical step that we have taken towards the shouldering of a responsibility that is ours. Some be honourable members confuse the issue by playing on the word ""conscription""; but, as I understand the term, it really ask, means the system adopted in countries where men are taken from their ordinary daily life for a term, and forced into military training, so as to be ready if they are needed. In our case, however, as soon as the war is finished, and the man comes bome either fit and well or maimed, he will resume his ordinary rights of citizenship, and could not be called out again. I am prepared to admit that the service contemplated is compulsory-and it is much better to have proper systematic methods than that men should leave for the front who, from an economic point of view, would be much more useful in Australia. Married men have gone, leaving behind wives and several children, and in case of the death of such men we are pledged to pensions for the dependents. At the same time there may be families of hefty, lusty sons who remain behind, the loss of any one of whom would, perhaps, not mean so much - The pension of f l a week to a wife and 5s. a week for children I cannot help regarding as a mere charity dole, because, with such a provision, a woman will have to work in order to bring her family up in any way respectably. I take it that this Bill, if carried to its logical conclusion, will avoid many of these effects of the present system. Every man who can fight would be brought into line, and even supposing the Bill does not result in compulsory service, we shall at least know definitely what are our resources in men, means of transport, and so forth. We are told that all employers of labour are offering the greatest facilities for their men to enlist: and we are asked to go upon the public platform and stimulate the recruiting. I wish to bring under the notice of the House a statement which was made by Mr E. Massey Burnside, general manager of the Omnibus Company, and which, as reported in the Argus of this morning, shows that he does not believe in recruiting. The secretary of the union had made some remarks in regard to wages paid, and Mr Burnside repliedNo man is shown on our books as having received £ 1 19s. for his last week's work, .but four men received £ 1 17s. 4d., £ 1 13s. I d . , £ 7d., and £ 1 18s. 9cl. respectively, because they were allowed a day off to attend at the Defence Department for the purpose of enlisting.",36
268,Mr SPEAKER,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,The honourable member is travelling outside the scope of the Bill.,37
269,Mr YATES,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"I submit that my remarks have to do with the question of the taking of a census, because the sort of thing to which the newspaper report refers could not occur if that census be taken and the Bil l carried to its logical conclusion. I wish to 3how what is taking place at the present time, and what, in all probability, the position will be if this Bill be carried into law.",37

271,Mr YATES,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,I am now referring to what has already taken place.,37
272,Mr SPEAKER,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,The honourable member is referring to another question altogether. Mr YATES:-Thes e men are said to have been allowed a day off in order to enlist; and I submit that that is the sort of thing that the Bill is brought into provide against. These men made personal sacrifice in order to offer their services to the country; and this was necessitated by the system that now prevails.,37
273,Mr SPEAKER,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,The honourable member must see that the Bill is one merely for the purpose of taking a census.,37
274,Mr YATES,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"I am quite in favour of the taking of that census; and in order to show the necessity for it, I must make a comparison between the conditions now and the conditions that wijl probably obtain after the census is taken. I have to show reasons tb my own conscience, and to my constituents, why I support this Bill, which I regard as the thin end of the wedge for compulsory service. If I can show, that in Melbourne these men were docked their pay",37
275,Mr SPEAKER,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,Order !,37
276,Mr YATES,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"I shall ref/ain . from further quoting the extract. The Government have realized, though late in the day, that we must take our proper place in the war that is now going on, I am quite in accord with the taking of a wealth census; and I do not care whether or not this is the forerunner of taxation. .Were I all-powerful on this 1 l is . continent, and had I to finance this war, I would not only take a wealth .census, but I would take the wealth. When a working man volunteers and loses his life on the field he loses his all, and his family are left unprovided for, whereas a rich man who is killed by the enemy generally leaves sufficient to provide for those he leaves behind.  provide for such cases as those suggested?",37
277,Mr YATES,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"I can only hope that the honourable member's wife and children will never he asked to subsist on such an amount as that given under the ""War Pensions Act . I would not like fco go to the front and leave my wife and girl dependent upon the pension that would be paid to them in the case of my death. We are told that the liberty of the Australian people is being decided by this war, and that it is necessary for us to take this census in order that we may successfully prosecute our efforts in the way of providing troops and financing our part of the struggle. If , in order to do this, it is necessary for the people to give all they have got, I think that should be taken, even if it means a main's last penny. I would use every means to obviate the necessity of paying interest on any war loan, because I would not pay any man interest on the money he lends in order to protect that money. "" When a man gives his life he gives all he has, and in the same way that this man has given his all , I think the capitalist, or any other man, should b""e asked to contribute all they have got. A man cannot grow another leg or another arm. He cannot come back to life once he has been killed. He has made his sacrifice, and whatever sacrifices are necessary to properly finance this war, I hope, when the census is taken, that the proper methods will also be taken to see that posterity does not have to pay for it . '",38
278,Mr RILEY,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"South Sydney) [3.50] I heartily support the Government in this measure, which I do not tliink is preliminary to the introduction of conscription. The history of the war has shown us what the position is from the point of view of conscription. When the Cook Government was in power, 20,000 men were asked for. They came forward without any pressure. Then 50,000 men were wanted. They were easily obtained. Now 100,000 men are either in camp, on transports, or at the front. All that shows that the voluntary system is quite sufficient to supply our needs. I look upon this measure not as a measure of conscription, but as one that is necessary fco the proper defence of the country. If it should happen that the country needs defending, the census will enable the Government to know where to look for the men capable of carrying on that defence. .The Bill is the first step towards national defence.",38
279,Mr FINLAYSON,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,It is the first step towards conscription.,38
280,Mr RILEY,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"I do not think it is, otherwise I would not vote for it . No one can tell what the result of this war may be, and if the situation were to arise in which we required men here, there would be a good deal of indignation, if , owing to absence of organization, the Government had sent all available men away. I admit that this census should have been taken some time ago, but it is better to do it now than not at all, and I believe the will of the people is in favour of this census. .Just as we have taken the first step in the way of organizing the manhood of the country, so T think those who have wealth should not have the slightest objection to similar organization of their wealth. I would likn to see a clause in the Bill under which the resources of the various States could be tabulated-the possibilities of transport from one State to the other, the rolling-stock and the number of locomotives. All this information would be useful to the Commonwealth Government. We need also to obtain a census of the number of motor cars, which would probably be a greater factor in national defence than railways.",38
281,Mr KELLY,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,It will not be necessary to cover the same ground twice. They have all information with regard to motor cars at the police stations.,38
282,Mr RILEY,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"The Government ought to have all information with regard to transport facilities. I have not the slightest hesitation in extending my hearty support to the Bill , though I hope when it is dealt with in Committee, the Attorney-General will agree to wipe out some of the details regarding the returns which have to be submitted. I refer, particularly, to that calling for returns of f u r n it u r e and personal effects, about which there is likely fco be a good deal of complication and annoyance. Suppose I am in co-partnership with another party in the matter of furniture and personal effects. I should like to know who is going to fill in this return for me. That is one of the many little things that will probably cause irritation. I hope the Government will not insist upon that clause, because I fail to see how information of that kind can be of any service, whilst the task of filling in the return will be a great nuisance to people who just have a few pots, pans, and tables and chairs. However, I give the Bill my hearty support. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee: Clause 1 agreed to. Clause 2 (Operation of Act ) .",38
283,Mr GLYNN,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"Angas) [3.57] - There is just one matter that I would like to bring before the notice of the Attorney General. In our general legislation we exempt certain properties from taxation, for instance, churches and church properties. I know some anxiety has been created by this Bill on the point as to whether the people concerned with properties which are exempt from taxation will be compelled to make returns. ligious trusts and charitable trusts may find difficulty in complying with the terms of the Bill , however desirous the parties responsible may be of doing it on the ground of public duty. I would ask whether the Attorney-General would not give consideration to such cases, as in all probability if taxation follows as the result of this Bill ",39

I am quite satisfied bhat both the censuses proposed under this Bill are necessary, in order to make up deficiencies in our statistical information. Neither of them, however, go to the limits to which I am prepared bo go. As the Bill sbands, our information on these matters will cease with the war.",39

289,Mr FINLAYSON,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"That is so. order to continue the supply of this in formation we should have to revive t h is Act or to pass an entirely new measure. If the spirib of this clause be properly interpreted, then this information is wanted only during time of war. That being so, the Bill is for war purposes, and the information to be obtained under it is wholly, solely, strictly, and definitely limited to War purposes. T t is quite futile for the Attorney-General to persist in his disclaimer that this is not in any sense of the term a conscription measure, since such a disclaimer is inconsistent with this clause. This census of the people, their condition, their ability, and their wealth is to be taken in order that we may use them in connection with the war. The Prime Minister said today quite clearly and distinctly that the wealth census is being taken, as everybody believes, for the deliberate and special purpose of raising a war tax.",39
290,The CHAIRMAN,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,Order ! The honRe- orable member cannot discuss the purposes of the Bill on bhis clause. He may do so when we reach clause 4.,39
291,Mr FINLAYSON,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"The duration of blie Bill is to be determined by the duration of the war, and therefore the Bill is for the purposes of the war. That is a logical deduction.",39
292,The CHAIRMAN,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"It may be logical, but it is not parliamentary. The honourable member, in other words, is not withi n the Standing Orders in discussing the question at this stage.",39
293,Mr FINLAYSON,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"The reflection, therefore, is on the Parliament, and nob on my logic. In my judgmenb the information sought to be obtained under this Bill should be collected in time of peace as well as in time of war. The proposed census relates to information that we should have obtained long ago, and it could have been secured by an amendment of the Census and Statistics Act . I should like this clause to be omitted. If it were, we could continue to obtain this information after the war had ceased. We are going to spend, it is estimated, from £150,000 to £200,000 upon this census. We are going to set in motion a lot of machinery, and, perhaps, before that machinery has completed its operations the war will be over. Let us hope that it will be. The whole machinery, however, is to be set up, and as soon as the war is over, it is to autoIn matically disappear. I object bo that. I believe that the Bill is unnecessary, and unfair, and that it is opposed to the spirit of Australia and to the spirit of the times. Clause agreed to. Clause 3 agreed bo. Clause 4 (Taking of war census) ",39
294,Mr FINLAYSON,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,Brisbane) [4.6] I object to the census being taken under this Bill .,40
295,Mr KELLY,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"The honourable member is inconsistent, since he said only a moment or two ago that it ought to be continued after the war.",40
296,Mr FINLAYSON,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,I said that I objected to the census being taken under this Bill . The Bill is entirely unnecessary.,40
297,Mr THOMAS,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"The honourable member objects not to the principle, but to the title of the Bill .",40
298,Mr FINLAYSON,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"I object to the whole thing. I am not opposed to the taking of a census of the life and wealth of the Commonwealth, but what is now proposed is that we shall take a war census. Despite the Attorney-General's disclaimer, this war census can be intended only for a specific purpose, and that is to enable the Government to provide men and money to carry on the war. It is very pleasing, of course, to hear the Prime Minister, - the Attorney-General, the Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Flinders, and others saying that this Bill does not mean conscription, and that if they thought it did they would have nothing to do with it . When I was speaking on a previous occasion, I said that I did not like to use the word "" conscription,"" which is an ugly one, and probably the compulsory service to be rendered under this Bill will not be conscription in the ordinary acceptation of the word. According to Webster, conscription means a compulsory enrolment of men for military or naval service.",40
299,The CHAIRMAN,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"This clause has nothing to do with enrolment, compulsory or otherwise.",40
300,Mr FINLAYSON,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"The Minister of Defence, speaking at the Inter-State Conference held in Melbourne on the 14th instant to deal with the question of munitions, said-» Judging by the recruiting returns of the past few days, they would have sufficient men for the firing line. There is, therefore, in the opinion of the Minister who is responsible for the defence of Australia, no need for this compulsory enrolment. More men are offering today than the Department can honestly and properly handle. Between 35 and 40 per cent, of those offering are being rejected for paltry reasons. Whatever the voluntary system may achieve in other countries, in Australia it has proved absolutely equal to every demand. There is no need for this census in order to ascertain what men are capable of serving, because those who are capable of serving are offering themselves in larger numbers than we can handle. A Bill on similar lines is now before the British Parliament, and Lord Lansdowne, a member of the British Cabinet, in speaking to the measure, saidTlie country realizes that the "" old go-as-youplease system has broken down."" . . . There is not a word regarding compulsory service in the present Bill, but I believe that the country will not tolerate voluntary service with the present anomalies and injustices much longer. This .Bill will greatly assist compulsory service, because it will shorten the interval elapsing between the decisions to resort to compulsion and absolute compulsion. I believe with Lord Lansdowne-and I .find myself in unusual company in this respect-that the Bill now before the British Parliament has behind it the same idea as that which is behind the Bill now before us, and this Bill can only have the same result. What Lord Lansdowne says is correct. The Registration Bill in Great Britain means a shortening of the interval in the ultimate step towards absolute compulsion. Our Bill is a step towards absolute compulsion, and, if the definitions in Webster's unabridged dictionary are correct, "" compulsory registration "" is "" conscription."" For that reason I oppose the Bill , and likewise the proposal to take a census under the provisions of a War Census Bill . My objections would vanish if the census proposed to be taken were taken under a Statistics Act, or some such measure, and if the Government were prepared to say that, in their judgment, the position of affairs was so serious that the exigencies of the situation could not be met without compulsory enrolment and the demanding of men's services-if they said that we must have compulsion in the matter, I would be prepared to accept tlieir decision and support them. The Government, however, cannot say that there is need for taking that step, because their own Minister of Defence says that he has sufficient men for his purposes. Evidently the Government have become scared, or they are simply slavishly following the lead of a Tory Government in the Old Country. Had the party to which I belong been on the other side of the chamber, and had this measure been introduced by the right honourable member for Parramatta or the honourable member for Flinders, every man in the party would have denounced it as being a Conscription Bill pure and simple.' I denounce it now as being a Conscription Bill . It is meant for nothing else but to compel men to serve.",40
301,Mr ATKINSON,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,Why should they not serve ?,41
302,Mr FINLAYSON,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,That is the feeling which is displayed.,41
303,Mr ATKINSON,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,Why should only the best be allowed to go ?,41
304,Mr FINLAYSON,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"Under voluntary service, the best always go, and only the best. One of the most regrettable, sad, and perplexing, yet inevitable, features of war is the fact that the best men are killed aud the older and weaker men are left to carry on the burdens of their country, and perpetuate their species. The other night, when I spoke upon this subject, I was told that it was necessary to know where our engineers and fitters were, so that they could be classified and organized, but if we require engineers we do not need to spend £200,000 in order to find them. We can get all the engineers we require by asking for them. Furthermore, we have unlimited authority to reject men offering for service on half-a-dozen different grounds. Men need not be rejected solely for being undersized, or for having defectiveteeth or flat feet. They can be rejected on the ground that their services are required in Australia. If we need engineers here, all we have to say is, "" We need you here. allow you to go to the front . "" Now that this Bill is approaching its last stages in this Chamber, I am more than ever satisfied that it is the first step towards conscription. In fact, I go further, and say that it is really a Bill for conscription, and that being the case, I am opposed to it . Clause, agreed to. Clause 5 agreed to. Clause 6 (Persons required to fill in and supply war census forms to Statistician) .",41
305,Mr GROOM,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"Darling Downs) [4.16]. - In order that persons may know what penalties are provided for failure to comply with the requirements of the Bill , will the .Attorney-General add to the census forms a specific statement as to the penalties which may be imposed ?",41
306,Mr HUGHES,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [4.17]. - Thoug h I cannot speak definitely, I am of the opinion that the space on the census form will hardly be sufficient to enable it . to be done, but at the same time. I quite agree that the widest possible publicity should be given to the consequences of not fulfilling the duties required of citizens. Clause agreed to. Clause 7 (Particulars to be specified in war census forms).",41
307,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"Flinders) [4.18] - I should like to say a good deal in regard to this clause, but as I recognise that honourable members are anxious to get away I simply ask the Attorneyt General whether.he is prepared to make a statement with regard to the schedules generally or their application ?",41
308,Mr HUGHES,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [4.19] - I snould like to mention what is in the mind of the Government in regard to these schedules, which are quite distinct in their nature and involve, to a certain extent, a corresponding distinction of treatment. Parliament will be asked to settle definitely the questions to be asked in reference to the schedule dealing with personal service, and the questions so settled upon should be put to the citizens in that form. This is necessary, because there is in the minds of some people an ideawhich I have given up trying to remove - voice d just now by the honourable member for Brisbane, that this census is for the purpose of conscription. Parliament), therefore, should determine the We cannot precise nature of these questions not settled by regulation. The position in regard to the wealth ceusus is quite different. I do not think that there is any serious difference of opinion as to what information we are trying to obtain nor of the necessity for obtaining it , but there is ample room for difference of opinion as to the precise form in which these questions ought to be put. I do not profess to speak as an expert as to the precise form the questions should take. I have a number of amendments which I intend to move to the schedule, dealing with wealth and income. The Committee will have an opportunity of expressing its opinion upon each of those amendments, as well as upon the schedule as it stands. A f t e r that has been done, however, I shall not regard the schedule as being finally settled. I have already had the benefit of some advice from tke Commissioner of Taxes in this State- Mr . Prout ""Webb-wh o has been good enough to offer me the benefit of his experience, as has also the Land Tax Commissioner and Mr Knibbs. ""What I would suggest is that after the Committee has done what it ctm towards making the schedule perfect in order to insure that it shall be as effective for our purpose as possible, the Government will not issue it u n t i l it has been submitted in its amended for m to the Joint Committee to be shortly appointed, whose members will represent the different parties in the Parliament. In this way both political sections will have the assurance that the questions to be put under the Second Schedule to the Bill will be such as the Committee in tend shall be put. And we shall thus have the benefit of the experience of the expert advice at our disposal. If honourable members will accept this suggestion, the Bill may be passed very quickly, and the discussion on the schedules considerably shortened. I have several amendments to the Bill , but I will put them as briefly as possible. As far as the wealth schedule is concerned, we shall do what we can, with the advice proffered to us by experts, to make it as perfect as possible. It will then be submitted for approval to the War Committee, representing the whole Parliament, and it will not be issued u n t i l it has been made acceptable to that body.",41
309,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"Flinders) [ 4 . 2 2 ] - I am inclined to think that the suggestion of the Attorney-General will overcome some of the difficulties which some of usexperience in regard to this matter. I need hardly say that the wealth schedule is on© which will create an enormous amount of practical difficulty in various directions. People who have had to make out returns in connection with land and income taxes are already making representations as to the superfluity of requiring them to undertake all that work again. If this Committee were asked to pass that schedule today, it would be obviously impossible to do it . We should require to debate it at length, and to make a great many suggestions in regard to it . As I underBut stand the suggestion put forward by the Attorney-General, it is that the personal service schedule should be put in order now, so that it may come into operation r all y . at once. Then the wealth schedule is to be passed in its present form, but, as clause 7 gives the Government an unlimited power of modification",42
310,Mr HUGHES,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,Whic h we shall not exercise in regard to the personal service schedule.,42
311,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"The At to rney-General, I understand, intends that the wealth schedule shall not come into force except by regulation, and then only afber the War Committee has had an opportunity of approving of it .",42
312,Mr FENTON,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,Why not provide for the submission of the regulation to this Chamber ?,42
313,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"If the House were sitting, I would be inclined to agree wibh bhat suggestion. I think that there is a good deal in the interjection. I have as great an objection to legislation by regulation as has the honourable member for Maribyrnong. TJnder ordinary circumstances I should be very sorry to vest the Government with power practically to enact legislation by means of an Order in Council. If the Attorney General will give the further assurance sought by the honourable member for Maribyrnong, I shall be very glad. In any case, this Bill ought to go through another place early next week..",42
314,Mr HUGHES,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,That is the object we have in view.,42
315,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"And I think we desire to assist the Attorney General to achieve his purpose. But the War Committee would not have sufficient time before Wednesday next to receive the advice of the special officers whom the Attorney-General has been consulting. If the Bill is to go through Parliament next week, and to be at-once put into operation as far as the personal schedule is concerned, it is obviously impossible for the requisite investigation to take place before then. Consequently, I would suggest that after the War Committee has gone full y info the matter, and after the Government have framed a regulation upon it , that regulation-as Parliament will then be sitting-shoul d be laid upon the table of this Chamber.",42
316,Mr HUGHES,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"I have no objection. I think that that course will involve a long discussion upon each item in the schedule, whereas this Committee can now say what it thinks ought to be done gene",42
317,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,What I suggest is that there are a great many things in the Second Schedule of the Bill which I am not prepared to accept without debate. But I am willing to allow the measure to go through in its present form on the Government undertaking that they will not attempt to bring it into force except by regulation.,43
318,Mr HIGGS,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"Capricornia) [4.29] - I understood the Attorney-General to say that the Committee should determine the terms of the First Schedule to the Bill , but that in regard to the Second Schedule he would prefer that the Government should be given an opportunity to alter its terms if they so desire. A f t e r the honourable gentleman's promise that the Government will not in any way attempt to alter the First Schedule, I feel disposed to move an amendment which I have framed to put this clause in order. My amendment is that we should strike out the words "" with such modifications or additions as are prescribed,"" and insert the following proviso: - ' ' Provided that the second schedule may be modified by additions or alterations as prescribed."" The adoption of that amendment would give the Government power to alter the second schedule, but not the first.",43
319,Mr HUGHES,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"In view of the positive assurance I give now I do not think the amendment is necessary. If we found it impossible to use the first schedule in the form in which it was passed, we would bring the Act back, to Parliament, and ask for an amendment. We shall not issue the first schedule except in the form in which Parliament approves of it .",43
320,Mr HIGGS,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,I understood from the honourable member for Flinders that it was the first schedule which should come before the House again as a regulation and be discussed.,43
321,Mr HUGHES,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,The reference the second schedule.,43
322,Mr GROOM,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"Darling Downs) [4.31]. - I think we may take the assurance of the Attorney-General in regard to the first schedule. As regards the second schedule, by the terms of the Bill itself the schedule must be promulgated by regulation.",43
323,Sir WILLIAM IRVINE,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,No .,43
324,Mr GROOM,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"I fchink that any modifications or additions must be made by regulation. The Attorney-General has undertaken that any modifications or additions will be made by regulation, and this House will have power under the Acts Interpretation Act to disallow any regulation of which it does not approve. In that way the House will preserve complete control by Parliament.",43
325,Mr FINLAYSON,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,That will apply to both schedules.,43
326,Mr GROOM,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"Yes , but the AtfcorneyGeneral has undertaken not to alter the first schedule. The honourable member for Corangamite has asked me to bring under notice of the Attorney-General a special request he has received by telegram, that when there are several trustees in one estate fchey should be classified as one body, and make one return, instead of each being required to furnish a return. The same request might apply to partnership properties.",43
327,Mr HUGHES,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"I have no objection to that. Clause agreed to. Clause 8 agreed to. Clause 9Every officer executing any power or duty conferred or imposed on any officer under this Act shall, before entering upon his duties or exercising such power, make, before a Justice of the Peace or a Commissioner for Declarations or a Commissioner for Affidavits, a declaration of secrecy in the form prescribed.",43
328,Mr HUGHES,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"West Sydney-At torney-General) [4.35] - I move That the words "" of secrecy "" be left out.",43
329,Sir JOHN FORREST,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,What is the object of the amendment?,43
330,Mr HUGHES,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"If we arefcodeal with the personal service cards rapidly it is undesirable fchafc the form should be of such a nature that everything connected with it should be treated confidentially. Bufc fchere is a particular meaning attaching to the words which, I apprehend, is not desirable.",43
331,Sir JOHN FORREST,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"I understood that the information wasfcobe confidential. waa to Mr HUGHES - It is the suggestion of the honourable member for Flinders that these words should be omitted, but if honourable members wish the words to be retained I shall have no objection. I ask honourable members to observe the difference between the objects of clauses 9 and 10. Clause 10 provides that an officer shall not, except as allowed by the Act, divulge the contents of any form or any information furnished in pursuance of the Act . That relates particularly to those persons engaged in dealing with the forms, but clause 9 will cover all those persons-and their name will he legion-who , throughout the Commonwealth, will be assisting in any way to instruct the people how to fill in the forms? It is perfectly proper to draw a line of demarcation between these two clauses. The contents of the schedules will be quite confidential. A person will fill in his form and post it , and nobody will see it unless the person furnishing it asks for assistance in filling it in . The words "" of secrecy"" may be omitted without danger. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clauses 10 to 13 agreed to. - Clause 14 (Punishment of offences).",43
332,Mr HIGGS,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"Capricornia) [4.38] This clause provides for a fine not exceeding £ 5 0 , or imprisonment not exceeding three months, or both, or, for an in dictable offence, a fine not exceeding £ 5 0 0 , or imprisonment not exceeding one year, or both. In connection with the decennial census a person filling in the forms is given every assistance. A collector leaves the forms at the various houses; the householders are assisted in filling in the particulars, and if they fail to give in formation they are fined. TJnder this Bill , however, no assistance is to be given to the general public to obtain the papers. The public are expected to secure the papers on their own initiative ; the cards will not be delivered to the houses. I can well believe that throughout the Commonwealth there will be hundreds and thousands of people who will know nothing whatever about this Bill or its contents, but they will still be liable under it to the penalties to which I take exception. I ask whether the services of the Post Office could not be availed of, as they will be later to distribute pamphlets dealing with the referenda proposals, to send these schedules to the people throughout the country? Honourable members will agree that the taking of a census in the TJnited Kingdom, where 45,000,000 of people reside within an area that could be hidden away in one corner of Queensland, is a very different thing '.from the taking of a census in Australia, where, although I admit millions of people live in the big cities, neighbours in the country may be 50 miles apart. I think that the services of the Post Qffice should be availed of to furnish these schedules to the people; and we - should not ask them, under penalties, to obtain them for themselves.",44
333,Mr HUGHES,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [4.42] - It would be a mistake to suppose for a moment that the Post Office Department could carry out this work without so impairing its efficiency for the performance of its ordinary functions as to result in a practical breakdown. In connection witli the census, the Government Statistician had 7,000 collectors, whose sole business was to go round with the necessary forms, and they were weeks at the work. The collection of the forms after being filled in was done by this same army of workers. The difficulty will be, not as the honourable member for Capricornia seems to think, in the people getting the forms, but in the filling of them up. It is not for this Parliament, that has passed compulsory electoral registration, to baulk at this proposal. We make a man register as an elector, whether he likes it or not; we make him send his children to school; we make him see that they are vaccinated, and so on. I remind honourable members that the people of this country are now inflamed with the desire to do something, no matter what it is, to help in the stupendous task before the nation. The people, animated by this spirit, may be trusted to carry out the duties imposed upon them under this Bill . In existing circumstances we need not despair of people performing duties with enthusiasm that, in normal circumstances, they might ignore. Consider the circumstances. There are at least 100,000 households in Australia, and perhaps not less than 1,000,000 people, intimately concerned in this matter, because their husbands, sons, or brothers are at the front , or about to go to the front. They cannot, and will not, neglect the duties i m posed upon them under this Bill , or treat them as if they were the ordinary functions of a citizen in normal times. We are here asking them to do something which, if they will not do it , cannot be done at all. I say deliberately that if the people will not do this for themselves, it cannot be done within a reasonable time, and unless it is done quickly it is useless to do it at all. As for penalties in a measure of this description, penalties must be provided' for. We must show that we are in earnest, and intend to get this information.",44
334,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,How do penalties compare with the penalties under the Census Act ?,45
335,Mr HUGHES,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"Thes e are heavier. Under the Census Act a penalty of £ 1 0 is provided for. It must be remembered that the penalties set out in this clause are maximum penalties. Magistrates in many cases do not seem to be able to understand this general rule, governing practically all Commonwealth laws. There may, therefore, be some misunderstanding; but I repeat these are maximum penalties, there is no reason why a magistrate should fine any one more than Is., or should fine hira at all, for an honest mistake or an innocent oversight. offence under the Bill for which the maximum penalty might be imposed would have to be one in which it was plain that the mind of the citizen went with the offence, and that it was committed with a criminal intent.  gentleman have the power to remit a fine ?",45
336,Mr HUGHES,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,Undoubtedly ; it is a part of my business every day to remit fines.,45
337,Sir JOHN FORREST,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"Swan) [4.46]. - I think that the penalties provided for in this clause are excessive, and I am fortified in that opinion by what the Attorney-General has said. He says that in 100,000 households throughout the Commonwealth there are people who are intimately concerned about this matter. That statement is surely inconsistent with a proposal to impose a penalty of £ 5 0 , or of £500, and in default, three to twelve months' im prisonment, for failure to comply with, the provisions of this measure. I remind the Attorney-General that failure to register for electoral purposes is met by a maximum penalty of only £ 2 . I believe this clause will be a dead letter, as the penalties proposed are monstrous. By proposing such heavy fines and imprisonment for offences under this Bill , one would think that the Attorney-General desired to make criminals of the people. I do not believe in manufacturing crimes or criminals, and I am altogether opposed to these heavy penalties. Clause agreed to. Clause 15 (Regulations). these",45
338,Mr FENTON,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,Maribyrnong) [4.47]. - I understand that in drawing up the regulations the first schedule is not to be altered.,45
339,Mr HUGHES,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,That is so.,45
340,Mr FENTON,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"But when the regulations are drawn up in connection with the second schedule, those regulations and the schedule will come before this House and may be discussed. I understand that they will not come into operation be that fore honourable members have had .an and opportunity to consider them.",45
341,Mr HUGHES,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [4.48]- I am entirely in the hands of the Committee in this matter. An Two suggestions have been made. There is no difference of opinion on the point that the second schedule shall not come into force u n t i l it has been approved eitlier by the War Committee or by this House. In my view, the War Committee could besfc deal with the matter, but I do not press that. I propose to make a number of amendments in that schedule now, because I do not desire that the Bill sliould go to another place until we have done the best we can with it. When it is returned from another place, in whatever form the second schedule may then be, the regulations relating to it , together with the schedule, will be submitted to the War Committee or to the House. Honourable members can please themselves as to the body to whom they are submitted. Mr JOSE PH COOK (Parramatta) [4.50]- I am inclined to agree with the Attorney-General in this matter, and for this reason. This House cannot, shall I say, "" police "" these matters as the W a r Committee would be able to do. We cannot call officers and question them. - Mr Fenton - The Committee would have no more opportunity of policing the matter than the House would have.",45
342,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"I think that it would. We cannot call experts and examine them here, which is what the Committee could do. Therefore, we have not the same power to make the regulations fair and equitable as the Committee would have.

344,Mr HUGHES,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"It seems to me that that question, if we determine to ask it , should be placed in the personal service schedule. It is of importance to know what arms are in the possession of p r i WAR CENSUS. vate individuals.  under GO. munition. (Underline Surname.) Mr HUGHES - Anothe r matter to which I direct attention is this: Citizens are to be asked to state whether their general health is good, bad, or indifferent, to be and-Questio n 1-if their health is not usual resigood, to state the cause. Personally, I . should have no objection to answering the Month latter question, but I have had the adyears. vantage of a discussion with the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable and learned member for Flinders, and they convinced me that the question may be regarded by many as in is quisitorial ; and, therefore, I am willing that it should be struck out of the schedule. If a man says that his health is bad, we are not really concerned as to the cause, and the man who does not tell the truth in replying to Question 6 is not likely to give a true answer to Question 7. (If employing labour other than It is enough for us to know that a man on own is unfit, and it will be time enough to inask why men are unfit when we have reain receipt son to believe that they are malingering. if out of By inserting a question regarding the to possession of fire-arms, and striking out the question as to the cause of ill-health, we shall improve the schedule. The . Conunittee has the positive assurance of the Government that the for m of questions submitted to the citizens' will be that approved by Parliament.",46
345,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"Richmond) [4.56] Is there any reason why the question. ' should not be asked- "" Are you prepared to join the ' A r m y for active service?"" Answers to that question should materiThousands of men are ready to enlist, as is shown by the way in which volunteers have been coming forward in Victoria ; and what has been happening in this State will , within the course of a few weeks, happen - in every other State of the Commonwealth. There will be a general recruitwheing campaign, and an enormous body of a men will volunteer, to join the colours.. arms There are twoprincipal objects in these attempts to organize the community-on e is to ascertain what number of men is fit to go to the front, and the other is to discover how best we can organize the community for the supply of material, equipment, and munitions for war purposes.",46
346,Mr HUGHES,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"A third purpose, which ' is, perhaps, more important than the other two, is the organization of the country industrially and in every other way to make our fighting forces more efficient.",47
347,Mr GEEENE,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"That is the point to which I am coming. The great difficulty is not to get men to go to the front, but to equip and maintain in the field those who are willing to serve. I would ask every citizen, "" Are you willing to go to the front, and, if so, what notice would you require, after acceptance, before actually joining the colours ?""",47
348,Mr ARCHIBALD,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"rWoul d it not matter whether a man was married or single, and whether he was childless or had children?",47
349,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"I have said thut the time has come when the Government should compel certain men to remain in Australia. As the Defence Department, by using the organization which we are creating, increased its equipment we could, were these questions asked, call up recruits from the classes best fitted to serve. The Minister of Defence would be able to call up the men, have the equipment ready for them, and put them straight into the camp. I think that would be infinitely better than the method we are adopting, and that is why I suggest that these questions should be put in."" There is one other question I wanted to mention in connection with the schedule, and that is in relation to those industries, those particular industries, which I think I referred to at an earlier hour. There should be a' special effort in this census to organize every man who can be utilized in those particular industries; but I do not think this schedule is drafted in such a way as to enable that to be done. It does ask a man what employment he is actually in, and what .other employment he would be willing to engage in ; but there are certain industries for which particularly we require men. Take, for instance, the,textile industry, our Woollen Mills. In Australia there are many men wbo have had experience, perhaps, not in woollen mills, but in textile industries. where looms are employed, and I think their services might be gathered in on this occasion. Then, in regard to the manufacture of shells, I know of two or three cases myself of men in country occupations who have had experience in the arsenals in England. I do not think the details of such employment will be obtained by the census in its present form, and, therefore, it is probable that the services of such men may not be secured.",47
350,Mr HUGHES,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"I think question 10-' What other occupation ""-doe s that.",47
351,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"But it does not ask if a man has had experience in such particular industries, and, personally, I think a separate schedule to deal with those special industries would have been the best means of obtaining the information.",47
352,Mr HUGHES,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,I think - we will get everybody by the notification from the Defence Department that that class of workmen is wanted.,47
353,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"If the Government are satisfied, I am. I am simply pointing out what I think would be a better way in which to obtain the fullest organization of certain industries.",47
354,Mr FISHER,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"Wide Bay-Prime Minister and Treasurer) [5.5] - I do not agree with the honourable member for Richmond that the questions as they already stand do not provide for all that is required so far as concerns registration and the discovery of the occupation which a person is best fitted to perform, apart altogether from any work he may be engaged, in at present. The questions 9A and 10 set out the position very clearly, and any intelligent person filling in that return, if he has information of that character to give, will feel called upon to supply it. I have no doubt that if further questions were prescribed the effect would be really to limit the number of persons who fill them in.",47
355,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"I think you want an actual definition, of the occupation.",47
356,Mr FISHER,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"Any information particularizing the nature of employment will undoubtedly be of great value. Coming now to the other point referred to- I am sorry in one way, but glad in another, that it was raised- I want to say at once that this Bill is not a commandeering Bill at all:",47
357,Mr GREENE,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"No one suggested that it was. Mr FISHER , - It is not a recruiting Bill. There is no suggestion that any person who gives the information asked for therein will be in any different position after he has given it than he was before, so far as the defence of the realm is'concerned.",48
358,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"At the same time, it is intended to assist recruiting, I hope.",48

371,Mr FISHER,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"Yes . No one will s a j that this Bill would not have been introduced had there been no war. I am glad the circumstances have awakened the people of Australia to a sense of their duty, and that we will get this information ",48
372,Sir JOHN FORREST,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,You have most of it already.,48

We are aware that we a quantity of information, but the tial part is not available at the present moment. By means of this census, however, it can be brought up to date speedily and completely, and I believe every honourable member on both sides of the House, and among all parties, will be very happy indeed to have this information furnished to the Government, not to determine who shall go to the war in the first instance, but so that we may be able, to mobilize our resources for the use of the people, and to enable the Government, more effectively to protect the country not, in a confrom foreign foes.",48

It is a war census. l l It is not for any civil purpose, but for war purposes only, since its operation isspecifically limited to the duration of' the war.",48
375,Mr FISHER,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"The information will live, longer than. the. war. The Bill applies, only to the taking of a census for one. period only, and not a recurring one.",48
376,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,The Bill ceases fco operate when the war is over ?,48
377,Mr FISHER,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,Certainly . the Attorney,48
378,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"And , therefore, if it is proposed' to continue to ' gather this (information after the war bhere will have to be further legislation ?",48
379,Mr FISHER,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,Exactly .,48
380,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"Is not the purpose of the Bill to classify our material and men-me n in particular-for the purpose of ordering and mobilizing our forces to the best advantage? Some men, for instance, can serve the country better in Australia than at the front ; and the Bill is intended, I take it , to get such knowledge as will enable the Government, when - they make their appeal for , volunteers, to classify the men, and show what they are best fitted to do in the prosecution of the war. It may t u rn out when the census is taken and applied to those already at the war that we have sent men whom we could very much better have kept at home. Until we have all the factors of the case before us in a tabulated form, we may not know where war, to make our appeals with most effect, and who ought to go to the f r o nt and have who ought to do duty at home. This is essenpart of the proposal which I hope wil l be carried much further, so that by means of the Committee, and in other ways, we may be able to mobilize the resources of Australia, both in men and material. Since that is the unmistakable intention of the Bill , may I suggest that no good purpose is served by trying .to make the Bill appear what it is not? This is a war census, and nothing else-it is so .stated in the Bill-and its operation is limited to the duration of the war.",48
381,Mr FINLAYSON,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"Brisbane)* [5.14]. - Some remarkable statements have been made during the progress of the debate, 'but that of the Prime Minister is the most remarkable we have yet heard. This is a war measure introduced for two reasons in particular. There are men enlisting for the front whose services could be utilized to better advantage in Australia, while there are others who are not volunteering, and who, i h the general opinion, ought to be accepting their share of the wprk at the front.",49
382,Sir JOHN FORREST,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,How are you going to make them do that?,49
383,Mr FINLAYSON,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"The information is to be gathered, as stated, for the specific purpose of finding out whom we ought to call upon.",49
384,Sir JOHN FORREST,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,And what then ?,49
385,Mr FINLAYSON,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,That is what I want to know.,49
386,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,What does the honourable member mean by ' ' call ' ' ? That is going very near compulsion!,49
387,Mr FINLAYSON,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"I have said that, in my opinion, this is a Bill for conscription-that is only my own opinion.",49
388,Mr HANNAN,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,That is not the Prime Minister's statement.,49
389,Mr FINLAYSON,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,Of course not ; it is my statement.,49
390,Mr LAIRD SMITH,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,Surely you w i cept the statement of the Prime Minister ?,49
391,Mr FINLAYSON,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"I am absolutely sure that the Prime Minister, the At torney-General, the honourable member for Flinders, and the Leader of the Oppothe sition are not in favour of conscription.",49
392,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,I am not ; I do the war ? not think it is necessary at present.,49
393,Mr HUGHES,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,Then who is trying to put conscription into force ?,49
394,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"If I thought we could not get enough men without it , would have conscription.",49
395,Mr FINLAYSON,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"If this Bill is not going to help us to get men for the front, it is entirely useless. This Bill has two purposes. We are going to take two censuses, one of which is in regard to the wealth of the country. The Prime Minister stated quite clearly, what we all know and expected, that we are going to have a war tax, and that that tax is to . be based on the wealth census taken under this Bill .",49
396,Mr FISHER,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,Nothin g of the k in d ; the tax will come much earlier than that.,49
397,Mr JOSEPH COOK,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,What does the Prime Minister mean ? We never can understand him.,49
398,Mr FINLAYSON,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"In Webster "" conscription "" is defined as the compulsory enrolment of men-no t compulsory service, but compulsory enrolment-for military service. If the Bill is not for the purpose I have indicated, what is the meaning of the question in regard to military service? Why do we ask the question, if we are not passing this Bill for war purposes ? What the country knows, and; I think, understands quite distinctly, is that this Bill is intended to give us a register of men within certain ages who are capable of bearing arms, so that we may utilize them in the best possible way in the defence of the country.",49
399,Mr AUSTIN,NATIONALFLA GS AN D," CHAPMAN - The register will stand when the war is over, and the information will be useful for other purposes.",49
400,Mr FINLAYSON,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"As I have said, the information under both headings would have been valuable before the war, and should be continued after the war.",49
401,Mr HANNAN,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,Then why object to the Bill?,49
402,Mr FINLAYSON,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"I am not just, now objecting to the Bill , but objecting l l acto* the statement of the Prime Minister that the purpose of the census is not to assist in carrying on the war.",49
403,Mr FISHER,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,I did not say that.,49
404,Mr FINLAYSON,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"Thos e may not be exact words, but is the Bill noJ in tended to assist in recruiting men for",49
405,Mr FISHER,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"Hear , hear!.",49
406,Mr HUGHES,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,As the honourable member goes on he gets worse!,49
407,Mr FINLAYSON,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"The Prime M in I ister says "" Yes , "" while the Attorney General says "" No . """,49
408,Sir JOHN FORREST,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"Swan) [5.18]. - As the discussion continues one begins to wonder what the object of the Bill at the present time, really is. Is it a war Bill , but not intended for use during the war? I take it that the object of the legislation is to get information as to what men there are between certain ages suitable to go to the war. There would be no advantage in having that information if the suitable men do not go to the front. What advantage would it be to the country to know that there are many thousands of men between certain ages who are fitted for the front , unless they are at least told that they ought to go ? If these men say that they have other obligations and duties, and are not prepared to gowhat then ?",50
409,Mr FINLAYSON,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,The honourable member for Flinders said that we ought to - demand their reasons.,50
410,Sir JOHN FORREST,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"I am not in favour of conscription, because I do not think it is necessary just now. I think, however, that the object of the Bill is to enable the Government, if we do not get sufficient response without conscription or a legal demand-whateve r we may call it-to ascertain what men are available and legislate accordingly. ought to be no blinking of the facts; otherwise, why go to the trouble of. taking the census? What can be the object of taking a census if , when we get it , we do nothing with it? The response has been too good already to demand any coercion, but I am not in favour of going to a great deal of trouble to collect information unless we are able to see what we are going to do with it when we have got it . The Bill is to have effect only during the war, and the information will soon be out of date unless it is kept up. Most of the information we require we have already. The Commonwealth Land Tax Department can tell us the value of the lands in estates above £5,000 in value, and the States can tell us the lower amounts. The Federal Statistical Department and the State Statistical Departments know all about the wealth of the country, the incomes of the people, and so on. I asked the Attorney General to let us know what Mr Knibbs thinks about this matter, and what information is desired that he cannot get from his own Department or from the Land Tax Commissioner, or the State Statistical Departments, but the Attorney-General has given me no reply on that point. If something more than we have already got is wanted we should devote ourselves to that poiut, and not go over the whole gamut, and try to get the whole of the information anew, with all the attendant trouble and expense. I would, of course, like to have all possible information catalogued, printed, and available, but I do not believe that it is to be of use to us during the war, unless it is to be for the purpose stated by honourable members opposite-to ascertaiu what men within certain ages are available to go to the war, and to make them go if they do not volunteer.",50
411,Mr HUGHES,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"West Sydney-Attor ney-General) [5.23] - I despair of being able to impress on the minds of honourable members who have lived in au atmosphere utterly remote from that now being breathed by the modern world, any conception of what the Bill is for. It is for the purpose of organizing the nation. It is a belated attempt to do that which, had it been done long ago by England and by us, would have made this war absolutely impossible. We are fighting an organized nation. The right honourable member for Swan says we have all this information. There That is a voice coming from the tombs of the Pharaohs. We have not the information. He asks what is the use of having information if we do not make use of it . The right honourable member is saturated with information that he does not make use of. We have not the information we want. We have to get it . We must do now hurriedly work that we ought to have had in leisured preparation for years. The honourable member for Brisbane has the bee of conscription in his bonnet, and because of the obstinacy of his race I give him up. On the other hand, I have the right honourable member for Swan. If this Bill means conscription, I say devoutly, without any reservation, that those two will be the first to go. If the Bill served no other useful purpose, it could not then be said to have been altogether futile. .The Bill will organize the forces of the nation. My honourable friends are unable to see that for the first time in the history of the world it is the whole nation that is at war-no t the 100,000 fighting men that we are going to set up at the front, but the nation at large. We must face the fact that, unless we organize, we cannot keep 100,000 fighting men at the front. It means the bleeding of the bestresources of the nation in men and money, aud a disorganization of commerce aud industry which we cannot tolerate. We must put our house in order. This Bill is to enable us to do it . Its purpose is not to send certain men to the front. Its purpose is to find out what numbers of men we have to do the things which have to be done. So many men have to be engaged in the primary industries. We cannot carry on the war unless we can sell our primary products. Cut off as we are, and must be, from those financial resources upon which Australia has depended for over 100 years, we must now depend, for the first time, on what we grow and make ourselves. Just as a man confronted witli tremendous obligations determines to utilize and develop his resources to the uttermost, so must this nation. And the first step towards this great work is to take stock. This is a national stocktaking, and the purpose for which we utilize the information must necessarily depend upon the circumstances of the case. The Bill is not for the purpose of conscription for service either in Australia or abroad. In no circumstances would I agree to send men oufc of this country to fight against their will . If the day ever comes when men will not fight when their country is at deathgrips, it will be because the country is rotten to the core, and not worth fighting for. If the enemy comes here it will not be a question of conscription at all, for every one, young and old, must take what comes to his hand, and die, if need be, in the attempt to defend the country.",50
412,Mr FISHER,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,That is already provided for.,51
413,Mr HUGHES,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"As the Prime M in ister reminds me, we have already provided in the Defence Act for compulsory service for Home Defence. The righfc honourable member for Swan, who does not believe in conscription, has provided for it. Conscription is stamped all over him, and it will probably be found engraven on his heart. I move That question 7 he left out. Amendment agreed to.

414,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"Richmond) [5.35] - I do not - propose to move any amendment on the lines I suggested just now, because, if I did, I should be as one crying in the wilderness; but I do urge upon the Government that, before this Bill goes through another place, they should consider the suggestions that I have made for obtaining additional information. Nothing was further from my mind than the idea of raising any controversy regarding conscription in the suggestions I made as to the direct question as to service being asked. May I repeat, as the Attorney-General has pointed out over and over again, that this Bill is fco organize the people ? Surely, when we are going to spend a large sum of money, as we are in this work, we should secure the greatest,amount of organization possible. How can we get better organization than by finding out exactly the men who are prepared to go to the front? Thousands and thousands of affirmative answers may be expected fco fchafc question. Some of these 'men will be engineers, some cloth- weavers-me n whose services will be of more value here, and whose desire to go should be known to the Government. Are not these men worth discovering?",51
415,Mr SHARPE,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,Do you intend to call upon them if fchey are willing to go?,51
416,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"Yes , that is my idea. We shall have a solid army of volunteers Whafc in the name of fortune is to prevent these men from going on with their ordinary avocations until the country is ready to equip them and send them to the fron t ?",51
417,Mr SPENCE,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,They are ready now.,51
418,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"I know they are; but' if you know where they are you can bring them in in something like orderly sequence. You can have them at the rate of 1,000 a week if you like. You can bring them in in certain classes, or you can eliminate the married men.",51
419,Mr FINLAYSON,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,But you forget fchafc the Bill is not for that purpose.,51
420,Mr SPENCE,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,That is conscription.,51
421,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"No , it is not conscription. It is organization-the very essence of organization.",51
422,Mr SPENCE,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,To do that would be to k ill the whole thing.,52
423,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,I cannot see why it should. Surely to goodness the men who are willing to go are willing to say they will go.,52
424,Mr SPENCE,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,They are saying it now.,52
425,Mr MASSYGREENE,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"I know they are; that is the whole trouble, in my opinion. I believe that within the next few weeks thousands and thousands of men from all parts of Australia will come flocking to the colours. They will have to be put into camp and provided for, and the Government are not in a position to do that, or to equip them straight way. ""Why not do as I suggest?",52
426,The CHAIRMAN,NATIONALFLA GS AN D,"Order ! I have no desire to unduly limi t the debate, but the question before the Chair is whether the schedule, as amended, should be agreed to.",52
