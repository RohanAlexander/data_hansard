1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. R. G. Halverson OBE) took the chair at 9.30 a.m., and read prayers. NA Public Works Committee Approval of Work",13
2,Mr JULL,COMMITTEES,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Development of infrastructure on the Bradshaw Field Training Area, near Timber Creek, NT. The Department of Defence proposes to develop the Bradshaw Field Training Area to allow company, battalion and brigade sized units to conduct collective and joint training in live fire and manoeuvre activities. This proposal will allow Defence to develop the area to provide long-term sustainability and greater training opportunities and ease the environmental pressure on the Mount Bundey training area. The proposal will provide a bridge over the Victoria River in the vicinity of Timber Creek; working accommodation for the range control organisation; living and working accommodation for the range masters; communications facilities; an internal road network; two camps; vehicle crossing points over creeks and rivers; two C130-capable airfields; and vehicle wash points. The estimated outturn cost is $53.66 million. It is anticipated that construction will start about now and be completed by the end of the year 2000. The Public Works Committee, in its report tabled on 28 August 1997, supports the proposal, and its recommendations are consistent with Defence proposed development plans. I would like to thank the committee for its support, and I commend the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA Approval of Proposal",13
3,Mr JULL,PARLIAMENTARY ZONE,"I move: That, in accordance with section 5 of the Parliament Act 1974, the House approves the following proposal for work in the Parliamentary Zone which was presented to the House on 2 September 1997, namely: Installation of glass safety barriers to the viewing ports in the curved walls on the roof of Parliament House. The proposed works are to the roof balustrades for the installation of glass safety the barriers to the viewing ports and the curved walls on the roof of Parliament House. Some visitors to Parliament House stand on the edge of these viewing ports. Concern has been expressed that there may be a risk of injury should someone jump or fall from the viewing ports. The installation of the glass barriers will prevent people from accessing the ports and, as such, will prevent any accidents. The glass screens will be moved from the outside of the balustrade to the inside, making it impossible for people to stand in the cut-out of the curved wall. Question resolved in the affirmative. TEXTILES, CLOTHING AND NA Suspension of Standing and Sessional Orders",13
4,Mr CREAN,FOOTWEAR INDUSTRIES,"I move: That, in view of the urgency arising from the meeting of mayors convened today by the Prime Minister, to discuss the textiles, clothing and footwear industries, so much of standing orders be suspended as would prevent the calling on forthwith, order of the day No. 29 private Members' business concerning resumption of debate on the Member for Indi's motion, That the House: (1) notes with concern the recommendations of the Industry Commission on the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Industries; (2) notes, in particular, the likely loss of thousands of jobs throughout Australia, mainly in the regions, if the recommendations of the report are adopted; and (3) calls on the Government to reject the recommendations and to legislate for a tariff pause from 2000 to 2005 to enable the full benefit of microeconomic reform to be achieved, thus strengthening the economy and industry, and maintaining jobs for Australians, In order,",13
5,Mr SPEAKER,FOOTWEAR INDUSTRIES,"Order! For some time now I have been concerned about the inordinate length that is involved in some of these recent motions. Today you are including, within the text of your motion thus far, information that is readily available to all members by virtue of the Notice Paper. From where I sit this motion is out of order, and I rule it out of order. NA",14
6,Mr CREAN,DISSENT FROM RULING,I move: That the Speaker's ruling be dissented from.,14
7,Mr SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,That's your prerogative.,14
8,Mr CREAN,DISSENT FROM RULING,"We have here a circumstance in which I have moved the suspension of standing orders because the only way we can get an issue raised in this House about TCF is to seek to move the suspension of standing orders. This is a government that promises to make the House more accountable, but refuses to allow issue and debate in the House.",14
9,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Could I take a point of order, Mr Speaker? A motion of dissent from your ruling is one of the most specific motions allowed in this House. It does not allow a wide debate, and the honourable member is straying from the terms of the debate. I would ask you to keep him to this very narrow debate. He has 20 minutes to do it.",14
10,Mr SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,I uphold the point of order. I refer the honourable member for Hotham to the procedures involved.,14
11,Mr CREAN,DISSENT FROM RULING,"I am going to the specific reason as to why I am dissenting from your ruling, Mr Speaker. Since this parliament came back, in this House we have had the circumstance, since you have been in the chair, where this government has told us that it wants this place to be more accountable, but it will not allow debate on the major issues facing this nation. The onlyMr Reith-On a point of order, Mr Speaker",14
12,Mr CREAN,DISSENT FROM RULING,This is a government that does not want to hear the truth.,14
13,Mr SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,"The honourable member for Hotham will resume his seat. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the shadow minister is claiming in his remarks that his original motion has not been allowed to proceed, namely, by virtue of your ruling-because the government does not wish to debate the TCF matter. He has just put that proposition to you. That is clearly outside the definition of relevance to the matter before the chair, namely, the dissent ruling. We have not moved that the member be not further heard because it is convention in this place that, if people have a dissent from the ruling, they are entitled to put that point of view. But it is also the convention, and required under the standing orders, that your presentation be very tight to the matter before the chair. So we resist and we will continue to raise points of order when the member is beyond the motion of dissent. He is not entitled to use this as a de facto attack on the government, which he is obviously attracted to do, but which he is not able to do under the standing orders.",14
14,Mr SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,The point of order is upheld.,14
15,Mr CREAN,DISSENT FROM RULING,"The government of course does not want to hear the truth. But let me go to the specific point, Mr Speaker. You have said that this is too long. You further said that the words that are contained in the motion are already in the Notice Paper. Since when is it a ruling of this place that you cannot contain in a motion that which is already on the Notice Paper? This is a parliament that operates through two forms: publications and debate. To suggest that you cannot contain in debate what is on the Notice Paper is absolutely ridiculous. On the question of length, I thought this issue might have been taken; I am surprised that you took it. But the motion before us today, if I were allowed to complete it, contains 234 words. There have previously been motions which you have not sought to take issue with. A censure motion from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley): 264 words. I did not even get the chance to finish mine, so how you would have known how long it was defies me. There were 264 words in the House of Representatives on Monday, 23 June, page 6049. Count them if you like. I go to 24 June, another motion of censure on the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) by the Leader of the Opposition: 352 words contained in that. Again, on Wednesday, 25 June on the sugar tariff, the member for Perth (Mr Stephen Smith), a suspension of standing orders motion: 285 words. Mine is shorter than all those, Mr Speaker, but you would not know that because you did not allow me to put it. When have we ever had a direction from you in this place about the length of a motion to suspend standing orders? When have we had that? That is why I am moving dissent from it. Mr Leo MCLeay-Or even a suggestion.",14
16,Mr CREAN,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Or even a suggestion that they are getting too long? The truth of the matter is this, Mr SPEAKER - this is completely pertinent to the point-if we know, and you know, because it has been the form of this government to gag us on every suspension motion in this place, that that is going to be their step, or at least it is anticipated, surely we have got to have the ability to put as much on the record to state our position as possible because it is the only opportunity we get. If what you are doing is limiting the opposition's ability to state its case because this government will use its numbers to stop us having that argument, then we are getting to a very sorry state of affairs. Mr Reith-On a point of order, Mr Speaker: it is not relevant, nor is it appropriate-in fact, it is in breach of the standing ordersfor the shadow minister to impugn motives to the government in respect of a ruling that you have given. The fact of the matter is that this is a technical debate about the operation of the standing orders and the convention of this House. It is not appropriate and it is outside the standing orders for the shadow minister to claim that the ruling you have given somehow relates to an attitude of the government to prevent debate. He is not entitled to say that your ruling is part and parcel of, or infer that it is part and parcel of, an intention to prevent the opposition from debating any particular issue. What you have ruled on is the form in which he has moved his motion. That is all that he is entitled to refer to. Anything else is outside the standing orders.",15
17,Mr SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,The point of order is upheld.,15
18,Mr CREAN,DISSENT FROM RULING,"The point of order is longer than my motion-that is how ridiculous we are getting in this place. Do you want us to go through the word count on everything that comes before this House? Are you going to lay down not just limits in terms of time, which are actually contained in the standing orders, but limits on words? Mr Leo MCLeay-Next will be questions.",15
19,Mr CREAN,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Next we will have limits on the words that can go into a question. We have already tried to comply with that in terms of your admonition-keeping questions short. We do not get the same requirement on their side to keep their answers short. The fact of the matter is that we are trying to play the game in this place, but we are not being given the opportunity. This ruling of yours today just goes to point out",15
20,Mr SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Order! The honourable member for Hotham will resume his seat. TheMr Reith- Mr Speaker, on a point of order",15
21,Mr CREAN,DISSENT FROM RULING,How little opportunity we have been given.,15
22,Mr SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Order! Resume your seat! Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, on a further point of order: it borders on the unparliamentary for the Manager of Opposition Business, in this debate on a very technical issue, to refer to your handling of question time, and for him to say that your treatment of answers is different from questions. In fact, if it is different, it should be different, because that is required under the standing orders. But I will not be irrelevant. My point of order is that his latest remarks are beyond the matter before the chair; he knows they are beyond the matter before the chair. We all know that he is struggling to fill in 20 minutes-I understand his dilemma. He moved this particular motion of dissent on the instructions of the member for Watson. He is a bit short of what to say, because I heard him say it. He should be ruled out of order.",15
23,Mr SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Order' The minister is debating the issue. I will ignore the minister's prefatory comments. I will uphold the point of order. Mr Leo MCLeay- Mr Speaker, I raise the point of order which I raised before you broke me off to make a ruling on the Leader of the House. My further point of order is that the Leader of the House is making these minispeeches about what he alleges is relevant, yet all the matters that he raises under the guise of points of order are irrelevancies. If you are going to rule on his point of order that it order, then surely there has to be some relevance to the standing orders in what he is talking about. My involvement in any of this-or anything else that he said about the member for Hotham-is absolutely irrelevant to his point of order. If you are going to keep us to the point about how many words there are in a darned suspension of standing orders, then surely this galoot over there should have to keep to the standing orders as well.",16
24,Mr SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,"I have listened carefully to what the honourable member for Watson has said, but there is no point of order.",16
25,Mr CREAN,DISSENT FROM RULING,"I hope I can get an uninterrupted flow, because it is clear that this person is getting up and trying to interrupt my flow by saying why your ruling is wrong. Mr Speaker, the simple facts are these: there is no standing order that imposes a limit on the length of a motion for the suspension of standing orders. There is no standing order that imposes a limitation on the content of the wording of the motion for the suspension of standing orders. You have been concerned, as you tell us, about the way in which this parliament operates, and you have actually tried at length at times to address the forms by which it can be improved. At no stage have you given an indication in writing, informally, in whatever form, about this concern that you have raised today. As I say to you, Mr Speaker, what I have put today is not different, no longer, than anything that has been put before. Therefore, why is it being raised? Mr O'Keefe-It's shorter.",16
26,Mr CREAN,DISSENT FROM RULING,"In fact, it is shorter. It is shorter than any other motion for the suspension of standing orders that this House has debated. It is shorter, Mr Speaker. Therefore, why is issue being taken with us? This is a vital issue to the nation. The member for Indi (Mr Lieberman) has moved a motion to support TCF workers. He has got a delegation in town; we want to know if he is prepared to match his actions with words. We want to know, if his motion is actually is in put for a debate in the House, that he will come across and vote with us. It is only Labor that has been out there supporting TCF workers. This is a government that has tried to gag debate at every stage; this is a government that has got a restive backbench, a backbench that goes around to meetings sticking up its hand and saying, 'We support textile workers. We support a tariff freeze,' but every time there is an opportunity for a debate in this House they gag it. They gag it and they will not vote for it. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the member alleges that the government has gagged debate on this particular occasion and that clearly is not the case.",16
27,Mr CREAN,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Mr Speaker, on the point of orderMr Reith-I have not completed",16
28,Mr SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,I have not ruled on the point of order. I am listening to it. Resume your seat.,16
29,Mr CREAN,DISSENT FROM RULING,I have not alleged gagging of this debate. His point of order is out of order.,16
30,Mr SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,Resume your seat.,17
31,Mr CREAN,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Give us a go, or move for an extension of time. Mr Reith-My point of order is that it is beyond the motion and therefore irrelevant for the shadow minister to make such allegations, and it should be ruled out of order.",17
32,Mr SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,The point of order is upheld. I encourage the honourable member for Hotham to stay within the confines of the motion.,17
33,Mr CREAN,DISSENT FROM RULING,"All right, Mr Speaker. I will stay within the confines of the motion. But it strikes me as strange that the reason that we have got this dissent motion against you is not because we believe that for the first time you have imposed something not in the standing orders as to length or to content, nor have you raised it with us on any previous occasion. And this is not the first suspension of standing orders motion that we have raised. In the short space of time available to go through those three examples I have not come to any of the motions that I have moved in this place which have been much longer. We do not take the suspension of standing orders motion issue lightly . We move them on serious issues. If the House is not prepared to give us debate, then we have no option but to resort to the other forms open to us in the standing orders-not limited by length, not limited by content, not limited by anything in the standing orders. They are saying today that they are not gagging me in this debate which is against you. What they are gagging is the TCF debate in this House. They are gagging the opportunity for the member for Indi to get up and come and vote with us, to vote for those 2,850 people in his electorate whose livelihoods depend on the textile, clothing and footwear industry. The member for Indi goes with them and says, 'I support the tariff freeze. I'll put a motion in the House but don't force them to make me vote on it for one moment.' Well, we will force him, because accountability in this place does not just mean our ability to raise issues; it means members who say something to their constituency being required to vote and back it in the House. The member for Indi should be in here today, not only listening to this debate but prepared to have it on. His motion is deficient, because calling for the tariff freeze in the textile, clothing and footwear industry is not enough. We have to also retain the import credits scheme. His motion does not contain that. That is what we are seeking today to have brought on in this place. That is the motion we want the suspension of standing orders for and, unless you put in context, Mr Speaker, the reason we want to add to that motion, unless we are referring to the deficiency by reference to what the motion is that we are seeking to bring on, the addition that we are seeking to have the House consider has less meaning. In the context of the record, the workers in the TCF industry-lOO,OOO of them around this country, the ones that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) told us in that old house, looking at his old vision, were much more secure-are not feeling secure today. They are not feeling secure because of this government's dithering on its response to the Productivity Commission.",17
34,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Mr Speaker, I take a point of order. I have tried to be tolerant but this should really be about the length of the motion and the notice on the Notice Paper. I know the shadow minister is having trouble filling in his time, but he has strayed. You have asked him now on five occasions to come back to the motion. I would suggest he is now very much outside the standing orders.",17
35,Mr SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,I uphold the point of order. I ask the honourable member for Hotham to stay within the terms of his motion.,17
36,Mr CREAN,DISSENT FROM RULING,"I am attempting to stay within the terms, Mr Speaker, and I am doing it on the basis of pointing to why we need length and content. Are you interested, Mr Speaker, to hear my explanation? Mr Reith-Now, come on!",17
37,Mr CREAN,DISSENT FROM RULING,"No, you come on. Mr Speaker, you have asked me to stick to the point. When I seek to explain that, you tum away. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, I take a point of order. It is quite unparliamentary for the Manager of Opposition Business to criticise you for taking advice from one of the clerks during the conduct of an important debate. He has just done so. I think it should be made clear to him that that is not parliamentary and is outside the usual conventions of this House.",17
38,Mr SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Whilst I uphold the point of order, I understand how the honourable member for Hotham feels. This is a very important issue which we will pursue independently outside the chamber. I do encourage the honourable member for Hotham to pursue his motion.",18
39,Mr CREAN,DISSENT FROM RULING,"It ill behoves the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) to suggest I am seeking to influence you, Mr Speaker. After all, he is the person who, outside, seeks to influence your rulings and who imposes former staffers on your payroll to make sure the lines of communication exist. Mr Reith-How low can you go?",18
40,Mr CREAN,DISSENT FROM RULING,"AlI's fair in this game and you will get back as good as you are prepared to give. Mr Speaker, you have asked me to confine this to the reason for the dissent. I am seeking to do that.",18
41,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,DISSENT FROM RULING,Six times.,18
42,Mr CREAN,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Mr Speaker, if we are going to have enforcement of standing orders, what about the interjections?",18
43,Mr SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,I did not actually hear the interjection but I do encourage ministers to resist the temptation to intrude unnecessarily into the debate.,18
44,Mr CREAN,DISSENT FROM RULING,"You did not hear the third member of the Prime Minister's cabinet who got crushed by the Prime Minister, who flunked it on the heroin trial",18
45,Mr SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,You are digressing from the motion.,18
46,Mr CREAN,DISSENT FROM RULING,"And got dumped. Mr Speaker, the situation is as clear as this: we have moved a motion because we know this government will gag us in trying to get the TCF resolution up. The motion that we have sought to move needs to contain the reason for deficiency already on the Notice Paper. What we are seeking to do is to amend that deficiency. But in doing that, we have to include that which we claim is deficient and then add to how we think it can be improved. That happens to take a few words. But I say this to you, Mr Speaker: we have done nothing in terms of this suspension of standing orders motion which is against the standing orders. There is nothing in the standing orders against the content, the length. There has been no indication from you in any discussions, even though you have made your position clear that you want to give better guidance to the way in which we can conduct our affairs in this HouseMr O'Connor-No guidance on this.",18
47,Mr CREAN,DISSENT FROM RULING,"There has been no guidance in terms of this. Out of the blue, in the middle of this very important issue, the livelihood of the textiles, clothing and footwear industry, you close us off. It is a disgrace, and we move dissent from your ruling. (Time expired)",18
48,Mr SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,Is the motion seconded? Mr Leo MCLeay-I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.,18
49,Mr REITH,DISSENT FROM RULING,"I suppose the Manager of Opposition Business, the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean), may say to himself, as he reflects on this morning's events, that that should be the last time that he takes the advice of the member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay) in the management of the affairs of the House. Mr Speaker, I was amused, bewildered and benumbed by your ruling. Mr Crean- Mr Speaker, I take a point of order. If we are going to play this silly game, I draw your attention to the fact that you should rule the same way on him as you have ruled on me-and that is, he should go to the specific relevance, the confined relevance, which this is not doing.",18
50,Mr SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,I uphold the point of order.,18
51,Mr REITH,DISSENT FROM RULING,"On the point of order, Mr Speaker: I put it to you that it is entirely relevant for me to present to the HouseMr Crean- Mr Speaker, on a point of order",18
52,Mr REITH,DISSENT FROM RULING,I haven't finished yet.,19
53,Mr SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,I am hearing a point of order. Mr Crean-He is defying your ruling.,19
54,Mr SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,"I am listening to a further point of order. Mr Crean-No, you are not. On the point of order, Mr Speaker: he said, 'On the point of order,' the one upon which you have just ruled. If he has got a different point of order, he can raise it, but if he is talking about the point of order upon which you have ruled, he is defying your ruling.",19
55,Mr SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,I thank the honourable member for Hotham. That was not my understanding. I call the minister.,19
56,Mr REITH,DISSENT FROM RULING,Without revertingMr Crean-Eighteen minutes to gostruggling already.,19
57,Mr REITH,DISSENT FROM RULING,"I can assure the House that I will not be wasting 20 minutes, as the previous member did. The circumstances of this matter are the conventional, entirely predictable norms of the House; that is, as has been clear all week, the opposition has wanted the government to bring on for debate the question of policy in the textiles, clothing and footwear industry. This is an important issue. The government has put a reference to the Productivity Commission and is awaiting the Productivity Commission's final report. Obviously, there is a lot of public interest in this issue. Senior members of the government today are meeting people from the textiles, clothing and footwear industry, which is the reason that the opposition moved the motion that they did this morning. A motion with the same content has been moved every day this week. What the opposition do not accept is that when the last election was held, the coalition parties won the election, which allows us to determine which matters the House is going to debate. Clearly, the government will, in due course, make a decision about the textiles, clothing and footwear industries and there will be a debate on those issues. Mr O'Keefe-On a point of order: the Leader of the House has now been debating for three minutes the question of the dissent from your ruling and not once has he mentioned you or anything about that ruling. Yet you consistently upheld points of order against the member for Hotham about his relevance raised by that very member. What about getting him to try to explain where he thinks your ruling actually had substance?",19
58,Mr SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,There is no point of order. The minister is addressing the terms of reference of the motion. Mr Leo MCLeay-He'll be right now. He's just got the script sent to him.,19
59,Mr REITH,DISSENT FROM RULING,"No, I have some quotes of Mr Crean on tariff policy, which I thought I might be able to get in later on! But we will come back to that in a moment. Mr Crean-On a point of order, Mr Speaker: you have clearly been put on notice that this struggling, incapable Leader of the House has just been handed some quotes by his assistant which he intends to use, which, on all rulings that you have made in this debate, he clearly cannot do. I ask you to advise him now that, when he seeks, at any stage, to go to those points, you are going to rule him out of order. If you do not, I will take the opportunity to draw your attention to it again.",19
60,Mr SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,"I thank the honourable member for Hotham. We are dealing in hypotheticals at the moment, but I will listen very carefully to the minister's contribution.",19
61,Mr REITH,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I will make every effort to be entirely relevant. It is something of a record to have seven points of order upheld against you, as the Manager of Opposition Business did earlier. The point I was making is that the background to this dissent is that the opposition wants a debate on a particular matter and, obviously, the government has the policy issue before it. When we have made a decision, we will make an announcement. The second point to make is that the opposition is, of course, entitled to move for a suspension of standing orders. When we were in opposition, whenever we were trying to make something of an issue, we would regularly come into the House and move for a suspension of standing orders. The general understanding was that we would have our say-or attempt to have our say. As Mr Beazley moved the gag, we would interject, 'Jackboots! You deny us the opportunity to speak,' which brings a smirk to the face of the member for Watson. Mr Crean-When is the Leader of the House going to get to the point?",19
62,Mr SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,Is this a point of order? Mr Crean-This is a point of order consistent with what you have been ruling me to do-be consistent. I ask you to apply it to him.,20
63,Mr SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,"I have said that I will listen very carefully to the minister's tion. At the moment the minister is relevant, so the point of order is out of order, and I the minister to resume the debate.",20
64,Mr REITH,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. This morning the opposition have used an entirely conventional and predictable parliamentary tactic, clearly with the understanding, as is always the case on these matters, that the government would prevent them from having their suspension of standing orders. That is what we always do; that is what they always did. The motion which was moved by the Manager of Opposition Business was declared by you, Mr Speaker, to be out of order. I was surprised by that, not because it was not a valid ruling-it is quite clearly a valid ruling and the government will support your ruling-but because this has been developing over some period of time. When we were in opposition, I was always conscious that we could not put a speech into a motion. There is a great attraction to do that because, as I have explained, the convention and the practice in this place is that, if you are in opposition and you move for a suspension, you know you are not going to be allowed to speak to it. So what do you do? You put your speech into the motion. You know that they are going to gag you. You know that you are going to say, 'They're fascists,' 'They're wearing their jackboots, as usual,' and 'The Leader of the House is antidemocratic, closing down freedom of speech in the crucible of our democracy.' You know that these things are going to be said, so what you do is think up everything that you wanted to say in your speecp and put it into the motion, and that is just as good as speaking to that motion. We have now started to see motions of a page or a page and a half. This one is nearly a page. This is a most welcome ruling. Furthermore, this ruling is clearly within the practices and norms of the House because it is ofMr Crean-On a point of order, Mr Speaker: I ask the Leader of the House to refer us to the precise practices and standards to which he is referring.",20
65,Mr SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,There is no point of contribuorder. Resume your seat.,20
66,Mr REITH,DISSENT FROM RULING,"The embarrassment for the call Manager of Opposition Business is that, as has just been demonstrated by his point of order, he has no understanding of the standing orders. Mr Crean-Show us the evidence.",20
67,Mr REITH,DISSENT FROM RULING,"He has developed to a high form the art of being the cheapjack opportunist, whether it is tariff policyMr O'Keefe- Mr Speaker, my point of order goes to relevance and it goes specifically to what is developing as a serious situation for you-that is, the government says that it intends to vote to uphQld your ruling but the Leader of the House has failed to give a single reason in defence of you.",20
68,Mr SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,There is no point of order. Mr O'Keefe-That is how it has been presented.,20
69,Mr SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,Resume your seat. Mr O'Keefe-So do the Speaker a favour and show why you want to defend him.,20
70,Mr SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Resume your seat.  order: I understood that a dissent from the Speaker's ruling is probably one of the most serious debates in the House. As you know, by practice you are unable to defend yourself; it rests with the Leader of the House. If, indeed, as he is arguing, this is a new ruling, I have never seen a ruling introduced and debated with such hilarity.",20

73,Mr SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,Order! The parliamentary secretary!  on the dissent motion should reflect the seriousness of the motion. The Leader of the House should move to defend quite clearly and precisely the ruling that you have made.,21
74,Mr SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,"I thank the honourable member for Chifley. Whilst the point of order is out of order, I have some sympathy with the thrust of his comments. I encourage the minister to resume the debate on the motion.",21
75,Mr REITH,DISSENT FROM RULING,"I certainly will. The fact of the matter is that with a lot of these procedures in the House they are political stunts by the opposition to further what they see as their political advantage. That is how they operate. Without reflecting unduly in a personal sense on the Manager of Opposition Business, the fact is that he sees it all as of a game. Good luck to him in the sense that he enjoys his politics, but the truth of the matter is that on each and everyone of these issues, whether it is somebody's job in Geelong or whether it is the standing orders of the House, he thinks it is all just a great game and he plays it accordingly.

77,Mr SPEAKER,DISSENT FROM RULING,There is no point of order. Resume your seat. There are other forms of the chamber to pursue those debates.,21
78,Mr REITH,DISSENT FROM RULING,"Clearly, it is not appropriate-in fact it is outside the forms and norms of the House-to use the procedures of the House to establish your argument when the giving of notice, the setting of the blue, the forms of the House are designed, obviously, to establish the order of business of the House for the day so that there can be certainty about the matters the House is going to address, so that members are aware of the issues that are going to be discussed, so that the thing can be dealt with in an orderly and sensible process. That is a long tradition of this democratic institution. We inherited many of these forms originally but developed them for our own purpose here to reflect Australian circumstances and needs. I have been aware, I must say, for some years now-we were conscious of it in opposition-that you cannot move for a suspension and use that motion as a substitute speech for a speech which you know is going to be gagged. Therefore, I think this is a very common sense ruling. It is said by the opposition that it is a means to gag debate. The truth is that most days we have a matter of public importance after question time. At no stage has the opposition nominated this issue for the general debate. So it is not as if there is no opportunity to speak on these issues. It is quite simple what has happened this morning-that is, the Manager of Opposition a bit Business has gone too far. He has pushed too far and you have, quite rightly, said there is a limit to how far you can go in drafting these motions. I think that is sensible. That will obviously develop over time. For that good reason, the government fully supports your ruling and we propose to complete the debate forthwith.

90,Mr LATHAM,STUDENT AND YOUTH ASSISTANCE,"Thank you. This bill seeks to put in place a permanent exemption for the Austudy and Abstudy student assistance schemes from the provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 as they relate to marital status. A person who is married is entitled to the independent rate of Austudy, subject to the normal income and assets test and the actual means test, if applicable. Abstudy living allowance, income testing and rent assistance eligibility criteria also come into conflict with the requirements of the Sex Discrimination Act in this regard. There is an expired provision in the act for a three-year exemption for student assistance schemes. This was to allow time for a way to be found to provide assistance to students without discriminating between those who are married and those who are in a de facto relationship. This point is actually very important because, unlike social security payments, where lower rates are often payable to people in married or de facto relationships, the incentive in Austudy is the other way. If de facto relationships as well as marriage were a sole criterion for receiving the independent rate, there would be a financial incentive for students under 25-when the independent rate is payable on the basis of age-to set up such relationships in order to be regarded as independent and free of the parental means test. The incentive is much stronger now following the government's unjustified and unreasonable decision in its first budget to raise the independent age for Austudy payments from 22 to 25 years. In his second reading speech on the bill, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs e Mr Abbott) spoke of the difficulty for scheme administrators in verifying the legitimacy of de facto relationships. The opposition acknowledges this point and, therefore, we await with interest the proposals for verifying the legitimacy of such relationships once the youth allowance is in place and students in de facto relationships of two years or more can qualify for the independent rate on that basis alone. Once the temporary legislative exemption for student assistance schemes in the Sex Discrimination Act had expired, the previous government sought exemption by administrative means through the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. Such exemptions are granted only for a finite period. When the Labor government's exemption period expired, the new coalition government sought a further exemption, which will now expire on 31 December this year. In seeking this further exemption, the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, the unlovely Senator Vanstone, undertook to provide a report to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, prior to the expiry of the exemption, on long-term solutions to address marital status discrimination in student assistance schemes. This report has not been sighted. I understand that it is in preparation, although with no particular haste. Perhaps the parliamentary secretary, in his remarks later, can enlighten the House as to the state of the preparation of the missing report. The opposition finds it extraordinary that the minister would allow this bill-which makes very clear the direction in which the government is heading on discrimination in Austudy and Abstudy-to be introduced before she has met her commitment to report to the commission. Senator Vanstone seems to go out of her way to crudely deal with sensitive issues. It is not as if student assistance overall has been treated generously by this government. In its first budget, it launched a half billion dollar attack on Austudy, which included raising the independthe ence age to 25, removing case management and the schooling incidentals allowance for homeless students and extending significantly the actual means test. Senator Vanstone's administration of the revamped AMT has become infamous not least amongst the coalition backbench-and, I dare suspect, even her parliamentary secretary-who have had to face angry, bewildered and frustrated constituents complaining about having to wait for 50 minutes or more on the so-called hotline or having to wait for more than three months for a review, or who have simply given up their attempt to study because the minister's incompetence has restricted their access to income support beyond any reasonable point. In the 1997-98 budget the government also turned its attention to Abstudy. It announced nearly $40 million in cuts out of what is an annual expenditure of only some $130 million. The government has described these cuts as 'better targeting' , but if they are about better targeting the funds would surely be redirected, not cut. Worse still, the government has announced a review of Abstudy after the cuts, with a clear instruction that it should not recommend increased expenditure. These unjustified cuts are a demonstration of the government's lack of commitment to both indigenous education and student income support. During the second reading debate on the Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill 1996 in November of last year, the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) spoke of: ... the government's commitment to equal opportunity and the prevention of discrimination. One would not know that the government had made any such commitment to students, given the nature of Senator Vanstone's behaviour. As I pointed out earlier, the opposition acknowledges the point that has been made by the parliamentary secretary about administrative difficulties. Our concern is about process-the process of Senator Vanstone bringing this legislation to the parliament prior to the appropriate report being made from the government to the commission and thereby being open to public scrutiny. This bill makes it perfectly clear that the government has decided, irrespective of any report and due process, that the issue of discrimination between married and de facto couples in relation to the student assistance scheme is too hard for it to resolve. It is not interested in the facts. It is not interested in a report. It is not interested in due process. is just interested in getting this issue off its agenda through a crude and insensitive piece of legislation. The opposition do not believe that this question should be dealt with in the manner proposed by the bill. We are not prepared to support a permanent exemption for Austudy and Abstudy from the marital status provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act and, therefore, during the consideration in detail stage of the bill I will be moving an amendment which provides exemption for a three year period only, during which time we would expect-and I think this entirely reasonable, and the community certainly has a right to this manner of scrutiny and due process-to see some sort of genuine effort by the government to address this significant issue in the proper way.",23
91,Mr ANTHONY,STUDENT AND YOUTH ASSISTANCE,"Richmond) (10.33 a.m.)The Student and Youth Assistance (Sex Discrimination Amendment) Bill 1997 represents an administrative change which will allow statutory exemption from the Sex Discrimination Act for the Austudy and Abstudy schemes. Since 1994, the federal government has had a problem with applying different tests for individuals, married couples and couples in a de facto relationship because of its breach of the Sex Discrimination Act. We all know that under the Austudy scheme single applicants are assessed differently from couples. The parents of individual applicants are means tested to assess their eligibility, while married couples are treated differently. They are treated as being independent, and their parents' income is therefore not taken into account. This different treatment is based on the principles that underpin Commonwealth allowances such as DSS payments and are accepted by both sides of this House. The principles are based on the assumption that a person with a partner has access to the financial means of that partner to meet their combined costs. In contrast, a single person who is independent of parental assistance does not have this opportunity to share costs for accommodation and other living expenses. Further, differences in the way Austudy is It assessed are found in the way married couples and de facto partners are assessed. Married couples are automatically deemed to be independent in assessing income, but de facto couples are not. If de facto partners were automatically assessed as being independent for Austudy eligibility, it would encourage people as young as 16 to leave home, enter a de facto relationship and receive full independent Austudy, free of parental means testing. I do not believe that breaking up family homes is the type of thing this government, or indeed any government, should be encouraging. I believe there are already too many incentives for parents and children to part company for the sake of collecting an additional social security payment-although I do recognise that there are times when it is appropriate. Indeed, this is the reason why the government has announced the common youth allowance, which will encourage young people to stay at school or in training rather than leave home and collect unemployment benefits. This change signals an important shift in the way this government will tackle youth unemployment and better distribute assistance to those people and families who most need it. The ALP will stand condemned for opposing the common youth allowance but, given its record of blatant obstructionism during this sitting and throughout the whole year, I will not be surprised when it decides to oppose this important policy. Returning to the issue of Austudy and Abstudy in relation to the Sex Discrimination Act, it should be noted that in 1994, under the Labor government, a temporary administrative exemption was issued by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commissioner under section 44 of the Sex Discrimination Act. This was followed by the granting of further temporary exemptions, with the current exemption ending on 31 December this year. I understand that officers from the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs have considered renewing the exemption or finding other non-legislative avenues to comply with the Sex Discrimination Act. However, such options were found to be prohibitively costly, administratively complex, legally flawed and totally against community attitudes; therefore, a statutory measure is required, which is what this bill will provide. It is important to note that the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Ms Sue Walpole, was fully consulted on this issue and that all relevant departments agreed to the permanent exemption, including the Attorney-General's Department, the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and, most importantly, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. This bill provides a permanent solution to a long-running problem. I congratulate the officers of the various departments who have dedicated their time and resources to what is a complex problem in need of reform. I commend this bill to the House.",25
92,Mr ANDREN,STUDENT AND YOUTH ASSISTANCE,"The preamble to the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 recognises the need: to eliminate, so far as is possible, discrimination against persons on the ground of sex, marital status or pregnancy in the areas of work, accommodation, education, the provision of goods, facilities and services, the disposal of land, the activities of clubs and the administration of Commonwealth laws and programs ... It attempts to ensure that every individual is equal before and under the law and has the right to equal protection and equal benefit of the law without discrimination on the grounds of sex, marital status, pregnancy or potential pregnancy. The SDA gives effect to certain provisions of the international Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, which was ratified by Australia in 1983. The Student and Youth Assistance (Sex Discrimination Amendment) Bill 1997 will provide a permanent exemption for the Austudy and Abstudy schemes from the operation of the marital status provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act. Prior to this bill, governments have periodically applied to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission for grants of exemptions, for various pieces of legislation, from the operation of the SDA. When I first saw this bill, I could not work out why the government was introducing it. The explanatory memorandum says it will have no financial impact. The bill, by adding an exemption, appears to conflict with the stated intention of the Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill 1996---currently before the Senate-of making laws fairer by removing or limiting exemptions for discrimination. It conflicts with the government's purported view that exemptions to the SDA should be limited and that, where possible, all federal legislation should be consistent with the SDA's objectives. That was in the second reading speech of the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) to the Sex Discrimination Amendment Bill 1996. It also conflicts with the government's stated policy 'to introduce positive measures to encourage equal opportunity and to prevent discrimination against individuals'. That is in the coalition's law and justice policy. Further, half the bill will be irrelevant after July 1998 when the controversial proposed youth allowance commences, rendering Austudy obsolete. Finally, the SDA has been around since 1984 and the Student and Youth Assistance Act since 1973. If the government has been able to secure exemptions from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission for all of these other years, why is it not just getting another sixmonth exemption this time? What is the difference this time? The 1997 exemption of the Austudy and Abstudy schemes from the operation of the marital status provisions of the SDA was granted on condition that the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) gave an undertaking that a report would be made to the HREOC prior to the expiry of the proposed exemption-that is, 31 December this yearon long-term solutions to address the marital status discrimination within student assistance schemes, existing and proposed. DEETY A claims it is currently preparing the report, but it is difficult to see how it be meaningful-at least as it relates to Austudy-given the impact of the bill and the imminent introduction of the youth allowance. A cynic might argue the government has decided to implement the bill because it has been taken aback by HREOC's condition. HREOC was saying, 'Okay, enough is enough, the SDA has been around for 13 years. It's about time the government actually stopped talking about removing discrimination in the difficult areas like marriage and actually addressed the issue.' What was the government's reaction? It was not about to be dictated to by the commission, was it? No, rather than try to address the issue, it has taken the easy way out. It promised to prepare a report on the issue. This place is great at preparing reports when it does not want to change anything and, therefore, entrench the exemptions by amending the legislation itself. It matters not if such a move directly conflicts with the intention of the SDA itself, international conventions or supposed government policy. To gauge further the government's position, you have only to look at how the Attorney General, and the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman), handled the report of the Steering Committee on Social Security Discrimination. The report recommended a review of the implications of the policy based on dependency assumptions; for example, indirect discrimination due to the different treatment of married couples and de facto couples in income and asset testing rates of payment. In his 1996 Review of the operation of subsectipns of the federal Sex Discrimination Act 1984, the Attorney-General, with the Minister for Social Security, undertook to report back to parliament within 12 months in relation to the issues raised by the steering committee. I may be wrong, but the only report I have been able to find so far is a dismissive two-page press release which concludes the government will not take steps to reduce 'discrimination in the social security regime on the grounds that reduced payments to couples recognise principles of economies of scale'. That is, the government assumes a person with a partner has access to the finanwill cial means of their partner to meet their combined costs whereas a single independent person, who is independent of parental assistance, does not have the opportunity to share costs. This assumption was also made clear by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Mr Abbott) in his second reading speech on this bill. He said: If de facto relationships are treated the same as marriage-that is, as a ground for independent status-there would be a financial incentive for establishing the existence of a de facto relationship ... This would make it difficult for the scheme administrators to verify the legitimacy of de facto relationships. Non-legislative options for dealing with this issue have been explored, however, these would have serious social or financial repercussions. That says it all. The government simply does not want people to live together before they are married, and it definitely does not want to pay them the independent rate of Austudy if they choose to do so. But this ignores the reality of the situation out there in mortgage land. I appreciate the government's concerns, but it is a dilemma we should tackle in the interests of fairness. I would just like to take the opportunity to remind Mr Abbott that there was a time when de facto couples received independent Austudy. Way back between 1976 and 1982, if applicants could prove their status by providing two stat decs-preferably from their parents--confirming that they had been living together for at least two years, they were considered independent. I can only conclude that the government did not look too hard for solutions. What we have here is a government which claims it supports non-discrimination principles. It then introduces an SDA amendment in 1996 which claims to limit exemptions from the operation of the SDA but which, in reality, just maintains the status quo. We have an education minister who prefers to entrench a discriminatory exemption after the commission requested she investigate how to remove discrimination from the Student and Youth Assistance Act. We have an Attorney-General and Minister for Social Security who have recognised the problem and promised to investigate and report back to parliament but who, from the detail of their report, appear to have given the issue only cursory attention. To top it off, we have a Prime Minister (Mr Howard) who earlier this year endorsed tax incentives to persuade married women to leave the work force and stay at home. It all adds up to a serious lack of commitment on the part of the government to the non-discrimination principles it claims to respect. It is a contradiction. Whatever the problems of social security rorting, I can tell you they are not the exclusive province of de facto couples. The fact is that this bill is all about about government inactivity, about a government shirking its international commitments and about entrenching discrimination, which flies in the face of the purpose of the Sex Discrimination Act. If the government were committed enough, these exemptions could surely be removed. It is about a government saying one thing and doing another. In short, it is hypocritical. The independent rate of Austudy is available to people who are orphans or wards of the state, have a dependent child, are married, are able to prove severe family breakdown, have been in the work force or have been unemployed for three out of four years or are above the age of 25. Students in de facto relationships are not considered independent. With this bill, the government is assuming that students in de facto relationships will not get married in order to access the independent rate of Austudy. I would not be so sure about this. I recently attended a mock mass wedding at Charles Sturt University in Bathurst, where 50 students tied the knot in protest at the government's increase in the age of independence from 22 to 25 years and at the failure of the government to recognise people in de facto relationships as independent. It was a novel and creative protest which effectively demonstrated the absurdity of the law. As speakers at the event pointed out, they were old enough to vote, old enough to go to gaol for their actions and old enough to fight for their country, but until they get married, have a child or tum 25 they will not be considered independent for the purposes of Austudy. I wonder, in our emphasis on family values, how commendable it is to encourage abuse of the marriage vows and sacraments. How about stat decs again on the couple's status of their de facto relationship, as de facto relationships are a fact of life? I have had students coming into my electorate office whose parents still hold on to the view that, once children tum 18, they are adults and therefore have to fend for themselves. What are the options for people in this position if they want to study? They could try to find work for three years, which could prove difficult given the high youth unemmoney, ployment rate. They could go on the dolethey will be able to until the common youth allowance is introduced. They could try to prove severe family breakdown, but they would fail because mere withdrawal of economic support is not a sufficient reason. They could have a child or get married. The point is that, for those children who are from families who do not share the government's view that it is the parents' responsibility to look after their kids until the kids are 25, there is no safety net. Such people are left to fend for themselves and, if their parents earn too much, they get nothing. On my reading of the common youth allowance bill, this will also be a feature of its operation. I do not know what the answer is to the problem, quite frankly. I can see that it would leave the system open to abuse, but the safety net issue certainly has to be addressed. In conclusion, I want to touch briefly on the infamous Austudy actual means test. It is relevant to this debate because it is another example of the discriminatory operation of the Austudy assessment system. Due to numerous inconsistencies, legislative flaws and poor handling by DEETYA, this test has impacted particularly harshly on struggling small business people and farm partnerships in my electorate. The following extracts are taken from letters I have received on the issue in my electorate. Mrs Betty Drady of Lyndhurst wrote: Austudy is a nightmare, you need an accountant to fill it in, but if you can't afford one you are penalised because you put the wrong answers in the wrong boxes. Mr Dave Phillips of Bathurst wrote: I fail to see how a family who qualify for a low income rebate on tax, do not qualify for Austudy. Do any of you live hand to mouth day by day? Try it! You are institutionalising a system which will leave people no other option than to try to cheat The test provides an alternative assessment regime for applicants whose parents are involved in private companies, trusts, small businesses or partnerships. After pressure from various members and interest groups, particularly in my electorate, the government finally decided to conduct a review into this highly controversial test. I must place on record the work of my young electorate assistant, Tim Payne, in this area. I have got no problems with the rationale behind the test, but after dealing first-hand with the problems of affected constituents it is clear that its operation is unfair. I have recently presented a submission to the review highlighting the numerous anomalies present in the test and proposing an alternative fairer assessment. I only hope that the government takes notice of the recommendations I and other contributors made before including the test in its common youth allowance. The Australian parliament introduced the Sex Discrimination Act in 1984 with a commitment to do all it could to remove from the Australian landscape discrimination on the grounds of sex, marital status, pregnancy or potential pregnancy. While current and past governments have continually reaffirmed their commitment to the principles of the SDA and to the international convention it ratifies, one could be excused for thinking that the current government is not fair dinkum about really taking a proactive approach to removing discrimination on the basis of marital status. As I have outlined, the government's action-or should I say 'inaction'-in addressing the obvious discrimination resulting from the exemption of marital status discrimination from coverage of the SDA tells the true story of the government's views on discrimination. In fact, rather than address the discrimination, the government has chosen to entrench it. It is enough to make you wonder why we have got the SDA at all. While this bill itself will not change the status quo for the treatment of de facto couples seeking Austudy, the government's handling of the issue clearly demonstrates its lack of commitment to the principles of nondiscrimination. It is clear this government will it. get proactive on removing discrimination only when it will not cost anything to do so. I wonder how many de facto couples in my electorate will be forced to get married earlier than they would like just so they can study. To be consistent, the government should remove marriage as a criterion of independence. I will certainly study the amendment to be moved by the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham). I reserve my vote on this piece of legislation.",26
93,Mr ABBOTT,STUDENT AND YOUTH ASSISTANCE,"Warringah-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs) (10.52 a.m.)-in reply-The Student and Youth Assistance (Sex Discrimination Amendment) Bill 1997 seeks to provide a permanent solution to what would otherwise be an ongoing problem. It is a problem which has bedevilled the parliament and the last government and this government for quite a few years. From their inception, the Austudy and Abstudy schemes operated under a regulatory exemption from the principles of the Sex Discrimination Act. Then in 1991 these schemes were given a temporary legislative exemption that was to run out in three years. So from 1994 these schemes have operated under a series of temporary administrative exemptions. We have gone from a regulatory exemption to a legislative exemption to an administrative exemption. Now we want to go back to a legislative exemption, only this we want to make it permanent. We do need an exemption, because this scheme, in common with all other income support schemes, treats married persons and single persons differently. They all do that because they are all based on an assumption that couples have access to the resources of each other. That is a perfectly reasonable assumption. It is acknowledged by all parties, as far as I can work out, and at all times. The Austudy and the Abstudy schemes treat differently formally and informally married applicants. Formally married people are regarded as independent under Austudy and Abstudy. De facto couples are not regarded by that fact alone as being independent for the purposes of Austudy, and for the purposes of Abstudy the relationship is required to be on foot for six months before it is recognised. This is obviously a very significant issue. It cuts to the nub of the problem that the member for Calare (Mr Andren) has alluded to. Obviously, if we were to do what the member for Calare seems to be suggestingthat is to say, extend independence to de facto couples-we would be creating a lot of additional costs for the government. In addition to that, we would perhaps be encouraging people to move into de facto relationships rather earlier than might be good for them. So this government, in common with other governments, is faced with a dilemma. We have to solve the problem. We could run Austudy and Abstudy in ways which entirely comply with the Sex Discrimination Act. We could end discrimination between de facto and other married couples. We could do that by removing marriage as a ground for independence, and that is something which the member for Cal are mentioned as a possibility. Indeed, it is something that the former government tried in February 1995, but that regulation was rejected by the Senate. Or we could add de facto marriage as a ground for independence but, as I have just said, that would be an extremely costly exercise. Sadly, someone would have to pay for it, and that someone would be your constituents and my constituents and the taxpayers of Australia. Or we time could try to provide a permanent exemption, and that is what we are going to do with this legislation. Should the Sex Discrimination Act mean that married and unmarried students are treated exactly the same for income support purposes? I do not think it should mean that. It does not happen in other bits of legislation and it should not happen here. Should the operations of the Sex Discrimination Act encourage people to move in together? Should it provide, even if only indirectly, an incentive to shack up? No, I do not believe that that is the purpose of the Sex Discrimination Act. I would point out to the member for Cal are that the youth allowance will at least in part address this problem. The youth allowance, as the member for Calare should know, will provide for de facto relationships of two years standing to be a ground of independence for the purpose of being assessed at that independent rate. In fact, we are doing with the youth allowance what was done with the tertiary education assistance scheme back in the 1970s and early 1980s. So, to that extent, the government's policies are accommodating the member for Calare's concerns. I should point out that Department of Social Security benefits are provided with a permanent exemption in the Social Security Act from the operation of the Sex Act. So what we are doing with this piece of legislation is extending the same exemption to these particular benefits as is already provided to DSS benefits. The member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) in his contribution suggested that we should do anything until the department has comwilling pleted a report to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. That report is indeed in preparation, but obviously we would not be introducing this legislation if did not think that it was perfectly consistent with the tenor of our investigation so far. What the member for Werriwa is suggesting is that we go back to the former situation a temporary legislative exemption. Well, we did that before. The former government did that. It expired and they were problem. That path has been tried; it was not very effective. Why go back to something that has failed? I have to say, for a gentleman who thinks that he is better than the people have gone before him, I am disappointed to see the member for Werriwa going back old, failed solutions. We all know that member for Werriwa thinks that he is better than his senior colleagues; it is a pity to him emulating the sort of thing that was tried by the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) and the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans). Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.",30
94,Mr LATHAM,STUDENT AND YOUTH ASSISTANCE,"I move: Schedule 1, item 1, page 3 (line 6), omit ""Nothing"", substitute ""For the period of 3 years beginning facto on the commencement of this subsection, nothing"". I addressed these issues in my remarks on the second reading of the Student and Youth time'. Assistance (Sex Discrimination Amendment) Bill 1997. It is interesting to listen to the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister Employment, Education, Training and Youth police Affairs (Mr Abbott). He provided a very poor justification as to why the government has not made public its report; why it has not coming pleted due process and reported on these out of one. issues to the Human Rights and Equal OpporDiscrimination tunity Commission. It seems to me to be an absolute perversion of process for the Parliamentary Secretary to stand up and say in the House of Representatives, 'We know what is in the report and it is not inconsistent with our legislation.' If not they know what is in the report, and he is to say that in the parliament, then make the report pUblic. Report to the human rights commission so that due process, at the very least, has been completed. This is a basic we principle in having faith in the processes of government-that information is made public and it is subject to public accountability and scrutiny. It is poor form indeed for the Parliaof mentary Secretary to take that course of action, to treat the parliament and the public with contempt on what he described as a very left with the important issue. If I might respond in the spirit in which the member for Warringah concluded his remarks. I was interested to hear his reservations about who the impact of this provision on de facto relationships. Certainly, from talking to my to parliamentary colleagues about this, we the acknowledge there is a concern about the administrative difficulty of monitoring the see legitimacy of de facto relationships in these circumstances. I think that is a public administration concern that a reasonable person would acknowledge. But the member for Warringah comes from that social engineering strand of the Liberal Party that places greater emphasis on what he thinks people should be doing. His main concern was not about the administrative difficulty; it was about whether or not it is in their best interests for people to be in a de relationship. I think his exact words were 'that it might not be in their best interests to be in a de facto relationship at this I know that the honourable member for Warringah has wide interests in these matters. for I am not saying he is part of the bedroom at this stage, but I don't think he is in any sort of position to make a judgment about whether it is in the best interests of consentadults to be in a de facto relationship or There are limits to what parliamentarians can legitimately achieve in public life. We have to allow a bit of freedom of choice and adult discretion. It is not our job to ascribe to people what their interests may be if they are in or out of a de facto or any other form of relationship. So I urge the member for Warringah at the very least, in his consideration of this matter, to drop the social engineering strand from the Liberal Party. Let us stick here to public administration matters. There are some administrative difficulties, so let us stick to those instead of getting into the sort of social engineering for which the Lyons Forum in this place has become renowned. I think these are the two matters of substance. Let us stick to the administrative issues, and let us also acknowledge the need for due process. Quite frankly, the Labor Party is not in a position to support the bill its entirety until due process has been completed, and it would be unreasonable of the government to expect us to take any other position.",31
95,Mr ABBOTT,STUDENT AND YOUTH ASSISTANCE,"Warringah-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs) (11.02 a.m.)-On the issue of due process, as I said earlier, the government is in the process of preparing a report to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, and the report will be completed and presented to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission as we have indicated. But the Student and Youth Assistance (Sex Discrimination Amendment) Bill 1997is consistent with our thinking. There is no problem there; it is a perfectly reasonable thing to do. We have to do something to solve this problem before 1 January 1998 because that is when the administrative exemption runs out. This is what we are doing, and it is a perfectly reasonable and simple thing to do. I also have to say that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has indicated that it is not opposed to the course of action that we are taking. On the question of the administrative difficulties involved in including de facto relationships as a ground of independence, as the member for Calare (Mr Andren) said, we have had, so he tells us, 50 people up at Charles Sturt University going through some kind of sham marriage. If people are prepared to go through sham marriages in order to get independent status, obviously they will be even more ready to claim to be living in a de facto relationship for the purpose of getting Austudy. It is a very simple point; it is one which all governments up until now have recognised, and it is certainly one which this government recognises. While I am mentioning the point made by the member for Calare, I wish to acknowledge his great concerns about the actual means test. I acknowledge the quality of his submission to the government's inquiry into the actual means test. I repeat in this chamber, as I have said in a number of other venues, that obviously we as a government are deeply sorry for in the pain and the suffering that people have endured because of the administrative difficulties involved with the actual means test. These administrative difficulties operated last year under the former government's AMT. We certainly have not cleared them up this year. We have to take responsibility for that, and we are working overtime now to try to ensure that the actual means test for 1998 is simpler and fairer. I have to say that it is not an easy job. It is a very difficult job, but, if we cannot make it simpler and fairer, obviously there is something fundamentally wrong with the concept or there is something fundamentally wrong with us. Let us hope that we ultimately pass the test with some colours still flying. Mr Deputy Speaker, the government sees no need for the amendment of the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham).

108,Mr LATHAM,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House: (1) is of the opinion that TAFE has a vital role to play in providing employment skills and opportunities for lifelong learning; and (2) condemns the Government: Gambaro, T. (a) for failing to properly support and resource T AFE in this important role, in direct contravention of its promises before the 1996 election; (b) for failing to meet its responsibility under the ANT A Agreement to fund vocational education and training growth on a continuing basis; (c) for cutting funding to vocational education and training at a time when demand already cannot be met; and (d) for imposing savage and unreasonable cost cutting on the T AFE sector in the name of efficiency"" . The Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 1997 amends the previously legislated amount payable to the states through the ANT A agreement to provide for cost supplementation and the effect of budget changes and also legislates an amount for 1999. The reason the amount in 1998 is to be reduced despite cost supplementation is that the 1997 budget announced a cut in Commonwealth vocational education and training grants to the states and territories of $20 million per calendar year beginning next year. These cuts are being introduced under the interesting label of benchmarking efficiencies, which are described in a budget measures table as providing 'an incentive to the states to achieve efficiency gains in their VET operations by, for example, benchmarking their activities against the most cost-effective states'. The most cost-effective state for this purpose is described as Victoria. I would suggest it has been much more about crudely cutting costs than about building effectiveness within its TAFE sector. The closure of T AFEs, described by the Kennett government as 'amalgamations', the running down of their system and the merger of 14 TAFE institutes into eight and possibly five is a further indication of how these do represent cost savings much more than efficiency or effectiveness gains. These decisions by the Victorian government have now been rewarded by the Howard government holding this as a model for the rest of the country. The irony is, however, that in Dr Kemp's so called $4.5 billion TAFE 'deal', delivery of guaranteed Commonwealth funding is dependent upon states and territories creating an extra $100,000 student places each year. Of course, this whole approach to vocational education and training, like the government's overall tackling of higher education, is input focused. Dr Kemp talks about the need to improve quality, yet the benchmarking measures he is forcing on the states are entirely focused on costs. Nothing demonstrates this better than the results of the national employer satisfaction survey conducted in late 1995 and early 1996 by AGB MCNair and funded by ANTA. It is interesting to note how Dr Kemp's star state performer-Victoria, by his assessment-is actually measured in this survey. For instance, on the question of supervisor satisfaction about the extent to which the course fitted in with work commitments, there was an Australia-wide level of satisfaction of 74 per cent but for Victoria only 65 per cent. On the question of recent T AFE graduates, where supervisors were satisfied with the compatibility of the course with training requirements, Victoria again failed to measure up to the national average. The state rated a dismal 42 per cent on the issue of satisfaction with the incorporation of on-the-job training, compared with 68 per cent for the New South Wales sector and a national average of 61 per cent. The benchmark state ranked second lowest in the country when employers were asked about the relevance of skills to the current needs of their organisation and second lowest on the issue of job readiness of graduates. Not even on the cost-effectiveness measure does Victoria make it anywhere near the national average. It scores 58 per cent, as against an Australia-wide satisfaction level of 69 per cent. Finally, when employers were asked to rate their general satisfaction with the training provided, where does Victoria rank? Last by the length of the straight. This so-called 'model state', when it comes to various measures of effectiveness and satisfaction within the sector, comes a long last. It should be noted that New South Wales, the object of some criticism by Dr Kemp, rated higher than or equal to the national average on everyone of the above criteria. It is very difficult to escape the conclusion that this is about cutting costs, whatever the result. It is about an input focus irrespective of output. More than that, it is a disturbing reminder of how this government has been driving privatisation into our education system at all levels, of course in itself driven by the minister's ideological obsession. T AFEs are being expected, with reduced funding, to continue their traditional role of providing broad access to adult education while, at the same time, competing with private providers to meet the needs of employers. As the Pro-Vice-Chancellor, Vocational Education and Training at the RMIT told the Senate inquiry into this legislation on 5 August: There has been a substantial decrease in capital funds for VET. That is a concern to us because of the old stock that we have ... if we are going to go into a competitive trading market, we are competing with other providers that may be up to date with buildings, facilities and equipment, whereas we have been left with a fairly run-down situation. This government is walking away from its responsibilities in all sectors of education. Mr Des Fooks, a former head of DEETYA's Vocational Education and Training Division told the same Senate inquiry: Of the graduates of T AFE in 1995, 55 per cent were female, 27 per cent of them came from a nonEnglish speaking background, six per cent had a disability and 1.6 per cent were Aboriginal. a pretty impressive little bundle of statistics to demonstrate the importance of T AFE in the community . . . Anything that is going to impact on T AFE resources will impact immediately on those target groups, many or most of whom will have nowhere else to goin the education sector. According to an ABS survey of T AFE graduate outcomes for 1994, the average age of T AFE graduates was 29 years, with II per cent of graduates being over 44, highlighting its critical role in the development of life-long learning, opportunity and possibility in Australia. The survey also highlighted the increasing significance of T AFE in providing particular skills to people who have previously completed a university education, with some five per cent of graduates having completed a bachelor or higher degree before commencing their T AFE course. By inadequately resourcing T AFE, therefore, the Howard government is effectively abandoning one of the most important roles it can play in Australia's current and future interest: ensuring the appropriate provision of quality education and training for all our citizens. In Dr Kemp's media release of 8 June, announcing his so-called $4.5 billion 'deal' to the states and territories, he claims his funding contract will lead to a major upgrade of the TAFE system. Dr Kemp implies, as he does in so many other areas-literacy, vocational education in schools and civics education, to name a few-that nothing ever happened until he arrived on the scene. The truth is that between 1991 and 1994 contact hours in the VET system grew by 21 per cent. The average growth rate for T AFE over the last decade has been around seven per cent per annum. In the last five years growth has been something like 10 per cent per annum, according to submissions received by the Senate inquiry. These achievements are now being ground to a halt. The Kemp deal, which reads more like a threat to the states and territories, commits the Commonwealth to a guaranteed level of funding of around $900 million annually for the next five years on the condition that the states and territories increase student places by 500,000. There will be no That is growth funds from the Commonwealth. All this growth must be funded from the states and territories through so-called efficiency gains. It is a peculiar minister indeed who is promising an extra 500,000 places in T AFE off the back of no increase in Commonwealth funding. Dr Kemp is winding back the growth component of Commonwealth funding yet telling the Australian public that 500,000 places can be produced. It is a bit like the New Testament-I know the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott), will relate to this-Dr Kemp positioning himself such that he wants to tum fishes and loaves into a feast. There is no feast without Commonwealth resourcing. There can be no feast or growth in the T AFE sector without a matching Commonwealth contribution. All the ANTA documents received by the minister highlight the past funding growth under the former Labor government and the fact that his deal is more a threat. His deal cannot produce a feast unless the Commonwealth keeps up the growth funding that the former Labor government had committed to T AFE and vocational education and training in Australia generally. The schedule to the Australian National Training Authority Act states: The Commonwealth will provide growth funding on a continuing basis. The minister is now even acting outside the schedule of the legislation. This is the reason why he wants a new ANTA agreement-an agreement on his terms and conditions alone. The government does not want to be reminded of the commitments and responsibilities from which it has walked away. It is no wonder the states are resisting so strongly. This is not an ALP piece of resistance. not an ALP objection to the way in which the minister is going about his business. The strongest objection, the strongest piece of resistance, comes from his own colleague in Victoria Phil Honeywood, the Victorian Liberal Minister for Tertiary Education and Training. He has led the drive by state and territory training ministers. They met in Adelaide because of their concerns about the future of the system. They believe in their statement that young people have had their expectations raised unrealistically. They wanted to come to Canberra to meet Dr Kemp and discuss a more reasonable proposition for future T AFE funding than the one being put forward by the Commonwealth. The minister refused their request and now the states are talking about involving the premiers-going to the top. We cannot wait for Jeff Kennett to involve himself in vocational education and training. He has been such an astute critic of this government that I would certainly welcome his intervention in this debate. He would know, as does his minister, that the states are being screwed over. The states are being ripped off in this so-called deal which, from their perspective, can only be understood as a threat-the threat that unless they squeeze the lemon in the T AFE sector there will be no Commonwealth funding out of the ANTA agreement. The states in this regard are being placed over a barrel. They are being placed in an untenable position-the 500,000 places are to come off their budgets, out of their efforts, without any Commonwealth growth funding. One could reasonably understand why they are objecting and why they have put party politics to one side to barrel the minister and highlight his hypocrisy on these various matters and to highlight the way in which his public rhetoric, particularly the promise of an additional 500,000 places, does not accord at all with the sort of information that has been provided to him by ANTA. I have the document in question available for the House. This is what ANTA have to say in their advice to Dr Kemp: The capacity of States and Territories to deliver It is efficiency gains of this orderthat is the order wanted by Dr Kempwithin a single calendar year, is problematic. They then go on to say: Experience suggests that for most states a baseline efficiency of one per cent per year has been achieved over the past five years. Nationally, annual average efficiency growth of one per cent would fund only between 9 and 20 per cent of the required growth in VET clients. For the past five years they have made a one per cent efficiency gain. If they were to do that for the next five years it would only meet one-fifth of Dr Kemp's target. So Dr Kemp is expecting the states and territories after a substantial period of change and reform within their TAFE sectors to multiply by a factor of five the efficiency gains to meet his target. Clearly it is unrealistic. Clearly it is nothing more than a publicity exercise. Clearly it is nothing more than the minister again trying to protect his own hide, advance his own interests against those of Senator Vanstone. That is not hard to do. You do not need to mislead the parliament or mislead the public to look better than Senator Vanstone. Dr Kemp is out of control and he is certainly not providing this parliament with any accurate information when one examines this ANTA document. The document goes on to say-and I think this is the most damning commentary on Dr Kemp: A reliable estimate of real efficiency possibilities as opposed to notional possibilities requires access to detailed information on Staterrerritory system budgets that is not available. The bottom line is that this information is not available. It is not available to ANTA. It is not available to the minister. The minister has no right or authority for making the claim that 500,000 extra TAFE places will be provided in the coming period. The information is not available. He is engaged in a public relations exercise that is doing damage to the relationship between the Commonwealth and the states and territories and, ultimately, and most unfortunately, doing damage to the whole nature of vocational education and training in Australia. These matters need to be placed on the public record. I am delighted to be joined in my criticism of the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, Dr Kemp, by Phil Honeywood, who has come out in his frustration in recent weeks. For example, on 13 June Mr Honeywood was reported in the Age as questioning whether the Commonwealth's aim was to 'dismantle the TAFE system by squeezing it to produce impossible efficiencies while encouraging private providers to take over training'. Mr Honeywood has been a pretty effective dismantler, a strong dismantler, in his own right. But now he is asking the question: 'who will guard the guardians?' One of the dismantlers is saying that the system will be under further pressure if Dr Kemp has his way. On 12 June the Age quotes him as saying: There is a complete sense of frustration that Dr Kemp is a centralist who does not acknowledge the part the States play in funding training. I feel is a betrayal of trust. You can tell when the Liberal Party start getting real angry about these matters: when they really want to cut into someone they describe him as a centralist. That is like putting up the cross to Count Yorga. He has really gone for the low blow of describing the minister as a centralist. On 20 August another Age report has Mr Honeywood saying: The States and Territories have just given up, basically. Kemp, just to get headlines, goes out after each Minister's meeting ... and hits us with another bombshell that we haven't agreed upon. Upon coming to office, this government acted quickly to signal that it has no commitment to any part of the education sector. It made education and training funding its No. 1 target for budget cuts at exactly the same time as it was trying to quarantine Defence spending. In its first budget, it reduced vocational education and training grants to the states and territories by $66 million over four years and abolished the five per cent real growth on TAFE for a saving of $91 million over four years. The government also cut $12 million from ANTA's operating expenses. The trend continued in the 1997 budget with the so called $72 million benchmarking efficiencies, to which I referred earlier. Vocational education and training funding has been cut by 2.2 per cent in real terms between 1996 and the year 2001, yet the government came to office having promised-again, it must have been a non-core promise-to: . . . continue to support a strong and effective T AFE sector, that is, the publicly funded network of T AFE institutions ... and to ensure that the network of T AFE institutions, especially in rural and regional centres, will not be undermined and that T AFE will continue its traditional role as a provider of further education and second chance educational opportunity, particularly for disadvantaged groups. That was the public promise. The reality since the election has been nothing more than betrayal, nothing more than empty publicity stunts, nothing more than cost saving measures and nothing more than running T AFE into the ground and not fulfilling the commitment of the former government to grow T AFE, to grow the pathways available for there post-secondary education in Australia. The other cutting blow to the T AFE sector comes with the creeping privatisation of the sector such that some $500 million a year in Commonwealth and state funds are to be made available to fund the training of all new apprentices and trainees through the provider of the employer's choice. We listened yesterday, for instance, to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) talking about the difference between sectional and national interest as he referred to the ACTU congress in Brisbane. I would question the nature of a sectional interest when employers in Australia are provided $500 million under the banner of user choice without any matching user pays. I have not known of a single part of the public sector in these recent decades of reform where user choice has not been accompanied by some element of user pays, yet here we have the federal government authorising a transfer of $500 million to employers for them to undertake the training options on behalf of their employees. I would make the point to the House that there is a substantial difference in the training agenda between employee interest and employer interest. I would have thought that, if employers were given a user choice, they would be expected to fund more substantially the nation's budget in vocational education and training than they do in Australia. If they are to have a choice of training options for their workers, they should be making a greater contribution to training funding and general support in the workplace than what we have seen in recent times. It is a dangerous proposition to place worker and employer interests in this particular perspective because it may be tempting for some employers to use their choice, to use their budgets in this particular area, to cast a narrow set of skills for their particular workers. I would have thought it would be preferable to have workers very closely involved in the casting of their own training, their own skill development. Dr Kemp has raised examples in this particular area",36
109,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"Order! The honourable member will refer to the minister by his title. Mr Martin Ferguson-Count Yorga, or Dr Doolittle?",41
110,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,The honourable member for Batman is not assisting things.,41
111,Mr LATHAM,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training has used this example: why should a worker not have four different sets of skills, say, in a wine making enterprise? Why shouldn't they not only grow the grapes, fix the vat, do the accounting systems and do the retailing? If we are to disperse skills in this fashion and provide just a narrow set of skills amalgamated to suit the interests of just one enterprise that might require that particular base of skills, it will not place the employee in a very sound situation. If the enterprise goes out of business or the industry restructures, which is almost inevitable, surely workers need a stronger base of skills than that particular example provided by the minister. So there is an argument to say that employee and employer interests do not always match, that in this particular area there needs to be better consideration of the interests of workers. They should have a stronger say in the development of their skills so their skills are portable, stand the test of industry restructuring and stand the test of economic change, which is so inevitable now in our open economy. .In so many areas-whether it be the nature of the training agenda, the funding cuts, the publicity stunts, the empty rhetoric, the misleading of the Australian people by this particular minister through to the substance of user choice and the conflicting nature of worker and employer interests-this government has moved in the wrong direction on vocational education and training. The Labor Party will be standing against these particular changes. We had a proud record in government of growing the sector. That remains our commitment. It is only out of Commonwealth growth and responsibility that T AFE places around Australia can be grown in cooperation, instead of confrontation, with the states and territories. That is our commitment. It is reflected in my second reading amendment, which I would urge the House to strongly support.",41
112,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,Is the amendment seconded? Mr Martin Ferguson-I formally second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.,41
113,Mr BROUGH,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"Longman) (11.51 a.m.)We have heard the comments of the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) and the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), who refers to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp), one of the most capable ministers in this portfolio this country has ever seen, as Dr Doolittle. I think it would be more accurate to refer to the member for Batman, as he is a former President of the ACTU, as Mr 10b-Destroy-something which he continues to try to do today. He and his colleagues obviously do not realise that the wider sector of the youth in our community are out there looking desperately for methods to get themselves into the work force because of an education system which has been failing them. I am a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training and, as part of that committee, we have been undertaking an inquiry into the constraints of employing young people. Some of the things we have heard have been very disturbing because, as those opposite and most of the community would be aware, 70 per cent of young people going to high school do not go on to a tertiary education, do not go on to university. We have heard time and time again that they feel the school system is gearing them for only one thing-that is, university-and, if they cannot get into university, they have no hope. I am very privileged to be involved with a group of people in Caboolture in my electorate of Longman who have an organisation up and running called CASILS, the Caboolture area school industry links scheme. This is an innovative program which has only commenced in the last few months. It has seen business working together with schools, private trainers as well as the public sector, the form of T AFE, to ensure that we integrate vocational education into the schools and give young people the very best opportunity to progress into the work force. The previous government-the Labor Party-left this country with apprenticeships at a 30-year low. The member for Batman, as the former President of the ACTU, stands up in this place and waxes lyrical about how we need training and how desperately we need to have a work force which is able to meet the needs of the Australian consumer and the workplace. What we find is that the very base which skilled workers come fromapprenticeships-is at a three-decade low, and the Labor Party did nothing to assist or turn the situation around. We are not taking money from vocational education but ensuring that the money that is spent is spent wisely and to the benefit of all those students who will not be going on to university. We are ensuring that the appalling lack of apprentices right across the board is addressed. The fact is we have a lack of skilled metalworkers and skilled people in the hospitality industry as far as chefs are concerned. We have heard that in Mount Isa they cannot get apprentices. In fact, MIM have told me personally that they were only able to fill half the apprenticeships they had available in 1997. Why is that? Mr Deputy Speaker, I put it to you that it is because the vocational education system applied by the previous government failed the young people of Australia. We need businesses, industry, industry leaders, the private and public sector training systems and the schools to work together. It will only be then that we will start to address the problem of vocational education needs in the schools. If I can just talk briefly about the CASILS project, we have seen young people being given an opportunity to work one day a week in a workplace so that they understand both the rights and the responsibilities they have in a workplace. Some have already gone on to traineeships and apprenticeships as a result of the work that has been undergone in Caboolture in the last few months. What has impressed me is that the business community in have not just supported this; they have become almost fanatical in their approach to wanting this scheme to progress so they can employ young people. This is a great turnaround, and it is a turnaround that has been fostered by a government policy which sees the need for vocational education to take a proper role in society. One of the private schools in BrisbaneNudgee college, which has a very long history-has also seen the need to embrace vocational education. Through its dedication, it has seen a growth in the number of young people getting jobs in that sector and not just going on to university. Nudgee is catering not just for the 30 per cent who go to university but for 100 per cent of its students, including the 70 per cent who must find jobs in the workplace. So the picture that is painted is that we have to move away from a system that has failed young people and that has failed the wider community in not allowing us to have the skills base that we need to take the opportunities that Australia offers us. Isn't it appalling that we have to go overseas to find skilled people to fill jobs in Australia? The wider community gets very upset about that, and understandably so. But we have to do that because the system that we have had in place for many years has failed to bring through those people with the skills necessary to fill positions in the industries that Australia has. Unless we tum this around and we start to put vocational education into the schools in such a way that it meets industry needs, that it is proactive rather than reactive and that it uses the resources of the public and private sector-whether it be TAFEs or private providers-then we are not going to be able to progress. The previous speaker, the member for Werriwa, mentioned ANTA. ANTA actually has the task at the moment of sifting through a number of trial schemes to come up with skills centres. Skills centres allow for technology to be placed into schools so they are able to increase the vocational education ability of the attending students. I am very much a supporter of this entire project. Once again, it is a demonstration of the government's commitment to vocational education and also its dedication to the knowledge that we must immerse both traditional and new skills in technology. This has been very well done by John Paul College on the south side of Brisbane, which have a success rate in placing their students approaching 100 per cent. They do not just have computers in the school; they have actually immersed every subject in technology. Once again, CASILS have a very innovative idea. They have put up a submission which would enable six schools, each with a particular voc ed bent-including plastics, mechanical works, agriculture and three other groups-to allow each student in those six schools to access, through technology, much of the information that is needed to fulfil those subjects. This means we get a sixfold return on the physical equipment and industry products that we are putting into each school, rather than just allowing those few students in the immediate catchment area to benefit from them. These are just some of the few ways in which we in the government are very deliberately addressing the needs of vocational education. We are listening to business. We are trying to respond to the fact that we do not have enough apprentices and that we have a skills base which has deteriorated under Labor and has not been assisted by their policy of quick turnaround courses. We are embedding technology, training and vocational education in the combined industry, schools and training providers so we have a coordinated approach to overcoming the problem. Only through the innovative ideas that this government is putting in place-supported by the increase in finances in this budget and the redirection of some of those funds into the more needy areas of vocational education such as apprenticeships, and by allowing both traineeships and apprenticeships to involve education and training at the one time-will we start to address the long-term problems of Australia's lack of a skills base. I commend the minister for the fabulous work that he is doing in a very difficult area. This area requires more than just rhetoric; it requires answers. Very shortly, a report will be tabled from the inquiry of the employment, education and training committee. I believe that many of the messages that come from the report will support what the government has been undertaking and will continue to undertake to give young people in Australia more than just a fair go-to give them the kick-start they so desperately need to get into the work force through vocational education.",41
114,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"It is a pity that the member for Longman (Mr Brough) is leaving the House, because he might have heard some of the real facts about the fall-off in the growth of traineeships and the decline in apprenticeship opportunities in the first 18 months of the Howard government. That aside, facts are not an issue that has worried those on the other side of the House with respect to their performance on the training front. I rise today to support the second reading amendment moved by my colleague the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham). In doing so, I support the condemnation of the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill expressed in the second reading amendment. This bill is about further cutting the funds needed to help train young Australians for jobs at a time when this government is responsible not only for the growth in the number of young people coming from overseas under the working holiday makers program and taking jobs and training opportunities that ought to be available to young Australians but also for a 50 per cent growth in the independent skill category of migration. So much for this government's support of training and apprenticeship opportunities for young people in Australia. This government would prefer to give training and job opportunities to people from overseas rather than concentrate on the needs of young people in Australia. That is the crux of the problem. This government has made no commitment at all to job and training opportunities for young people. It is about time this government faced up to the fact that unemployment is the biggest problem confronting Australia, in association with a lack of opportunity and a lack of a sense of security in people's lives. The bill is to implement the 1997 budget decisions-to do what? It is to cut $14.3 million from vocational and industry training and another $72 million from education and training grants to the states. That is what about. It is not about increasing opportunities but reducing opportunities through cutting the very programs that are supposedly aimed at helping young people in Australia to get decent skills on the basis of which they can be attractive to employers. This is not the first time in the last 18 months in this House that we have had to deal with cuts to training opportunities for young people. The cuts I refer to are in addition to the $183 million cut from vocational education and training in the 1996 budget, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Mr Abbott) is well aware. It is not about increasing opportunities; it is about reducing expenditure in the first two Howard budgets on training for young people in Australia and ripping away their opportunity to gain the skills that are so necessary in order for an employer to be willing to say, 'Yes, I am prepared to give a chance to that young man or that young woman for the purposes of training and for getting a job with me.' This bill is about taking us further down the road of high youth unemployment at a time when severe skills shortages exist in Australia. That is what it is about. In Western Australia and Queensland at the moment, where there is potential growth in the need for people with skiIIs, there are huge skills shortages. What are we doing about that as a nation? We are making it harder for the states to provide opportunities to overcome those skills shortages. What will we have in the very near future? We will have employers knocking on the door yet again and saying, 'Don't blame us for the fact that we did not train people, but open the doors again-bring them in from overseas.' The simple answer, the old answer is: 'We are not going to do the training. The federal government is not going to provide the opportunities for states to assist. We are not about overcoming unemployment in Australia. Open the doors. Bring them in from overseas.' That is going to be the end result of these cuts in expenditure with respect to it is vocational education and training. This bill will mean, as I have said, that more skilled vacancies are filled by ad hoc decisions to have intakes of skilled immigrants instead of using young unemployed Australians trained in this country-using people from overseas as an alternative to young unemployed Australians getting a decent opportunity in life. Last night the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). in the inaugural Prime Minister's lecture. suggested that Australia is safer and fairer than it was 18 months ago. If cuts in vocational education and training mean that Australia is safer and fairer. then I do not know what young unemployed Australians must think about the performance of the Prime Minister in the last 18 months. I suggest that the Prime Minister has been letting his Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) run around wasting money on publicity while our T AFE colleges and apprenticeship system fall into neglect. In an extraordinary outburst last week, the minister's Liberal Party colleague, the Victorian Minister for Tertiary Education and Training, Mr Honeywood-a person well known to you, Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - said that the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training was more concerned about his personal publicity than he was with putting young people into jobs. We all know what that is about; it is about Dr Kemp stabbing his senior minister in the back so that he can obtain her post at the cabinet table at the expense of young people, purely on the basis of his own self-promotion and publicity. Last week, the minister put out this very expensive glossy kit, which includes a colour photograph of himself. We all know about publicity-and we will deal with that in due course-but surely this money would have been better spent on helping some young people get training opportunities, rather than on colour photographs of the minister. The minister is also well known for doctoring the figures to give the opposite impression of the truth. Recently he has been exposed in the House on a number of occasions in question time with respect to those activities. He was known as misrepresenting statistics in his academic days, as throwing figures around without proper caution to justify his claims. He is continuing that approach as a minister of the Crown. I have the articles here to prove it if he wants to have a debate about it. He doctored the figures on the success rate of Working Nation programs. for example. to justify abandoning the election promise to maintain labour market program expenditure in real terms-again not a core promise, despite the promises before the last election. Nearly $2 billion was taken out of jobs programs in John Howard's first budget. Clearly, the real losers as a result of those cuts-for example, with respect to LEAP, which is a highly successful green program that assisted young people-were young people, their families and their local communities. The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training had to find an excuse to justify this massive betrayal-that is what it is-of a promise to maintain spending and to do something positive to reduce unemployment. But, as usual, the minister could not rely on the real facts. The real facts were that the number of long-term unemployed had fallen by 35 per cent since the Working Nation labour market programs came in. The number of long-term unemployed had fallen in trend terms every month for the last 32 months of the Labor government. So the minister, the honourable member for Goldstein, set about twisting the facts to justify cutting these effective and compassionate programs for the long-term unemployed. He even manufactured figures to discredit the programs, and the department itself knows this. For instance, he baldly stated in the House-and the Prime Minister repeated the claim-that the cost per job obtained through new work opportunities was $143,000. It later became clear that these figures related not to the cost per person assisted, as the statement implied, but the so-called cost per net impact of the programs. It also became clear-as the parliamentary secretary is well aware-that the so-called cost per net impact was a very artificial concept which served only one real purpose, and that purpose was to mislead the Australian people into thinking more was being spent on these programs than there actually was. The member for Goldstein's own senior minister, Senator Vanstone-the person whose job he is after-has admitted under questioning in Senate estimates that assessing labour market programs according to the cost per net impact is a limited measure of their effectiveness. She has specifically said that suggesting that the figure for jobs under the new work opportunities program is $143,000 is not the cost per person. Department officials made clear that this figure is in fact 14 times-yes, 14 times-the actual cost per person assisted. But that does not worry the minister, the member for Goldstein, because it is just a little twist of the figures. He did it during his academic days, and he is continuing it whilst he is a minister of the Crown.",43
115,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"Order! The member for Batman knows that the forms of the House are that, if he wishes to make that sort of allegation against another member of this House, he should move a substantive motion.",46
116,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"Mr Deputy Speaker, with all due respect, I am repeating to the House what the senior minister, Senator Vanstone, stated in Senate estimates as to the actual cost per program. These are facts put on the table in estimates by a representative of this government.",46
117,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"The member for Batman is quite entitled to state facts. It is the inferences that he might draw from those facts which are leading him close to the mark. Mr AbboU- Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. The suggestion made by the shadow minister was that the minister, the member for Goldstein, had been fiddling the figures in a former life. That is a very serious thing to say, and I think it would assist the House if he did not say things like that.",46
118,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"The member for Batman is aware of the line which I have made clear to him, and I hope that he will assist the House.",46
119,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"Not only will I assist the House but I will make available to the parliamentary secretary, for his own edification, the articles which set out the suggestions that I have made in the House. I am sure that he will find those articles of as much interest as I did. So the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training is in direct conflict with his senior minister and department. The truth is that those programs should not have been abolished. Since the government began to remove them, the number of long-term unemployed has risen by almost 32,000 to a 27-month high, reversing the steep decline in the number under Labor. Unfortunately for the parliamentary secretary, that is a fact, and I know that he does not like to deal with facts such as that. The youth unemployment rate-John Howard said reducing that in his first term as Prime Minister would be his highest priority-has in fact risen. Well might the parliamentary secretary hang his head in shame. It has risen by one full percentage point since he took office. And it is no wonder, given funding cuts to vocational training of the order enacted in this bill. The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training has been doctoring the figures again recently in relation to the number of apprenticeships in Australia, and we will deal with the facts again to prove the point that I have just suggested. At the time of the 1997 August budget, his media release titled 'Funding for new apprenticeships' portrayed the government as providing $265 million for 100,000 new apprenticeships and traineeships in 1997-98. This is grossly misleading. As this bill makes clear, funds for vocational education and training are in fact being reduced, not increased. The facts speak for themselves. The so-called new apprenticeships and traineeships are just the continuation of annual commencements, and their rate of growth has slowed drastically since the Howard government took office. The number of traditional four-year trade apprenticeships has in fact fallen, not risen, since the Howard government took office. Independent officers of the department confirmed at Senate estimates hearings a fortnight ago-and I hope the parliamentary secretary is listening because these are the facts-that the number of apprenticeships in 1996-97 will be as many as 2,000 down on the 1995-96 figures; that is, around 46,000 compared with 48,000. They are Senate estimates facts, not my figures. Then we go to the rate of growth in traineeships, which has also dramatically slowed since the Howard government took office. It has gone from 117 per cent in Labor's last year of office to around 33 per cent in the last year, with virtually no growth expected for next year. The reason for this is that the Howard government has cut rather than expanded vocational and industry training in its first two budgets by nearly $270 million-and again we are talking about facts that have been twisted and distorted to suit the minister's own best interests. Most of those cuts have been to grants to state governments. It is no wonder that the Victorian Minister for Tertiary Education and Training, Mr Honeywood, has had some harsh words to say about the performance of this government in recent weeks. When you look at the 1997 budget papers, as distinct from the minister's PR material, you see very clearly in the savings measures table-table No.7 of budget paper No. I-that another $72 million will be cut through benchmarking efficiencies in vocational education and training grants to the states. The labour and employment affairs outlays table, which is on page 4-94 of budget paper No. I-I suppose it is a bit hard dealing with the budget papers, when things have been twisted and distorted to suit people's own best interests-shows a cut of $14.3 million for vocational and industry training, including a cut of $16.8 million for entry level training in 1997-98. I suggest this bill is a further ment in a series of cuts. As a result, there has been understandable outcry from the states. On 10 August the minister made another very misleading statement. He said on the Face to face program on Channel 7 that the government would be committing new funds to enable an additional 18,000 young people to take up apprenticeships and traineeships at school. I think '18,000 new apprenticeships for secondary students' sounds like a good headline-it was, after the program. But at the Senate estimates hearings a fortnight ago, the department when questioned about the fine print was forced to admit that only 900 young people would start apprenticeships and traineeships in schools as a result of this program-not 18,000. At Senate estimates, a parliamentary process of this nation, we were told there would be only 900 places. Using the figure of 18,000 was again grossly misleading. Then last week the minister put on another glossy public relations charade. What did we get? A new program called 'Apprenticeships can work for you'. I think apprenticeships and traineeships are fairly important, but I cannot see why, when I picked up that kit-made at considerable expense to the Australian taxpayer-the first thing I came to was a glossy photo of none other than the minister, the member for Goldstein. I can understand that the minister wants to promote himself, but I would have thought the expenditure on the production of that glossy photo and on all those kits would have been better spent on trying to train young Australians rather than again opening the gates and reverting to increased immigration from overseas. That will be the end result of cuts to these programs by this government. The state governments are correctly aggrieved by the fact that there have been no consultations with them before last week's media announcements of the so-called new apprenticeships. Indeed, some are so annoyed that they are going to raise it at the next Council of Australian Governments meeting. Labor does not believe in letting the nation's skills base run down. We believe in actually tackling Australia's high and rising instalyouth unemployment. We must have an adequately resourced national training program. We must be about securing an environment conducive to companies planning ahead to meet future skills needs. It is about identifying the skills shortages and cieating the opportunities through the Commonwealth government adequately resourcing state governments and creating adequate incentives to encourage employers to take on young people in apprenticeships and traineeships. I do not care whether it is an apprenticeship or a traineeship, provided it is decent training that ensures that a young person is made job ready. To this end, Labor supports the further development of closer consultations on the training front between the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs and the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs so that we do not again resort to not only cutting expenditure on our skills needs and training opportunities but also falling back on the easy option of increased skill immigration. It is about time the Prime Minister faced up to the fact that he does have an obligation to do something about unemployment-not just youth unemployment but also mature age unemployment, one of the major problems confronting Australia. The textile, clothing and footwear decision that is about to be made is central to the debate about the future of mature age unemployed in Australia. The Prime Minister has taken no action whatsoever to expand this initiative and to prevent continuing severe skills shortages. A recent report handed down in Western Australia shows, for example, that some 7,000 skilled tradespeople, managers and engineers will need to be imported to meet expected shortages in Western Australian development projects between now and the turn of the century. I say that these shortages should be filled not by cutting expenditure on training in Australia but by increasing the number and going out of our way to get our unemployed young Australians, who desperately want work, into those training opportunities. However, the problem is that this bill and the associated cuts to T AFE colleges are going to make this impossible. I commend the second reading amendment to the House. I also ask the parliamentary secretary to examine the facts that I have referred to in the debate today. Figures have been twisted and distorted by the minister to try to suggest that he is doing something other than what he is doing in the bill before the House-that is, drastically cut expenditure on vocational education and training. The facts speak for themselves. You cannot hide from the facts. The minister is condemned. (Time expired)",46
120,Mrs STONE,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"I rise to support the original wording of the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 1997. This bill will increase the amount previously appropriated for 1997 under the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act 1992 by some $17.938 million in line with normal price adjustments. It will take the total funding for 1997 to $909.938 million. The bill will also amend the legislated amount for 1998 to $890.585 million, giving effect to the 1997-98 budget decision for funding for distribution to the states and territories by the Australian National Training Authority. The bill will appropriate the same level of funding for 1999. The extent to which a nation achieves a standard of living that is acceptable depends on the levels and relevancy of its education and training. That is what this bill is all about-making sure we have the funding that is going to ensure that the Australian nation has the levels of education and training that will fit this nation for the part it wants to play in the global economy of the next century. What we had under Labor over the last decade was an appalling situation of a maldistribution of skills. In the city areas we had oversupplies of people like medical and hospital staffs, doctors, nurses and paramedics of all descriptions. We had teachers clustered in cities. We had the hospitality and tourism employees clustered in metropolitan areas. But in regional Australia we had a skills shortage. In electorates like Murray we have restaurants that could be open seven days a week, with bookings well in advance, open only two or three days a week, because we in the country do not have the hospitality and tourism staff necessary to keep those sorts of businesses open. Under Labor we had a situation where, as migrants came into this country, they automatically and quite happily ended up in the major metropolitan centres of Sydney and Melbourne. There was no incentive for them to be directed towards regional centres. Under our migration policy, we are giving incentives to those who come here with skills to locate in regional areas. The electorate of Murray has just been designated a part of one regional skilled migration program. We want to make sure that we get our share. And of course there will be no blow-out in the migration numbers that we are now permitting into this country. The member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) seemed to suggest that we are going to have ever increasing skilled migration. We are saying that we want to very carefully focus our immigration policy on the skilled people this country is currently short of, and then provide incentives for them to come to regional Australia. Under Labor we had a very sad situation where, as the realisation of the election drew nigh, instead of looking at the essential training needs of our younger people they looked at Mickey Mouse short-term training courses to make sure the stats looked better, without giving any long-term work opportunities to the younger people in the dole queues. What this government does is look very seriously at the long-term needs of the nation. We want to give those older people who are unemployed the opportunity to gain training that enables them to be geographically mobile, so that they have qualifications which allow them to move around this nation and do not restrict them to one state. We are also looking very seriously at how we can make sure that our younger people can adjust their lifelong training needs. We want them to be able to move in and out of training as their families grow and as their interests change. We will not focus on a quick fix for the sake of statistics-a Mickey Mouse course that does nothing to adjust unemployment in the nation. Unfortunately, for the decade or more that Labor was in office, Australia was not well served by our post-primary school system. Teachers, parents and students have been focused on university entrance. At the end of each year 11 and 12 more than half of the students have been finishing their post-primary education disappointed and disillusioned. In the case of those lucky enough to get places at university, attrition rates have soared to between 26 and 55 per cent. Meanwhile, we have seen the number of young people entering skilled trades plummeting and the youth unemployment rates rising, especially in regional Australia. This government is addressing the problem of the deskilling of parts of the populationthe skills shortages, the maldistribution of skills that we have in this country, the irrelevancy of much of the training that went on before, and the clumping and clustering of skilled labour in areas where there has been an oversupply for many years. The previous speaker referred to the new apprenticeship scheme that has just been announced by the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp). This scheme is one of the most essential parts of our new order which will make sure that we have people trained for life. It is an initiative of national significance. It aims to refocus the educational thinking of a generation of people badly and sadly served by Labor. We do not simply look at what happens to our students as they leave the post-primary school sector. We understand that we have to tackle the skills needs of Australia back in the schools, where students first begin to form their views about careers and about their own potential. So the Commonwealth is providing $187 million over four years for a school to work package. Fifty million dollars will be available in 1998 specifically to expand vocational education in secondary schools. This funding has several components. Twenty million dollars will be allocated in 1997-98 for expansion of the vocational education and training program in schools. This program was introduced by Labor, but they left it at such low levels of resourcing that the actual numbers involved in VET in schools were inadequate. Approximately $7 million will be put into 1997-98 funds for the school to work program. There will be $9.9 million in 199798 for the Australian Student Traineeship Foundation; $10 million in 1997-98 for the Australian Student Traineeship Foundation workplace coordination funding; and $5 million in 1997-98 for jobs pathways programs. In my electorate of Murray there has now been a response to this government's initiatives and the funding that is helping them to achieve the goals that they need to achieve for their young people. There are altogether 18 government and independent colleges offering post-primary education and, of these, the half are now offering vocational education and training as part of their programs. All programs commenced within the last year or so. For example, Numurkah Secondary College is in the first year of its program. When they considered the needs of their local industry, they saw career paths and a clear need for training for young people in the fields of agriculture and engineering training that would enable people to remain in regional communities, thereby ensuring the continuation of the social and physical infrastructure necessary to keep those communities intact. In talking to these young students, you cannot help but be struck by their commitment to their chosen fields, their enthusiasm, which comes from taking part in a real life education experience, and their realistic but, at the same time, lofty goals in life. These students are already fielding job offers from local businesses, who are keen to pick them up before they get lured away to other areas with skills shortages like ours. In the NBEET report for 1995, Towards a national education training strategy for rural Australia, it was noted that there are proportionately higher concentrations of demographic groupings in rural and regional Australia which are underrepresented generally in education and training. These are Aboriginal people, early school leavers, persons with no post-school qualifications and low income earners. Statistics show, too, that when our rural students do get to universities, while they are overrepresented in agricultural related courses, they are substantially underrepresented in courses of all other descriptions-in medicine, in law, in business, in architecture and in courses that would give them the qualifications that would help them to come back and fill those positions that we currently are facing huge shortages in. I want to remind you that this is a 1995 report. The report said that limited employment opportunities in many rural areas contributed to low participation in education training. That no longer is the case. We have those job opportunities in our areas now, but we need to create the training opportunities. What did Labor do about the 1995 report? Unfortunately, not very much. Decades of inflexibility and irrelevancy in the vocational education and training system took their toll. The past is now with us; it has come back to haunt us. Today's crisis in skilled labour shortages in my electorate was well and truly entrenched 10 years ago when rural electorates were heading into recession. They had, of course, the huge costs of employment of labour; they had the task of putting on an apprentice that involved them in complicated red tape. There were costs associated with putting on a young person. There was, of course, the relative lack of control a company had over the formal training portion of the apprenticeship itself. So, for many small businesses, surviving in the short term meant not taking on apprentices. Today we have businesses, such as our metal fabricators, who want to participate in the extraordinary opportunities now growing in Asia for processed food. Some of these manufacturers have positions now for 40 or 50 metal fabricators that they cannot fill. They are trying to find trainees for these positions and, at this point in time, after a decade of neglect of the system, those trainees are simply not there. It is going to be an enormous challenge for an area such as Murray, which has had substantial overseas offshore investment in our food manufacturing area, to find the young people to do the training and to make sure that the systems will deliver to them the training that gives them the opportunities now presenting offshore in the supermarket to Asia scenario. We have food manufacturing demands that we can meet only if we have the skilled labour. According to the draft report by the Australian Student Traineeship Foundation, we are now making up for lost time. Vocational education and training in schools programs, for years 11 and 12 across Australia, in 1997-that is, this year-now involve 38,867 students. This represents a 116 per cent increase over 1996, and a very significant increase from the 2,815 students involved in the ASTF-supported VET in the previous program in schools in 1995, when Labor had their hands on the wheel. We have heard from the previous speaker, the honourable member for Batman, that Labor did it well. If it was being done so very well, why are we seeing right now a 116 per cent increase in participation in these vocational education programs in schools? The growth in these programs from 1996 to 1997 is significant, both in metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas. Particularly, I am pleased to see this growth in the LoddonCampaspe and Mallee areas. Loddon-Campaspe is entirely in the electorate of Murray, and parts of Mallee are too. Those are the areas which have seen the highest levels of youth unemployment in the past. While we are now putting funding towards these VET schemes in both metropolitan and rural areas, in regional schools we may need to give particular additional support as the schools try to establish the schemes. It is more difficult for their teachers to get access to professional development. It is more difficult for our young students to observe a diversity of local role models, given that the populations are smaller. Students who are in remote situations may never have interacted with a whole range of professions that are found in metropolitan areas. So I am sure that, as we move along, we will see our government looking at the need to address additional funds to support regional vocational education and training in schools. It has always been more difficult to access and participate in education and training if you are from regional Australia. But this is not a new understanding. In 1994, the National Board of Employment Education and Training released a report that condemned the Labor government's achievements given the amount of participation access that could be tracked in terms of rural and remote Australian students. The national board found, for example, that in non-metropolitan Australia there were very special needs, that in fact access and participation of regional students in higher education was declining-the only sector in Australia to have declining access to higher education. The study also determined, from the results of a survey of TAPE participation, that students in non-metropolitan Australia were less able to participate in TAPE than students in the state of Victoria at large. The students were less likely to have completed secondary education; they were less likely to have had experience of higher education; they were less likely to have taken middle level courses, and they were more likely to be studying in external mode. We all know that students who are only able to study through external mode suffer lower levels of completion of courses. That information was on the record in 1994. What did Labor do about that? Unfortunately, next to nothing. That is why, of course, we see in this House only two Labor representatives of regional Australia. Regional Australia got very sick and tired of being treated as second-rate citizens. They were sick and tired of seeing their young students denied the access that they should have had-the same rates of access as other students-to higher education and training. That report in 1994 recommended that traineeship places should be expanded and targeted at 15to 25-year-olds in regional areas. That did not happen. It said that training should include basic general education, vocational education and employment. As we saw, under Labor's VET programs the participation rates of schools were minimal. In 1994, we were told traineeship programs should be further developed on an industry basis with programs controlled by employers, unions and workers in the industry rather than specifically just in educational institutions. In other words, it was calling for a participatory, coordinated, cooperative approach. That, of course, did not happen. It is happening now. In 1994, this report said a large number of vocational education centres should be established in regional areas using existing educational facilities and new facilities where needed. That was quite a few years ago-in 1994. Since then, the numbers of regional students participating in higher education have continued to decline. I think that is an indictment of the previous government. They should be feeling very ashamed. Another important part of vocational educational and training in schools is, of course, the opportunity for students to take part in work placements. In 1996, with our initiatives, 38,867 students in Australia were able to do just that, and 6,401 students completed a work placement component of more than 20 days. How did we get to this situation? We have had a massive maldistribution of skills throughout Australia. We have had a cultural cringe about apprenticeship training and technical training compared with a goal of going to university. Tragically, decades ago all that started to happen. Victorians in ticular will remember that one of the premiers of the day, Joan Kirner, abolished the name 'technical schools' from our vocabulary. Technical schools were very substantially encouraged to amalgamate with the high schools to become so-called 'secondary colleges'. The name 'technical schools' largely disappeared throughout the state. The message given to the student was, 'Look, if you really want to get on in life, make sure you're going to something called a college, and make sure that you don't get tainted as someone who's studying in an area which will lead to a skilled trade.' Of course, it is no surprise that we saw a significant decline in the number of young Australians commencing apprenticeships. In 1988-89, 62,678 commenced apprenticeships, including 5,217 who began metal fitting and machining apprenticeships and 1,252 who began horticulture apprenticeships. By 1990-91, the number of people beginning apprenticeships had dropped by about one-third. In 1993-94, the figure had climbed back somewhat, although there were still far fewer than in 1988-89. In 1993-94, there were 3,430 metal trade apprentices-I, 718 fewer than six years earlier. The food manufacturing area in particular, which is the growing area of opportunity in the electorate of Murray, is where we need the work. This government is addressing those needs. This government knows that the economy needs skilled people, with the will to be mobile around the country. We know that the past is haunting us, but we will overcome those difficulties. I commend this bill to the House, because that is what the nation expects and demands of this government.",48
121,Mr MOSSFIELD,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"I rise to support the second reading amendment moved by the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham). The government's legislation amends previous legislative amounts payable to the states through the Australian National Training Authority for cost supplementation and effects of budget changes and legislates an amount for 1999. The Vocational Education and Training Funding Act gives the minister the power to par- make payments up to a maximum legislated amount. However, while I will be referring quite extensively to figures and costs and how this will affect my state of New South Wales in particular, the key issue of the debate is the danger of stopping the reform process begun by the Labor government through short sighted cost cutting and failure to properly invest in educating and skilling Australians. Following on from last year's cuts to vocational education and training, the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 1997 implements a further reduction of $20 million per calendar year, as announced in the budget. These cuts are being called 'benchmarking efficiencies', aimed at encouraging states to benchmark their vocational education activities against the most cost-effective states. The coalition government's cost cutting exercise for vocational education and training will once again lead to uncertainty and stop-start policies in this vital area of educating and skilling the Australian work force. Under the new ANTA agreement, the minister wants an efficiency dividend of 100,000 extra enrolments to be produced each year. At the same time, the government wants the states to meet the cost of training places for unemployed 16to 17-year-olds previouslyon unemployment benefits. This would require the states to fund over 262,000 training places at $6,000 per place, totalling $1,572 million. This cutback and additional responsibilities will create the possibility of derailing the training reform process begun during the term of the Hawke Labor government. This process reflects the Labor government's determination to complement its commitment to restructuring the Australian economy by revitalising education and training policies and programs to develop a highly adaptable and skilled work force. This program is now under even greater threat. Worse still is the fact that these cutbacks are being implemented at a time of high youth unemployment with a dramatic reduction in the number of jobs for young unskilled school leavers. The economy and industry are still undergoing considerable change with new and more demanding requirements of the modem workplace meaning higher than ever levels of vocational training have to be achieved, with the work force being required to be equipped with the knowledge and skills needed in a highly competitive global economy. We now find that, against these increased demands on the various state training systems, the government is reducing funding. What will the government achieve by these cutbacks? We are advised in the Bills Digest provided by the Parliamentary Library that the reductions aim to: provide an incentive to the states and territories achieve efficiency gains in their VET operations by, for example, benchmarking their activities against the most cost effective state. This ignores the reality of vocational training where, quite clearly, each state has to respond to the needs of their own particular industries. New South Wales, with a diverse industrial and manufacturing base, would have different benchmarking requirements to, say, South Australia, where the motor industry is its main manufacturing activity. We have had the Northern Territory election, and I pose the question: if we are looking at the cost-effective states, and Victoria at $8.30 compares with the Northern Territory at $20.30 per unit cost, how much are the people of the Northern Territory going to really suffer? Or was there some special deal offered to last through the election campaign, to become a non-core deal now that the election in the Northern Territory is over? Clearly, we can reasonably expect that the more efficiently a state benchmarked, the more likely it is to receive funding cuts. Again, we are advised by the Parliamentary Library: While details about conditions of the Commonwealth's offer are unavailable, reports on statements by the minister suggests that new places, better targeting, improved standards and greater responsiveness to industry are likely to be the criteria to be considered during funding negotiations. These are all worthwhile objectives, but who will be making the final decisions? I know that the professionals in the field are very concerned that the effects of the implementation of this bill will impact severely on quality teaching and learning conditions in TAPE. For instance, the New South Wales government's budget provides for some 5,000 extra student places in TAFE in 1998' but, with the likelihood of less money, the increased places with less money would impact adversely on student-teacher ratios and maintenance of existing facilities and increased facilities for the extra student places. I am also surprised that those National Party members who represent country areas are not making very loud noises to their government colleagues about the effects that to these measures are likely to have on their country TAPE colleges, which are going to be stretched to the very limit by these proposals. From my own experience as a member of the New South W ales TAPE Council, I know the great role that TAFE colleges play in regional and country areas, not only in the areas of training but also as a great focus for a lot of community activities. No doubt, this cutback will severely impact on their role in this area. The TAPE scheme is a real success story in Australia. It has adapted to commercialism and competitive practices; it is meeting the diverse training needs of industry and enterprise; and it is participating successfully in delivering vocational education and training to the international markets, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. In Western Sydney, three major TAFE colleges-at Blacktown, Mount Druitt and Werrington-are providing training for the international market in the subjects of information technology, engineering, accounting and business studies, and hospitality. In spite of efforts by various governments to increase private provision of vocational training, TAFE, the public provider, has delivered the largest share of training. It has a proud record and has shown an enormous ability to become flexible to meet the needs of various government labour market programs such as traineeships whilst maintaining its very high technical and academic standards. I am advised by the TAFE unions that there has been excellent research done which shows, for example, that 80 per cent of TAFE graduates achieved their main aim in undertaking their course. Some 78 per cent believed that their TAFE course was relevant to their job. Of employers, 75 per cent thought that the skills acquired were relevant to the needs of their organisation. That is a very important figure, because that shows that TAFE is providing a service to industry. I repeat the figures: 75 per cent of employers thought that the skills acquired were relevant to the needs of their organisation; 73 per cent of employers said that the training was cost effective; and two-thirds of employers said that the training resulted in productivity gains for their own organisation. That is another very important figure in showing that employers are recognising the great role that TAFE is playing in increasing productivity in their own organisations. Why would any government therefore try to harass such an organisation by these funding cuts? Is it so ideologically driven that it cannot bear to have a successful government body remain in operation? Is it a belief that everything done by a public servant of any description is to be regarded as bad and that all private enterprise is good? I am very concerned at the general thrust that is being given to really downgrade the T AFE system. The cuts contained in this legislation merely serve to underline that issue. When one lines up the cuts with the passion for a training market in vocational education and training, the concerns become even more intense. I intend to quote from information provided to me, once again, from the New South Wales Teachers Federation. It relates to AEU briefing paper No.3, as follows: Latest statistics show that T AFE was responsible for 92.1 % of the annual student contact hours funded by the public in 1996. Private providers were responsible for 2.2% The zealots driving the market will use the figures above to invigorate their efforts. Firstly, they will be hoping that user choice, commencing in January 1998 and involving some 20% or $500 million of recurrent funding in VET will finally get the market operating. ANT A's plan for user choice is to ignore both public and private providers and concentrate on enterprise-based training with the enterprise as the provider. How can you have a market if private companies are both purchasers and providers. As long as public funds can be used in this way we can expect a turning away from public provision irrespective of how efficient and responsive public provision is. Secondly, we can expect greater emphasis on competitive tendering especially in states such as Queensland and Western Australia. Competitive tendering will make TAFE funding problematic and impact negatively on staffing profiles thus further casualising T AFE teaching. By way of example, a family member had been working full-time at TAFE for four years, yet he was still a casual, with no annual leave, no sick leave and, most important of all, as he had a young family, no permanency. Is this the way to treat highly qualified TAFE teachers? I would suggest not. The briefing paper continues: Contestable funding brings TAFE under the Trade Practices Act. This act was intended to regulate business conducted for profit not organisations such as T AFE with their social and community obligations. Thirdly, the introduction of third party access will give T AFE competitors access to T AFE buildings and infrastructure. Clearly, the teachers have a biased interest in this issue, but it cannot be denied that T AFE staff have provided a magnificent service to Australia as a whole over a great many years. The subtle and not so subtle attacks on this system are a disgrace and give no recognition to the valuable role that TAFE has played in assisting industry to become more competitive and its work force to become more skilled and versatile. Having spoken in general terms concerning the budget cuts to vocational education and training, I would like to tum to the implications of these budget cuts for my own state of New South Wales. I am indebted to the office of the New South Wales Minister for Education for this information. The reductions in VET funding for New South Wales will impact on the state's ability to meet the demand for vocational education and training. The total reduction in national VET funding of $20 million in 1998-99 and $72 million for the period 1997-98 to 20002001 will mean a loss to New South Wales of $6.72 million in 1997-98 and $24.19 million over 1997-98 to 2000-2001 on a population share basis. It is proposed that the cut in ANTA funds be offset by state efficiency gains. This ignores the fact that New South Wales has been achieving significant efficiencies in VET. There are major difficulties with benchmarking efficiencies between states and territories because of the lack of comparability of data. New South Wales has consistently taken up this issue with the Commonwealth and ANTA. New South Wales would favour an alternative method for distributing the $20 million cut, as would most other states and territories. The favoured alternative is to base the cut on a relative population share-of the 15to 65-year-old population-so that all states and territories bear the cuts equitably. The absence of additional growth funds beyond 1997 will significantly reduce the VET system's capacity in New South Wales to respond to growth in VET arising from population changes and industry growth and restructuring. Most importantly, something which the federal government has possibly forgotten, there is the need for additional training relating to the Olympic Games development, which no doubt will create additional employment, but before employment can take place, the work force has to be trained. This is an area that will suffer considerably because of this reduction in funding. The further reduction in labour market program funds, on top of the $1.86 million over four years announced last year, represents a loss to New South Wales of over $10 million in 1997. The cessation of labour market programs in March 1998 will have a severe impact on New South Wales and will increase the number of people seeking VET funded training places, including new apprenticeships. Given that the Commonwealth is not providing additional growth funding, this places great pressure on the New South Wales VET system. Although $24 million has been allocated out of the $415 million for the new national network of one-stop shops and $14 million for group training schemes in 1997-98, there does not appear to be any provision for implementation infrastructure or training delivery to support the anticipated increase in apprenticeship and traineeship numbers. Once again, this is an area of concern. The government are talking about these additional trainees and apprenticeships, but they are not providing funding for the TAFE system to support them and train those new apprentices. The funding to support new apprenticeships appears mainly to provide for an increase in incentives for employers and employment support services, not for TAFE. Lack of funding to VET systems for the implementation of new apprenticeships will create a significant burden on New South Wales resources. Infrastructure costs include the implementation of user choice, monitoring performance, reporting, and establishing and monitoring new recognition structures. The Commonwealth is expecting these costs to be absorbed by the states. The planned further reduction of one per cent in university operating grants in 2000, on top of the cuts already borne by the higher education sector, will deny places to potential university students and direct more of them to seek their education and training within the VET sector, thus placing more load on a sector that has already been cut. In the 1996-97 Commonwealth budget, there was a net reduction of national recurrent funding for vocational education and training of $133.4 million, of which $44.8 million was lost by New South Wales. This situation has now been compounded in the 1997-98 budget by a $20 million reduction in Commonwealth grants. The $20 million cut represents around 0.7 per cent of total VET expenditure and will have a significant impact on TAFE New South Wales, whose share will be approximately $7 million annually or $24 million over four years. The cessation of growth funds for VET will further reduce the number of student places in TAFE. In addition, the introduction of the new apprenticeship and traineeship system in association with user choice will have a significant budgetary impact upon TAPE New South Wales in 1998. This impact will increase in subsequent years as user choice arrangements are extended and further private vocational education and training providers enter the market. It is estimated that user choice arrangements in 1998 could affect 12,000 T AFE student places at a cost of $40 million. In the 1996-97 budget, capital funds to New South Wales, excluding funds for skills centres and Aboriginal educational projects, fell from $76.8 million in the 1996 calendar year to $62.6 million in 1997. The reduction of $14.2 million will continue into future years and therefore represents a permanent decrease in capital funding of some 18 per cent. Based on the average cost of around $1,500 to $2,000 per square metre of building space, this equates to a loss of around 7,000 to 9,500 square metres of space each year. After allowing for building refurbishment, based on previous years experience, the number of new student places that have been lost is around 710 per year or 2,130 new enrolments each year. This represents 6,390 new student places over a three-year period. Having given my own state a fairly good run, which I make no apologies for, I would like to conclude with some remarks from the Victorian Minister for Tertiary Education and Training, Mr Honeywood, who is quite clearly very critical of the present federal government. He is reported in the Age of 13 June as saying: The Victorian Minister for Training yesterday led an attack on the Federal Government's TAFE funding plan, claiming it may lead to the dismantling of the system and the introduction of university-style fees.  ministers, meeting in Darwin, said in a joint resolution that they doubted they could produce 500,000 new places over five years, called for in the plan by better using $300 million of funds.

122,Mr BILSON,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"Dunkley) (1.01 p.m.)Because the future of Dunkley's young people is always uppermost in my mind, I regard the vocational education and training amendment as one of the most important proposals to come before this House in this session. I noted from the commerits of the member for Greenway (Mr Mossfield), who spoke extensively about what sounded like the difficulties he was having with his own state government in New South Wales, that one of the key tenets of the sorts of program the government is pursuing is that it is not a T AFE only sector. There are other options, and certainly the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) is to be commended on encouraging industry groups and the like to explore training delivery alternatives. I know that, in my own electorate, a high school in its current incarnation, Monterey Secondary College-things change as we age-has in fact quite a respectable motor trades workshop. It has the capacity to be more involved in training through that venue; and now, with the changes that the government has implemented, the opportunity to mesh the vocational training with secondary schooling is available and possible. It is something that the schools in my electorate are taking a great deal of interest in. I remarked in my maiden speech to the House 15 months ago that the presence in Dunkley of institutions li,ke Peninsula T AFE, Monash University's Peninsula campus and the broader educational infrastructure made it quite well suited as an academic centre of some prominence. I talked of how strategic alliances between our educational institutions and our primary and sunrise industries had the potential to enable Dunkley by the bay to excel in areas like clean and green food production. What I did not say in my first speech was that a year and a half on it is becoming clearer just how the government's plan is beginning to produce a demand driven training system; a system of education that is moving from being often largely concerned with providing students with a liberal education-and that is not to be criticised-more towards one that provides them with the wherewithal to find employment. We need to bear in mind that 70 per cent of the students in my electorate of Dunkley do not go on to university. They have to consider other career options and the government is putting in place strategies that will aid their search for employment. While we have the taxpayers still funding, on average, three-quarters of every university degree, people who do not choose to go down that path currently are not getting the sorts of attention and assistance that this government believes they deserve. We are all aware also of how the former government ran down apprenticeships to one of the lowest levels since the war. That was a disgraceful measure for them to simply tum their back on. When you look forward to the future you realise that we need a very skilled labour force if we are going to compete. If we are not investing in the vocational skills that are so important to our future, particularly in the fast-growing services area, how are we going to be well positioned to provide the jobs for the young people who are leaving the education system? A quality national training system built into all industries has a critical role in establishing Australian businesses, services and products as leaders in the worldwide market. Quality training is about people: equipping them with skills and matching them with the needs of employers. That is precisely what the minister has been talking about. I understand that the personal attacks directed at him by earlier contributors just illustrate how little grip the Labor Party has on these issues facing the nation and these 70 per cent of young people who quite rightly believe that Labor has turned its back on them. If people in Dunkley need any reminder about which group has the best chance of obtaining ongoing employment, the ABS noted in its October 1995, Educational Attainment and Employment: Victoria, that seven in every 10 unemployed people had no postschool qualifications compared with 52 per cent of people with a job. This is not advocating credentialism--collecting pieces of paper just for the heck of it. It is about accumulating skills and competencies-I see you like that, Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER - that enable young people to present themselves to employers as productive persons in the workplace. It is another area where this government has taken some very important initiatives. The measure that recognises that apprenticeships need to be renewed, upgraded and made more responsive to today's economy is one of the most excellent initiatives that Dr Kemp has introducedand there have been many of them, so it is quite a compliment to point that one out as one of pure excellence. If your training schedule and the program that employer and trainee work through have an emphasis on a greater level of training in the earlier part of their employment, to enable those skills to be accumulated and to enable those qualifications and credentials to be obtained, then that should be encouraged. All we are saying to employers is, 'You pay for the productive time of that young person, for the time that you are getting value out of them so that that person is attractive to your business, and the government will make a contribution to top up the salary that is paid to make sure that it meets national training wages.' That is a very important measure-to recognise that this concept of training is not solely about the trainee. We need providers of training, which we are talking about here today, but we need employers willing to participate in that structure as well. It is a recognition that the government has made and that it is actually doing something about it. Again, it is another reason to compliment Dr Kemp on his very visionary and forthright approach to this portfolio. It just disappoints me greatly that those opposite can only resort to denigrating him personally rather than addressing the issues before this House. Under this bill, 1997 Commonwealth funding for vocational education and training will rise to $909.263 million-a bit under a $1 billion-with an extra 43,000 student places expected to be created this year from Commonwealth moneys, apart from an extra 12,000 places created by funding from other sources such as the states. The 13 May budget provided for an overall increase in vocational education and training funding of $144 million or 12 per cent. While funding through the Australian National Training Authority to the states will decline by $20 million in 1998, this should be measured against the very substantial efficiency gains that all ministers have agreed will be likely as the Commonwealth's plans are put into practice. We need only concern ourselves with the average cost per training place throughout various states to understand that there are opportunities to generate some efficiencies. It would be negligent of this government not to work with the state governments in securing those efficiencies. The speaker before me, the member for Greenway, mentioned the contribution of the Victorian minister, Mr Honeywood. That is understandable. Those who have been involved with politics for some time understand the role posturing has to play by state governments that are looking for the Commonwealth to make a greater contribution to the cost of its activities. Ms Macklin-Is that all he's doingposturing? He's not serious?",56
123,Mr BILSON,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"The member for Jagajaga is picking up from her carping over the nursing homes and entering a new foray. I encourage her for her diversity of criticism. She is at least moving on to a new area and she is to be commended for that. From estimates made by the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, there are about 160,000 Australians who currently have an apprenticeship or a traineeship. Dr Kemp recently launched, in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne which stretch from Kew and Whittlesea to Portsea and south of Pakenham, a new apprenticeship training one-stop shop in the electorate of my friend and colleague the member for Deakin (Mr Barresi). That is important because that region alone accounted for just under 4,000 apprenticeship and around 2,000 traineeship commencements in 1995-96, with a further 12,850 apprentices in training. This is important business. This is why we need someone as competent as Dr Kemp to handle the portfolio. In 1996, of Peninsula TAFE's 9,600 students, almost 4,900 came from the five major suburbs in the Dunkley electorate-that is, Frankston, Seaford, Langwarrin, Mount Eliza and Mornington, all of which I am very proud to represent. The age profile of students from this TAFE is also of interest, with just under half aged between 15 and 24. This indicates the important role that peninsula TAFE plays in equipping our young people with vocational and, dare I say, life skills, which are so much a part of the training offered there. Almost one-quarter of the TAFE's enrolments in 1996 were in engineering and in personal services, showing the degree to which the local industry and tertiary industries, such as tourism and hospitality, are dependent on these sorts of training facilities. We might dwell on that issue for one moment. In the hospitality industry, as in many other service industries, there are no traditional apprenticeships. If we had left the responsibility for managing this important area of our future in the hands of the Labor Party, they would probably still not be recognised in that formal training structure. Dr Kemp has introduced a regime where industry is encouraged to work with trained providers to get accredited training programs in place and to provide new apprenticeships in industries where the new job opportunities are for the people of this country. He is to be commended for that. It would be remiss of me not to acknowledge one of my dear friends, who is a qualified sheet metal worker, and the continuing importance of those more traditional trades to our economy. This is particularly so when we hear from areas in Western Australia, for example, where highly skilled boilermakers and the like cannot be found to support the industrial growth in that part of the country. Again, that highlights the decline in apprenticeships and vocational training that occurred under the former government. This bill is a continuation of the government's plans first announced in the 1996-97 ministerial statement by the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training entitled 'Training for real jobs'. Rather than continuing Labor's largely program driven assistance, where you set up some programs and try to squeeze people into those programs, notwithstanding that they might not be responsive to employment requirements or to job opportunities, the focus of the coalition government is on issues such as expanding these opportunities for young people in new industries and in new occupations. A former minister who served during Labor's 13 years suggested that Labor did not do enough about accommodating the needs of those not intending to proceed directly to university. May I remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that in my electorate 70 per cent of young people choose not to go on to university. This is why these sorts of reforms that the government is pursuing are so important. I am delighted that, through this amendment, many other elements of the government's plan for young Australians will also be addressed, remedying the regrettable Labor legacy in this area. I would like to compliment the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training for taking the time on Friday, 15 August to visit my electorate. Not only did the minister meet a wide cross-section of Dunkley school council presidents, principals and careers teachers at the Peninsula Institute of TAPE but we then went to the Langwarrin Secondary College, where we were hosted by the principal and talked with careers teachers about the sorts of challenges they are facing at the coal face. It was comforting for me to hear from those people dealing with the difficult job of aiding young people in their transition from education to employment about how responsive and how welcome these reforms are. They just cannot get enough of them. We have PVET, the Peninsula Vocational Education and Training organisation, which consists of a cluster of schools on the Mornington Peninsula. These schools are very driven and very with it in terms of the requirements of their students, and they are very understanding of the important role that the education system has in aiding that transition from schooling to work. Could I also thank Mr Don MCKenzie, the Director of Peninsula TAPE, and Doug Moore and Stephen Robin for their organisational skills and hospitality. Similarly, at the Langwarrin Secondary College, the minister found his more than one hour of discussions with the careers teachers very productive, due in no small measure to the good work of Mr Bob Loader, principal of the secondary college and chair of PVET, along with Sylvanie Morgan, assistant principal at the secondary college, and Lorraine Rawlings from the school council, who also showed the interest that the school community in the Dunkley electorate has for these reforms. The minister said that one of the key messages he was taking around Australia was that we need to be informing young people that they can go anywhere through a new apprenticeship. The career and lifestyle choices that are available to them are enhanced by the approach to vocational training and education that is being pursued by Dr Kemp. I found the minister's remark especially appropriate for the Dunkley community, because we have a lower percentage-around 30 per cent-of young people taking up the university option than the national average, which is around 37 per cent. As the minister said in the House earlier, the coalition government's new apprenticeships will help young people to achieve a rewarding career. That is what this is all about-getting young people into the jobs that they find satisfying and rewarding. Employers will see their businesses become more productive and competitive if they take on an apprentice, particularly in the new apprenticeship framework, where they are paying only for the productive time of that apprentice while also gaining the benefits of their productive time, for which the business is paying. It is attractive for business to pay for productive time and to have the government step into support these new traineeships with a top-up of income so that the trainee can enjoy the national training wage. The government has made a long-term commitment to training the young people of Australia so that our companies and small businesses, and micro businesses in particular, can continue to be great contributors to our country. As Dr Kemp observed, it is critical that children are able to read properly by the fourth year of primary school. The agreement he has secured with every state and territory to test children in years 1 and 3 for literacy and numeracy skills is most important. The minister alluded to the great pressures that schools face to add all manner of items to their curricula, but literacy and numeracy remain the main game as far as I am concerned, and as far as the government, parents and students are concerned. With those core competencies, you can tap into the other training and life opportunities that are available. Without those core skills, participation in the workplace and in the community, being able to read training manuals, being able to understand safety instructions in the workplace and being able to comprehend orders that come through from customers are made very difficult. This is why we need to invest in these core competencies of literacy and numeracy. It is a commendable effort that complements what the bill before the House today is seeking to achieve. Linkages are a key part of the coalition government's plan for vocational education and training. It is appropriate that the Peninsula Institute of TAFE, whose aim is to achieve excellence in education, continually stresses the development of strong links with industry. For instance, its relatively new $7 million automotive and metal fabrication facility at Fletcher Street on the Frankston campus is a key contributor to the service industry in Frankston, Seaford and Mornington, all areas that I continually remind people generally do not have large Boeing-size employers. We rely on some 8,000 Dunkley small and micro businesses to generate present and future job opportunities. The school based apprenticeships and traineeships that the minister for schools recently launched are part of what I would like to call the quiet revolution in secondary education. These will serve to bring the schools more closely into contact with their local business communities. I return to the comments made by the member for Greenway, who seems to think that the only way you can get vocational training is through the TAFE system. It is not the only way. It has a great head start-it has years of tradition and skill in that area-but the government is saying that it need not be the sole provider of that training. Other forms of delivery of those training opportunities are something that are to be encouraged. A number of schools in my electorate have put their hands up and said, 'Maybe that's something we would like to be involved with.' The Commonwealth is committed to providing schools with more resources to undertake this new role, and it is encouraging schools to form clusters so that they can tender for these opportunities where they are appropriate for their local conditions. As the minister said to his Dunkley audiences, the initial trials of this exciting concept appear to have been successful at two Brisbane high schools. For the sake of our children in Dunkley and throughout the country, we have to institute these sorts of changes, because we cannot focus solely on the minority of students who go on to university. All young people in this country deserve to be invested in. All young people in this country deserve to have the encouragement of their government working with them, and their schools, their parents and their local employment communities, to see that they have opportunities ahead of them and to make getting up in the morning and striving for a better life something that is really worth pursuing. The government has backed these plans with a budget allocation of $187 million over the next four years, while still paying back $5 billion of the debt that Labor racked up on the Commonwealth bankcard. Unlike Labor, we do not believe in adding to the nation's debt by recklessly throwing hundreds of millions of dollars at programs that basically try to squeeze people into them rather than having the programs respond to the needs of the community. Parents are concerned about many issues, including the standards of literacy and numeracy, and the government is responding to that. Provided the information is publicly aired in a realistic manner, I think the testing that is being considered will be a helpful tool in enabling parents to make choices about the education for their children and to encourage the schools themselves to excel. I see a net benefit right across the education sector with the reforms that Dr Kemp is seeking to introduce. Training must be demand driven as far as possible. With employers being able to select the training that meets their business needs from 1 January 1998 under the user choice system, $500 million annually will be available from Commonwealth and state sources to divide among public and private education providers. Change of this type always brings questions. Established institutions like Peninsula T AFE are already looking ahead, and I commend its director and the whole board for their forward looking approach. I was pleased to be at the launch of their 'Strategic Directions 1996-2000' document, which identified their key missions as providing quality services and responsiveness to their customers. I have been very pleased to support their efforts in attracting international students to this area. I understand we have the daughter of an Indonesian minister currently studying a business course in the electorate of Dunkley. T AFEs may have to change their names or have other changes to deal with as a result of the current Ramler review commissioned by Minister Kemp's Victorian counterpart, the Hon. Phil Honeywood MLA. I have been assured that these sorts of changes are geared at providing a more responsive, more able and more capable T AFE sector in this state. This is an area of great passion for me. I could keep talking for a long time about the many other reforms the government has introduced to complement this new national training framework, but I will conclude by commending the bill to the House and I look forward to a very positive and constructive contribution from the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) as we go through this debate.",58
124,Ms MACKLIN,TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT,"The amendments in the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 1997 we are considering here today, which the member for Dunkley (Mr Billson) might consider, actually take money out of the TAFE system, which of course he failed to mention. They provide yet another example of the government's lack of commitment to vocational education and training in this country. They also demonstrate the government's incompetence in dealing with complex issues and provide a further illustration of this government's deteriorating relations with state governments. The member for Dunkley might remember that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has certainly had quite a bit to say about this in the recent past. He at least is aware of it, if you are not. The effect of the amendments is to cut $20 million each year from the Commonwealth funding to the Australian National Training Authority for allocation to state and territory training agencies for vocational education and training. Despite all the rhetoric about its commitment to vocational education and training, the government has yet again failed to live up to its promises-not that this is evident from government pronouncements on the cuts: In language we have come to expect from the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp), the cuts are described as providing: an incentive to the States to achieve efficiency gains in their VET operations by, for example, benchmarking their activities against the most cost effective States. That is longwinded code for cuts. The government assumes, as it does in many other areas of social policy, that current programs and administrations are inefficient. That is the basis for its understanding of the needs of vocational education. It has produced no evidence to support this view. It appears to rely on the fact that some states, when measured in terms of recurrent costs per curriculum hour, have unit costs which are much lower than others, ranging from $8.30 in Victoria to $20.30 in the Northern Territory, according to the Bills Digest which we all have available to us. As the Bills Digest itself acknowledges, this is a very crude measure. It takes no account of factors such as population density, the proportion of students who are from various disadvantaged backgrounds and so on. Nor does it take any account of the measure of quality of services provided. The whole issue of benchmarking is fraught with difficulty. Anybody with experience in this area recognises this and is accordingly cautious in its use and inclined to use it in conjunction with a range of other measures. Not so this government. It has been unable to produce any other guidelines to assist the Australian National Training Authority in distributing funds. These are still to be negotiated with the states. ANTA will be forced to rely solely on state and territory records in meeting efficiency benchmarks. These records show that on average over the last five years most states have achieved a baseline efficiency gain of one per cent a year. This would fund only 10 per cent of the government's proposed new places. Even a continuation of the one per cent efficiency gain is in doubt, given the other constraints on the TAFE sector, such as the efficiency dividend required annually by state and territory treasuries and the current round of enterprise bargaining, which will require efficiency targets of between three per cent and 14 per cent. The government is in danger of exacerbating the difficulties facing the T AFE sector if it proceeds with plans to increase TAFE places over the next five years while at the same time enforcing these funding cuts. The minister suggested an additional 100,000 places a year over each of the next five years to be funded by 'better targeting of existing funding', that is, of course, current funding less $20 million a year. This is a nonsense. It again assumes that major inefficiencies exist in the training and further education sector which, if overcome, would provide a sufficiently large pool to fund these 100,000 places a year-a figure which the minister estimates would cost $300 million each year. How the minister has arrived at this figure, we have no idea. Certainly not through discussions with those with the clearest understanding of the sector, that is, those who work in the TAFEs-the teachers and administrators. Who would actually fill these 100,000 places? The Australian Bureau of Statistics calculated in 1996 that 62,000 people were unable to gain a T AFE place. Of these, 7,000 cancelled their applications, 11,000 were not eligible for the courses for which they applied, 6,000 applied too late and 21,000 gave 'other reasons' for their failure to gain a place. Almost 30,000 were unable to gain a place because places were full-too many, I agree. It is true that some added demand will result from the government's plans to force more young people to remain at school or to go on looking for vocational education. The other plank of the government's efforts, as far as 16 and 17 year olds are concerned, is to deprive them of any income if they choose to leave school without having a job. The government itself estimates that this is around 27,000 students a year. Nor are the government's new traineeships and apprenticeship arrangements likely to result in demands on the TAFE sector of the magnitude suggested by the government's target for new places, given the states' reluctance to support them. Yet again the government is providing simplistic solutions to very complex problems. Very sadly, it will be our young people who will have to bear the brunt of government indifference and incompetence. Given the government's grand plan for the expansion of traineeships and apprenticeships, certainly as put by the minister, one would have expected more detail about how it intends to fund them. The states fear, with some justification, that they will be expected to do so. Their view is summed up by the Victorian Minister for Tertiary Education and Training, Mr Honeywood, in the Melbourne Age, when he said: ... the coalition's announcement ... of 220,000 new apprenticeships and traineeships was so poorly designed, it might force the Government into setting up a Higher Education Contribution Scheme for T AFE colleges. When he was talking about the apprenticeship scheme, he also said: . .. it was unlikely to have a significant impact in Victoria because there were no funds to create T AFE places. He then went on: Apprentices are required to attend a T AFE college or post-secondary training institution-which are two-thirds funded by the states-to complete their apprenticeships. Further: ... the Victorian government would have to find up to $54 million a yearthis is just in Victoriato fund new T AFE places created by the scheme and the new youth allowance which would force many young people back into post-secondary schooling. Finally he said: I won't (find the money). The Premier and our government have a policy of not filling a financial hole that's been left by the Commonwealth. Mr Honeywood's fears appear to be well founded. Departmental advice to the minister suggests that schools will be required to cater for an additional 27,000 students per year when changes to the youth allowance take effect. It suggests an additional allocation of $140 million per year would be required as a result, but the Commonwealth has made no move to increase its contribution to schools funding. Instead, of course, that too is being cut. In the electorate of Jagajaga, the Northern Melbourne Institute of T AFE is expected, as with all other TAFEs, to provide excellent training and education while this brawl goes on. The minister needs to wake up to the fact that fights of this kind between the Commonwealth and Victoria do nothing for TAFE and do nothing for the students. They only make providing education harder. Some state and territory ministers have gone so far as to suggest that the government's real aim in requiring the states to expand TAFE places while reducing their funding is to dismantle the T AFE system, thus leaving the way open for private providers to take over an increasing proportion of its work. This is a further example of the government's neglect of our public institutions and its attempts to channel public money into the private provision of services, which are motivated by ideology rather than any evidence that the private sector can provide an equivalent quality of service at a lower cost. I am very conscious of the depths to which the relationship between the Commonwealth and the states has now sunk. Two other agreements-the Commonwealth-state housing agreement and the Commonwealth-state disability agreement-are in tatters because of the Commonwealth's unrealistic expectations of the states. They are being asked-although from the states' point of view I am sure they think they are being told-to do more with less Commonwealth support. They have been pushed to the limit and, just as in the TAFE sector, they have refused to sign new agreements. In the case of the Commonwealth-state housing agreement, governments are operating on the basis of an interim agreement which is now into its third extension. The situation is even worse in the disability area. The Commonwealth-state disability agreement has been operating on the basis of an interim agreement renewed each month since the minister unilaterally and without any notice, let alon'e consultation with the states, withdrew support from a one-year interim agreement to which she had previously agreed. The resulting hiatus is, of course, creating considerable anxiety and confusion to providers and participants of affected services alike and is preventing any long-term planning or policy development. On the issue of vocational education and training, we see a similar breakdown. When informed of the minister's plan for 100,000 new T AFE places per year to be funded from 'more effective use of existing funds', the states' reactions were predictable, though seemingly not to the minister. I have already mentioned Victoria's response but, more significantly, in a recently issued joint response, state and territory ministers said: Ministers are concerned that the Commonwealth is not providing funding to support new apprenticeships and the Common Youth Allowance initiatives, and that young people are having their expectations raised unrealistically. This concern, coming on top of the continued uncertainty surrounding the negotiation of a new five year, industry led ANTA agreement arises because of the Commonwealth's demand that states and territories agree to the arbitrary creation of an additional 500,000 student places. These are all state and territory ministers. The response continues: . . . the Commonwealth is requiring that these new places be funded by states and territories without additional Commonwealth funds and in the context of earlier funding cuts. This response was issued by eight state and territory ministers. Seven of them are supposed to be allies of the Commonwealth government-politically at least. Shouldn't their reaction give the Commonwealth some pause? Shouldn't the Commonwealth take some time to reflect on the problems that are being created for T AFE and for the students? It should be the case that we see some reflection of the impact of the measures that are being considered in this legislation and the impact of other related issues being dealt with by this minister and by the government. It should not be the case that the states have to carry the increase in numbers of T AFE places, and it should not be the case that states and the T AFEs have to carry the cuts that this government has introduced. It is time that the government stopped playing politics with this essential area of education and training and provided the funding that is necessary so that T AFEs all around the country can keep up with the services they provide. I commend the second reading amendment moved by my colleague the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) to the House.  many, often look to the classics for words of wisdom and inspiration. Quotations and thoughts of the likes of Thomas Jefferson, Martin Luther King and Anne Bronte are as brilliant as they are timeless. There is one adage, however, which has not survived the test of time: the conventional wisdom that the only fundamentals to a good education are the three Rs. It is both unfashionable and obsolete in the context of a beneficial, contemporary education. Arithmetic, reading and writing are only the beginnings of a relevant, modem education. The development of practical skills and abilities, a pertinent knowledge of information technologies and an aptitude for further learning and professional development are supplementary qualities which today's employers require. The accelerated evolution of the Australian marketplace, small business and industry over the last decade has changed forever our approach to vocational education and training. To illustrate this point, in decades past there were many vocations where you could literally walk off the street and into employment without any experience or training. Such is not the case today. Every job requires a particular range of skills and abilities. Indeed, in the past it has been the lament of many young talented Australians that they cannot find work because they have no experience or relevant training in the industry in which they wish to make a contribution. Consequently, this government has set about redefining the fundamental three Rs of education-whether it be school, tertiary, vocational or training-to relevance, responsiveness and realism. A particular priority for reform for this government is vocational education and training. It is significant to note that 70 per cent of school leavers do not go to university or to T AFE on a full-time basis. Yet, despite their number, it is a group which was marginalised by the former Labor government. In my previous term as the member for Sturt, young people and parents alike would often ask what was being done to help that majority of schoolleavers who did not go to university or T AFE. There was a sense of not being recognised by the then Labor government, whose impotent attempts to reform this area of education served only to further frustrate many young people and their parents. These frustrations were not isolated to an unlucky few. During the recession that middleand lower-class Australia had to have, national youth unemployment reached 34.9 per cent in July 1992, compared with total national unemployment of 11.1 per cent. The former Labor government's ineptitude in this particular area punished not just young people but also Australian small businesses and industries-and the member for Banks (Mr Melham) was a member of that government. A philistine approach to industrial relations policy, coupled with inadequate training programs, stifled apprenticeships and training opportunities in a great variety of small businesses and industry. To a certain extent, the effects of this era are still felt today. The community challenged this government to rejuvenate vocational education and training practices, and this government has responded accordingly. The Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 1997 which is presently before the House is an integral component of this response. Before highlighting the particulars of this bill, it is important to stress to the House that this is not the only plank in our vocational education and training platform. Some other government initiatives to complement this bill include an allocation of $45 million towards achieving improved literacy and numeracy rates, of which I have spoken earlier in our term of government. This commitment represents a 50 per cent increase on the former Labor government's expenditure in this area. There is also a $23 million investment in professional development for teachers, including up-to-date training in industry experience, and a $74.1 million initiative aimed at developing Asian language skills among our school students, which will likewise complement this government's cohesive vocational education and training strategy. This bill provides for an increase in funding of $17.938 million to the 1997 amount previously appropriated under the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act 1992. This will take this government's commitment to vocational education and training to almost $1 billion in 1997-$909 million, to be precise-a 12 per cent increase on the former Labor government's 1995-96 vocational education and training expenditure. It is anticipated that this increase in funding will contribute to an estimated national total increase of 55,000 training places for our youth in this year alone. This bill also makes provision for an adjustment of funding amounts and arrangements for 1998-99. This adjustment is in accordance with the resolution of state and territory ministers at the Australian N afional Training Authority ministerial council meeting in May this year. However, the most significant aspect of this bill is the establishment of the new apprenticeships program. New apprenticeships have been developed by this government to provide trainees with a nationally recognised qualification which embraces the concepts of simplicity, relevance, flexibility and responsiveness to the needs of employers and trainees. Accordingly, this government also expects new apprenticeships to play a major role in ensuring that Australian small business and industry can confidently meet the challenges and demands of the global economy into the next century and beyond. The key words in defining new apprenticeships are 'relevant training'. The former Labor government, as is their wont, tentatively approached vocational education and training by aimlessly throwing money around in the desperate hope that there might be some method in their madness and that some of their expenditure may end up representing good value for the taxpayer. To make matters worse, they could not even afford to pay for their irresponsibility, so they did what all good, irresponsible governments do: they booked it up on the national credit card. Unfortunately for Australia's youth, small business and industry and, indeed, the economy in general, the former Labor government's vocational education and training strategy was obsolete in the technological and performance oriented business culture of today. New apprenticeships will address these deficiencies. The parameters under which new apprenticeships will operate can be broadly summarised as a national system which is responsive to and accessible by small and medium enterprises; ensures that training leads to quality and nationally agreed qualifications; gives business a key role in leadership and provides training which is relevant to business; has streamlined regulation delivery mechanisms to ensure responsiveness to clients; and is more efficient through the use of flexible, workable and competitive delivery arrangements. Thus, the coalition government has given small business, the engine room of the Australian economy, the confidence and assurance for the utilisation of this initiative. A reduced budget deficit, a revitalised economy and the abolitlon of the anti-economic growth provisions of the Industrial Relations Act have meant that small businesses and industries are no longer intimidated by the irrelevant policy shackled to them by red tape. Nationally accredited and accepted qualifications in vocational education and training is also a long overdue initiative which will lend itself to recognising geographic diversities. This bill is responsive to both regional and urban needs. The government achieved this by recommencing the dialogue suspended during the Labor government between government and urban and rural small business and industry interests. In its pursuit of excellence in all forms of education, this government has encouraged small businesses and industry to assist in the development of training programs. This will ensure that the vocational education and training provided is relevant to the demands of the particular industries involved, which, in tum, will give our school Ie avers an appropriate preparation for employment. This government, as promised in the election, will continue to accompany and assist the youth of this nation, particularly in the formative stages of new apprenticeships. A training which is both nationally accepted and relevant will give trainees the flexibility and pursue their own employment ambitions. By simplifying and streamlining vocational education and training whilst avoiding the disproportionately large administrative expenses of Working Nation, the government has also made significant savings for the taxpayer. The new apprenticeships program is good for youth, employees and, inevitably, the economy. As a form of illustration of this assertion, the national training manager of Woolworths expects to treble their trainee numbers from a present total of 350 to a minimum of 1,000. In addition to the involvement of companies such as Woolworths, other small businesses and industries are likely to appoint trainees in trades such as manufacturing, maintenance, engineering and construction, graphic design, forestry, child care, youth support work, sport and recreation, and rural industries. New and expanding industries such as technology and communications, tourism and hospitality, the domestic music industry and information technologies will also benefit from youth participation. It is this far-sighted, equitable and fiscally responsible attitude of the government which will define new apprenticeships as a groundbreaking program. Indeed, the coalition government is providing hope for Australian schoolleavers regardless of their career paths. Encouragingly, enrolments for undergraduate students in tertiary education are up by 14,350 or four per cent. Contrary to what Senator Stott Despoja and Senator Carr would have us believe, an injection of funds for better targeted programs for vocational education and training and a strengthening economy is evidence of this. I believe that this bill and the accompanying new apprenticeships project will lend itself to an improvement in the employment participation rates of our youth, the cornerstone of this nation's future economic development. New apprenticeships is also an initiative that the opposition-many of whom are themselves serving apprenticeships in political competence and common sense, some for as long as three terms now-should be able to appreciate and relate to. I commend adaptability to the bill to the House. Amendment negati ved. Original question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Third Reading Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Motion (by Mr Miles) proposed: That the bill be now read a third time.  Deputy Speaker, I apologise to you and the House for being a little late and I very much appreciate the courtesies extended to me by both front benches. Vocational education and training is a very important issue in my electorate. As other opposition members who have made contributions during the debate on the second reading have said, we really do get some very confusing if not misleading statements from the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp). The minister has often said that in the 13 years under Labor we really neglected vocational education and years 11 and 12 at school were really only for those who were academically inclined or those who sought to go on to university. I find those sorts of statements-that is, that we neglected vocational education-objectionable. As with many other issues, I am ready to accept that we could have done more. The reality in terms of years 11 and 12 retention rates is that at the end of the term of the last coalition government you had about 33 per cent of students staying on to years 11 and 12. They most definitely were, in the main, university bound. We placed a great emphasis on trying to push the message that it is important for a nation, as it is for the individual, to invest in people's talents and potential and encourage them to stay on to years 11 and 12. We have seen a huge increase in the rates of young people staying on for years 11 and 12-and certainly that applies in my electorate. They now have quite a number of choices of subjects of a vocational nature. I remember very well the Carmichael report and actually getting Laurie Carmichael to talk to interested people in my electorate about the changes that were proposed for skill formation, whether that was for people in the workplace or for people about to start in the workplace-that is, people at school. I have to say that currently there is a very hot issue in my electorate and that is the results of the investigation into the HSC at Mount Druitt High School. We have had, for some months now, the MCLaughlin report which I have tried to disseminate as far and wide as possible. As with a number of other issues, I have gone out on the front foot and said that 10 years ago we were right in advocating a senior high school for Mount Druitt. Regrettably, the then Labor government did not proceed with that, but the Liberal government formed the first ever public senior high school at St Marys. It is not based on the model we proposed, but, to give credit where credit is due, the first public senior high school in New South Wales at St Marys, which is now in my electorate, is an outstanding success. At that senior high school there are 800 applications for 400 positions in year 11. This is a public school that is reversing the drift from public to private. It not only offers exceptionally rigorous courses that lead on to university but also offers rigorous vocational courses. I am very keen to ensure that this senior high school at Mount Druitt not only has vocational courses which are board approved but also, more importantly, lives up to the principles that Laurie Carmichael was espousing. We must ensure that TAFE units are placed in that senior high school so that we give reality to the proposition that people can complete high school and be part way to their TAFE qualifications. For example, if someone wanted to do an apprenticeship, by staying on and doing years 11 and 12 at Mount Druitt Senior High School not only would they finish with a department of education qualification but also they would be well into their apprenticeship, including practical experience. I am going to continue to fight for that. I have to say that the abolition of the youth allowance has had a dramatic effect on my electorate. Again, I think the minister is a little confusing if not misleading in his statements. I can remember when we were doing a review of Austudy in this place quite rightly coalition members said-and I note that the former deputy chairman, now chairman, of that committee, the honourable member for LaTrobe (Mr Charles) is in the House-said, 'We have to make sure that people just do not go to school to collect their Austudy and that there are benchmarks of progress.' The committee agreed with him and we recommended that way. By abolishing the youth allowance, what you are doing right across Australia, and I am talking about my electorate, is forcing people back to school not because they see school as giving them extra skills, giving them a better start in the job market, but merely because they have been deprived of a benefit. Schools have sufficient challenges just dealing with young people and all their aspirations in years 11 and 12. If you get a group of unmotivated students, as the coalition was saying when debating the Austudy provisions, who are merely at school to fill in time, then the potential for disrupting serious students becomes even greater. In my electorate there are something like 537 students who may be going back to school because they have been cut out from receiving the youth allowance. As the shadow minister has said, there has been no extra money provided for schools to cater for this huge influx and no extra resources provided to maybe have a second chance at interesting them in worthwhile subjects and seeing their potential and talents developed. It is going to be an extra burden for high schools that the MCLaughlin report has suggested already are very fragile and near collapse. I think that is a very unfortunate approach to this problem. In western Sydney we are well provided for by a network of T AFEs. I have been pleased to see the Mount Druitt TAFE go through seven stages of expansion-not all in the time. I have been a member. I was thrilled to be there, because we promised to provide a T AFE, when the sod was first turned. Now I am thrilled to see a vibrant institution with effectively some 8,000 full-time places for young people in my electorate. I think it is regrettable that when the minister suggests that there is going to be wholesale expansion of the TAFE sector-for example, Mount Druitt TAFE is going to be able to take even more students-what he is really talking about is that there have already been federal government cutbacks to the T AFE sector and they are expected to be able to achieve extra places through efficiency gains. This is at a time when in New South Wales through a similar methodology 5,000 extra places were already provided. I can say that in New South Wales and at Mount Druitt T AFE there is not the opportunity to dramatically increase the intake of students by these so-called efficiency gains. Even if there were, two-thirds of the funding to expand T AFE places comes from the state government. When the minister says that we are going to have an expansion of half a million places in TAFE, what he is really doing is trying to predict how the states are going to be able to spend their money at a time when, in terms of direct line items and untied grants, they are cutting the budget. Vocational education for young Australians, indeed all Australians, is too important to trivialise and it is too important for the minister to make misleading statements about-misleading statements about T AFE' s capacity to expand the system without any extra federal funding. I think the opposition would welcome an expansion of the TAFE sector, but what we really want to see in that expansion is the government putting its money where its mouth is. The high schools in my electorate are being expected to take on an extra SSO-odd students without any additional funding.",61

127,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. Is it not a fact that the 2,000 workers of Newcastle who will shortly lose their jobs-people who have paid taxes all their working lives, people with families to support-will get no assistance until they get down to the last $5,000 of their redundancy payments under your government's harsh, new social security policies which will come into effect later this month? Is it not a fact that the government will force these Newcastle workers to use up their hard-earned annual and long-service leave, which are to be cashed out in their redundancy packages, before they get any help from the nation? Is it not federal government action like this which has so dramatically increased people's sense of insecurity?",69
128,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think the dominant cause of insecurity felt in Australia at the present time is due to an accumulation of factors, not least of which is the fact that we have had in the Australian community for quite a period of time now-and it stretches back through the 13 years that you were in power-a chronic problem in relation to unemployment. The idea that all the maladies of Australia arrived on 2 March 1996 is one of the great fictions of the Australian Labor Party. You had 13 years to fix insecurity. You had 13 years to do something about unemployment.",69
129,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On a point of order, Mr Speaker: my question was completely specific. It referred to a set of social security measures which will come into effect on 20 September. There was no rounding out of it and the Prime Minister is irrelevant in his answer.",69
130,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. The Prime Minister has a wide canvas on which to paint and is doing just that.,69
131,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, the whole question was posited on a proposition about insecurity. I am pointing out to the Leader of the Opposition and to the parliament that the opposition had 13 years to remove that sense of insecurity. It is very interesting, when you are talking about job insecurity",69
132,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On a point of order, Mr Speaker, going to relevancy: the Prime Minister frequently receives from us broad general questions. This was not one of them. This question was specific to these propositions: the fact that a worker has to work his redundancy package down to $5,000 before he gets UB, even if he has paid taxes for 30 years. That is what is causing insecurity and that was the question.",69
133,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! We are not going to debate the issue. There is no point of order.,69
134,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You caused an enormous amount of insecurity when you were the 'minister for unemployment'. Job insecurity does remain and, as I think people on both sides of the House will acknowledge, represents one of the factors that does cause general insecurity within our community. Only a fool or a knave would pretend otherwise. Equally, only a fool or a knave would believe the line being peddled by Kim Beazley that in some way this problem arrived when we were elected to government in March of last year.",69
135,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I take another point of order, Mr Speaker, on relevance. When are we going to get an answer to the proposition of whether or not an unemployed Newcastle worker faces that position-where his redundancy package gets worked down to $5,000 before he gets UB?",69
136,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. The Prime Minister is addressing the thrust of the question.,69
137,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Nothing can erase from the public record of this country the fact that when you were 'minister for unemployment' , unemployment in this country went to over 11 per cent. It was you who had charge of the affairs of this nation for 13 years. It was your industry policy that has led to people losing their jobs in the Australian steel industry.",69

144,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the House on a further point of order. Mr Reith-My point of order is: you ruled the first point of order out of order and the subsequent points of order were simply a repeat of the first. On that basis, the further points of order were quite clearly frivolous. There are standing orders which debar frivolous points of order. Mr Speaker, I remind you of the remarks of a former Prime Minister who said to the honourable member for Cunningham back in 1995: Cameron, Aston and Snedden, whenever a point of order was a debating point frivolously taken, the member was named immediately. In the end, all these relevant standing orders, like 145, are frivoment lous, disruptive points of order. And my suggestion to you, Mr Speaker, is that you name the members immediately. That was the advice of the previous Prime Minister. We remind and put to you, Mr Speaker, that this is nothing other than a debating point of order and they should all be ruled out of order.",70
145,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Thus far I have ruled all of the Leader of the Opposition's points of order out of order. I do not seize on the opportunity that they are frivolous but well intentioned. But they are outside the level that I am prepared to accept. The Prime Minister's response thus far is in order and I invite the Prime Minister to conclude his answer.,70
146,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I remind the parliament that the self-professed concern and crocodile tears of the Leader of the Opposition about the steel workers of Newcastle, indeed the steel workers of Australia, were manifestly lacking when he had authority in the former government and under his administration thousands of Australian steel workers lost their jobs; and you shed not a tear about them. Native Title",70
147,Mr LIEBERMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Prime Minister-the good listener. Will the Prime Minister inform the House what steps the government is taking in response to the Wik decision in the High Court?,70
148,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am pleased to inform the House that a little later this day the Attorney-General will introduce into the parliament amendments to the Native Title Act. These amendments will at long last address the shambles left by the former government. These amendments will give security and predictability to the farmers of Australia. These amendments will give security and predictability to the mining industry. These amendments will preserve the basic fabric of the rights conferred by the High Court of Australia on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community in the historic Mabo decision. I remind the parliathat the coalition parties never supported the Native Title Act in its original form. If the advice of the coalition parties had been taken back in 1993Mr Crean- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I draw your attention to the standing orders in relation to anticipation of debate. This issue is on the Notice Paper. It is to be introduced by way of legislation immediately the MPI is finished today. My understanding of practice in this place is that questions can go to the issue of timing but not to debating the issue which the legislation will canvass. I would ask you to rule accordingly.",70
149,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The point of order is out of order. I am listening very carefully. I am aware that it is on the Notice Paper. The substance of this sort of response certainly cannot anticipate debate and thus far it does not. I am listening very closely.,70
150,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I remind the parliament that the chaos of the existing Native Title Act has not delivered benefits to the indigenous community but has delivered enormous concern and confusion to the farming industryMr Crean-This is a debate.,71
151,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Don't you like a debate on detail? Mr Crean-We want a debate on tariffs and he won't give it to us. Now what he is doing is seeking to usurp the standing orders. He is clearly debating the issue, Mr Speaker, and I would ask you to rule him out of order.",71
152,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The notice is a notice of presentation. Mr Crean-Of what?,71
153,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Of presentation. It is on the Notice Paper. Mr Crean-Yes, and he is anticipating the debate.",71
154,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, that is not true. Your point of order is out of order. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, my point of order is that here we have another frivolous point of order. The fact of the matter is that the first point of order was put to you and you ruled it out of order and all he did then in his second point of order was repeat the obvious when the Prime Minister's answer was clearly within order. Furthermore, the facts are that in respect of the question it was entirely within order and in respect of answers, which are treated differently by the standing orders, the Prime Minister has, under the standing orders, the opportunity to answer it as fully as he so desires.",71
155,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the Leader of the House. Mr Crean-Are you going to rule on that point of order?,71
156,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, I am. There is no point of order. However, this has been an interesting day. There has been a range of emotions flowing freely in the House in its normally typical combative way. But I am not prone to accept frivolous points of order, and I do not see the points of order raised thus far as frivolous, although I will pay particular heed to them between now and the expiration of the period allocated to question time. The Prime Minister is well within the compass of his responsibilities, and I do invite the Prime Minister to address the rest of the question.",71
157,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"-The Native Title Act 1993 has been a disaster for reconciliation in the Australian community. What the existing Native Title Act has done, because of its flawed operations, because of its manifest complications, is contribute to rather than subtract from division and argument within the Australian community. We now have the extraordinary situation where the Australian Labor Party is still supporting the maintenance of a right to negotiate potentially in relation to 78 per cent of the land mass of Australia. That is the essence of the position being taken by the Australian Labor Party. The Mabo decision of five years ago contains sound principles. The Native Title Act of the former government took the Mabo decision way beyond the original decision of the High Court of Australia. The Native Title Act of 1993 introduced concepts which were completely alien to the land law of Australia. What we have been left to do, as we were left to do in relation to the budget, as we were left to do in relation to unemployment, as we were left to do in relation to so many other things, is take responsibility of cleaning up the Labor Party's native title mess. The lO-point plan that has been developed by the coalition strikes the right balance, the fair balance and the only balance between the interests of different sections of the Australian community. It is not a plan that has drawn unanimous support from all sections of the community, which probably underlines the fact that it does strike the right balance. You always have to be suspicious of plans that draw unanimous support from everywhere. It will be very interesting for the Australian community, as well as this parliament, to observe the response of the Labor Party to the government's proposals in order to attend to the native title mess. Are we going to have a repeat of what the Labor Party did in relation to the budget? Are we going to have a situation where the Labor Party created the mess and then tried everything they could to stop the newly elected government from cleaning up the mess? I simply want to say to the Labor Party, to the Australian Democrats and to those in another place that we have given very long and careful thought to our response. We believe the response is right. It is fair. It is what the Australian people want. We are determined to press ahead with it, despite the opposition of the Labor Party. NA",71

Having been forced by this government to use their super between 55 and retirement age, how can the government claim that these people have a more secure retirement income when the government's policies will deliberately underwe mine that security? Prime Minister, will you now acknowledge that people who have paid their taxes all their lives have earned the right run down. to be better treated by this government in their hardship?",72
160,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think the honourable member for Jagajaga has forgotten a few things in asking that question. The first thing she has ignored is that the whole basis of the question is wrong-that is, in some way the sense of insecurity now is greater in earlier years. Some of the evidence that I have seen suggests that the greater insecurity about jobs was when your leader was the 'minister for unemployment'. That is the first point I would make. Secondly, you seem to have ignored the reality that people are expected to draw down on their superannuation before they take the age pension. I do not recall that your government attempted to do anything about that during the 13 years that it was in power. The third thing that you appear to have completely and deliberately ignored, that you have paid no account to at all, is the major improvements in the network of security that my government has provided to older Australians. Let me remind you of what my government done for older Australians. The first thing have done is reduce inflation, which has a great deal of price stability. The second thing we have done is provide incenfor private health insurance. The third very thing we have done is introduce the same taxation provisions for self-funded retirees, which have been very widely welcomed by the elderly of Australia. Fourthly, we have introduced reforms in the aged care area which will in fact lead to improved quality of accommodation in aged care, despite the scare campaign that the member for Jagajaga has as assiduously mounted all around Australia. She has gone from nursing home to nursing home scaring older Australians. That is what she has done. She has gone from nursing home to nursing home and she is proud of the fact that she has tried to scare older Australians. She boasts about it. She has gone from place to place scaring older Australians. Once again, we have tackled a problem that inherited from you. If your policies had continued, the capital contributions to nursing homes in Australia would have continued to Ms Macklin- Mr SPEAKER ",72
161,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You are going to scare a few more old people, are you? Ms Macklin- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The question was very specific about superannuation that would have to be used up than it was before people retire.",72
162,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of sense of order. Resume your seat.,72
163,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The point I am making is very specific to insecurity amongst older Australians. I am not only fingering you for the way in which you are trying to make them feel insecure but also reminding the parliament and the Australian people of the many things that we have done to reduce their sense of insecurity. I know you are a little stung by the fact that you are reminded of these things, but they remain the reality-Oh!",73
164,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,A point of order!,73
165,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister will resume his seat. The Leader of the Opposition on a point of order.,73
166,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, my point of order goes to relevance. The question was about that set of arrangements which now obliges people over 55 to access their superannuation before UB is picked up and it is tested against their position. That is what the question was about and it is not being answered.",73
167,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. The Prime Minister is addressing the response.,73
168,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have dealt with that. I have reminded the Leader of the Opposition of the link between drawdowns of superannuation and taking the old age pension, something you never tried to address when you were in power. I am going on and using the opportunity afforded by the honourable member for Jagajaga's question to remind her, to remind the Leader of the Opposition and to remind the rest of the House of the many things we have done in only 18 months to boost the sense of security amongst older Australians. The more noise that comes from the Labor Party front-bench only proclaims their sensitivity about the effectiveness of those measures. Retail Sales Figures",73
169,Mr MUTCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer inform the House of the retail trade figures released today by the Australian Bureau of Statistics? What do the figures indicate about the economy's growth prospects?,73
170,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Cook for his question. Retail sales in July recorded a 2.6 per cent rise, the highest monthly rise in over three years. Retail sales have exceeded 2.6 per cent for a month only three times over the whole of the decade. This is a very strong growth in retail sales, which probably explains why the Labor Party has no questions to ask about retail sales today. I have never seen a group of people who get more morose as the economy picks up. Absolute silence is coming from the Australian Labor Party. They were very interested in retail sales a couple of months ago, but with a 2.6 per cent increase-the highest for three years-there are no questions on it, no economic statements and, in fact, no economic spokesman coming in here and asking questions. Seasonally-adjusted retail sales, which grew in July, showed a particularly large increase of 17.6 per cent in the department store component of retailing. Although anecdotal evidence suggests this could in part be a result of end of year clearance sales, growth in total retail sales over June and July averaged 1.1 per cent, a step up from the average growth of 0.4 per cent per month recorded in the first five months of the year. Excluding department stores, retail sales grew by a solid 1.2 per cent in July. The retail sales growth was broadly based across all of the areas, other than recreational, hospitality and services and, as I said before, it was particularly strong in relation to department stores. In addition to that, revisions have occurred for past months which have actually made the retail sales for June somewhat stronger than had originally been thought. The big step up in retail sales for the month of July is a welcome sign in relation to consumer spending and consumer spending patterns. That can be taken together with the national accounts for the June quarter, which were released yesterday. They showed a 1.2 per cent increase, which was a very strong result in relation to the June quarter. We have seen, coming together with a low inflation climate and a low interest rate climate, an economy which is definitely stepping up into growth. We see excellent prospects in the Australian economy.",73
171,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,74
172,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, one of the ways you can always tell the economy is picking up is that the moroseness of the Australian Labor Party picks up commensurately with it. The interjections just betray how anti-Australian the Labor Party is. Nobody takes great delight in bad news like the Labor Party. Their economic spokesman come in here yesterday before the national accounts were released and said that the accounts were seedy. That is what he said-seedy. When the accounts came out at 1.2 per cent, he escaped overseas before he had to make a comment on them. The economic prospects of the Australian Labor Party and its purported comments in relation thereto cannot last for an hour. It is of no use an hour after it has actually been uttered. But these are good figures. They bespeak a strengthening pattern of consumption and, aside from the Labor Party, all Australians will welcome them. Telstra: Sale",74
173,Ms HANSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Finance. With one-third of Telstra being sold and with it the loss of thousands of Australian jobs, is it true that, the shares made available for sale, one-third are specifically reserved for foreign investment? If the demand for the shares by Australians exceeds the number of shares available, why are we allowing one-third to go to foreigners and not Australians?",74
174,Mr FAHEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Oxley for her question. She, firstly, is under a wrong assumption in making the statement that one-third are specifically reserved for non-Australians. The fact is, as the honourable member should have known as the legislation went through this House, that legislation provided that no more than 35 per cent of the shares be sold to nonAustralians. It was up to 35 per cent-not specifically one-third, not specifically 35 per cent, but up to 35 per cent be sold to nonAustralians. The honourable member also referred to the fact that there is some considerable demand for shares, if one can judge from the reservation of the public offer document. It is true to say that, since that particular process started about three weeks ago, there has been some considerable interest and a number of applications have been made. One cannot take from that that all those who reserve the public offer document will in fact, subsequently, after receiving advice from their brokers, proceed to apply for shares. The international experience on that is that between 30 and 60 per cent of those who reserve the public offer document proceed subsequently to actually apply for shares. If I could indicate further, prior to the election, we made it abundantly clear to all Australians that we would proceed as a government to sell one-third of Telstra in shares so we could get funds to provide for the biggest single attack on environmental degradation in this nation's history through the $1.1 billion Natural Heritage Fund. That is one of the main purposes behind the sale of one-third of Telstra. We said at that time, and nothing has changed today, that we were very interested in as many Australians as possible-the mums and dads of Australiagetting access to this great Australian company. I can assure you, Mr Speaker, and I can of assure the honourable member for Oxley that nothing has changed since that time. The allocation and the structure of the sale will be determined at some point down the track. The honourable member for Oxley is wrong in her assumptions. I can assure her that that process of providing for the mums and dads of Australia to buy shares in this great Australian company is still to the forefront of the government's thinking and, ultimately, when the allocation is made, that will be seen by all Australians to be the case. Forestry",74
175,Mr BROADBENT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. As the Prime Minister will be well aware, the central highlands regional forest agreement, which impacts on my electorate of MCMillan and Mrs Fran Bailey's electorate of MCEwen, is due to be negotiated between the Commonwealth and Victoria in the near future. Given the importance of Tasmania in national forest policy, will the Prime Minister advise the House what progress has been made in finalising the Tasmanian regional forest agreement, and what does this say about the Howard government's approach to forestry policy and the communities within them?",74
176,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for MCMillan and take the opportunity of acknowledging his continued interest in balanced industry outcomes, particularly in the state of Victoria. I can tell the House that this morning I had a lengthy and very productive meeting with the Premier of Tasmania about the regional forest arrangements to apply in that state. I am pleased to report to the House and particularly to those many government senators and members from Tasmania-not least the member for Braddon and others who have been consistently putting constructive suggestions to the government about the resolution of this issue-that, whilst the regional forest arrangement has not been completely finalised, what we are discussing and, I believe, moving towards resolving will provide an extremely good",75
177,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Another delay! Another delay!,75
178,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Denison!,75
179,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Denison is noisily trying to interrupt. If you were interested in the future of your state you might want to listen to this, because it is directly relevant to Tasmania. Whilst the agreement has not been completely finalised, it will provide an extremely good conservation outcome and it will produce new jobs for the state of Tasmania. The conservation outcomes will be based on science. There will be a generous Commonwealth package to stimulate job creation and I expect that the proposal will generate at least 300 new jobs. The member for Denison is apparently not interested in the generation of new Tasmanian jobs. The member for Denison was a member of the former government which had a poisonous attitude to Tasmania. The former Labor government was the great job destroyer of Tasmania. The conservation decisions that you took in relation to Tasmania were directed at the heart of the blue-collar workers of Tasmania. If ever there was an example of a Labor government that destroyed the hopes, the dreams and the aspirations of blue-collar workers in Tasmania, it was the former federal Labor government. It will be a jobs-positive and an environmentally friendly outcome, and I believe that the environmental decisions will be underpinned by science. The overall package will not only provide a great sense of job security, certainty and predicability to the industry, but also hold out the prospect of generating several hundred new jobs-in other words, a good outcome for everybody other than the doom merchants in the Labor Party. Salary Repackaging",75
180,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his claim last night that Australia is now a fairer society than it was 18 months ago. Why has the Prime Minister allowed his department to put together a list of fringe benefits that senior public servants, many earning more than $100,000 per year, can access in order to repackage their salaries through such fringe benefits as cars up to the value of $50,000, laptop computers and mobile phones, and thus avoid the new 15 per cent super tax and the Medicare levy surcharge? Why has the government allowed highly paid senior public servants such as Max Moore-Wilton, the head of the Prime Minister's department, to arrange their salaries so as to avoid tax, while slugging the guts out of 2,000 workers in Newcastle? Prime Minister, what is fair about that?",75
181,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Some parties have 'em! Really! Thank you, Anthony. This question comes from the New South Wales Labor Party-and if you want to look at extravagant salary packages in the public service, have a look at the New South Wales public service, presided over by your mate Bob Carr; have a look at them. The question also gives me the opportunity of reminding the House of what the Labor Party did to the superannuation surcharge. You have the nerve to talk about superannuation. You tried to destroy the 15 per cent superannuation surcharge. That surcharge was designed to bring fairness to the 1996 budget, and what did you try to do? Ah, he is on his feet again!",75
182,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I rise on a point of order. The relevance goes to this: this is a very specific question again. The question asked was: why is the Prime Minister permitting packaging to evade the 15 per cent super tax and Medicare levy surcharge for his own employees? Why is he allowing them to do that? The question had nothing to do with the bill that passed through, but with his own actions.",76
183,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. Resume your seat.,76
184,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me also remind the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Grayndler, who asked the question, that you all tried to prevent that measure, a measure which was designed to give balance and fairness. Why is it that you tried to protect the big end of town in the 1996 budget? Why is it that you voted to put imposts on battlers, but you actually protected the big end of town?",76
185,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I rise on a point of order. You were specific, Mr Speaker, in inviting relevance, and we are being specific in responding with specific questions. This requires an explanation: why is he allowing tax avoidance packaging of this particular bill by his own high income earners, thus setting such a fine example to the big end of town?",76
186,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is no point of order. Resume your seat. Mr Reith-I rise on a point of order. Mr Speaker, I refer you to the statement that you made earlier this year on this very subject, where you said: In my view, many points of order seek to disrupt the giving of an answer and/or to make debating points rather than being bona fide points of order challenging some aspect of proceedings. Mr Speaker, you then said: Genuine points of order have their proper place, but members who persistently raise frivolous or ately disruptive points of order should be dealt with firmly. Mr Speaker, I put it to you that everybody in this House knows that these points of order from the Leader of the Opposition are merely debating points. He cannot get his point up in the general public debate so all he can do is raise a frivolous point of order. I put it to you that, on the basis of the very warning that you provided earlier this year, the time is nigh for the Leader of the Opposition to be dealt with.",76
187,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! Whilst I am not prepared to uphold the Leader of the Opposition's point of order, it was a timely rejoinder to revisit some of the remarks that were made earlier this year. I invite all members to refresh themselves with the thrust of what was said earlier this year about points of order, frivolous points of order, disruptive points of order, and using these manifestations to upset the due processes involved in orderly question times. For the remainder of this day, I will rule quite harshly where I determine that the points of order are out of order.",76
188,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. In your remarks that you promptly delivered to us at that time when you had that discussion, you indicated that you intended to be tough on relevance. We are now trying to be tough on being specific. We are entitled, when there is an obvious deviation from a specific point, to go to relevance. The standing orders contain reference to relevance, that an answer must be relevant. In circumstances where you have strictly enjoined it, I would respectfully submit to you, Mr Speaker, that it is an entirely appropriate thing for us to raise the question of relevance, particularly in circumstances when we have obviously been specific in our questions.",76
189,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the . Opposition. I will rule your point of order out of order, but I take cognisance of the points you raised.",76
190,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can I resume the entirely relevant answer, because the question was about fairness. The person who asked the question asked me a particular point and, of course, in the course of giving the answer, I deliber- will deal directly with that point. Mr Bevis-Get on with it.",76
191,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will give the answer at my own pace and in the way that I choose. Can I remind those who sit opposite of an indication that was given by the government some weeks ago that, in relation to salary packages in the Commonwealth Public Service, no arrangements will be allowed which in any way represent tax avoidance. Any suggestion that I will allow that, or any members of my government will allow that, is quite wrong. I would also remind those who sit opposite and remind the public generally that one of the features of the new Workplace Relations Act-and I think it is a very desirable feature of the new Workplace Relations Act-is provide a certain amount of flexibility which was not present in the earlier arrangements. Whilst it may serve the purposes of debating point for somebody to raise the question that was raised by the member for Grayndler, can I simply tell him and tell the parliament that people who imagine that you can go on forever in having a Public Service whose remuneration falls further behind the private sector, yet complain about the quality of the Public Service when that happens, are living in the past and they have Minister. their heads in the sand. I also remind you of some of the steps that were taken by the former government to remove some of the taken disparities that existed between the public and private sectors. Of course, those things can be done consis- my tent with the government's view that all taxpayers should meet their tax obligations. That is what brings me back to your behaviour on the super surcharge. Why did you want the wealthy in Australia to continue to enjoy such a huge tax advantage? Why did you vote to prevent us imposing a tax surcharge on people in relation to superannuation payments when their incomes were over Australia's $70,000? Do you have an attack of the Bill Kelties-the only unionists he tries are the wealthy; the only people you apparently vote for in the Australian parliament the wealthy-or do you have an attack of the Simon Creans? He wanted to retain the rorts for the syndication and to protect his rich mates who, in the words of the minister for industry, wandered around in their rollers. Let me-ah! Mr Crean- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. I am not responding to his attack on me, but I draw your attention to what the Leader of the House has drawn your attention to, and these are your words in terms of what you expect to be acceptable behaviour. I will quote them, Mr Speaker, because you have had them quoted back to us in terms of points of order. They say: I expect ... answers to be relevant. If in my view a question is too long or too wide ranging, or an answer goes beyond what is reasonably appropriate, I intend to intervene. Members to will not always agree with my judgment. You expect that you might offend. Mr Speaker, all I am saying is that this is clearly a cheap getting away from the specific",77
192,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We are not going to debate the issue. You have made your point. There is no point of order. Resume your seat. Mr Crean-What is a point of order on and further this, Mr Speaker?",77
193,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Resume your seat! We are not going to debate it. I call the Prime,77
194,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The fact is that for the last 18 months whenever my government has action to catch rorters and tax avoiders you have tried to frustrate it. Therefore, you have no credentials to lecture me or any of colleagues about fairness or doing the right thing by the Australian battler. Waterfront Industry",77
195,Mr SLIPPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. Minister, have you seen recent reports of union rorts and grossly inefficient work practices that are carried out on waterfront? Is it a fact that this situation is adversely affecting the job prosto protect pects of all Australians?",77
196,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable are member for Fisher for his question. Like those of us on this side of the House, he is very concerned about the inefficiencies and the rorts that have existed on Australia's waterfront for a long time. Like the member for Fisher, we on this side of the House recognise that those inefficiencies and rorts are costing ordinary Australians their jobs. I am sure the honourable member for Fisher and others saw last Sunday night the 60 Minutes program, where that program followed the Columbus Canterbury-a ship that went between Australia and New Zealand. It showed the ship being loaded at the port of Auckland in New Zealand, averaging 24 container movements per hour. When the ship Columbus Canterbury arrived in Melbourne, the ship being loaded by Australian wharfies was loaded at the average rate of 17 containers an hour. That same ship then moved on to Sydney, where it was loaded at a rate of 14 containers per hour. That was a classic example of the sorts of inefficiencies that the member for Fisher highlighted a few moments ago in his question. In addition to that, the 60 Minutes program also highlighted that, whilst in Sydney, the Columbus Canterbury was held up in an industrial dispute, delaying it by some 12 hours at considerable cost, which is ultimately a cost that we as Australians bear. The 60 Minutes program also showed that wharfies can earn up to $120,000 a year. You do not hear the people on the Labor Party side of the House complaining about those sorts of wage levels, because the people who are earning those extraordinary wage levels are their mates. These people are the heart of the Labor movement in Australia, and you do not hear Labor Party members of parliament complaining about those sorts of wage levels when their own friends are getting them. On Sunday night in the 60 Minutes program, we also saw not only these people earning these extraordinary wages but the old 'nick-off' system. The long heralded, the long spoken and the long existing 'nick-off system is still alive and well on the Australian waterthe front. We saw people leaving many hours before their shift was due to conclude and, of course, taking the full pay for the shift in the process. Then yesterday we saw the Secretary to the ACTU at the ACTU congress in Brisbane give a powerful speech. Who did he give a powerful speech on behalf of? Was it on behalf of the battlers of Australia? Was it on behalf of the unemployed of Australia? Was it on behalf of trying to create jobs in this country, to reform our tax system or to put forward a better resolution system for industrial disputes? Was it on behalf all those worthy causes? No, it was not. Who did he get up and make a powerful speech about? He went on about the elite of Australia's work force-the wharfies of Australia, the members of the Maritime Union of Australia. That is who he made the substance of his speech about-the elite of the Australian work force, people earning up to $120,000 a year. He made a passionate speech and he said, 'If the government are going to change things on the waterfront, they can expect a dispute. They can expect a fight. They can expect to see the biggest picket ever assembled in Australia standing up for the elite of the Australian work force.' That is what the Labor movement stands for-the elite, the people who earn these extraordinary wages and who do not work the hours in order to earn those wages. We have another dispute going on at the present time. An example of the sort of thing that Mr Kelty stands for is the dispute in the port of Adelaide at the present time where the MUA is blocking the movement of car components from ships in the port of Adelaide. What is it about? Is it about something really important in the interests of Australia? No, it is a demarcation dispute between the MUA and the TWU. The MUA wants to do the job that the TWU is doing on the waterfront of moving cars on and off the ships. That is the sort of dispute that the Secretary to the ACTU, Mr Kelty, stands for. That is the sort of organisation he supports. That is sort of organisation that the Labor Party here in the parliament supports. Mr Kelty represents the heart of the Labor movement in this country. He stands for the elite. It is this government which is prepared to stand up for the unemployed, to stand up for the battlers and to give those people a chance of a job-a job that has been denied by the inefficiencies and the rorts on the Australian waterfront that have been supported for so long by the Labor movement in Australia. Dental Waiting Lists",77
197,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Down Fantasy Lane! My question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that the Western Australian government's own figures indicate that public dental waiting lists have soared, with over 10,000 people queuing for dental work for up to 20 months, as a direct result of the government's $100 million budget cut to the Commonwealth dental health program? Does the Prime Minister agree with the WA Liberal Minister for Health, Mr Kevin Prince, who said, 'It was not right for the Howard government to have slashed dental funding for low income earners'? Will the government immediately restore that program?",79
198,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am not aware specifically of those figures, but I am aware of the decision that was taken in the 1996 budget in relation to that particular scheme. I remind the Leader of the Opposition that, when you lot introduced it, it was introduced on a temporary basis. Ms Macklin-Wrong.",79
199,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It was, and it was introduced on a temporary basis for a period of time in order to meet a temporary problem in relation to a state responsibility. Given the 1OY2 billion deficit you left us, it was a regrettable but defensible decision taken by my government. If you had not wasted money, for example, if you had not wasted $400 million on the waterfront, which you did in trying to buy N.ace on the waterfront, and left an absolutely unacceptable mess, then we would not have been left once again with the problem of cleaning up your fiscal legacy. As a consequence, we did have to take some decisions that in other circumstances we might not have wanted to. I remind you that you introduced it as a four-year program. You introduced it as a temporary program. You never said when you introduced it that it would continue forever. It was a temporary program to plug a gap left in relation to state responsibilities. You have absolutely no credibility in criticising it. Work for the Dole Scheme",79
200,Mrs GASH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. There has been continuing support in my electorate of Gilmore for the work for the dole scheme. Minister, a number of inquiries about the insurance coverage for participants have been received. Could the minister please outline the workplace protection which will be offered to participants in this scheme?",79
201,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Gilmore for her question. On a recent visit to her electorate, I was very impressed by the very deep and widespread support for the government's work for the dole scheme and for the principle of mutual obligation, on which that scheme is based. I detected this level of support also in recent visits to the electorates of Warringah, Wannon, Ballarat, Bendigo, Dunkley, Deakin and others. Indeed, the Australian community has embraced the work for the dole scheme. The Commonwealth recognises the need for protection for all participants in work for the dole projects. Participants in projects will not be employees of either the Commonwealth or sponsor bodies. Accordingly, the Commonwealth will be purchasing accident or liability insurance to ensure proper protection for all participants in line with current insurance arrangements for labour market programs. The accident and liability coverage also protects a participant's liability arising out of negligent acts which cause personal injury to a third party or damage to a third party's property. But I should say that sponsors are expected to provide and maintain a safe working environment in accordance with relevant laws relating to occupational health and safety throughout the projects. Sponsors will be required to maintain public liability insurance-the cost of which can be included in the project costs in the application. I am very pleased to say that the first contracts are expected to be signed by the end of September, after some 600 applications have been sorted through. That shows the level of community support-community support which the Labor Party has completely failed to acknowledge. The Labor Party, as we know, opposed the work for the dole scheme until Major Backtlip over there decided that he could not withstand public opinion any further. The overwhelming response to the work for the dole scheme indicates the government's and the community's commitment to helping young unemployed Australians. T AFE Funding",79
202,Mr LATHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is also directed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. Has the minister seen comments today by his Victorian Liberal colleague, Phil Honeywood: Dr Kemp's arrogance has no - ounds .. '. he is acting like an endangered specIes who will say anything to protect his hide. Minister was this a reference to your repeated use of i-accurate claims and figures in this House, especially now that ANTA has advised you that your funding policies represent a 3.4 per cent cut on Labor's growth of the TAPE sector? Minister, is this not just another case of ANTA telling you one thing about TAPE funding and you telling the House exactly the opposite?",80
203,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What hurts the Labor Party, if I can put this in its policy context, is the government's commitment to young p-ople. What this government has done, as III so many other areas of policy, is to remedy the 13 years of neglect. No group in this country suffered more from neglect than this group did under the Labor Party. Whether it is through our new apprenticeships initiativ-s; whether it is through the Green Corps, to gIve young people a chance to work on th- environment; whether it is through our lIteracy initiatives; whether it is through the youth allowance; or, whether it is through the work for the dole scheme, this government is determined to stand up for the rights of young people. The government has made to the states a very generous offer. That offer is to maintain funding for T AFE in real terms for the next five years-an offer which the Labor Party never matched. Mr Crean-There was funding there. You are totally wrong.",80
204,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,We guaranteed funding for 10 years.,80
205,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There was no guarantee for 10 years. The Leader of the Opposition misled the House the other day in a personal explanation when he got up and said that there had been an agreement through ANTA to guarantee funding until the end of the decade. Do not think I did not go out of this House and check up on whether that was correct. ANT A knows of no such agreement. The Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs knows of no such agreement. You misled the House when you said that, because there was no such agreement. Will you repeat that in here? There was no such agreement at all. The Leader of the Opposition is very bad with figures, as we know. He is the person who went around this country in the last election campaign and said that there was a $2 billion surplus, when there was a $10 billion deficit. He has never been any good with figures, and when the previous .Prime Minister walked right over the top of hIm, he just laid down and died.",80
206,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The minister was beginning to digress substantially from the thrust of the question, but I recognise that he has now concluded his response. Mr Crean-You sat him down.",80
207,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I did not sit him down. I thought the minister had concluded his response. But before the minister continues, I draw his attention to the question and recognise that he was digressing substantially from the question.",80
208,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I was setting the policy context and showing that the government has had a number of very significant initiatives for young people. And one of the most significant initiatives for young people is the subject of this question. What the question concerns is the government's offer to the states, the intention of which is to encourage the states to continue to grow the number of places in their TAFE systems. The fact is that millions of dollars each year are being wasted in bureaucracy and red tape within the states. There is no blank cheque coming from the Commonwealth. The buck stops here: no more waste. No amount of empty rhetoric from a state minister will stop me from fighting for a better deal for young Australians. This government will continue to stand up for the young people of this country. Rural Doctor Services: Provider Numbers",80
209,Mr VAILE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Can the minister inform the House of any new developments with regard to discussions with the Australian Medical Association and other industrial organisations held following the introduction of the provider number reforms?,81
210,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. An important feature of the provider number legislation that we introduced in last year's budget was the safety training net for new medical graduates. I am pleased to inform the honourable memcation ber that the government has now signed memorandum of understanding with the Australian Medical Association and with other medical industrial organisations to make safety net a reality. This is good news for young doctors and it is also particularly good news for rural areas. For young doctors it will give them the tangible benefits of having an alternative pathway to have a guaranteed place that will lead to a provider number. For rural people will provide additional doctors; it will make ing orders. country hospital positions much more attractive than they have been in the past, and it will ensure that those positions are quality positions. We have now been negotiating over a number of months, and the negotiations have been very cooperative between all parties. We are going to have a clinical assistanceship program that will mean doctor can enter a pathway in the country whereby they will undergo training for four years. That training will be structured; it will be supervised; it will be high quality training. that At the end of that training they will be given guaranteed access into the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners' training program and they will be given credit for prior learning. So they will have the priority access, they will have a guaranteed place, and they will be able to have a shortened program. I would like to say to the· honourable member, as to other rural members who have raised the issue with me time and time again about attracting doctors into rural areas, that this will make those hospital positions much more easy to fill. The hospital positions in the country will now be the only ones in Australia with this sort of guarantee. It is well known that the AMA and I have had a few differences in the past, but I must thank the AMA and other organisations for the cooperative way in which they have approached these negotiations. Schools Funding",81
211,Mr LATHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Eduand Training. Given the exposure of a the minister's doctoring of TAFE and ANTA funding figures, will he now correct the misleading information he has provided the that House on schools funding? Why has the minister claimed in this HouseMr MCGauran-Could I take a point of order, Mr Speaker? The honourable member alleged malpractice by the minister. His question is out of order. When he said the minister was doctoring figureS; that implies it improper behaviour and is contrary to stand",81

216,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I called him on the basis he was going to take a point of order on a question ruled out of order.,81

218,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I defer frequently to the Leader of the Opposition. I had just ruled an opposition question out of order and the honourable member for Cowper was on his feet.,82
219,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, he wasn't.",82
220,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I had not thought you were calling for anything other than a point of order.,82

222,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,We will check the tape. Nursing Homes Residents,82
223,Mr NEHL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I address my question to the Minister for Family Services. Can the minister explain to the House what measures the government is putting into place to ensure that, under the Aged Care Reform Bill, all residents' accommodation bonds are fully protected, and is the minister able to tell the House what could happen if full prudential protection is not provided by the government?",82
224,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Cowper for his question. Mr Speaker, this government does not accept that resi,dents' funds can be subjected to any level of risk. The prudential arrangements that I have announced will provide full protection of residents' funds and will ensure that the balance will be repaid in full and on time. The government cannot compromise on its commitment to prudential arrangements. While the record of the hostel sector has been very good, the reality is that a number of facilities have encountered financial difficulties as a result of a variety of factors. In one case a large facility in Victoria became insolvent; in another case another facility in South Australia encountered financial difficulties. In these situations residents either face lengthy delays in receiving the balance of the bonds or the complete loss of those bonds. No matter how limited the number of such incidents is, the consequences are simply unacceptable. While the size of the risk may be small, it should not be underestimated. Independent actuaries advise me that the risk of loss is very real, and it will increase as the system grows. I have also said that there will be a capacity to approve alternative prudential arrangements where a group of providers can demonstrate that they can deliver an equivalent guarantee to residents. The Aged Care Act provides for this where such alternative arrangements are at least as stringent as the general prudential scheme. Prudential arrangements are an integral component of this government's aged care reform package. We will accept nothing but the full protection and security of those residents' funds. Schools Funding",82
225,Mr LATHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, my question is addressed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. Given the minister's demonstrated errors in his claims on T AFE and ANTA funding, will he now correct the information he has provided the House on schools funding? Why has the minister claimed in this House that government schools will receive an extra $2.3 billion when his own department has told the Senate that the real level of direct Commonwealth funding will fall by $41 million in the four years following 1996? Or is the minister now using Billy Hughes's counting system as well as his hearing aid?",82
226,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, sometimes I think the young and the restless are so restless that they have not got time to actually study the figures properly and get them right. Mr Latham-What about the arrogant and the endangered?",82
227,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"And I am very happy to provide the table to the member for Werriwa and take him through it very slowly. We can have him briefed by the officers of the department if he is still confused at the end of it all. What the Department of Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs provided to the Senate was a table clearly demonstrating that, over the next four years, from Commonwealth budget sources government schools will obtain some $2.3 billion more than they would have obtained had funding been held at the levels of the last year of the Labor government. So you can commit these figures to memory so that you do not go around the country trying to mislead people and, indeed, telling people that the government's decisions are running down government schools when the fact is that our decisions are the best news government schools have had for a long time. I will just repeat it. What the government's funding commitments equate to is an increase of 17 per cent per capita for each government school student over the next four years, an increase of 17 per cent compared with 14 per cent per capita for non-government school students. It is a pity that you cannot read the tables straight. The table that we have put forward and the table that I am quoting from is the table that the Australian Education Unionyour mates-have said is the only realistic way of presenting Commonwealth funding for schools. Indeed, the new putative spokesman for training in the Senate, Senator Kim Carr, has also said that that is the only presentation that gives an accurate picture of Commonwealth funding for government schools. So go and talk to your mates before you come in here and show your ignorance once again. National Nurses Memorial Trust",82
228,Mrs DRAPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer inform the House of the steps the government is taking to recognise the magnificent contribution of Australian nurses to the nation? In particular, what plans does the government have to honour those nurses who served Australia in time of war and in other significant ways in Australia's history?",83
229,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Today the government is announcing that donations of $2 or more to the National Nurses Memorial Trust will be tax deductible from today. Donations will be deductible for a period of two years. There have been discussions between the Australian Taxation Office and the trust so that it meets the usual public fund requirements necessary for tax deductibility to be granted. The trust has been founded by the Royal College of Nursing, Australia. Its primary objective is to support the commemoration of nurses and their achievements relevant to the history of Australia, and to raise money to construct an Australian service nurses national memorial on ANZAC Parade here in Canberra. I know all members of the House will be pleased to see a memorial to nurses constructed here in Canberra. Australian nurses first volunteered for service in the Boer War; some 60 nurses between 1899 and 1902. In the Great War there were nearly 2,500 nurses who served. In World War II the number was nearly 3,500. The member for Makin is somebody who was a nurse; she nursed in the area of aged care. She continues",83

We could send some around to nurse you in your disability, Mr Leader of the Opposition. She continues to champion the cause of carers. This is going to be a welcome memorial. Mr Tim Fischer-And on Legacy Day to.",83

234,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, my question is directed to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, have you received comments from the workers at Rocklea Spinning Mills concerned about their job security because of your government's failure to act on TCF support? Is the Prime Minister aware that under Labor's 1991 TCF plan Rocklea exceeded all targets set for it, gave continuous employment to over 400 people and is now exporting 100 times more than in 1991? Prime Minister, will you end the current insecurity for the Rocklea workers and adopt Labor's new plan for the TCF industries. If not, why not?",83

243,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I do particularly thank the member for Indi; a man who works assiduously for his electorate and has a consistent understanding both in government and in opposition. The thing that distinguishes Indi from Hotham is that he has a consistent position. But good old Hotham over here. When you were a minister you boastedSimon the Slasher you were when it came to tariffs; when you were in,84
244,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I have a point of order. I am going to take this point of order every time from now on to help the standards in this place.

He has identified himself.! think all members, particularly those people in the gallery who are interested in consistent policy and in a sensible outcome, might have this to say. This is what the mystery minister had to say in his address to the National Press Club: The trade union movement, I must say, took a long time to come to grips with this question, because they saw protection, tariff walls, as somehow protecting jobs. But all it did was to weaken the manufacturing capacity of the country. These were the words of a person who was in a hairy-chested, hypocritical manner boasting about the way in which his government had cut tariffs. That is why one of the consistent themesMr Crean-A point of order!",85

266,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It's coming to the end. Don't be too hard on him. I think I'd miss him if he left. That is the sort of home truth that reminds the entire Australian nation of the monumental hypocrisy of the Labor Party on the question of assistance to Australian manufacturing industry. For 13 years they boasted how proud they were of cutting tariffs.,85
267,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, my point of order goes to relevance. A specific question was asked about the Rocklea workers"":""'-'a specific one. There has been now about 10 minutes of the Prime Minister's arrogant oration, and we have not heard one word of comfort or of explanation for the workers of Rocklea or one statement of intention from the Prime Minister. I think we are entitled to it by now.",85
268,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am listening to the Leader of the Opposition. There is no point of order, but I do have a comment to make about relevance. We have had a number of questions over the last few days about relevance, and I think it is worthwhile to think in terms of the interpretation requirement. It provides the chair with a challenge, and you all know that. Pages 521 and 522 of House of Representatives Practice refer to the latitude permitted by Speakers in the past. Members will recall that on 26 May I indicated that I intended to apply a common sense approach. In applying this approach, I point out that it is not sufficient to say that a question was related to a specific aspect of a wider topic and that comments relating to the wider topic are therefore out of order. Similarly, if a question is lengthy and ranges over several aspects of a matter, it is a open to a wider range of relevance in the answer. Thus far, the Prime Minister's response is relevant.",85
269,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I simply again remind the House on this very important issue that for 13 years the Labor Party relentlessly cut tariffs in Australia. They were proud of it. They did it deliberately. They argued that it was the right thing to do and now, in a totally naked, opportunistic fashion, now that they are in opposition, now that they think there is a cheap vote in it, now that they are obsessed with the Beazley mantra of 'say one thing and do another', now they are running around the country",85

273,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes. Mr Reith-On a point of order and a point of clarification, Mr Speaker, can I ask you to clarify exactly how you intend to interpret this standing order. It has been common practice, for example, if the Leader of the Opposition were to have a bill before the House to refer to it as 'the Beazley bill'. Would you say that that was out of order? I put it to you, Mr Speaker, that that has never been in breach of the standing orders.",86
274,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, never.",86
275,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In fact, the use of the word 'Beazley' by the Prime Minister a moment ago was absolutely in accord with the conventions. In the same way, Mr SPEAKER - to complete the point-if the Leader of the Opposition referred to 'the Howard government', that would not be in breach of the standing orders. On that basis, Mr Speaker, I put it to you that what the Prime Minister said was entirely in order.",86
276,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I take cognisance of the Leader of the House's comments. We have had a particularly robust question time today. It is not uncommon to talk about 'the Beazley bill' or 'the Howard government', and it is appropriate, when addressing each other in this chamber, to use proper titles. At this moment the Prime Minister is totally in order.",86

My point of order is that the member for Batman went and confronted the Hansard reporters and I believe that is out of order.",86

It is entirely within the province of the member for Batman to check a word or a phrase. I am totally unaware of the circumstances surrounding it.

I have got to say that I find the treatment handed out to you today to be most offensive, Mr Speaker.",86
288,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for Curtin. I take cognisance of the point raised by the honourable member for Curtin. I was unaware that the Leader of the House followed through after I had ruled on a point of order. I take no offence. You may all think that I am putting on weight. The reality is that my skin is getting just that little bit thicker.,87
289,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I conclude by reminding the member for Hotham of two other remarks that he made. On 8 November 1990, while boasting about his tariff slashing proclivities, he said: The only people who have adjusted tariff levels in this place have been members of Labor govemments. You boasted about it. You also boasted about what the Whitlam government had done between 1972 and 1975. In other words, when you were in government you boasted about how you cut tariffs. You are demonstrating, by your scare tactics on this issue at present, what a monumental hypocrite you are on this issue. I say finally, in relation to this issue, that the government will have a very quick response when we get the final report. As I said in the House the other day, job security for Australians will be paramount in our minds when we take that decision.",87

291,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have called the honourable member for Hughes. Nuclear Reactor at Lucas Heights,87
292,Mrs VALE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Will the minister please advise the House of the important initiative of this government in the new regulatory arrangements for radiological health and safety in Australia? What are the implications for enhanced public confidence in the Lucas Heights facility in my electorate of Hughes?,87
293,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question. As extraordinary as it seems, Australia has had no regulatory infrastructure to oversee the Commonwealth's nuclear activities. So we have decided to merge the Australian Radiation Laboratory, which is located in Melbourne, and the Nuclear Safety Bureau, which oversees ANSTO, which is in Sydney. We are putting the two together to form the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency. This agency will have a number of activities. The first is that it will regulate all activities at Lucas Heights. So for the first time the regulator will be at arms-length from who is being regulated. It will also have statutory power by way of its office-holders. It will work by having a system of advisory committees and working parties. These advisory committees and working parties will allow direct input from interest groups, local people and people with expertise on health issues. Finally, it will be responsible for trying to get uniformity in state and territory laws on matters relating to nuclear radiation. This was an issue that I raised with my colleagues at the last health ministers' meeting in Cairns and they agreed that Australia should move towards uniform Commonwealth-state regulations and laws on nuclear radiation. The member for Hughes also asked me what the benefits would be for her constituents. The benefits are very simple. For the first time, located in my department, there will be a body that oversights all activities at Lucas Heights. These activities will not only include the decommissioning of the old reactor but also the activities of the new reactor, the storage and disposal of spent rods and the production of isotopes, which are so essential to medical diagnosis. Also, her constituents will have a chance to have a direct input into this by way of the operation of the advisory committees and working parties. When it was first put to me that there should be a new authority like this and that it should be located in my department, I was not wildly enthusiastic. But after a long period of advocacy by the member for Hughes, I was prepared to change my mind. I do see the importance of this being at arms-length. I do see the importance of this for the constituents of Hughes. I congratulate the member for the advocacy she has put on behalf of her constituents.",87

300,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"On a normal day, I would have taken considerable offence from the reflection that the honourable member for Hotham has extended, but from the opening of proceedings in this House today we have had a number of feisty debates. I am sure, when the honourable member for Hotham reflects on his words and his reflection, he may wish to take th- matter up with me privately.",88
301,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, in asking you to come back to this House, I refer you to page 473 of the House of Representatives Practice under the heading of 'Anticipation' which clearly says: . .. when answering questions Ministers have been directed to keep away from specific provisions of, or not to canvass, legislation to come before the House later in the day. On the face of it, I would have thought that was absolutely clear-cut. If you go to the blue, you clearly have as the first notice under 'Government Business' after we finish the MPI: No.3-Native Title Amendment Bill 1997- Mr Williams (Attorney-General and Minister for Justice) to present Bill. First reading. Second reading to be moved. Debate adjourned. I understood you said in your ruling that the reason you were not accepting my point of order on anticipation was that all that was here was a notification on the paper. Clearly, the blue shows otherwise. I ask you to reflect on the ruling that you have made in the light of that and, if there is to be a re-write of this practice, we would like to have it in writing. I would invite you to come back to this House and explain what appears to be your ruling, inconsistent with the practice.",88

307,Mr BEAZLEY,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Mr Speaker, I negotiated the previous government's policy with the states and it was for a continuation of funding to the end of the decade with a three per cent growth number in it, provided that the states maintained their effort. Furthermore, the evidence for it is that, were it not for the fact that that had been there, there would have been no savings against forward estimates because that forward estimate which was continuing at three per cent real growth was what was cut back to zero real growth by the minister in the budget.

308,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, you would be aware of a campaign which has been initiated by the Department of Health and Family Services under the national mental health strategy to improve community understanding about mental illness, which has had some publicity i!l the last six months. My question to you anses from yesterday's Hansard in which the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) said that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) had not taken hisn his Modicate-medication which is used in the treatment of schizophrenia. He went on to say: If you do not stop talking to yourself, you will be carted off from here in a little white suit. My request to you, Mr Speaker, is that you draw to the attention of the Minister for Health and Family Services, if not to the attention of all members of the House the campaign of the Department of Health' and Family Services and the good work they are doing, and ask all members not to try to reinforce demeaning stereotypes for people who suffer from mental illness.",89

He went on and said that instead of supporting their own motion-thmotion that I had put on the Notice Paperthey voted against it, and so on. Then he made other unfounded accusations and reflections.

355,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Mr Speaker has received a letter from the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The government's failure to provide sufficient post-secondary education opportunities for young Australians. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number a/members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",92
356,Mr LATHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) has been caught out again in question time doctoring the funding figures and failing hand over fist to grow the post-secondary education opportunities in this country. Doctor by name, doctor by deed. That is the nature of this minister. Dr Kemp- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The member for Werriwa is accusing me of an impropriety. If he wishes to do that, he can move the appropriate motion against me. Otherwise, I ask you to call him to order and express himself in an appropriate way.",92
357,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I say to the member for Werriwa that I was speaking with the Clerk at the time and did not hear what you said. If you said anything that the minister finds offensive, I ask you to withdraw.",92
358,Mr LATHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I do not think I did but, if he is offended, I will withdraw. Doctor by name, doctor by deed. That is the nature of this minister. We on this side have always wondered what the PhD is for. It is not for integrity. It is not for credibility. Dr Kemp- Mr Deputy Speaker, he is referring to the same accusation of impropriety that I have doctored figures. He is claiming that I have deliberately presented false figures to this chamber. I ask you to require him to withdraw that accusation or to move an appropriate motion.",92
359,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"To any extent that the member for Werriwa has been perceived to be making comments which the minister would see as being derogatory in terms of the possibility of his doctoring figures, I take it he will withdraw those inferences or implications.",92
360,Mr LATHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"On your advice, Mr Deputy Speaker, I withdraw. If he does not like my words, why does he not try out the words of his own Victorian Liberal colleague Phil Honeywood who had this to say today in the Melbourne Age: Dr Kemp's arrogance has no bounds. It is unfortunate that Minister Kemp is acting like an endangered species who will say anything to protect his hide. Here he is-the arrogant and the endangered who spends all his time trying to manipulate information before this House. He is told one thing by ANTA and he tells this House something completely opposite. It is like reading an Orwell novel where this minister tries to pretend that black is white, good is bad, cuts are growth and funding reductions equate to opportunity. For a man who spent most of his adult life campaigning against totalitarian governments, he has embraced the 1984 ethos-that is, white is black, good is bad, cuts are growth. That is the nature of this minister's performance in this House on every single issue of education funding. I invite the House to look at the record of this minister's comments critical of the funding policies of the former government and then examine the information that has been provided to him by ANTA. This is what ANTA had to say about funding policies under the former government: ... total VET participation, measured in terms of annual hours curriculum (AHC), has grown by an average of 5.0 per cent per year in the context of significant real increases in government, especially Commonwealth government, funding (an average annual real increase of 3.4 per cent). So under Labor there was an annual increase of 3.4 per cent. The number of additional dollars that this minister is putting into VET-into vocational education and training-is a big fat zero, abolishing the growth that Labor had running under the former ANTA agreement. So, while in this House he criticises the former government, he has clear information from his own authority, ANTA, to actually praise the former government and its funding policies. Then there is the mother of all misrepresentations, the mother of all Orwellian tactics. In his press release on 8 June this year, the minister said: The number of student places in TAFE colleges will increase by up to 500,000 in the next five years. Not 'may increase', not 'might increase' but 'will increase', according to the minister his public statement, by up to 500,000 in the next five years. This is what ANTA said to the minister recently in this document that has been provided to the opposition: The capacity of States and Territories to deliver sayefficiency gains of this order, within a single calendar year, is problematic. So what is a certainty for the minister is problematic for ANTA. It gets even worse for Clerk. the doctor because ANTA then goes on to say: This experience suggests that, for most States, a baseline efficiency of 1 per cent per achieved over the past five years. Nationally, annual average efficiency growth of 1 per that is, what they have done for the last yearswould fund only between 9 and 20 per cent of the required growth . , . that is, the doctor's growth. The doctor's growth is totally unrealistic. The doctor's claim in the public and parliamentary of what the states and territories have been doing in the last five years is totally unrealistic by any sensible measure. I can guarantee the minister that they have not been sitting on their hands. There has been substantial reform in the TAFE sector over the past five years. The document goes on to then say: A reliable estimate of real efficiency possibilities as opposed to notional possibilitieshint, hint, who is presenting the figures notionally in the public arenarequires access to detailed information on State!ferritory system budgets that is not available. While the minister in his press release is saying there will in absolute certainty be another 500,000 places, his department is saying that the information needed to make that statement is not available. This is a minister who will say and do anything to try to promote himself in the public arena, and that includes misleading the House of Representatives. This is what he said on Monday of this week: It is very clear from analysisDr Kemp- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order",92
361,Mr LATHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"He was misleading the in House of Representatives hand over fist. Dr Kemp-On a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker",93

Dr Kemp-I have just been accused by the centmember for Werriwa of misleading the House. five There are forms of the House in which that accusation can be made. I ask him to withdraw it.",93
366,Mr LATHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"On the point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker: this is the same minister who just moments ago in question time was accusarenas ing the Leader of the Opposition of misleading the House. What is good for the goose is good for the gander. You should cop it all the way.",93
367,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I thank both members for their contribution. The question of misleading or deliberately misleading is a vexed one.,94
368,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,He didn't say that.,94
369,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I do not need the help of the member for Calwell. The member did not say 'deliberately misleading' and certainly, every time 'deliberately misleading' has been used, the member using those words has been called upon to withdraw. However, the word 'misleading' at other times-and there has been some inconsistency on this-has been regarded as unparliamentary and the member has been called upon to withdraw. I will refer this matter to Mr Speaker so we can come up with an absolutely ironclad definition. But in the meantime, since the minister finds it offensive, I ask the member for Werriwa to withdraw.",94
370,Mr LATHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"On your very thorough ruling and advice, Mr Deputy Speaker, I withdraw. The minister said this in the House on Monday: It is very clear from analysis done by the Australthrough Ian National Training Authority that there are significant numbers of places to be gained in growth from the state TAFE systems. There is no such analysis. I would challenge the minister in this matter of public importance debate to provide the analysis that he alluded to in his statement to the House of Representatives on Monday. The document that has been given to him by ANTA in the last two weeks provides no such analysis. They call it problematic. They say the information is not available. They cast all sorts of doubts over what sort of efficiency gains can be made by the state. Again, what for this minister is white is really black. What for this minister is good is really bad. What for this minister represents as growth really represents in the eyes of ANTA exactly the opposite. What we are seeing from this minister is an attempt to mislead and deceive the parliament and the people of Australia, and all for what? If the minister does not like my words on these particular matters, he should take on board the words of Phil Honeywood, because this is what the minister in Victoria-his Liberal colleague-had to say: The states and territories have just given up, basically. Kemp, just to get headlines, goes out after each ministers' meeting ... and hits us with another bombshell that we haven't agreed upon. So Honeywood is there saying that this minister will say and do anything all for the sake of a headline. Maybe this is a bit too harsh on Dr Kemp. He does not look like the sort of person who could build a PR campaign. I thought, in one of my moments of good faith and goodwill, I would give him the benefit of the doubt. That was until this document lobbed on my desk-'New apprenticeships can work for you'. I opened the document and, all to my surprise, the first item that popped out was this. A photo of Dr Kemp. I wondered to myself, 'What practical use could this be put to?' Mr O'Connor interjecting",94
371,Mr LATHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for Corio has raised the right point. The valid fault with the kit was that it lacked the complementary cross and stake which would be needed to drive the photograph to get it away from very oneself. I was at this point a Honeywood convert. I thought, 'There is something in what Phil Honeywood is saying about someone looking like that wanting to try to attract headlines. ' So the minister needs to do away with the little coloured photograph and stick to the substance of the debate but, even more importantly, he needs to tell the truth. He needs to tell the truth when it comes to giving the Australian people and the parliament of Australia an accurate reflection of what you are actually doing in the funding area for vocational education and training. Your authority, ANTA, have blown the whistle on you. They have exposed you thoroughly in that document, and it is incumbent upon you to provide evidence to the contrary in this debate in this House. You have to provide the analysis that you have promised the House. There is no doubt in your own budget figures that you have cut TAFE funding by $242 million. In the new ANTA agreement, you are abolishing all the Commonwealth growth component that was established by the former government and you have dumped the problem solely on the states and territories. You have owned up to the fact that 60,000 people cannot get into TAFE under your policies, and you are solely trying to shift the blame and public presentation to the states and territories. In the end, it is a fantastic and unbelievable proposition that you are trying to present to the Australian people. The proposition is that, on the back of no growth in funding-not a single extra dollar in real terms in Commonwealth funding-there will be an additional 500,000 TAFE places over the next five years. It is fantastic to the point of disbelief. I would have thought the minister, in dreaming this up, was at a Lyons Forum gathering, where it was a matter of turning loaves and fishes into a feast. Minister, there is no feast and there is no way, on the back of a zero increase in Commonwealth funding, to generate another 500,000 TAFE places. You are trying to set the states and territories up for a fall and, to their credit, they have fingered you. It has not just been the Labor Party government in New South Wales. Every single state and territory education minister has fingered the doctor for trying to set them up for a fall. It is clear before the parliament that possible to create a feast in T AFE out of the fishes and loaves that the minister is providing. It is not possible. It is not possible to provide 500,000 TAFE places-and that was the certainty and guarantee that the minister gave the Australian people and the parliament-on the back of a zero change in Commonwealth funding. Phil Honeywood needs to be commended for these remarks. If you tried to criticise someone in the Liberal Party, what would you call them? If you tried to think of the way they work things out in the Victorian Liberal Party, what would probably be the most harmful thing you could say? Is it 'Minister Kemp is a total centralist'? I think that is getting pretty close to the mark. Honeywood said: Minister Kemp is a total centralist. He reminds me very much of the former prime minister Billy Hughes. When he didn't want to hear something he tumed his hearing aid off. From Phil Honeywood's point of view, I think it is more the little fibber than the little digger when it comes to Dr Kemp-more the little fibber than the little digger for the minister who conveniently uses the hearing aid.",94
372,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Those remarks are sailing very close to the wind. Mr Sharp- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: I propose to you that the member for Werriwa's remarks would be offensive. Mr Crean-Kempie hasn't taken offence.",95
373,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Before I call the honourable member for Werriwa back to the dispatch box, I might say that the Speaker or the occupant of this chair has the absolute authority to call anybody to withdraw anything. It does not have to be taken by another member. The occupant of the chair has the responsibility.",95
374,Mr LATHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I withdraw.,95
375,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Thank you very much.,95
376,Mr LATHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The record and bottom line for this minister is quite simple: a TAFE funding cut of $242 million in the last two budgets; an ANTA agreement that abolishes it is not totally the growth component from the Commonwealth; advice from ANTA that the 500,000 places are not realistic; and from this minister the Orwellian tactic of trying to pretend that good is bad, that cuts equal growth. The minister stands condemned by the House of Representatives for his misleading and deceitful behaviour over a number of months. He has been exposed by ANTA and he has been exposed by his Liberal Party colleagues, particularly in Victoria. He stands condemned.",95
377,Dr KEMP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Goldstein-Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, Minister Assisting the Minister for Finance for Privatisation and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service) (4.01 p.m.)-I suppose one could make some allowance for the inexperience of the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) and his incapacity to read even the most straightforward documents. In my remarks I will seek to educate him as to his misleading interpretations of the document from the Australian National Training Authority. Mr Latham- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: after the minister has taken umpteen points of order about the use of the word 'misleading', to then use that word in reference to me in his second sentence in response I would have thought to be hypocritical. I take offence, as he did, and it should be withdrawn.",95
378,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I must confess that I did not hear the minister, but since the member has taken offence I do ask the minister to withdraw.",96
379,Dr KEMP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I withdraw. One can only note the sensitivity of the member for Werriwa who felt free to use words which he now finds offensive. Let me clarify exactly what the Commonwealth is saying to the states, because the Commonwealth's position is not accurately represented by the member for Werriwa. The Commonwealth is making a very significant offer to the states, which is to maintain funding in real terms for five years. It has called on the states essentially to match that offer and to produce growth in TAFE numbers by operating their T AFE systems in a way which will ensure that any efficiency gains go back into additional places for young people. The claim that I have made-which the member for Werriwa disputes-is that there are significant efficiency gains to be made within the T AFE systems. The member for Werriwa says that that is not the case and that there is no possibility that there could be growth in the number of places of the kind that I have foreshadowed. Unfortunately for the member for Werriwa, the document that he has released demonstrates the exact opposite. If you turn to the table on page 4 of the document which the member has released-he has difficulty reading tables, so I shall take him through it very carefully--column 4 shows the 1997 notional possible efficiency gains. The member for Werriwa will see that at the foot of that table it says that, for instance, for Australia as a whole, the notional possible efficiency gains that ANTA projects are no less than $343.5 million. What ANTA is saying is that if the state TAFE systems were operated at the level ofMr Latham-Read the sentence after it.",96
380,Dr KEMP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I will come to the sentence after it. If the state TAFE systems were operated at the level that was most efficient, there would be savings of some $343.5 million. The member for Werriwa believes that, despite the fact that these very substantial savings are there to be made, the Commonwealth government should apparently continue to pour funding into T AFE, into that black hole, on top of these inefficiencies. The Commonwealth is saying that it will not do so. The Commonwealth is calling on the states to make efficiency gains and to grow the number of places in TAFE. That figure of $343.5 million equates to well over 100,000 places in TAFE per year. The document then goes on to say that a reliable estimate of real efficiency possibilities, as opposed to notional possibilities, requires access to detailed information on state and territory system budgets that is not available to ANTA. Mr Latham-So it is not reliable.",96
381,Dr KEMP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"No, it is quite reliable as an estimate. The Commonwealth's position is to take that comment from ANTA on board and, as the Commonwealth has said to the states, we will sit down with each of the states and negotiate the level of efficiency gains that can be obtained in each of the states in the light of the actual situation. That is an entirely appropriate way to go about it. It is entirely consistent with the document which has been tabled by the member for Werriwa and which he simply fails to understand. Let me just look at the broader picture. We have before us an MPI which says that we have failed to provide sufficient post-secondary opportunities for young Australians. Nothing could be further from the truth. It was the Labor Party which restricted opportunities for young Australians across the postsecondary sector. It neglected T AFE for the vast proportion of its period in office. It locked tens of thousands of students out of universities. Apprenticeships and traineeships declined as a proportion of the work force to their lowest level for three decades in 1995. In the last year of the Labor government, apprenticeships and traineeships were at a level only of 69,500 compared with 99,000 in 1996, the first year of this government. The fact is that this government has expanded opportunities for young Australians in every area of post-secondary education. There are 55,000 extra places in TAPE in 1997, of which 43,000 have been funded by the Commonwealth. Again, I think one must make allowances for the shadow minister because he is relatively inexperienced, and I do not accuse him of deliberately misleading on this point. The fact is that total funding for vocational education and training has increased by some $144 million over the level of the last year of the Labor government. That shows this government's great commitment to vocational education and training. Expenditure on vocational education and training is not the same as expenditure on TAPE. It is broader because it encompasses, for example, the Commonwealth's commitment to provide support for employers in taking on apprentices and trainees. The Labor Party neglected that whole area throughout its entire period in office, and it has fallen to government to build it up to ensure that there are opportunities for young Australians. The member for Werriwa went around the country last year saying that the budget decisions of the new government would restrict access to universities. The reality is quite the opposite, as the government intended. The government intended to increase access to opportunities for higher education. In fact, enrolments in universities this year are up 15,000 over the previous year. The university sector is better funded this year than it was last year. So the government has expanded opportunities. The growth in the apprenticeship and traineeship system is equally significant. I think it falls to me to point out to the House that the previous government completely neglected the apprenticeship system and the desperate need for reform. It even attempted to wipe the word 'apprenticeship' out of statistics on employment based training. It introduced the trainees hip, which was not well understood, and for 10 years tried to get it up and running. But because its partner, its close mate, the ACTU insisted on surrounding it with so many requirements, rules and regulations, it was unattractive to employers. In fact, we had the dramatic run-down of opportunities for many of the thousands of young people who would be in the member for Werriwa's own electorate. Like so many on the Labor side of the House, the member for Werriwa had his eye fixed firmly-as did his predecessor, John Dawkins-on the number of young people going into universities. Th-re was a significant increase during the period of the previous government in the number of young people in universities, but only 30 per cent of school leavers go on to universities. What about the other 70 per cent? They were virtually utterly neglected. The member for Werriwa, along with all the other members of the Labor Party, went around giving the totally misleading message to young people that, if you were not going on to university, you were not going anywhere. It has fallen to this governmentMr Latham- Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, I raise a point of order. The minister has set a this standard in this debate about the use of the word 'misleading'. He has now referred it to me for the second time in the debate. I would ask him to withdraw.",96
382,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"There is no point of order. I listened very carefully, and you had better believe it. Mr Latham-He said that I was going around trying to give a misleading impression.",97
383,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I listened very carefully. I heard what he said. I believe misleading advice was the term. Mr Latham-What is the difference?,97
384,Dr KEMP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This year, I am pleased to say, the growth in traineeships has been at record levels. There have been 52,000 traineeships over the 1996-97 year-a 44 per cent increase on the previous year. That reflects to a significant extent the commitment of this government to ensure that employment based training apprenticeships and traineeships-the sorts of opportunities that tens of thousands of young Australians are looking for-are much more attractive to employers because of the reforms that we have put in place. In the most recent budget, the Commonwealth government has provided some $550 million to support 220,000 new apprenticeships and traineeships, which is something like a 48 per cent increase over the last two years of the Labor government. So let us have none of the nonsense that is embodied in this MPI before the House, that this government has failed to provide expanded post-secondary education and training opportunities for young Australians. In every sector, there has been an improvement. Let me say that this reflects the outstanding commitment of this government to redress the neglect of young people that occurred over the previous 13 years. When we came into office, for example, we found that some 30 per cent of 14-year-olds in year 9 in school could not read properly and that the reading comprehension level of boys had declined. That was how much the previous government cared about the most disadvantaged young Australians. Getting literacy to young Australians is the single most important social justice measure in education, and you did nothing about it. This government is determined to give young Australians a proper foundation on which they can build their future lives. The measures of this government to expand vocational education and training options in schools by a commitment of $187 million over this four-year period provide an outstanding initiative to make sure that those thousands of young Australians who drop out of school have the chance to get schooling which they perceive is relevant and which will be relevant to them. This government has also encouraged schools to begin to think about their role in employment placement and to take a responsibility for actually getting young people jobs with local employers as they leave school. There has been outstanding success in the first schools to be contracted under this program by the present government.",97
385,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Have you ever heard of modesty?,98
386,Dr KEMP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The shadow parliamentary secretary at the table clearly is embarrassed by the fact that this government is committed to young people and their futures in a way that the previous government never was. We are putting it to the states that, with this level of inefficiency in the TAPE systemand we do not stand by that particular ANTA figure; there can be argument about the figure that it has come up with and there should be a proper investigation into what is involved in these inefficiencies-dearly there are very substantial gains to be made in the TAPE system. The Commonwealth government is saying to the states, 'We want to see those gains made. We want to see them evidenced in additional TAPE places for young Australians and we want to build on the increases in TAPE places which the Commonwealth is funding this year.'",98
387,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I support the MPI proposed by the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham). I also wish to condemn the government's failure to provide sufficient post-secondary education opportunities for young Australians. The most disappointing thing about the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training (Dr Kemp) is that he was previously firmly committed to education and he is now committed to deception. The minister is trying to tell this House and this parliament that serious cuts in education in the university, TAFE and school sectors equal more for education. That is what he is trying to tell this House; that is what he is trying to tell this parliament. He ought to be ashamed of this kind of deception because he knows the importance of education. Whenever the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is asked questions about these matters, he says, 'We were in a difficult budgetary situation. We had to make all those cuts.' At least the Prime Minister admits that serious cuts have been made to education, unlike the minister who tries to pretend that nothing has happened in cuts to education and that somehow cuts to education equal better education for more people. What kind of nonsense is this? What kind of misuse of the statistics and facts is that? The reality is that this government is now in a position to fund education because it gained a lot of revenue in the last year or so from various sell-offs, privatisations and the like. Instead of coming in and saying, 'We will spend more on universities. We will spend more on TAFE colleges. We will spend more on training. We will spend more on primary and secondary education,' the government says, 'We are spending less money but, never mind, even though we are spending less money, there are going to be better outcomes.' And then what happens? The minister attempts to push the state governments into a situation in which they have to fund the expansion. Basically, that is what is going to happen. The minister tried to tell the state governments, 'We have cut $70 million at least from your budget, but you are going to have to expand by 500,000 positions in the next five years.' How is this going to be funded? According to the minister, the state governments are going to have to find a way because the federal government is not going to do that. The minister then produces this document, which is supposed to be some way of showing that notional achievements of this kind can be made. But what happens? Dr Kemp-You put that document down on the table.",98
388,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"'We put the document on the table'-this document was given to the minister. Of course we put it on the table, because the minister has tried to pretend to this House that this matter will be achieved, notwithstanding the fact that the states are going to have to fund it and that the states are saying, 'We will not fund it. We are not capable of these kinds of efficiencies, because it is going to be a detriment to education.' I will come back to that in a moment. What does this document say? It says: A reliable estimate of real efficiency possibilities as opposed to notional possibilities requires access to detailed information on State!ferritory system budgets that is not available. In other words, you have this notional figure and then they say, 'A realistic assessment means that we have to get the figures from the state and territory systems.' When the state and territory ministers met and talked about this matter, what did they say to you, Minister? Didn't they say to you that these figures were not achievable and that these cuts that you are making to the budgets are an outrage? Didn't they say that to you? They issued a statement on 12 June, didn't they? They were really condemnatory of your approach. You have not referred to that statement, Minister, have you? The state ministers said that what you were trying to achieve was not achievable and that what you are trying to do is to force the states into a situation where the quality of the TAFE system will go down. You insist on efficiencies and increases which are not viable instead of going to the Prime Minister and saying, 'We need more money for this sector,' as we do for all of the education sector. That is what you would be doing if you were really responsible in terms of education. You know very well that you can afford that money at the moment, because you have had various windfalls. We have even heard the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Jull) tell us about how he gained $400 million from privatisation. Why don't you use a bit of that money for social welfare or for education? Why don't you use some of that money to fund the post-secondary sector? Why don't you use some of that money in the school system? In the view of many representatives on the Labor side, our schools and our postsecondary education system are suffering as a result of your cuts, which are then represented through the state system as well. They are suffering. I can tell you what a disaster education was when we came into government in 1983. You talk about working-class kids not getting to university. You should have seen what it was like in 1983, after your government had been in power for eight years. There was a terribly disastrous situation in terms of the number of kids starting school and finishing year 12. The retention rate increased from about 30 per cent to about 75 per cent under our stewardship. That is what happened in education in terms of high schools. You talk about people from disadvantaged backgrounds going to universities and colleges. How could they go to universities and colleges when under you at that time they could not even finish high school? You are trying to reverse what happened under the Labor government when we achieved a dramatic increase in university positions and a dramatic increase in TAPE positions. We put the TAPE sector on a financial footing in terms of federal support. It was the Labor government-not your previous government, which did hardly anything for TAPE. Now you are trying to cut back on this with the way in which you are proceeding. Let us not beat around the bush, Minister: you are having a serious problem with the state ministers on this matter. You can come into this House and bluster and tell us about immodesty. I have never heard a more immodest minister than this fellow. Every time he talks he says, 'We have had substantial increases; we have had wonderful achievements; we have had fantastic results.' This is the same minister who has accepted cuts to universities, cuts to the TAPE system and cuts to the school system. Mr Billson-Wrong!",99
389,Dr THEOPHANOUS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It was wrong, was it? You have not cut $600 million from universities over the next four years? That was not in your budget figures? What a fool you are. Why don't you at least look at the figures? What a lot of nonsense. You say that it is wrong. It is certainly not wrong. What is wrong is the attempt by the minister to pretend that things are going well in education in this country. It is a shame, because this minister knows-probably more than anyone else, having been an academic-the importance of education to this country. He has allowed a situation where education is being run down, it is being cut, and he is trying to push the situation on to the state ministers, whose budgets cannot afford these increases that he is trying to push on them. Why do we now have to put more funding into education? At no time in modem history than at the current time have we seen demonstrated the importance of post-secondary education for a viable society, for a viable, modem economy in the industrialised world. We need education in order for us to participate in the technological society, in information technology, in high-tech industries, for our people to be able to work with modem equipment-computers and the like. What do we have from the minister? We have this blustering about how he is going to be able to cut money in the post-secondary sector but is going to be able to provide a reasonable level of education. Are you going to be able to provide computers and all the necessary equipment that you need in the TAPE colleges while you cut these budgets, Minister? Is that what you are pretending to tell us? What a lot of nonsense. Quality will go down under you. You will try to force increasing numbers through the states. The states will not wear it. We are going to have a crisis in education as a result of the way in which you are handling your portfolio. We will be coming back into this House to look at these figures very clearly after more information is gained from ANTA and from the state ministers. We will be putting it on to you to prove that the states are able to make these increases that you claim you can make. You will not be able to do that because, as you know very well, the state ministers-especially Minister Honeywood in Victoria-have condemned you for the way in which you are approaching this whole matter. It is time you went and had a rethink about the issue. It is time you went back to the Prime Minister and said, 'Look, Prime Minister, if we are going to get this expansion in the TAPE sector, we need more money and we do not need to push the states around trying to get them to pay for our increases.' (Time expired)",100
390,Mr BILSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We are probably all fortunate that all that waffle has just finished. The point of this matter public importance is about providing postyoung secondary education opportunities for young Australians. I am grateful to the member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) for straying on that subject near the end of his contribution. Particularly for people in the gallery and those listening-and I am sure you would appreciate this information, Mr Deputy er Jenkins-what Labor is talking about when it talks about cuts is cuts to its fairy tale forward estimates. These are the forward numbers that Labor dreamed up to look good. At the same time that they were dreaming those numbers up, they were telling you and me and the whole country that we were on target for a surplus. What happened when we actually got the figures? There was no surplus; it was a $10.3 billion deficit. When they talk about forward estimates, when they talk about cuts to tion, just remember that these are fairy tale figures that they are referring to. The member for Calwell knows it well. You do also, Mr Deputy Speaker. Those listening have an opportunity to gain an understanding about these so-called cuts. Let me talk about what the Howard governwhy ment has done. We were faced with the problem of having to fund the deficit left to us by the members opposite, by those people that the broader community understood were doing nothing about postenrolments, secondary education opportunities, by those people opposite who were going around talking ignoring the 70 per cent of people in my electorate who do not go on to tertiary tion-the 70 per cent who do not get the support that those going to university get. While they were ignoring those people clocking up more debt on the Visa card, were planning a better future for young Australians people, to restore their hope and their job prospects and to give every young Australian an opportunity to make that transition from education to employment. I can understand why the member for Calwell may have ignored all these sensible facts, because he probably has not been listening to some of the reforms the government has introduced. Those reforms demonof strate that this government views the future of people as one of its highest priorities. It has backed that up with a comprehensive plan that does not just start, like the member to for Calwell would like to suggest, when there is an election around the comer. We do not start plans like Labor, which will say and do anything to make themselves look good. We Speakall know what they do when they get into government. The vast majority of Australians understood that and threw them out at the last election and created so many vacant seats on make it the other side of the House. The university sector would probably say, 'Under this government they have given us a chance to fill the seats and retain the revenue that comes from it. Isn't that great.' If we have got all the infrastructure there and it is left half empty, like we see on the Labor Party benches over there, why not put those educaresources to use? Why not give people the opportunity to occupy those places? Why not give them the benefit of the wisdom and the tuition available from lecturers that are already being paid, that already have the resources that are required for them to deliver their programs? If there are vacant seats there, not use them? That is a very important change that we have made, and I will talk $10.3 billion about many others. While I am on the subject of university the member for Calwell might be interested to understand this while he is about cut, cut, cut. We are all saying, 'Cut, cut, cut-cut the rot,' but we will keep educagoing for now. Universities in 1997 have enrolled more Australian students than ever before. You might not have understood that and from what the member for Calwell was we saying, but that is a fact. There are more in universities this year than ever before. There are more opportunities for the young people of Australia. There are more opportunities to tackle the question of postsecondary education for young people. While I am on this subject, isn't it fortunate that the standing orders in this place are fairly slack when it comes to MPIs? Because this is so misleading that it would not have passed the test of almost truths. That is probably why those opposite chose to talk very rarely about it during their contributions. The enrolment figures for 1997 indicate that enrolments of Australian students have increased by 15,820 effective full-time student places, which is 3.6 per cent on last year. That does not sound like a cut. That sounds as though 15,000 people are making use of the educational opportunities that this government is providing them. In addition, Australian undergraduate enrolments have increased by over 14,350 or 3.9 per cent. That sounds like another increase to me, and further demonstrates that so much of what has been said in this debate today is just absolute, utter nonsense. In terms of funding levels for universities, the university sector is estimated to have some $33 million more of Commonwealth revenue in 1997 than in 1996. That does not sound like a cut to me either. That sounds like more resources. That is probably why we have more students in there. That is probably why, in Victoria, we have more than 120,000 students in government funded places. That is probably why students at RMIT, myoId alumni, are so appalled by the student demonstration that was going on there that was talking about up-front fees. There is no obligation regarding up-front fees for more than 120,000 government funded places in Victoria. The people who are paying up-front fees at the moment are people who are not Australian citizens, who can buy places to pursue their dreams and who can pursue their post-secondary education vision for a better life. Everyone except Australian students can have that opportunity. If someone were to say, 'I've just missed out very slightly with my TER score to gain access to a veterinary program, but that is something that drives me, that is something that is within me as I love animals and I'd like to make a contribution in that area for the rest of my career,' why can't they invest in their future? Everyone else has had the chance-but not Australian citizens. We have addressed that also. Total postgraduate fee paying students and overseas students have increased by 19 per cent and 11 per cent respectively over 1996 levels. That sounds like more again. Where is this cut? There is no cut. University revenues from both these sources-that is, government funded places and overseas students and those who are paying up-front fees-have increased by $65 million over 1996 levels. Again, that does not sound like a cut to me. While we are on the subject of universities, let us talk a little bit more about what actually happened when people had the chance to enrol. You know the scare campaign that the Labor Party was going on about when it was said that people would be missing out on university places? As I have clearly demonstrated, not only has the number of government funded university places increased but they have actually overenrolled some 28,000 students against the undergraduate targets this year. There is an eight per cent overenrolment. That is more on top of more. I do not know how more on top of more becomes less, becomes a cut. Perhaps the member for Calwell could explain that or perhaps he has not confrontedMr Barresi-He's gone.",100
391,Mr BILSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That just shows his interest in the subject. He is off. Perhaps the best contribution he can make to the young people of this country is to leave the chamber and leave it to people who are genuinely interested in young people's futures. In the tight budgetary circumstances that I have already outlined-that very heavy Visa card that this nation was carrying around, the debt that was left by those opposite for our young people-what has this government done? We have invested in those young people. We have said to them, 'It is so important that we can provide you with future opportunities.' Dr Kemp has talked at length about the vast array of initiatives that has been introduced-all part of a plan to provide more opportunities for young people as they leave secondary education. Whilst that has been going on, we will put an extra $26 million over the next four years into universities to help them restructure, to take advantage of the opportunities that this government has provided them. There will also be an extra $130 million provided over three years for research infrastructure, postgraduate research training and collaborative research. That is $130 million in addition-more; more opportunity; more investment in the young people of this country. That is not less. So the member for Calwell again does not have a grip on what is actually going on in this place. I will move quickly to those people who have not yet had to make the choice about their post-secondary education. Let us not forget them. Let us not forget the fact that have a responsibility to give them the opportunity to take advantage of these vast improvements in alternatives they have before them. With Dr Kemp, I was recently meeting with a number of careers teachers down our way, on the Mornington Peninsula, around the electorate of Dunkley. They were telling us about how overworked they are-and they are. They are working and working for the young people of this country. One of the challenges they are facing is that there are so many more choices for them, there are so many other alternatives that they need to explain and so many new opportunities that were not there under the previous government, that they are now spending more time talking with employers, talking with TAFEs, talking with the universities and working with the school community to make sure that those young people have a future and that the school is playing a valuable role in aiding that transition of a young person from the school environment to work. They want to have a stake in that transition. We have put an extra $560 million together for special programs, for literacy, for students with special learning needs and for languages so that opportunities are there for those people who, perhaps through some cognitive disadvantage that is not of their making, can be assisted. We are making sure that they have a chance to benefit from this vast array of alternatives that is before them. Even the young people who have intellectual disabilities who were here today from W oorinen-an ATSS centre down in Dunkley providing supported employment-have choices now. They have more choices; we are funding more places for them. We are not just talking about those people that Labor talked about for the last 13 years; we are talking about all young people because they all have [(right to expect that the government is working with them for a brighter future. There are so many more initiatives that I could go through, but my time is running out. Let me simply conclude by saying that it is important to appreciate what this government has done. It has done what the Labor Party's we former minister said that Labor could never do, and that is to think about the 70 per cent or more of people who do not go on to universities.

396,Mr WILLIAMS,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. Introduction 2. It is over five years since the High Court's historic Mabo judgment. That decision held for the first time that indigenous Australians have native title rights in relation to land that are recognised by the common law. The judgment challenged our legal and parliamentary systems to provide a framework to respect and protect those rights, while at the same time to provide the necessary certainty to enable economic activity and development to proceed. 3. The previous government sought to respond to the Mabo decision through the Native Title Act 1993. In 1993 the coalition's clear and consistent view was that the act was inadequate and unworkable, and failed to address many of the uncertainties arising from the Mabo decision. 4. In 1997 it is more apparent than ever that the Native Title Act has not delivered real outcomes to the Australian community, and particularly to Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders. 5. After almost four years and over 600 claims lodged under the act, there has been only one determination of native title on mainland Australia. Australians have been disappointed with the delays, confusion and Report lack of results from a complex, costly and litigious system. The act has placed a burden on resource development, without yet delivering benefits to indigenous peoples. As a result of the significant uncertainties left unresolved by the original act, community relations in many parts of rural and remote Australia have been unnecessarily strained. 6. These frustrations, uncertainties and tensions were intensified following the High 1997 Court's Wik decision of 23 December 1996 which, contrary to general assumptions about the law, found that pastoral leases do not necessarily extinguish all native title. In responding to the Wik decision, the government is determined to reduce these uncertainties, simplify native title processes, improve the workability of the act, and increase community understanding and acceptance of native title issues and processes. 7. The government aims to develop a more effective framework for managing native title in Australia, a framework which respects, balances and gives voice to the interests of all parties with an interest in the land-native title holders themselves, the resource based industries, pastoralists and farmers, state and territory governments, local governments, and others. Australians want to have confidence that native title issues are being resolved by efficient, fair and timely processes which find the right balance among the rights and interests of all parties involved. 8. We believe that the bill introduced today achieves those objectives. 9. The government reiterates today that it is committed to respecting the native title rights of Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders. The Mabo decision was an important day for indigenous Australians. Most Australian citizens continue to support the decision's acknowledgment of the rights and interests of indigenous Australians in the continent we share. This bill delivers on that sense of broad community support for the Mabo decision and the need to accommodate the legitimate native title rights and interests which flowed from it. 10. But the bill goes further and also delivers on the government's central policy objective of encouraging economic development across Australia. It delivers certainty for pastoralists, reduces complexity for the resource industries, and recognises the appropriate role for the states and Territories. For the first time Australia will have native title processes that work. Processes towards the bill 11. In developing these amendments, the government has worked through an open and participatory process. On 27 June 1996 I introduced the Native Title Amendment Bill 1996 into the House. In October 1996 the government released a range of amendments to that bill, in particular in relation to the right to negotiate provisions. The substance of that bill, and the proposed government amendments, have been incorporated into this bill. 12. More importantly, this bill also brings to the parliament the government's response to the Wik decision. As honourable members will be aware, in the months following the Wik decision the Prime Minister held an intensive series of consultations with all interested parties. On 8 May 1997 he released a IO-point plan which summarised the government's proposed response. 13. On 23 June 1997 the government made available a working draft of the bill for comment by interested groups. Following a further round of extensive discussions over 80 written submissions were received and considered by the government. 14. Not surprisingly, given the broad spectrum of views on the issue, the bill will not accommodate all the representations of all the interest groups. The National Farmers Federation has continued to call for the extinguishment of native title on pastoral lease land. The bill does not do this. However it does protect the interests of pastoralists and allows them to carry on pastoral activities and to diversify those activities with greater certainty. The National Indigenous Working Group has proposed a package of responses to Wik. Some of these responses have been incorporated into the bill, while others have not. In developing its proposals, the government has sought, through its 1O-point plan, to put in place a fair and equitable process for dealing with native title which balances the interests and objectives of all parties, in the overall interests of the Australian community. Pastoral Leases 15. Since the Wik decision Australia's pastoral leaseholders have been grappling with the uncertainties of native title. The government is determined to resolve those uncertainties as directly and as soon as possible. 16. The previous government took the view that pastoral leases extinguished native title. In the second reading speech to the Native Title Bill 1993 the previous Prime Minister stated: the government's view [is that] ... under the common law, past valid freehold and leasehold grants extinguish native title. There is therefore no obstacle or hindrance to the renewal of pastoral leases in the future . . . 17. The previous government developed the Native Title Act on the assumption that native title on mainland Australia would exist principally in relation to vacant crown land, that is, the 36 per cent of Australia where there has been no significant grant of private rights, or public reservation or use. The assumption was that the rights of native title holders in relation to such vacant crown land could be significant, and could be equated to ownership of the land. Based on these assumptions, the act provided to native title holders the same protection and the same procedural rights as freeholders, as well as a special right to negotiate in relation to mining and some compulsory acquisitions. 18. However, the High Court's judgment in Wik contradicted these assumptions. The Wik decision held that the grant of a pastoral lease over land did not necessarily extinguish all the native title rights in relation to that land. Justice Toohey said in Wik: It is apparent that at one end of the spectrum native title rights may ""approach the rights flowing from full ownership at common law"". On the other hand they may be an entitlement ""to come onto land for ceremonial purposes, all other rights in the land belonging to another group"". 19. It is clear that, in relation to pastoral lease land, native title rights cannot be the former, and may only be the latter. In this government's view the assumption underlying the Native Title Act, that native title rights are likely to be rights approaching ownership, is rendered false by the Wik decision. It is inappropriate therefore that that false assumption should continue to underpin the Native Title Act as a whole. The current act is clearly deficient in that it does not deal in any systematic way with the relationship between co-existing native title and other rights. 20. The amendments in the bill put in place a more appropriate regime to deal with native title rights on pastoral lease land and other non-exclusive areas. The amendments protect the legal rights of pastoral lessees, and enable them to carry on their legitimate activities. They continue to protect any surviving native title rights but, in relation to pastoral lease land, they recognise that these can only be coexisting rights. Consistent with this philosophy of finding a balance among the rights of different parties, the amendments allow for the introduction of new processes for reaching land use decisions over pastoral lease land which give equivalent procedural rights to all parties with an interest in the land, including the pastoral leaseholder and the native title holder. 21. The High Court has held that the Native Title Act is supported by section 51(xxvi) of the constitution. Legal advice to the government is that the bill is supported by section 51(xxvi). 22. Let me now take the House through some of the key elements of the bill. Validation 23. As I have said, the effect of the grant of a pastoral lease on native title was not specifically resolved by the High Court in Mabo, nor by the Native Title Act. The previous government assumed that pastoral leases had extinguished native title. As a result of the Wik decision, we now know that pastoral leases do not necessarily have that effect. However, the government does not accept that grants by governments, and actions by others, in particular pastoral lessees, should be left invalid because of a legitimate and reasonable assumption, subsequently found to be wrong. The appropriate remedy for those actions should be compensation for any native title affected. 24. Thus, the bill provides for the validation of so-called 'intermediate period acts' over freehold and pastoral lease land and public works, which occurred between 1 January 1994, the date of commencement of the Native Title Act, and 23 December 1996, the date of the Wik decision, which might otherwise have been invalid as a consequence of the existence of native title. Confirmation 25. The approach of the previous government raised expectations of certainty which the act proved unable to deliver. This has proved to be costly to all parties. This government's policy is to bring a much greater level of certainty to bear in relation to native title issues, in particular in relation to the circumstances where it can reasonably be said that native title does not exist. To do so we have chosen to confirm explicitly in the Native Title Act the extinguishment of native title by certain grants or activities by governments. 26. It needs to be clearly understood that the government does not seek to extinguish native title in this process. We do not seek to go beyond what can be inferred from the decisions of the High Court as to what acts have already extinguished native title. As I have already made plain, this government respects, and will continue to respect, the Mabo and Wik decisions and the native title rights of indigenous Australians. But it is in the interests of all Australians to be clear and certain about where extinguishment has already occurred. The resolution of native title issues will be made even more difficult by unrealistic expectations on the part of claimants or by unnecessary uncertainty for others with interests in land. 27. Accordingly, the bill provides that certain 'previous exclusive possession acts' have extinguished native title. They include the grant of a freehold estate, leases for residential, commercial or community purposes and interests included in a schedule to the act. The bill provides that states and territories are to confirm that such grants extinguish native title. 28. The Commonwealth has worked extensively with the states and territories to develop the schedule of interests. It has proved to be a complex and time-consuming task. We are currently discussing its terms with a range of interest groups, and this intensive process has meant that the schedule is not ready to be included in the bill. It will be added as a government amendment to the bill after further consultation. The schedule includes particular types of leases and other interests where exclusive possession must have been intended. 29. The bill is intended to introduce further certainty by confirming the effect of the grant of pastoral leases on native title. Consistent with the High Court's view, states and territories are able to confirm that the grant of such leases is confirmed to extinguish native title to the extent that the native title rights are inconsistent with those of the pastoralist. 30. The bill provides that such extinguishment is permanent. The government recognises that the permanency issue was left unresolved by some members of the High Court in the Wik decision. However, it is a central element of the government's approach to amending the act to put an end to such uncertainty. 31. To the extent that these provisions confirm the common law there will be no effect on native title rights. But if there is any actual extinguishment by the provisions, the legislation will provide for compensation on just terms. I would note that the government has retained the Land Fund to enable Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders to remedy past extinguishment of native title rights by the purchase of land. Future act regime 32. The 'future act regime' in the Native Title Act seeks to answer the question: what acts can governments and others now undertake which may affect native title rights? Despite more than 3Y2 years of the operation of the current act, for most of Australia we do not able yet know where native title exists and, if it does, the identity of the native title holders or the nature of their rights. It is the view of the government that changes to the future act processes are required if land use decisions and activities are to be made with certainty in the future. Accordingly, the bill includes a revised future act regime. If an act by government will not affect any native title, then nothing in the Native Title Act prevents or restricts that act. But, if the act will affect native title rights, the act provides some basic rules. The present bill clarifies these rules, and adds some additional provisions to deal with the new concepts of co-existing native title on pastoral lease land. These include, among other things, expanded scope for agreements, new provisions relating to primary production, confirmation of the ability of governments to regulate and manage water, facilitation of the provision of services to the pUblic, facilitation of renewals, and provisions to allow for the implementation of past reservations of land. 33. The amendments make clear that where governments carry out acts under one of the 'future act' provisions, then that act is valid, even though it may affect native title rights. The bill provides that where a person has, or receives under one of the future act provisions, a lease, licence, permit or authority to do something, such as a right to take water or conduct primary production activities, then this authority prevails over any native title, and the existence or exercise of any native title cannot prevent any activity that the authority requires or permits. 34. Importantly for indigenous interests, the great majority of future acts are subject to the non-extinguishment principle. This ensures that while native title is subject to a lease, licence or other government grant for the period of the grant, it is only temporarily suppressed for the period and can revive. With several minor exceptions linked to past actions or future processes, native title can only be extinguished under these amendments in the same way as it can be extinguished under the existing act, that is: - by agreement of the native title holders; or - by compulsory acquisition of the rights of native title holders under legislation that applies equally to other land-holders. Primary production 35. The bill recognises on the basis of the Wik decision that native title is able to coexist with other interests on pastoral lease land, although those rights are subject to the rights of the lessee. The bill enables pastoral lessees primary production activities, notwithstanding any co-existing native title that might exist. The definition of 'primary production' is based on the definition in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 with some minor modifications. It includes incidental and associated activities. The approach is intentionally wide to reflect the national interest in diverse and flexible rural industries. 36. However, any activity permitted under the Native Title Act still requires authorisation under any relevant state or territory legislation. 37. As the Prime Minister has already made clear, the government does not expect, and would not support, across-the-board freeholding of pastoral leases at the expense of native title holders or of Australian taxpayers. There will be no massive windfall gain for holders of pastoral leases. Nor will there be risk of environmental degradation through loss of legislative and administrative controls over inappropriate land clearing and overuse. However, if there is a legitimate need for exclusive possession of pastoral lease land in order to facilitate changes of use, then this can be achieved by agreement with the native title holders or under a general non-discriminatory compulsory acquisition regime, on a case by case basis. In its financial agreements with the states and territories the government will be requiring a proper financial contribution by the beneficiaries of the upgrading through the payment of a betterment charge. Statutory access rights 38. The government's legislative package protects any existing access of native title claimants to pastoral lease land. 39. In a significant new provision in the Native Title Act, access for registered native title claimants to pastoral leases will be guaranteed, provided that they regularly had physical access at the date of the Wik decision. This is a provision designed to maintain the status quo, pending determination of their claim. The access rights will, however, be subject to the rights and activities of the pastoral lessee. to carry out Right to negotiate 40. Among the many shortcomings of the current act, it has become apparent that the 'right to negotiate' procedures, which apply to mining and certain compulsory acquisitions, have failed to deliver the outcomes that were expected. Not only have these procedures impeded resource and commercial development, but they have done so without giving indigenous peoples substantial benefits in return. Both development interests and indigenous groups-and the two are not always mutually exclusive-have every right to be disappointed. 41. The government foreshadowed changes to the right to negotiate when it released its exposure draft of government amendments to the Native Title Amendment Bill 1996 last October. Since then, the decision in Wik has made the need for change more urgent, as mining and certain compulsory acquisitions on pastoral lease land may now also be subject to the right to negotiate. 42. The government proposes to remove the right to negotiate where it is inappropriate because of the nature of the rights to be granted, the minimal impact on the land, or the limited native title rights that can exist. However, the basic procedural rights of native title holders are protected. The bill also streamlines the right to negotiate process, so reducing unnecessary delay; and, where appropriate, devolves greater responsibility to the states and territories to deal with these matters. 43. While the right to negotiate will generally remain on vacant crown land, the bill will enable a state or territory to apply its own regime in relation to mining and relevant compulsory acquisitions on areas described as 'non-exclusive or reserved areas'. These are basically areas of land or waters in relation to which, if native title exists, the native title holders do not enjoy a right to exclude others from the land or waters, and have, at best, only co-existing rights. Where the Commonwealth minister approves a state or territory regime under the act, the right to negotiate will to acts covered by the state or territory regime. Of course, the act will require that the alternative regime satisfies specific criteria, including the provision of procedural rights for native title holders equivalent to others with like interests in the land, and compensation for any loss or impairment of native title rights. Agreements 44. Currently, the act provides for an essentially 'claims driven' regime for dealing with native title issues. In the government's view, insufficient support is given to resolving native title issues by agreement-often the speediest, lowest cost and least divisive mechanism. The bill therefore sets out a comprehensive framework for reaching consensual arrangements between the parties. While the government encourages agreements, nobody will be forced into such agreements. However, the bill does provide a number of mechanisms to facilitate the use of agreements as one way of resolving native title issues. Procedures 45. Amendments to the act in schedule 2 of the bill address the constitutional issues raised by the High Court's Brandy decision. Many are the same as those included in a bill introduced into the House at the end of 1995 by the previous government, and in the bill introduced into this House last year. 46. These amendments set up a new system under which native title, compensation and non-claimant applications will be filed in the Federal Court. They will then be referred to the National Native Title Tribunal for notification and mediation, where such a reference will assist the parties to come to an agreement about native title. In all cases, however, the determination of claims will be made by the Federal Court. The bill confirms that the court will consider all the claims for native title in relation to particular land or waters, and once a determination is made it will be good against the whole world, and generally subsequent claims cannot be considered. no longer apply Registration of claims 47. Arising out of the Brandy case the bill will separate the consideration of a claim by the Federal Court from the registration of the claim on the Register of Native Title Claims. Registration will be the prerequisite for native title claimants to access the special right to negotiate, gain statutory access rights and enjoy certain other procedural rights under the act. The Federal Court will determine all claims, whether or not they satisfy the registration test. 48. There is wide agreement that the current lack of an effective threshold test for access to the right to negotiate is an issue which must be addressed to maintain the right balance between the legitimate interests of native title holders and the need to ensure that economic development is not impeded. 49. The bill sets out the more demanding conditions which must be met if the benefits of registration are to be enjoyed. The Native Title Registrar must be satisfied that prima facie each of the elements of a claim can be made out before it can be registered. The registrar must also be satisfied as to a range of matters which have a bearing on whether a claim is credible and well researched. The registrar must take into account information provided by the relevant state or territory government as to whether the land is or was subject to freehold, or other extinguishing grants, and if it is or was, the claim will be ineligible for registration. 50. By operation of the transitional in schedule 5, the new test will be applied as a matter of course to claims made on or after 27 June 1996, the day on which the predecesland sor to this bill was introduced. All claims will be tested when a section 29 (right to negotilease ate) notice is given. As claimants will be protected. required to provide greater detail for the purposes of claim registration, the bill increase by one month the time within which a claimant is able to lodge a claim in response to a section 29 notice in relation to a mining proposal, or a non-claimant application. Representative bodies 51. The act currently provides for representaThere tive Aboriginal-Torres Strait Islander bodies to assist native title holders. The government is committed to ensuring that representative Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander bodies operate efficiently, effectively and accountty ably. The government considers that a robust representative body system will benefit only native title holders but all those who have dealings with them. 52. The amendments to the act in schedule 3 of the bill strengthen the representative body system by setting mandatory functions for the bodies and imposing nationally applicable standards of performance and accountability. These standards are based on models for other organisations funded by ATSIC practice for officers of Commonwealth instru57. mentalities. 53. It is the government's policy that the representative bodies should not have a monopoly role as representatives of indigenous peoples. However, the government does regard them as playing a key role and, as a consequence, Commonwealth funding for assistance to claimants will be channelled mainly through the representative body system. Benefits of the bill 54. Mr Speaker, the Native Title Act as amended will continue to provide significant benefits for Australia's indigenous people. Most significantly, co-existing native title over most of Australia's rangelands will be recognised and protected. This is in addition to any native title over land that has never provisions been alienated. 55. The opportunity for native title holders to prove their claims in relation to pastoral lease is assured. Following registration of a claim, any existing physical access to pastoral land enjoyed by native title claimants is The 'right to negotiate' in relation to will mining development and certain compulsory acquisitions is generally retained where native title may be equivalent to full ownership, that is, on vacant crown land. Where rights are only co-existing rights, equivalent procedural rights for native title holders will be provided. are greatly expanded provisions for negotiated agreements among parties on all aspects of native title. The role of representative bodies is clarified and enhanced. 56. This bill provides much improved certainfor agricultural and pastoral lessees. There is confirmation that most agricultural leases not have extinguished native title due to the exclusive possession nature of those leases. In relation to pastoral leases, all primary production activities, including associated and incidental activities, are protected. Lessees will have security that their rights continue to prevail over those of native title holders. Legal aid will be more readily available to pastoralists and other persons responding to and on best native title claims. Transparency and predictability of processes for the resource industries will be enhanced and new projects will be able to proceed without undue delays or restrictions. Mining titles issued between 1 January 1994 and 23 December 1996 over pastoral lease land will be able to be validated. The revised registration test, which gives access to the right to negotiate, will restore a proper balance between the interests of native title holders and the need to ensure that economic development is not impeded. In recent years the resources industry and indigenous communities have been increasingly interested in negotiating agreements to the benefit of both sides. The government encourages this development and the bill facilitates such agreements. 58. The bill provides for a greater role for the states and territories in native title properly preserves state and territory prerogatives in relation to land and water management. Subject to conditions, states and territories will be able to put in place their own regimes instead of the right to negotiate on leased or reserved land. There are new provisions allowing equivalent state-territory bodies to take on the functions of the National Native Title Tribunal and the registrar, but still operating under the broad framework of the Native Title Act. Claims for native title will still be able to be heard throughout Australia by the Federal Court, allowing for a consistent approach to these cases. Conclusion 59. Mr Deputy Speaker, this bill responds to the community's call to the government to restore certainty to native title processes throughout Australia. From the outset the coalition identified the Native Title Act as unworkable and so it has proved. Too often, decisions, development and progress have been confused or have simply stalled. Disagreement and misunderstanding within communities has resulted. The Wik decision raised new uncertainties. This bill gives all parties a renewed opportunity to get on with the job and to build a more secure, certain and prosperous Australia for all Australians. 60. The bill responds to representations from a wide range of groups. The government believes that it has provided the opportunity for all key groups to have their say. However, the government has a responsibility to take the final decisions in the national interest. 61. In taking these decisions, the government's strategy has been built upon four key features: respect for native title; a careful balance among the interests of native title holders, pastoralists, resource developers and other Australians; reduced uncertainty; and improved workability of this vital piece of Australian legislation. 62. The government is proud to have developed a bill with these features. I commend it to the House and I present the explanatory matters. It memorandum to the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Melham) adjourned. Reference to Committee Motion (by Mr Williams) proposed: (1) That: (a) the proposed changes to the Native Title Act 1993 and other Acts contained in the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 presented to the House this day be referred to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund for consideration and report to the House by 27 October 1997; and (b) the terms of this resolution, so far as they are inconsistent with the standing and sessional orders, have effect notwithstanding anything contained in the standing and sessional orders. (2) That a message be sent to the Senate acquainting it of this reference to the Committee.",104
397,Mr MELHAM,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"The Native Title Act is an act which runs for 127 pages. It was an act that was challenged by the Western Australian government-in particular, the Premier, Richard Court, led that challenge-and the High Court upheld the validity of that act seven-nil. Today we have had tabled in the parliament a Native Title Amendment Bill that runs to 293 pages. We have tabled in the parliament an explanatory memorandum that runs to 385 pages. The problem for the government is that in its eagerness to suppress native title it actually threatens to create a legal environment vastly less certain for pastoralists and miners. The Labor opposition has major specific objections to the bill. Our intention is to seek amendments to the bill so as to deliver justice to Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders and genuine certainty and predictability for all stakeholders, especially farmers and miners. The Mabo decision was a watershed in the history of this nation. After 200 years of European settlement we became belatedly the last of the so-called 'new world' countries with a tradition of British common law to recognise the native title rights of our indigenous peoples. The decision was a milestone in the social progress that had already seen us abandon the White Australia policy, grant citizenship to indigenous Australians, address inequity in their education and many areas of active discrimination against them. In this decision the High Court had confronted a most insidious form of racism-the racism of denial and neglect. It was powerful, real and a symbolic gesture of respect from mainstream Australia to the culture of indigenous Australians and thus an important instrument of reconciliation. It was a triumph for basic decency and had an enormously positive impact on how we see ourselves and how others see us. The responses in this country to the High Court decision were as varied as the number of interest groups who saw themselves affected by it and political parties purporting to represent them. Conservative political forces started almost without exception from a position of outrage and denial-outrage at what they characterised as an activist High Court and denial of the legal concept that the court had seen fit to recognise. There was widespread misunderstanding of the implications of the decision for the security of title for the beneficiaries of crown grants, vesting and so on since European settlements. Equally there was the prospect of an avalanche of common law claims for title from indigenous groups that could go on indefinitely with no statutory framework and one piece of case law for guidance. The Native Title Act 1993 accepted the concept of native title and set out to address the attendant problems. It confirmed the validity of every previously issued title and set down a process for the expeditious and cost-effective handling of native title claims. The act introduced into this place represented the end product of negotiation and compromise with the key stakeholders. These were genuine negotiations, not just consultation and certainly not a crude sales exercise for a predetermined government position. Those negotiations in 1993 were carried on within the context of a relentless campaign of hysterical scaremongering and wilful misrepresentation conducted by political opportunists and interest groups who felt threatened by the native title concept. It should be said that the National Farmers Federation at that time was one of the honourable exceptions to this approach. Indigenous interests were not motivated to trust the motives or actions of any of the other interest groups, including the government. The government pursued the goal of delivering certainty, clarity and workability through the act. It set out from a position of respecting everyone's rights and the conviction that certainty for any of the interest groups could only come from consensus. Once the bill was in the parliament it was clear that the conservative coalition opposition was intent on playing a totally negative role. No provision, no clause, irrespective of the attitude of any interest group, was to receive the support of the coalition. They did everything in their power to deny the community an instrument for certainty and just resolution of claims. There was no evidence of respect for the existence of native title. There was no evidence of respect for the need for governments, farmers, miners, pastoralists, the judiciary and others to have a workable instrument to deal with apparent and real legal uncertainty. Despite their worse efforts, the 1993 bill was enacted by the parliament, albeit in an imperfect amended form. In return for accepting this process and the legislated validation and confirmation of existing titles for nonindigenous Australians, indigenous people were given the right to negotiate, a land fund for those with no prospects of successful native title claims, and the promise of a social justice package that has yet to be delivered. This government will not deliver that social justice package; they have already said that on the record. They are now setting about taking away the right to negotiate in any meaningful form. With a range of common law cases already in train, and with entirely new structures set up to deal with a new and difficult range of problems, the implementation of the act would always be difficult. It was equally acknowledged that courts were yet to rule on critical issues such as the continued existence of native title on pastoral leases. That view was far from settled. Back in 1993, the decision was to leave that view to the courts to decide. Wik had commenced in June 1993. That was the deal that was done with all the stakeholders in 1993. The High Court has now decided. The 1993 parliamentary record shows an interjection by me when the then Leader of the Opposition was asking a question of the then Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. That interjection indicates that I was one who believed that native title could coexist with pastoral releases at that time. So the issue was not settled, and it was not one way. Practical experience and subsequent court rulings have meant that it is inevitable, and it would be inevitable, that the act would need to be amended at a relatively early stage. The timing needed to be such that cases being heard were not compromised and that the teething problems that did not need to be legislatively revisited were worked through. In 1995, the then Labor government were moving to introduce amendments to deal with developments to that point in time. They constituted a measured response rather than an overreaction to sectional pressures. The initiatives lapsed, of course, when we left office. However, a transformation appeared to be taking place in the body politic. Australia went to the polls in 1996 with a coalition as enthusiastic converts to the concept of native title and with a newfound respect for the Racial Discrimination Act. As with so many other issues, it was a case of, 'Elect us, trust us and we won't change a thing.' The coalition policy says: The Coalition approach to Aboriginal land rights is based on the following: a) the fact of Native Title where it has survived; b) the Constitutional protection given to all property interests against Government resumption without compensation; c) the prohibition of racially discriminatory measures or laws; and d) the special relationship between Indigenous people and land which is at the core of Indigenous culture. In Government, the Coalition will: a) retain the Native Title Act; This amendment bill does not retain it. It guts the Native Title Act. Their other promise was to: c) respect the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act; This bill does not do that, and it is significant that this bill was not introduced, as our bill was, under the special measures section of the Racial Discrimination Act utilising section 8(1) of the Racial Discrimination Act and, therefore, relying on the external affairs power. This bill, as the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) concedes and the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) concedes, is introduced under the races power. The races power does support our Native Title Act, but it supports it on the basis that it is a benefit to indigenous Australians, that it is consistent with the special measures approach as contained in the Native Title Act as it was originally enacted. The noise of the bells is now deafening with what purports to be the government's legislative response to the Wik decision. The Wik proposition is that native title might, in theory, persist on some pastoral leases but that any such title was emphatically extinguished or suppressed to the extent that it was in any way inconsistent with a pastoralist's enjoyment of his or her title. Wik confirmed pastoralists' title yet, with the hysteria that went on after the Wik decision, one would think that it was the exact opposite. The 1997 amendment bill appears to be a gross overreaction to the Wik decision, to the Brandy and Waanyi decisions and to experiences of difficulties in the field. It is excessively complex, convoluted and riddled with internal contradictions. I repeat: we now have a 293-page amendment bill to an original bill that has only 127 pages, and we have an explanatory memorandum that runs to 385 pages. This bill asks legislators in this place to accept on faith that massive schedules provided by the state governments of purportedly exclusive possession acts should be incorporated in this bill without a shred of corroborating evidence. It winds back the right to negotiate that Aboriginals gained as part of the 1993 package. It appears that the response from the government is to go for bucket loads of legislative extinguishment, and not just on pastbralleases. In a process where native title claimants have never had a right of veto, it removes the incentive for respondents to negotiate with claimants by giving Commonwealth and state ministers the right to intervene and make determinations for the respondents at the very beginning of the process. This bill massively increases the complexity and volume of work for court and tribunal registrars, but it is silent on resources for job. It is a recipe for bottlenecks and delays. It is a recipe for uncertainty. This amendment bill delivers uncertainty for pastoralists, uncertainty for miners and uncertainty for indigenous interests. The bill thumbs its nose at the Racial Discrimination Act and invites legal challenge under the constitution. It ignore's the Commonwealth's constitutional responsibilities and sets out to disadvantage indigenous people. This will, of course, be legally challenged. The Native Title Amendment Bill appears to corrupt the process. It is in this context that I support the bill's referral to a joint committee. The committee bears an onerous responsibility. We now have legislation. We now have an amendment bill. Not weasel words. Not a moveable feast. Not shifting sands. Not a 10point plan. But at least we now have something concrete to look at. This is the opposition's first opportunity to see the actual bill itself. The committee bears an onerous responsibility. It must make sense of this mess. It must fairly and dispassionately allow stakeholders a desperate last chance to be heard on the legislation's inadequacies. The committee owes it to the parliament and the people of Australia to be a servant of the parliament and an agent of an incisive and fair inquiry. It should be neither a lackey to the government nor an agent of obstruction. Members of that committee, burdened though some might be by declared or undeclared vested interests, must do what the government has failed to do. They must listen openly to criticism of the bill and show how it can be improved. The bill must be improved towards offering greater certainty, real workability and real equity for all stakeholders. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA BILL (No.1) 1997 Consideration of Senate Message Bill returned from the Senate with an amendment. Ordered that consideration of the Senate's the message be made an order of the day for the next sitting. NA (FOREIGN INCOME MEASURES) BILL 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Miles, and read a first time. Second Reading",111
398,Mr MILES,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister) (5.23 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Taxation Laws Amendment (Foreign Income Measures) Bill 1997 will amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to give effect to proposed changes to the rules for taxing foreign source income that were announced in the 1997-98 budget. Creation of a new list While the government considers that the broad structure of the system for taxing foreign source income is appropriate, it has become evident that there are problems with the list of countries used for providing exemptions. These problems have arisen because the current list of countries has been used for two distinct purposes that would have been best served by separate lists. The list has been used for the purpose of determining when income should be exempt from accruals taxation under the controlled foreign company and transferor trust measures. The list has also been used to determine when dividends and branch profits derived by resident companies should be exempt under the foreign tax credit system. The current list, comprising over 50 countries, is unsuitable for the purpose of providing exemptions from accruals taxation because there are many countries on the list that do not consistently levy tax on a comparable basis to Australia. A more robust list of closely comparable tax countries is required for the purpose of providing exemptions from accruals taxation. The accruals taxation rules apply to amounts derived from investments that are likely to be significantly influenced by taxation considerations. Amounts derived from these types of investments are treated as 'tainted' and include interest income, royalties and certain amounts derived from arrangements involving related parties. Accruals taxation of these tainted amounts is crucial to ensure investments offshore are not favoured over similar investments in Australia for purely taxation reasons. To address the problems with the current list, the bill will create a new list of seven 'broad-exemption countries' for the purposes of providing exemptions from accruals taxation under the controlled foreign company and transferor trust measures. The list will comprise Canada, France, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States of America. These countries will be designated in the Income Tax Regulations as broad-exemption listed countries. A shorter list will also make the task of designating tax concessions more manageable. Efforts to designate tax deferral opportunities in listed countries have had only limited success and are made more difficult by the large number of countries that must be monitored. The risks to the revenue associated with not designating a tax deferral opportunity are significant because tainted income by its nature can be diverted to take advantage of the opportunity. The current list of countries is also to be updated and will continue to be used for the purposes of exemptions under the foreign tax credit system. The current list is still considered suitable for the purposes of providing exemptions under the foreign tax credit system because the exemptions apply to amounts derived from investments that are less sensitive to taxation considerations. Countries that are listed for the purposes of the foreign tax credit system and not for accruals taxation purposes will be designated in the Income Tax Regulations as 'limitedexemption listed countries'. Countries on either the limited-exemption list or the broadexemption list will be treated as listed for the purposes of the foreign tax credit system. Branch profits exemption The bill will also modify the existing exemption under the foreign tax credit system for amounts derived by a branch in a listed country so that it can continue to apply to amounts derived through a branch in a limited-exemption listed country. The exemption will generally continue to be available for branch income other than tainted income. An active income test will be provided for branches in limited-exemption listed countries to help reduce compliance costs. The test will allow branches in these countries to derive up to five per cent of gross turnover as tainted income and still receive a full exemption for branch income. An exclusion from tainted income will also be provided for banking income derived by branches of Australian financial institutions in limited-exemption countries. This exemption is broadly consistent with the exclusion from tainted income provided under the controlled foreign company measures for subsidiaries of Australian financial institutions. There will be no changes to the treatment of branches in broad-exemption listed countries. These branches will continue to be generally exempt on amounts that have been taxed at full rates in those countries. Measures to help reduce compliance costs Another feature of the bill is amendments to help reduce compliance costs under the controlled foreign company measures. The amendments will help keep compliance costs for legitimate business operations offshore at a minimum and are largely made possible by the creation of a new list of broad-exemption countries. The amendments will make the following changes to help reduce compliance costs: the more generous active income test for controlled foreign companies in unlisted countries will be extended to companies in listed countries; the thin capitalisation and debt creation rules will no longer apply when calculating the attributable income of a controlled foreign company; the transfer pricing rules will no longer apply to non-arms-Iength transfers involving controlled foreign companies resident in same broad-exemption listed country; the rules for making elections under the controlled foreign company measures will be relaxed; and amounts derived by a controlled foreign company from an associated controlled foreign company resident in the same country will generally not be treated as tainted services or tainted rental income. General maintenance of the rules for taxing foreign source income The other amendments made by the bill are required for the general maintenance of the system for taxing foreign source income. Transitional rules will apply to deal with uncertainty arising from the dissolution of a number of listed countries. These rules will operate from the time of dissolution of the countries. Amendments will also operate to reduce the extent to which taxpayers may be disadvantaged by changes to the lists of countries. In this regard, the Czech Republic and Vietnam are to be added to the list of limited-exemption countries with effect from 1 July 1997. The bill will also repeal the exemption in the foreign investment fund measures for approved country funds. The exemption was originally provided to allow portfolio diversification in emerging markets that do not allow direct investment by Australian residents. There is now little justification for the exemption following recent reforms in emerging markets that have resulted in substantial investment liberalisation. Commencement The new two-list approach will generally apply from 1 July 1997 for the purposes of exemptions under the foreign tax credit system. To avoid the need to calculate attributable income for a part period, the two-list approach will first apply for statutory accounting periods of controlled foreign companies and years of income of transferor trusts commencing after 30 June 1997. In some cases this will defer revenue collected from the changes by up to 12 months. The measures to help reduce compliance the costs under the controlled foreign company measures which are made possible or are required because of the creation of a short-list for accruals taxation purposes will apply for statutory accounting periods of controlled foreign companies commencing after 30 June 1997. The measures to reduce compliance costs that are not linked with the creation of a new list will apply prospectively from the time the amending bill receives the royal assent. The transitional rules dealing with uncertainty arising from the dissolution of a number of listed countries will generally apply from the time of dissolution of the countries. The exemption from the foreign investment fund measures for approved country funds will be repealed with effect for notional accounting periods of foreign investment funds commencing on or after 1 January 1997. Consultation There have been two rounds of public consultation on the proposed changes. The first round was on policy issues following the release of an information paper by the Treasurer on 24 December 1996. Submissions were also invited on measures to reduce compliance costs under the controlled foreign company measures whilst still meeting the government's objectives for taxing foreign source Income. The views expressed in submissions on the information paper were taken into account in settling the changes announced in the 1997-98 budget. The measures in this bill for reducing compliance costs under the controlled foreign company measures were adopted following consideration of the submissions. The second round of consultation was on legislation giving effect to the changes that was released in draft form on 1 July 1997. The bill currently before the House is essentially the same as the draft bill. Revenue implications The likely annual revenue gain from the changes made by this bill is estimated to be $125 million in the 1998-99 financial year and $100 million for subsequent years. It is expected that a significant proportion of the revenue will arise due to changes in investment behaviour and be collected under the general provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 rather than directly under the controlled foreign company or transferor trust measures. Full details of measures in the bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum circulated to honourable members. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr MCMullan) adjourned.

His words were that the honourable member for Batman 'confronted the Hansard reporters'. I acknowledged to the House that I would investigate the affair, which I did not think was of any great import or significance. I have received a written report from the Chief Hansard Reporter and I am completely satisfied that no confrontation of any nature occurred. I am totally happy, from the report that I have received, that no infringement of the standing orders occurred in any way whatsoever.

401,Mr ALBANESE,ADJOURNMENT,"Grayndler) (5.34 p.m.)I rise to pay tribute to Senator Bruce Childs who next week completes a distinguished parliamentary career. Bruce has been a true representative of his class. After joining the ALP at 16, Bruce was apprenticed in photoengraving, before becoming a clerk at the printing chapel at 17. He went on to become an official of the printing union, culminating in his election as secretary in 1965. He was instrumental in the formation of the PKIU the following year. After federal intervention in the New South Wales branch, Bruce became the Assistant General Secretary of the New South Wales ALP in 1971. In this position he broke new ground. There were no precedents and no-one to seek advice from in what was often a hostile environment. However Bruce, as he did throughout his entire political life, continued to take a principled stand and to earn the respect of all those around him, whether they agreed with his political position or not. Bruce was elected to the Senate in 1981 and played a prominent role as a convener of the national Left and the parliamentary Left throughout the period of the Hawke and Keating governments. Bruce played a critical role in the positive achievements of those governments. Often in a minority position, he always took a principled view, always advocating the collective position that the Left chose him to lead and always taking a constructive view of the role of Labor in government because, above all else, Bruce Childs is a thoroughly honourable man. Bruce has been throughout his life a genuine collectivist. He has believed that the movement is bigger than any individual. His values of democracy, respect, integrity, hard work, collectivism, modesty and loyalty are ones that humble those of us who see him as a role model. He is much loved by all of those who have been privileged to work with him and learn from him. Bruce has always been there to guide and support younger members such as me and others in the movement, even when we have not always deserved that ongoing support. He has particularly encouraged young women to advance themselves in the movement. Bruce is a true believer in the principles action embodied in the ALP's socialist objective-that progressive change comes not just through the parliament but through trade union action and through ongoing action organised by community groups. His leadership in organising the Palm Sunday peace marches of up to 170,000 people is practical evidence of his ability to unite and inspire often disparate groups in pursuit of common objectives. He is the ultimate democratic facilitator. He is, of course, retiring only from parliament, not from politics. I am sure that Bruce, as head of the Evatt Foundation in Sydney and convener of the national Left, has many more constructive years in politics. He has been involved in a broad range of issues in the party, in the trade union movement and in organisations as a parliamentarian, such as UNICEF and Parliamentarians for East Timor. He has been involved in a range of issuesoften taking on issues that other people would duck because they were hard ones. Bruce has never squibbed it. Bruce has always been prepared to take up that principled position. I think that those of us who remain in the parliament would look forward to the function that Bruce had last night, when parliamentarians and friends and family gathered to farewell him. If when we leave we can leave with just a portion of the respect which was shown to him last night, then we will have been fine representati ves of the labour movement, as Senator Bruce Childs has been. Tariffs: Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Industries",117
402,Mr BOB BALDWIN,ADJOURNMENT,"Tonight I rise to speak about the hypocrisy in the TCF debate. In the early 1970s, the TCF industry was flourishing in Australia. However, in 1974, when the Whitlam-Labor government oversaw the wages explosion combined with a 25 per cent tariff cut and currency revaluation, our competitive advantage was well and truly obliterated. Imports began to flood in and jobs were lost. Analysts have stated that between 1972 and 1978 over 1,300 factories-32 per cent of of the TCF industry-closed down. Fifty-thousand jobs were lost; that is, some three in 10 TCF jobs were lost. In other words, Labor instituted a TCF plan of 1989 which featured, amongst other things, the removal of quotas and the removal of jobs. I personally believe, as the Industry Commission states in its draft report, that the removal of quotas had a substantial impact on the local domestic TCF sector, greater still than the tariff wind-down. To add salt to the jobless wound, in 1991-in the midst of the most protracted post-World War II economic downturn-Labor revised this plan, accelerating the rate of tariff reduction and continuing the plan beyond 1995. As a result of these poorly thought out plans, more jobs were lost and more industry went offshore, with the telltale figures between 1987 and 1994 highlighting the TCF factory employment falling by some 32 per cent, overall employment in the sector diminishing by some 20 per cent and manufacturing output down by 24 per cent. That is history. They are the facts. It was not helped along by the former Prime Minister, who stood up and proudly displayed the fact that he wore an overseas suit, a Zegna suit, instead of supporting Australian industry. The reason I stand up here tonight to talk about the TCF industry is that I am surprised by the hypocrisy. Today I have heard the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) called names such as the 'battler for burgundy' and the 'master of disaster'. I do not know whether they are true or not and I do not wish to call him those things in the course of this discussion, but I think he is a hypocrite because of the fact that he deserted the TCF workers. He was the person who put his foot on the accelerator in driving down the TCF industries and people out of jobs. If that is not bad enough, I draw the House's attention to a speech given on 26 March in 1992 by the former member for Hunter, who said: 'One step forward and two steps back.' If someone is 25 stone and wants to lose weight, he does not try to run a marathon and kill himself. If we want to make our manufacturing industries more competitive, we do not drive them at a pace which kills them stone dead. Our plan, which stages the reduction in protection for the TCF industries, is too rapid and too harsh. I admit it is no easy task to judge the pace of reform, but quite clearly we have failed. He was in government and he said, 'We have failed.' Did his colleagues listen to him? No. As he came out to support the TCF industry, did his colleagues listen? No. What did they do? They accelerated the rate of winding back the tariffs. Then on 30 September 1993, that same member for Hunter came out and stated again that he was losing jobs-some 700 jobs throughout the Hunter in companies such as Depict Fashions and National Textiles. If it is so important for the member for Hotham-the alleged 'battler for burgundy', who cannot even be bothered drinking Australian wines and supporting that industry-to come out now and support the TCF industry, why didn'the listen to his own members? Why didn'the listen then and protect those jobs? The bottom line is that they deserted their union membership. All they wanted is their union dues. The only time they went into the factory was to collect union dues, never to protect jobs. So all of this screaming about protecting jobs is nothing more than wind. The member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) gets up and screams about the TCF industry, but did he defend the jobs of his Gloweave workers in Brunswick? Where was he? There was not a word in the last parliament about the protection of those jobs for those people. So the crying and screaming in this parliament is nothing more than a sham, but a sham is what they are on the other side of the House. They do not deserve to be in parliament. They do not deserve the support of the TCF industry. They got the barrel roll out at the last election because they could not deliver to those people who depended on them. They depended on them, but the Labor Party ignored them. (Time expired) Education: Government Schools Childs, Senator Bruce: Retirement",118
403,Mr JENKINS,ADJOURNMENT,"At a time when the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone) goes about the country running down government schools and her junior minister is going around touting spurious figures for increased T AFE places-which even his own department describes as 'problematic' - the nation is facing a crisis in education. There is no mystery about what has caused the crisis. It has been government neglect. In Victoria, the crisis has been sharpened by the combined impact of state and federal funding cuts. A recent report on the resourcing of primary schools by the Victorian Primary Principals Association indicates that in 1981-82 the education budget in Victoria represented 31.2 per cent of the state budget. In 1996-97, it represents 18 per cent. Victorian government primary schools received the lowest government spending per student in Australia. In the two years to 1995, the Kennett Liberal government reduced inschool spending in primary schools by 11 per cent from about 4,300 to 3,800 per student. When Jeff Kennett was elected, 39 per cent of classes had more than 25 students. Two years later, 60 per cent of classes contain 25 or more students. Cuts have seen a decrease in the provision of both curricula and extracurricula activities. Victorian parents now pay an average of 30 per cent of a school's operating costs from voluntary contributions and locally raised funds. This is a scandal. As the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) indicated not so long ago, the Australian tragedy that a person's educational opportunities are dictated by their postcode is increasingly true. The savage cuts to the education budget have not impacted equally. The capacity of school communities to respond to the cuts is also unequal. Disadvantaged schools have been the hardest hit. The impact of cuts has been exacerbated by the reduced capacity of relatively disadvantaged school communities to respond. In recent times, matters have reached a high farce in Victoria. In 1996 Dallas North Primary School, which is in the northern suburbs of Melbourne, was selected to participate in an early literary research project, ELRP, conducted jointly by the Victorian Department of Education and the University of Melbourne. For participating, the school received additional resources-O.4 of an EFT-in the form of an experienced teacher to coordinate the project. The school was also given leave credits to allow those class teachers involved the opportunity to undertake regular professional development as part of the program. The Dallas North Primary School ELRP team has achieved spectacular results by any standards. The University of Melbourne believes that during 1996 literacy levels at the school were improved by 20 per cent when compared with the reference group. In addition, the school has provided professional development for more than 300 teachers from all over Victoria and has also shown the program in operation to principals and teachers from interstate. Based on these excellent results, Dallas North Primary School won the 1997 teacher of the year team award announced recently. This award acknowledges the professionalism of the ELRP teachers and highlights the value of the additional resources dedicated to the program. At this point, however, the story becomes a tragic farce. Despite these outstanding achievements and the critical need for ongoing resources from the Victorian government, the school council has recently been informed that the funding and resource provision given to the school for the program is to be slashed in 1998. The school council has written to Minister Gude, pointing out: If thisthe cutis the case then we believe that the program will be unworkable in its present highly effective form because the school could not support the program from its present school global budget. What a travesty it will be if the program ends next year. What a cruel joke. Dallas North Primary School has suffered successive cuts in funds. The school council rightly believes that it is unable to do more for less. Victorian primary principals estimate that it costs about $60,000 per year to operate a literacy program in a school of 350 students. In terms of the amount that has been ripped out of the education budget in Victoria in the last 15 years, this is peanuts. Having proved that ELRP works, I call on the Victorian government to fund it. If Jeff Kennett will not fund it, I strongly urge the federal minister to stop bagging state schools and to provide the funds needed. Under the heading of economic rationalism"", we cannot again allow Australia to be a place where only the wealthy have the opportunity to receive a quality education. In the brief few moments allowed to me, I would like to join with the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese) in what he had to say about Senator Childs. Across the parliament, in both houses, Senator Childs is greatly respected. Within this parliamentary party, the whole caucus also respects him. He has been a fine ambassador for the parliamentary left. We will miss him, but I know that he will continue to contribute to the Labor movement. Northern Territory: Speech by the Member for Kalgoorlie",119
404,Mr DONDAS,ADJOURNMENT,"Today I rise to discredit the completely offensive claims about the Northern Territory made in this place by the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell). I was stunned by the breathtaking ignorance shown by the member in relation to the Northern Territory. In a speech that was supposedly about forest industries, the member for Kalgoorlie launched a savage attack on the territory. The member called the Alice to Darwin rail link uneconomical. He stated that the $100 million Commonwealth contribution to the railway was a stunt in light of the upcoming election campaigns in the Northern Territory and South Australia. As most members would be aware, I have made many comments in this House in regard to the Alice Springs to Darwin railway. It has been on the drawing board since 1911. It is not a stunt. It certainly is a major project worthy of financial support from the Prime Minister's Federation Fund. The railway will tum Darwin into a major transport hub servicing Asia. It is a project that will provide jobs and investment for the whole country, not just the territory. The Northern Territory and South Australian governments would not have committed $200 million to the project as a stunt. The railway would not have bipartisan support unless it was a viable proposition. I always thought the member for Kalgoorlie was in favour of economic development. Certainly, when he was in government he extolled the virtues of government investment in infrastructure projects and industry. This makes his attack on the railway not only fanciful and unfounded but also out of character. His comments get worse. The member for Kalgoorlie then said, 'Tasmania is much more important than the Northern Territory to the welfare of this nation.' What an outrageous statement. The comment shows a complete lack of knowledge of the economic contribution territorians make to Australia. I am happy to take the opportunity to educate him. Territorians are the most productive people in Australia. While accounting for only one per cent of the nation's population, we produce 1.6 per cent of Australia's exports. In 1996-97 this totalled more than $1 billion worth of exports. It is important to note that the population the Northern Territory is less than half that of Tasmania. Despite this small population, the value of territory exports per capita last year was almost double that of Tasmanian exports. Let me repeat that: the territory has a population of less than half of Tasmania's, but exports almost twice as much as Tasmania on a per capita basis. The ignorance shown by the member for Kalgoorlie reminds me of the exploits of the former Labor member for the Northern Territory Warren Snowdon who would try to imply that the territory was a burden on the national economy. As we are all aware now, this is untrue. Perhaps the most offensive statement made by the member for Kalgoorlie yesterday was when he said: ... what we ought to do with the Northern Territory is get realistic and whack it up amongst the surrounding states. That is the best solution for the Northern Territory. It would solve quite a few problems and, believe me, it would be much more economical. That is an appalling statement made by a member of this House. I could forgive his comments if they were ignorant, but I am quite sure that they were not. Of course, we are aware that the member for Kalgoorlie is trying to set up a party called Australia First. I hope that he does run candidates in the Northern Territory, because with thoughts like that his party will not get one vote. It reminds me of comments made by a former Prime Minister of this country when he said that the best way to see Darwin is from 35,000 feet up in the air, flying to Paris, sipping champagne. And look where he is today. I am very disappointed that the member for Kalgoorlie chose to denigrate the Northern Territory in the federal parliament. When he does get around to seeing the territory-I do not think he has been there for a while-I am quite sure that he will be very impressed with the productivity and the energy that territorians have in promoting Australia by way of tourism. I am not sure of this fact, but I think the Northern Territory gets more international tourists than Western Australia does. I understand the Western Australian government is now trying to promote Western Australia. We of have been promoting the Northern Territory for a number of years, and our runs are on the board. The federal member for Kalgoorlie should come and have a look at what we are doing in the Northern Territory. Our mining industry is on the increase; our cattle industry is on the increase. (Time expired) Pharmaceutical Benefits Childs, Senator Bruce: Retirement",120
405,Mr MOSSFIELD,ADJOURNMENT,"-During the winter break my office sent out to hundreds of our pensioners and veterans their updated information kits. These kits are well received and in fact are anxiously awaited. They are able to inform our veterans and pensioners of their rights and also o- their current entitlements. Many of these penSIoners and veterans phone my office to express their appreciation after receiving their kits. This recent dispatch of kits was no exception. My office received many calls from our elderly citizens, but this year they had a sting in the tail-not for me or the opposition but for the Howard government. These important members of our community are extremely annoyed with the Howard government. Their major concern, of course, is the cost of pharmaceuticals and various cuts in benefits. These important citizens have given their very all to our community of Australia over the years. They have worked hard and have paid millions of dollars in taxes to the government. They have no negative geared or used family trusts, nor have they been paid a stipend by their company. They have in fact been the battling backbone of our nation, and they really believed John Howard when he seemed to be reaching out to them prior to the 1996 election. What a disaster it has all been for them. They find to their horror that their regular often weekly visits to the chemist for theIr pharmaceutical needs are fraught with financial danger. They now seek advice not about the value of the treatment they need but as to which of several treatments they should get due to the cost increases. This means that they are not taking all of their prescribed treatments, only those that they can afford in a particular week. The phone calls and letters to my office are extremely critical, with people saying such thing as: 'We think that such cuts to benefits on those pensioners who are ill and/or infirm and most in need of such care are disgraceful and contemptuous actions of economising by the government.' The ignoring of these comments by the government will be done so at its own peril. I guess that, in my electorate of Greenway, when the election comes it will mean that my margin will grow substantially. However, for the government, despite its current enormous majority now, reactions of people such as the elderly and veterans w-ll see these margins dramatically reduce, and In fact many seats will return to the Labor Party. It is indeed breathtaking to see the extent to which the Howard government has lost faith with the voters of this nation. It matters not where you travel, the tune is the same: 'They promised the world and delivered a desert island.' The veterans and pensioners are writing to and phoning my office saying, 'We hope that you and other members of parliament will take every opportunity to criticise and condemn these actions by the government, not only in parliament but also in the media.' I have done just that and will continue to draw to the attention of my electorate the shameful attacks that have been launched upon so many of these less able members of our community by this uncaring and ideologically driven old-style tory government. Who would have thought that children and grandchildren of those who lived through the 1930s Great Depression would inflict such constant and vigorous pain on those who became the backbone of Australia through wars and good times? The government will not be allowed to an.d escape the wrath of the voters from all avenues of our society as we move closer and closer to the next election day of judgment. Those with children in need of reasonably priced child care, those out of work, those who have had to sell their family home to get into a nursing home and those who have watched as their elderly relatives have been dogged by higher and higher prices for their pharmaceutical necessities of life will remember on election day, and we will see that they remember. They will exact their ultimate get square. Who would have thought that a Howard government with a stunning majority could be even contemplating a one-term government? Do not blame us; simply blame yourselves. I would also like to join with other members of this parliament in wishing Senator Bruce Childs all the best in his future endeavours. Wynnum Medicare Office",122
406,Mrs WEST,ADJOURNMENT,"I wish to place on the public record my utmost concern, dismay and anger at the proposed closure of the Wynnum Medicare office. This office is part of our government's rationalisation process, as the number of daily account claims is only 147, not the 400 required as the minimum number. The fact that 38 of the 43 medical practitioners in the area bulk-bill was evidence also given by HIC as the reason for this regional closure. I am aware that the savings made by the closure will offset the regional and rural facilities, but the extenuating circumstances of Wynn urn should be taken into account. Wynnum is a special case. I call on the HIC to reconsider this closure, as the impact affects many of the elderly who have limited mobility. In the interests of supporting local employment and keeping valuable funds in the local area, I call on the HIC to reconsider the closure of the Wynnum Medicare office. Wynnum is an outpost. It is not a through suburb. Although public transport is available, it takes a bus change to get to Carindale, and to get to Capalaba is just not worth contemplating. If the closure is not able to be prevented, the first option it has been suggested that a chemist claims facility be set up. The suggestion has been well received by some chemists. There would, however, be no cash refunds. A drop box for the Chamber of Commerce to service has also been suggested. However, again there would be a delay in receipt of the refund in cash. Failing that, I would appreciate consideration of an option that takes into account the special needs of this wonderful community, many of the residents of which will suffer from the change in the current situation.",123

ministerial responsibilities. (2) For each body referred to in part (1), (a) who are the members and (b) when does the term of each appointee expire.

Where no expiry date is indicated, the appointment is on-going. [The attachments are too lengthy to be published in Hansard. Copies are available at the House of Representatives Table Office.] Orange Juice Concentrates (Question No. 1965) Mr Barry Jones asked the Minister for Trade, upon notice, on 25 June: (1) What was the total value of imports of orange juice concentrate in (a) 1994-95, (b) 1995-96 and (c) 1996-97 and what are the projections for (d) 1997-98, (e) 1998-99, (f) 1999-2000. (2) What share of the total market has been taken by imports in (a) 1994-95, (b) 1995-96 and (c) 1996-97. (3) Which nations export orange juice concentrate to Australia and what is the percentage share in each case. (4) Do tariffs apply to orange juice concentrate imports; if so, what. (5) Are Australia's tariffs on orange juice concentrate the lowest in the world. Mr Tim Fischer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The total value of imports of orange juice concentrate in 1994-95 was $22,185,154, and in 1995-96 was $38,117,153 (Source: ABARE). Data for 1996-97 are not yet available. Brazil 19,335,531 Cuba Israel Japan Netherlands New Zealand Korea United Kingdom United States of America Value of Imports 22,185,154 Source: ABARE Report No. 2902 (4) A tariff of five per cent applies to all imports of orange juice concentrate. (5) No, Australia's tariff on orange juice concentrate is not the lowest in the world. While some countries have tariffs much higher that Australia (for example, Korea's tariff is 50% and Brazil's tariff is 14%), the US tariff of US8.78c/kg translates into around 6% for the most competitively priced Brazilian orange juice concentrate, and will be less for more expensive juice. Countries like Singapore, Hong Kong and Brunei have a zero tariff on frozen unsweetened orange juice concentrate. Canada's tariff for unsweetened orange juice concentrate is zero, and the tariff for sweetened orange juice concentrate is 2.8%. Australian exports of orange juice concentrate have grown from $All million in 1993/94 (7.6 million litres) to $AI5.8 million in 1994/95 (9.7 There are no official projections of future imports. Imports of orange juice concentrate are made on the basis of commercial decisions which are determined by, inter alia, domestic demand, the availability of domestic produce and world prices. (2) Statistics on the total Australian orange juice market are not available. As all imports of concentrate are imported in frozen form which can be stored for lengthy periods it would not be accurate to assume that imports in anyone year are reflected in the market share for that year. (3) The two major sources of orange juice concentrate are Brazil and the United States. The following table provides details of imports of orange juice concentrate into Australia for the latest two financial years for which data are available: 1994-95 1995-96 Imports % of total imports Imports % of total im$A $A ports 87.2 32,690,405 85.8 481,225 2.2 454,354 1.2 6,333 0.03 185,491 0.5 25,104 0.11 273,833 0.7 508 0.002 4 neg. 3,072 0.3 10,027 0.03 2,336,453 10.53 4,399,670 11.5 38,117,153 million litres) and $AI9.2 million in 1995/96 (12.8 million litres). Major markets are Hong Kong, Japan, New Zealand, Singapore and Malaysia. At the same time, Australia's exports of fresh oranges have increased from $A68.6 million in 1993/94 (88 m kg), $A80 million in 1994/95 (92 m kg) to $A81.5 million in 1995/96 (88.6 m kg), with Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and Hong Kong again being the major destinations.

Austudy (Question No. 1970) Mr MCMullan asked the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 25 June 1997: (1) Have students who received the independent rate of Austudy in 1995 and who did not receive the independent rate of Austudy in 1996 due to their requirement to complete compulsory work experience components in 1996, been ruled ineligible to receive Austudy in 1997. (2) If so, will Austudy regulations be amended to remedy this consequence; if so, (a) when will changes be made and (b) will the changes be retrospective to enable the students referred to in part (I) to receive Austudy payments in 1997. Dr Kemp--The Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (I) In the 1996-97 Budget the Government announced that the Austudy age of independence would be raised from 22 to 25 years with effect from I January 1997. This measure was implemented by amendments to the Austudy Regulations. ""Grandfathering"" provisions were put in place so that students who received Austudy at the independent rate in 1996 because they were over 22 years of age could continue to receive Austudy at the independent rate. Some students were on the independent rate of Austudy in 1995 because of their age but, because their course required them to undertaJce a ""work experience year"" in 1996 rather than full time study, were not eligible for Austudy in 1996 and so were not covered by the grandfathering provisions. (2) (a) and (b) I have agreed that students who were receiving Austudy at the independent rate in (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) (g) (h) (i) Health Insurance Commission: Staff (Question No. 1974) Ms Ellis asked the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 25 June 1997: How many (a) full-time, (b) permanent part-time and (c) temporary staff were employed in the 1995, but did not receive Austudy in 1996 because their course did not allow them to undertake full time study in that year, should also be covered by grandfathering provisions. That is, they can be assessed as independent students free of parental means testing. Amendments to the Austudy Regulations to give effect to this change will be prepared as soon as possible. The amending Regulations will apply from I January 1997. Students in this group who apply for, or have applied for, Austudy in 1997 will be able to get the independent rate when the amending Regulations are Gazetted. Child Support Agency Clients: Southern New South Wales (Question No. 1973) Ms Ellis asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 25 June 1997: How many Child Support Agency clients reside within the postcode areas of (a) 2606, (b) 2607, (c) 2900, (d) 2901, (e) 2902, (f) 2903, (g) 2904, (h) 2905 and (i) 2906. Dr Kemp--The Assistant Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: The number of Child Support Agency clients in certain postcode areas is shown in the following table: Post Code No. of CSA Clients 2606 363 2607 380 2900 79 2901 44 2902 855 2903 527 2904 482 2905 1517 2906 670 Tuggeranong, ACf, office of the Health Insurance Commission on 2 March (i) 1996 and (ii) 1997.",174
456,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,ATTACHMENT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: At 2 March 1996 there were (a) 691 full-time, (b) 24 permanent part-time and (c) 60 temporary staff. At 2 March 1997 there were (a) 641 full-time, (b) 25 permanent part-time and (c) 44 temporary staff. Macedonia: Embassy in Australia (Question No. 2000) Mr Jenkins asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 26 June 1997: (1) Further to his answer to question No.636 (Hansard, 4 October 1996, page 5146), have there been changes in the preconditions set by the Government for full recognition of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia since he gave that answer. (2) Further to his answer to a question without notice (Hansard, 23 June 1997, page 5743) from the member for Adelaide, what form have the consultations with the Greek and Macedonian communities in Australia taken. Mr Downer-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Australia has already extended full recognition to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (15 February 1994) and established diplomatic relations on the basis of non-resident accreditation. The preconditions for the establishbuilding ment of a residential Embassy by the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in Australia remain as set out in the answer to question No.636 (Hansard, 4 October 1996, page 5146) (2) I met with representatives of the Greek community in Australia on 29 October 1996, and with representatives of the Slav-Macedonian community on 5 November 1996 to explain the Australian Government's position on the establishment of an Embassy in Australia by the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and to hear community views. I discussed the matter again with representatives of the Australian Hellenic Council on 23 June 1997. Bringing Them Home: Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (Question No. 2024) Mr Campbell asked the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice, upon notice, on 26 June 1997: (1) Further to his answer to my question without notice to him (Hansard, 25 June 1997) concerning the ""Bringing them home"" report, is he able to say whether the source of the leaks was Sir Ronald Wilson or the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. (2) Did he have to threaten the Commission to have the report delivered promptly. (3) Did he receive the report on 6 April 1997 but did not release it until 2 June 1997. (4) Is selective leaking of the report the result of a 2 month delay in releasing it. Mr Williams-The answers to the Honourable Member's questions are as follows: (1) I am unable to say. (2) The Commission supplied necessary copies of the Report required for tabling promptly upon request. (3) I received the Report on 5 April 1997 and tabled it on 26 May 1997, the first appropriate date and within the time required. (4) The Report was tabled on the first appropriate sitting day following its receipt. I am unable to say why the Report was leaked. Department of Communications and the Arts: Building Projects (Question No. 2033) Ms Ellis asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 26 June 1997: Has the Minister's Department overseen major project design competitions since 1987; if so, when were the competitions held and what were the competition conditions. Mr Warwick Smith-The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: I am advised by the Department of Communications and the Arts that it has not overseen (any) major building project design competitions since 1987 other than the competition to select a design team for new national cultural facilities on Acton Peninsula which the Department is coordinating on behalf of the Construction Coordination Committee (CCC). The CCC was appointed by me to oversee implementation of the project. The Committee, chaired by Mr Jim Service AM, Chairman of the National Museum of Australia (NMA), includes representatives from the Australian Institute for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS), the National Capital Authority, ACT Chief Minister's Department and the Department of Communications and the Arts. The competition conditions were tailored to the specific circumstances, including the desire of the CCC, representing the clients, to have the primary role in the selection of a design team. The Councils of the NMA and AlATSIS are responsible under the respective legislation for the affairs of the organisations, and will ultimately be responsible for operating and maintaining the facilities. The CCC has always sought to have architectural advice, and have appointed architects recommended by the Royal Australian Institute of Architects, Mr Michael Keniger and Mr John Davidson AM, as advisers to the competition. Mr Keniger is the Head of the Department of Architecture at the University of Queensland and Mr Davidson has been involved as a professional competition adviser on many design competitions. It is a limited design competition, the final result will be to select a design team, not a final design. The winner will be engaged on the project to work with the stakeholders to undertake the detailed design and documentation. Department of Social Security: Building (Question No. 2035) Ms Ellis asked the Minister representing the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 26 June 1997: Has the Minister's Department overseen major building project design competitions since 1987; if so, when were the competitions held and what were the competition conditions. Mr Ruddock-The Minister for Social Security has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: No. Department of Health and Family Services: Building Projects (Question No. 2039) Ms Ellis asked the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 26 June 1997: (1) Has the Minister's Department overseen major building project design competitions since 1987; if so, when were the competitions held and what were the competition conditions.",189
457,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,ATTACHMENT,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) My Department has held one building project design and construct competition since 1987. Requests for a proposal for the design and construction of the Therapeutic Goods Administration Annex in Symonston ACT, were sought in June 1995. The competition conditions required construction companies to provide a fixed fee for the design and construction of an office block that met the Department's requirements as specified in the building brief. Department of Veterans' Affairs: Staff (Question No. 2063) Ms Ellis asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 26 June 1997: (1) How many persons were employed on a (a) full-time, (b) part-time permanent and (c) casual Projects basis in the Minister's Department at 30 June 1997. (2) What is the Minister's Department estimated recruitment intake for 1997-98. (3) How many positions will be available for successful candidates from the Recruitment Services Australian Public Service Entrance Test. Mr Bruce Scott-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) 2374; (b) 98; (c) 212* * 'casual' employment has been interpreted as temporary employment (2) The Department will be recruiting staff in 1997-98 to cover specific Budget 1997-98 initiatives. Other staff will be recruited to cover vacancies that are deemed to be essential to the Department's operations. This recruitment will, however, take place as part of a structured, net reduction in the Department's staffing levels. It is not possible to identify a firm recruitment target for the organisation in the 1997-98 financial year. The Department's estimated recruitment intake, which will be subject to monitoring and review over the year, is approximately 90. (3) The number of positions available for base grade staff from the Recruitment Services Australia Public Service Entrance Test cannot be determined at this stage. However, it would be limited to necessary replacement of staff promoted or who leave the Department.",191
