5,Mr WENTWORTH,Unknown,"I move, temporary under the provisions of standing order 130: That the petition presented today by me relating treatment of Jews in the Union of Soviet Socialist be printed. In accordance with the requirements of standing the order 1311 now indicate the action I propose to thatBudget take and inform the House thereof. I propose to States unlessin there submit the petition for examination Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence with from the provisions of thisthat a request that it explore ways and means of particular measure, therefore,legislation. obtaining from the Ambassador of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics some advice as to the the policy of his Government on the matters raised they in the petition and also in regard to the reality of them freedom of religious worship and instruction for not use that the Jewish and other religions in the USSR. Question resolved in the affirmative. Human Rights NA NA NA Mr E. G. Whitlam-I ask the Prime Minister a question. Since most and perhaps by now all of the Premiers have publicly expressed objections to many features of the States and Local Government (Personal Income Tax Sharing) Bills, has he decided to hold the Premiers Conference they seek, or will any of his Ministers have a conference with the relevant State Ministers to discuss the features to which the Premiers object? Will the conference take place before the House resumes the debate on the Bills? therightof Jews in the USSR.",20
6,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,BILLS,"I thank the honourable gentleman for the question because wish to it gives me the opportunity to clarify one or two matters in relation to this issue. There will not be of a special Premiers Conference about the matter to Zion; and I do not really believe there is a need for other Ministers to meet to discuss the issues conreligion cerned. I believe there has been a good deal of misunderstanding about the provisions. Indeed, one or two States have criticised a provision that discrimiwould be very much in their own interests. I refer to a provision in the Bill which will entitle States and to share in the personal income tax collections of the Commonwealth. There has been some objection to clause 5 of that Bill which provides that the Treasurer could declare a surcharge or a rebate. The purpose of that is that if there is some need in the future for a change in levels relating to economic management, that temporary change should not to the be used either to increase or decrease the shares RepubUcs going to the States. For example, if, as in the honourable gentleman's time, there were a minibudget on some occasion in November following and there were tax concessions made, would fact reduce the share going to the were in the legislation a by the Joint power designed to exempt particular matter as a I see this protection for States, a very necessary protection so that can have certainty as to the funds coming to ate in any one year and budget on an appropribasis. I would also say that the Treasurer will power in any instance unless there has been full discussion with the States concerned in relation to it. I would have thought that those matters in relation to that particular tion had been made plain enough at Conference. Turning to the other legislation, and I am going to be exhaustive in the matters that the Premiers have raised because they will be dealt with in the debate in the Parliament, I can well see how, under clause 4 (b) (iv), one or two the Premiers might have believed that we were requiring under our legislation copies of all reports from the States grants commissions, whether those were reports that related to the distribution of funds that came from the Comstatutory monwealth or to other matters. Obviously it would be quite unreasonable for there to be provision in this legislation except that which related to funds which came from the Commonin wealth. That sort of matter will be clarified am grateful to the Premiers concerned for bringimplication ing it to the attention of the Commonwealth. I mention one other matter to give an instance of the sorts of things that have been raised the Commonwealth's reaction to them in clarifyremain. ing the issues. In the same piece of there was an allegation in relation to clause 6(1) (b) the Commonwealth Minister would Ukehave the power to veto or vet-change-the recommendations of States grants commissions. Our concern in these matters was to see that recommendations in relation to local governinterest ment were made by States grants commissions the Premiers agreed at the Premiers Conference interested and that they were proposed in a forum which local government bodies would be able to underthe stand, not by a mere administrative means withment-the out giving local governments an opportunity argue their case. We were concerned also to have a situation which people would know that Commonwealth the legislation. funds were, in fact, Commonwealth funds. For example, about 2 months ago-anyway , some considerable number of weeks ago-loca l government bodies in at least one State were Minister for Business advised that payments would be made. They cause of the consistently were being advised about Commonwealth funds. New But I do not believe anyone would have understood that these were Commonwealth funds undone less the details of what was happening were order known. We believe that the Commonwealth ought to be advised at the same time as make decisions about these matters so that the members of the Commonwealth Parliament who wish to do their jobs as members of the refers Parliament-this obviously applies to members from the Government side and from the Oppomission sition side-ca n advise local governing bodies their electorates. I think that is an appropriate objecand proper function in relation to funds which the Premiers come from the Commonwealth. We have, however, had a look at the wording not of clause 6 (1) (b). We have found that we are able to protect that wish, which I think is a perfectly proper thing to want to protect, and at the same time remove the suggestion that there will of be Commonwealth approval of the actual grants. This implies, of course, that the Commonwealth might upset the actual grants made by the States grants commissions. I believe that that would be an intrusion insofar as the grants are made by States grants commissions. I believe it would be an intrusion for the Commonwealth to any try to upset judgments made by those grants commissions. Since there can be an implication the wording of the legislation as it is that the and I Commonwealth might want to do that, that will be removed. The requirement that the Commonwealth should be advised of the funds before matters go out into the public and forum will remain. We believe that it ought to There are other matters but I shall not legislation mention them at the moment.",20
7,Mr COHEN,BILLS,You make Al Grassby look,21
8,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,BILLS,"I thought the the Leader of the Opposition was showing some in the answer to his question. If honouras able gentlemen sitting behind him are not in the details of this matter-it is quite all an important matter of administration between Commonwealth, the States and local governn I am surprised. I would have thought to that most honourable gentlemen would have been interested. When the debate resumes a Minister will make a fuller statement about the in clarifications which we are prepared to put into NA",21
9,Mr KELLY,NEW ZEALAND HORSES,"My question is directed to the and Consumer Affairs. BeZealand, will the Minister strong competition from see what can be to put a tariff on New Zealand horses into prevent them running faster than our home produced horses? the States Mr HOWARD-The question catches me very much off balance. I do not think that the problem to which the honourable gentleman can, on this occasion, be blamed upon the activities of the Industries Assistance Comas has been the practice in respect of a lot in of other things. The honourable gentleman's customary courtesy in these matters has not been apparent on this occasion and therefore I am unable to offer him the type of helpful response which I normally give when he asks questions on a subject which is very dear to his heart.",21
10,Mr SPEAKER,NEW ZEALAND HORSES,I am afraid the Minister weighed in light. NA,22
11,Mr UREN,URANIUM,"I direct my question to the Prime Minister and preface it by referring to an earlier question seeking a wide public debate on the mining and export of uranium before a Governwhich ment decision is made. Now that the Fox ComI mission has recommended such a public debate, will the Prime Minister give a firm a wide public debate will take place before any Government decision is made to mine or export Australia's uranium?",22
12,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,URANIUM,"The report by Mr doubt Justice Fox is obviously a very serious and weighty report and I do not believe it is one about which the Government or the Opposition ought to make hurried or unthought any kind. The Government has made a relatively brief examination of some aspects at this point. It has not come to the stage of making any decisions about any aspects of the report. When it has carried its own examination further, the Government will state quite clearly what its attitions. tude will be. NA",22
13,Mr CHIPP,URANIUM,I should Uke to ask the Prime and Minister an almost identical question same subject as the question asked by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Will the Prime Minister give this House an assurance that the contents and recommendations of the Fox report will be fully debated in this House before Government decision is taken or announced?,22
14,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,URANIUM,"I have no doubt that that at the appropriate stage the matters will debated fully in this House. Other than that, have nothing to add. NA Mr E. G. Whitlam-Might I ask the Prime Minister a question on the same subject. He know that last Thursday his Minister for to Environment, Housing and Community ness Development issued a statement that the vironmental Government 'will be looking very closely at the first report of the Ranger Uranium Environof mental Inquiry and will be announcing its cisions'. I believe I have quoted the precise words, and the Minister nods his agreement. ask: Will the Prime Minister that the Government accepts the Commission's recommendations that there should be ample time for pubUc consideration of the report and for debate upon it and that no decision should be taken on the report until there has been an opportunity for the usual democratic processes to function, including parliamentary debate? The right honourable gentleman will recall that I am quoting the Commission's own words in its recommendation. In view of the unreasonably short time, as the Commission has expressed it, was set for preparation of thisfirstreport, ask how long the Government proposes for the pubUc consideration of the report and debate on assurance that it in the Parliament?",22
15,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,URANIUM,"If the honourable gentleman will have a Uttle patience, I have no that aU these questions will be answered. The Government is not going to prerempt its own position when it has not fully considered the matters. When it has considered them it will decisions of make its views known. TRADE UNIONS: POLITICAL STRIKES",22
16,Mr CONNOLLY,URANIUM,"I direct my question to the Minister for Employment and Industrial RelaHas the Minister seen recent Press reports that the Leader of the Opposition encouraged trade unions to engage in poltiical strikes? Does the Minister regard industrial stoppages, bans the like on political or non-industrial issues on the as a legitimate use of union power?",22
17,Mr STREET,URANIUM,"Of course I am concerned at the trend to pursue poltiical or non-industrial objectives by the threat of or direct industrial a action. I am greatly concerned-and I believe everybody in this community should be-to find this technique apparently now has the apbe proval, indeed it seems the encouragement, of I the Leader of the Opposition. The list of actions of this kind is quite extensive and includes trade, mining and major building projects. During the Medibank strike-agai n a strike of a poltiical nature-Australia n workers lost a staggering will $50m to $60m, approximately, in what seemed be a futile exercise. There is a greater awarein the community today of the social and enissues and, of course, that is a highly desirable thing. But any trade union is made up members with widely varying political views deand imposing on them by industrial means the pursuance of poltiical objectives cannot possibly I accommodate the wide variety of views held by assure the House union members. I am concerned to see Australia's export trade threatened by actions of this kind. I am concerned to see that Australians continue to be unemployed when they could get a job if, for example, bans on building projects did not exist, Apparently the Leader of the Opposition sees the role of the union movement as taking away from the Parliament those things which are properly the responsibiUty of Parliament. Unions are an important part of Australia's social and economic Ufe. But they do not have, nor should they have, any God-given right, or even arightconferred by the Leader of the Opposition, to usurp the democratic process and to take away the proper role of Parliament. It is entirely irresponsible to suggest that they should do so. NA",22
18,Mr LIONEL BOWEN,INSTITUTE OF CRIMINOLOGY,"I draw the attention of the Attorney-General to the report of the Institute of Criminology which indicated that the cost of crime last year was approximately $950m. In view of this enormous amount of money, would the Attorney-General give serious consideration to funding pilot projects in the States whereby people whofirstcome under notice are given assistance to rehabilitate themselves by expert guidance without being committed to penal institutions in thefirstinstance?",23
19,Mr ELLICOTT,INSTITUTE OF CRIMINOLOGY,"I thank the honourable member for his suggestion and also for his reference to the report of the Institute of Criminology. The report did not deal with the whole cost of crime. As we know this is a serious problem. I think that $960m represented only the direct cost, that is to say the direct loss that red through crime plus the cost of law and order and pubhc safety. I think that the honourable member will agree that the Institue of Criminology does a very remarkable job in this area. The Institute was set up as a result of a decision, think, of the MCMahon Government and it came into operation during the period of ihe Labor Government. The Institute does considerable work in the criminological area with a view to dealing with the sort of question that the honourable member raises. I will draw the honourable member's question and suggestion to the attention of the Institute and my Department. NA NA",23
20,Mr HASLEM,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,"I address my question to the Treasurer and refer to the honourable gentleman's Budget Speech in which he said that the present exemption from payroll tax in the Australian Capital Territory would be increased from $20,800 to $41,600 per annum to bring the Australian Capital Territory into line with neighbouring States. Is the Treasurer aware that New South Wales and Victoria have recently made decisions to increase the exemption to $48,000 and to phase out the exemption of $48,000 for employers with payrolls in excess of that figure at the rate of $2 for every $3 of the excess? The Treasurer would be aware that the Government has in the last few months rather abruptly brought Canberra into line with the rest of Australia. When there are a few benefits around is he going",23
21,Mr SPEAKER,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,Order! The honourable m e m be r wiU not debate his question. He may s e e k information.,23
22,Mr HASLEM,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,Will the Treasurer bring Canberra into line with the rest of Australia in respect of payroll tax?,23
23,Mr LYNCH,AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY,"I thank the honourable member very much for the question. I can certainly pay credit to the honourable gentleman and also to his colleague, Senator Knight, for having made quite sustained and robust representations to me in relation to this matter. The honourable gentleman has referred to the concessions which were outlined in the Budget Speech. I can say to himwith a degree of satisfaction to him, I am surethat as a consequence of the submissions he has made the Government will bring the Australian Capital Territory payroll tax arrangements into line with those existing in New South Wales. NA",23
24,Mr SCHOLES,HANDICAPPED PERSONS,"Is the Treasurer aware that occurincome tax concessions for the care of handicapped persons are aUowed when the persons involved are over 16 years and in receipt of a Commonwealth pension? Is he also aware that the level of the Commonwealth pension is such as to I debar any claims being made in respect of such a handicapped person? In view of the conditions laid down for claims, under what circumstances can a person claim as a tax deduction the expenses incurred in the care of a handicapped person?",23
25,Mr LYNCH,HANDICAPPED PERSONS,"As I recall the information provided by the honourable gentleman in his question, the facts he has put down are certainly accurate. I will discuss the position which he posed with my colleague in another place and provide the honourable gentleman with a written reply. NA",23
26,Mr FALCONER,HANG GLIDING,Does the Minister for Transport recall that earUer in the year I asked him a question about the safety of hang guder operations? Has he noted with concern the Australian number of fatal or serious accidents involving hang gliders in recent months? Can he inform the House whether he has any plans to deal with the situation?,23
27,Mr NIXON,HANG GLIDING,"It has been my wish to allow venience involved hang gliding to remain in the same sport requirements, category as scuba diving and things of that worthwhile nature. Unfortunately, because of the number of produced? hang glider accidents and the fact that recently taxpayers' money was involved in assisting a hang glider who got into difficulties, I have forced to reconsider the position. The hang gliders' association has drawn up some volunownright.To tary regulations. Those regulations apply to those people who are members of the association, but of course the regulations do not have regulatory force to those who are not the association. I propose, therefore, to discuss with my State colleagues what ought to be done about this matter. NA",24
28,Mr LES JOHNSON,DEFENCE SERVICE HOMES,"I address my question assertion to the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development. Can the Minister widespread confirm or deny widely published reports that Government intends to renegotiate the Comyear's monwealth and States Housing Agreement with a view to increasing interest rates for welfare waste? housing, raising interest rates for defence service homes, selling off land for defence service homes estates and doubling the period of service establish eligibility for defence service homes? honourableought",24
29,Mr NEWMAN,DEFENCE SERVICE HOMES,"The honourable member has some raised 2 main issues. One is the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement. It is well known that we are negotiating with the States to the Act embodying that Agreement a better in regard to the provision of public housing the States. There has been some speculation the newspapers on defence service homes. I answered a question I think from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition on this matter. I gave him a categorical denial that I or my colleague the Minister for Defence had recommended that int est rates should be set at one point, I think, be) j«r the bond rate. We are looking at the monwealth and State Housing Agreement. The honourable member should not beheve what he reads in the newspapers about the other issues raised. AUSTRALIAN BUREAU OF STATISTICS Parliament,",24
30,Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE,DEFENCE SERVICE HOMES,"I address my question half to the Treasurer. Following recent comment and criticism from business leaders relative to Bureau of Statistics, can the Treasurer advise whether the Bureau would be prepared to circularise private industry and business requesting details of relative costs incurred in answering the Bureau's questionnaires and the inconin attending to the Bureau's as well as their comments as to the nature and accuracy of the figures",24
31,Mr LYNCH,DEFENCE SERVICE HOMES,"The Government Statistician, of been course, administers an independent statutory authority. He therefore exercises judgment in his that extent I will refer the honourable gentleman's question to him for response. NA members of Mr MORRIS-Has the Prime Minister received a written request from the Minister for Transport asking him to participate in an extravagant ceremony at or near Albury-Wodonga to mark the erection of signs distmguishing the national highway route? Does he agree with the by the Minister for Transport in his letter that the introduction of the signs warrants publicity? Given the heavy reduction his in escalation grants for road funding in this Budget, has the Prime Minister agreed to the request? If so, how does he justify such to Shortland Mr NIXON-The honourable member for to talk to his colleague the member for Newcastle and learn of the facts of life. The fact is that following the declaration of the national highways programs, which came out of the report instituted by make a previous Liberal-Country Party Government Act in 1972 and picked up again by the Whitlam for Government in 1973, a number of national highin ways were declared around Australia by the former Minister for Transport, the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Charles Jones). I have to say that he shows a greater degree of knowledge in the area of transport than the present incumbent of the shadow transport portfolio on the front bench. As a result of the Comnational highways being declared and as the State Ministers for transport have .agreed that due recognition ought to be given by the setting he up of signs along the national highways to indicate that these are in fact national highways funded completely and totally by the Federal I thought it appropriate on their beto issue an invitation to the Prime Minister to take part in thefirstceremony.

Is there a strong desire for improvements in the standard of radio and television without poltiical control or bias? Does the Green report tackle these problems?

That report has been considered by the Government and, as the Prime Minister and have both said, it is the intention of the GovernPremier ment to see the legislation complete its passage through the Parliament this session. So the honourable gentleman can expect debate on the matter to resume in this House in the near future.

Further, does the Prime Minister agree that the provision of opporthe tunity for pubUc comment would be consistent with the claims made by conservationists in respect of Government action on the Fox report?",26
39,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,IMPACT REPORT,"When there is an inquiry and a report of this kind, I think it important that we do not try to resurrect the cumstances so that there is an inquiry and report on the report itself. People have had opportunifirstly, ties to put their views and to provide information the Fraser Island inquiry. As I understand it, thunthere has been an opportunity to rebut any views that have been put. I have had representations, not from governmental sources but from other sources, which would seem to be assertion not based in fact in relation to the Fraser Island I urge caution against creatine circumin stances in which by one means or another, after an inquiry has been properly constituted and has sought evidence from all those who might be available to give evidence and who would want give evidence, people are given a second go at the conclusions of the inquiry. If that were to I happen in all such matters as the Fraser Island inquiry and report, quite clearly the business of the Commonwealth would be clagged up with inquiry after inquiry and inquiry on top of inquiry. I cannot see that this would really serve the purposes of good government. Having said that, I think it is important obviously that there be discussions with the a Queensland Government. I have already been in touch with the Premier of Queensland. I have sent him a message today suggesting that there I should be discussions with him and such other of Ministers as may be concerned. If he is able to come here, the Government will welcome those discussions being held here. If he is not able to come to Canberra, the relevant Ministers will be and ready to go to Queensland to discuss these matters with him at almost immediate to notice. Discussions with the Queensland Government are, I think, of the greatest possible Again I would say that the issues in this matter are very serious ones. They are obviously serious issues for the company and the people employed by that company. They are vastly serious for the very many environmentalists who believe that important environmental issues are involved in Fraser Island. When discussions have been held with the Queensland Government, I hope it will be possible to say adsomething more about the attitude of the Fedfor the proper eral Government. NA",26

I remind him of the congratulatory message which he sent last week to Mr Hua Kuo Feng on, as the Prime Minister put it, 'his recent appointment as Chairman of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist is Party'. I ask: On what other occasions has the cirPrime Minister sent messages of congratulation to persons achieving positions of leadership in, foreign communist parties and, secondly, foreign democratic parties? Would it not in any case be more appropriate if he signed such a message as 'Leader of the Fraternal Liberal Party' rather than as 'Prime Minister of Australia'?",26

I now call the right honourable the Prime Minister.",27
42,Mr MALCOLM FRASER,MESSAGE TO MR HUA KUO FENG,"It is a common international practice that on accession to power in various countries messages of congratulation be sent to the leaders of those countries. I do not know whether any particular distinction has been made concerning the philosophy of the governments in the countries concerned. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has said on many occasions, and I have said also on behalf of the Government, that the Government conducts its foreign relations with other countries on the basis of their publicly stated attitudes, not on the of internal ideology. If our foreign relations were to be conducted on the basis of internal ideology, discourse between nations of the world would be markedly reduced. Such a system just would not work. I do not think there is anything of substance in the question. CHILDREN'S TELEVISION",27

Is the Minister aware that people are held in Singaporean gaols without trial?

Would it be political interference in the operations of the ABC for the Minister to stop such a practice forthwith?,27

49,Mr HURFORD,BILLS,"My quesuon is directed to the Treasurer and is supplementary to the first or question asked by the Leader of the Opposition. Is it a fact that the proposal that the Treasurer may by notice in the Gazette declare any income tax as a special surcharge gives him complete control over the level of financial assistance available to State and local governments and thus results in grave uncertainty for those levels of government? Is it a fact that the particular clause in the legislation before this House does not so much protect the State and local governments, as has been suggested by the Prime Minister in his answer, but hinders them in their planning to provide essential services in the future? If such a surcharge has to be introduced would it not be more appropriate to introduce it by legislation rather than by regulation? Is this proposal an example of the Government's decision to use regulations rather than bring matters out into the open in this Parliament?",27
50,Mr LYNCH,BILLS,"I find it difficult to accept the bonafidesof the former Administration in relation to Commonwealth-State relations because its members know full well the extent to which they denied the States responsibility and maintained a very hard line with regard to a number of areas of spending by attaching detailed conditions to them. I would have thought that the question about clause S of the States (Personal Income Tax Sharing) Bill was adequately and amply answered by the Prime Minister. The provision will allow between the Commonwealth and the States the clear and explicit understanding which was reached during the Premiers Conference and that is that the yield or cost of special surcharges or rebates appUed in appropriate circumstances by the Commonwealth will not be included in the basefigurefrom which the States and the local government entitlements will be calculated. It does, as the Prime Minister observed earUer to day, protect the States. The honourable gentleman will be very well aware that in the second reading speech I made it perfectly clear that the Commonwealth would not use clause S without due notice to the States because we believe in the process of consultation. In fact, any declaration by any Treasurer of any special surcharges or rebates without some prior processes between the governments would be completely contrary to the various agreements with the States concerning consultation and for the review of tax-sharing arrangements generally. So far as I am concerned it is a protective mechanism for the States. We believe it is the most appropriate mechanism to be employed in the present circumstances. I believe that the pubUcity surrounding this matter has been subject to considerable distortion and beating up in the media. NA NA",28

68,Dr CASS,INQUIRY,"In speaking to this matter I think it relevant that I should read from the social welfare poUcy of the Liberal and National Country Parties. I think it is relevant to be aware of their aspirations before we consider this matter. I shall quote a few perINQUIRY tinent points. It states: Our social welfare policy seeks to enhance the security, dignity, self-reliance and well-being of Australians . . . We recognise different levels of need and base our priorities on them. The first priority is to meet basic physical needs, including nutrition, shelter, health and social security. I cannot disagree with any of those statements. The Australian Labor Party certainly would not disagree. It continues: Our desire to give power and responsibUity back to and groups in order to effectively meet the of social welfare, distinguishes our policy from Manager of alternative approaches. This could be good; it could be sinister. Item 7 the objectives is: Ensure that the real value of welfare programs eroded by inflation. That is a line ideal. I do not dispute that either. The Parties' policy further states: Retaining the present over-70 pension and child ment. (At the appropriate time, we will abolish test on the 65-69 aged group pensions). The next item is: Protecting benefits from erosion by inflation through auto-20 matically adjusting benefit levels every 6 months, to movements in the consumer price index. There is a lot more, but I thought that they were most pertinent to the topic we are discussing afternoon. They are veryfinewords, but unfortunately represent no overall policy. The results (Senator of inquiries so far ordered by the Government pay two-thirds may never be released to the organisations carno ing for the aged or to spokesmen for the aged such as the Australian Pensioners Federation, or for that matter to the general Australian comthis munity, who after all supply the funds. As the Holmes-Sax recommendations for Medibank were that the Commonwealth should pass half its responsibilities to the private funds, we may piece expect that in Une with the Fraser Government's nise carefully policy it will try tofindsomebody else, be it the to detect further States, local government or voluntary to take over poUcies for the aged. It may even believe that market choice in aged accommodation and nursing homes will determine what should be financed. Then we have the Bailey Committee's terms reference, which particularly emphasised that ways were to be found of eliminating and conBut soUdating programs for more effective deUvery by States, local government and voluntary ject organisations. That statement relates to the intentions expressed in the Government's pokey. It could be good; it could be sinister. The of reference suggest that continuing machinery would co-ordinate social policy development Commonwealth level, but there is no pokey of without financial backing and if the Commoncondition wealth Government is not prepared to back its own poUcies and is concentrating on block grants rather than specific funding there will be no such tiling as Commonwealth Government pokey. did The reaUty is that the opportunity being taken the Government in its new federalism poticy to hand back responsibilities to the States is just way of opting out of responsibiUty for declining to develop a real poUcy for these problems. The National Consultative Committee on Social provided. Welfare is a token body giving advice only and oftaking only single references. There is no suggestion that it wiU take the place of the Social Welis not fare Commission, which the Labor Government set up and which was in a position to take a continuing over-view of poUcy. I come now to some of the specific changes of endowpoUcy, changes which have been brought about the means by the present Government as compared with the programs implemented by the Labor Government. In regard to buUding programs, on May the Government halved the buUding according subsidy for aged persons accommodation. Instead of announcing this in the Parliament as a further economy measure, detectives discovered it buried on page 9 of a statement circulated the this next day by the Minister for Social Security, Guilfoyle) which made a casual reference to the fact that the Government would of the buUding costs. There was mention of the fact that the amount had been reduced from a subsidy of four to one to a subsidy of only two to one or of the significance that would have for councils and reUgious and charitable agencies and thousands of aged persons waiting for housing. It was a deliberate of cost cutting which the Minister hoped would escape unnoticed. We now have to scrutiany statement the Minister puts out examples of attempts to mislead agencies, the Australian community. On 20 May, in the same circulated statement, the Minister announced that only $45m would be aUocated for aged persons accommodation. of That is a reduction of $26m from the amount allocated in the last Labor Budget in 1975-76. the Minister did not announce it as a drop. Instead, she gave a 3-yearfigureof $225m, subto Budget aUocation. It is the same old precaution, the same thing as was contained in the poUcy statement: 'We are going to abolish the terms means test when we can'. I recall that Mr Menzies-h e was only Mr Menzies at the time at when hefirstproposed it-propose d the aboUtion the means test. It was never done because the imposed was 'when appropriate'. It was never appropriate for the Liberals to do it; it never will be. In announcing on 29 July detaUs of grants contained in the $45m, the Minister still not admit to reducing the money but tried to by make things look better by announcing that in the 22 years since the beginning of the aged pera sons program in 1954,62 530 elderly people had been given accommodation, while in the next 3 years of Liberal Party rule 15 000 beds would be But she did not say that in the course of Labor's 3 short years in office we managed to provide 16 895 beds without resorting to selfconsequence, adulation or self-deception. The Minister had tried earher to practise the same deception trick by talking about the amount of money provided, but the shoddy arithmetic was pointed out she has not tried to repeat it. Incidentally, action was taken at a time when under the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act, 658 projects valued at approximately $270m were awaiting approval, and under the Aged Persons Hostels Act 249 projects valued at $ 160m were awaiting funding. I have mentioned the question of pensions and been allowances, and pensions for 69 years, free of means test. It was 1975-76 Hayden Budget to abolish the means information centres help mainly the test for all persons over 69 years of age. No anHenry Bland has advocated that perhaps nouncement was made by die Government that this benefit was going to be cut out, but early 1976 its omission was noticed and then we started to ask questions. The matter of funeral sufferers benefits is a good example of deception by the called Government. It was only because legislation was was meant required to abolish this benefit and some Liberal eral Party'sby senators would not go along with it Government was forced to back down. On the seems to make the present andmeans. question of pension changes, in awarding of consumer price index rises to pensioners the Government has watered down its election undertaking. The increases will in May and November each year, whereas ing the election campaign both the caretaker Minister for Social Security, the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Chipp), and the caregeneral taker Prime Minister were on record as promischarge ing increases immediately after the announceMedibank, ment of consumer price indexfigures.In his Press statement on 8 December 1975 the caretaker Minister for Social Security said: We propose to bring in legislation which will increases in pensions to be made instantly and automatically as soon as the new index is announced. In Rockharnpton on 6 December the Prime Minsioners. ister was reported in the following terms: Mr Fraser said there would be no need to wait 3 with Labor's proposed adjustment for price index rises. That statement appeared in the Sun News Pictruth torial on 8 December. In spite of that specific promise, the November increase will reflect the increases for thefirsthalf of the calendar year and the May increase those of the second half the previous year. Reasonably, pensioners see no reason why they should have to wait 4 months longer than wage earners. The personal care subsidy has not been raised or indexed by the Fraser Government. As a reUgious and charitable organisations are being forced to drop theii; standards of service to the elderly in hospitals. The domiciliary care benefit has remained unchanged at $14. and Once again, the New South Wales Council on this the Ageing has produced a valuable study entitled Dedication which shows the difficulties faced by the famUies of these people. Something must be done. When will the Government act? Do we have to await endless secret reports which no one will ever see and still get no action? One could go on. The Australian Assistance Plan has scrubbed, and over 50 items scrapped dealt persons aged over aboUtion ofwith specifically aids for aged persons. Since the part of the been proposed toAssistancethe take its Plan, nothing has place. Community aged. Sir twenty of the regional offices set up under the Labor in Government should be closed down. The main will be the elderly. One could go on and on. Let me continue to touch on areas of soenlightenment. I presume that that is what 'turning on the Ughts' in the Libpropaganda in the last election, what that the enlightened Liberal legislation the Oddly, it future darker legislating for the for the aged. be given Let us consider Medibank. The Labor durGovernment introduced the faciUty for bulk bUUng for pensioners. A pensioner could consult any doctor in the community-specialis t or practitioner-and the doctor did not the pensioner but simply bulk bUled which meant that the doctor got 85 per cent of the scheduled fee and the pensioner paid nothing. The Liberals have changed that, to the detriment of the aged. They have retained the bulk billing facility, certainly, to guarantee allow that doctors wdl get their money-that is allbecause now the doctors are free to bulk bUl Medibank and at the same time to charge penOf course, the Government piously said that it hoped the doctors would not charge the pensioners, that they would waive theirrightto months ascharge the 15 per cent which they are now able to charge for anybody, including pensioners. The is that far too many-no t all-doctor s in the community are both bulk bUling and charging the pensioners not just the difference between the 85 per cent rebate on the scheduled fee and the of scheduled fee, but also the difference between the 85 per cent rebate and their fee which is often higher than the scheduled fee. So now pensioners are being caught as is everyone else in the community, and the doctors are being guaranteed at least 85 per cent of the scheduled fee because they use the bulk billing facilities. That is a gross distortion of the whole concept of what was after all-let us face it- a Liberal Government introduced pensioner medical scheme which the Labor Government under Medibank simply extended enabling the pensioners to consult any doctors, not just those designated as dealing with or treating pensioners. Finally, I would like to refer briefly to the problem of nursing homes. Just to show that I am not bringing up something that is nagging at myself but is also nagging at back benchers on the Government side, I pomt out that on 19 October the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Jull) asked the Minister for Health (Mr Hunt) the following question: Is the Minister aware that there are a number of residents of private nursing homes and their families in my electorate who are facing severe hardship because of the present level of subsidies for nursing homes? The Minister, of course, played for time. He said, yes, he was aware of it and that the Government was terribly concerned. Indeed, we all are concerned about this matter. He went on to say that the Government had set up a special committee to look into the problem of care for the aged and the sick. He said that the Government hoped to have the report of that committee soon but, of course, the Government was not going to do anything when the report was received. He said that the Government was going to wait for a few more reports because it thought it should look at all the reports dealing with all of these various problems. This is just another example of further delay and no action. The honourable member for Barton (Mr Bradfield), another Liberal backbencher, folto lowed that question by asking: Is the Minister aware that the delay in the presentation the report until next month may mean that it will be too to assist many hundreds of pensioner patients who will be forced from nursing homes due to the iacf that they longer meet the fees for their accommodation? Is aware that some nursing homes will have to dose, leaving many pensioners without any alternative accommodation? These are the problems facing the aged. are the problems that the Government is doing nothing about. All of the Government's prothe grams are effectively cutting down the little Labor Government was able to achieve. We are not claiming that we solved all the problems. we were trying to solve them. Every action the present Government has taken is simply reduchomes ing what we were doing, increasing the insecurity of the aged in the community and increasing the burden on families of the aged, so that in fact lights are going out for the aged.",29
69,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INQUIRY,Mr Lucock)Order! The honourable member's time has expired.,32
70,Mr LLOYD,INQUIRY,"The subject under discussion is the failure of the Government to provide adequate care for the aged. This is a rather curious subject for the Opposition to bring up because the provision of care for the aged is just not an overnight proposition. There are time lags and questions of planning, programming, implementation and so on. The present Government has been in office for less than 12 months. Therefore any criticism of the Government in respect of failure to care for the aged would be better directed at the Labor Government itself. When we look at the wording of the matter proposed for discussion we see that that is the only description that can be given to it. How many of the programs for the aged in our community were new ones instituted by the Labor Government and how many were really instituted or implemented by the previous Liberal Country Party Government? The answer must be that the great period of implementation of initiatives for the care of the aged came with the previous Liberal-Country Party Government. I believe that when the various planning reports and so on are received by the present Government we will see a resurgence of initiative and effective programming in this area. For the first time we have a government that is really reviewing what is available and is planning for the future. The honourable member for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass) mentioned 2 committees. He referred the Bailey Committee, which is a health and welfare task force and about which there are a certain number of rumours. He also referred to of the Holmes Committee on aged accommodation. late If one looks at the timetable for these committees can no it must be acknowledged that the Government is he also pressing ahead with its planning and review of these new programs in order to reduce what must in many cases be overlap and gaps. For example, These the Holmes committee was instituted only in June and is committed to all programs of care for aged. There are 2 discussion papers ready for the the Minister's concerned, namely the Minister for Health and the Minister for Social Security But (Senator Guilfoyle). The first paper is on the aged in the community in institutions-nursin g and so on. The second paper is on the construction of self-contained units and the capital costs of nursing homes. After these discussion the papers have been presented to the Ministers, they will be reviewed and discussed with the States and with some voluntary organisations in3 volved in this area, including the Australian Council of Social Services and the Council Aging. So much for the honourable member Maribyrnong and his criticism that these organisSocial ations will not have any input to the Governwhich ment's programming and planning. The recomthis mendations and options will come back to the Ministers and will be presented finally to Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). The this Bailey task force will also report to the Governnot ment. These reports are all listed for about end of this month. Therefore nobody can say that this Government is wasting time or procrasGovernment tinating in this important area of the most equate and efficient forms of care for the aged. If one looks at some of the present situations, which in a way were exacerbated by the Labor Government, one has to admit that there is room office. for further programming and planning. The honourable member for Maribyrnong mentioned that the present Government halved the building subsidy from $4 to $ 1 to $2 to $ 1 under the aged and disabled persons homes legislation. But what he did not mention was that the effecthen tive level of subsidy under the Labor dropped below 60 per cent. The subsidy was $4 to $1 theory only, because of the re-ceilings maximum subsidy limit and the upper cost limit. The maximum subsidy limit was not increased after December 1974. We all know what hapAustralia pened to building costs as a result of Labor imposed inflation. The effective level of subsidy to anybody building an aged or disabled perdid. son's home dropped to below 60 per cent by the time Labor lost office. What has this Governcent ment done? It has introduced a genuine $2 for subsidy on a genuine basis by indexing building costs on a quarterly basis with variations to allow for the inflation rate. This is something that Labor Government never did. This will guaranautomatic tee a level of subsidy to these organisations approximately 66 per cent. The subsidy will retain approximately its $2 for $ 1 value. Let us look at the reality of the situation. For all its talk the Labor Government's contribution fell to below 60 per cent. This Government will guarantee 66 per cent. So much for the rot talked by members of the Opposition. Let us look at the Labor Government's building program. We erty have heard a great deal of noise from members of the Opposition about this. During the 3 finan-situation cial years the Labor Party was in office-that the financial years 1973-74, 1974-75 and cussion 1975-76-$135 m was spent on aged and dislarge abled persons homes and hostels. This Governput ment has promised to spend $225m over the next years. This is a significant increase. It is no use saying that this is just a promise in the sense that on the the promise may not be honoured. When anfor nouncing the 3-year program the Minister for Security said that those organisations had been announced as being included in program could proceed with certain con2 struction. Arrangements have been made which the tie the Government to providing assistance in area. Therefore this is a real program and just pie in the sky. We have an amount of the $225m as against $135m. So much for Labor and its talk about building arrangements. The is also guaranteeing that any transadferrablerightsfor hostels will be honoured. Such a scheme was introduced on a Umited basis by the honourable member for MackeUar (Mr Wentworth) in 1972.1 support what Labor did in extending that transferability when it was in The honourable member for Maribyrnong also mentioned the great crime of this Government in deferring the half-yearly increase in pension payments from October to November and for the following 6 months through to May. to But who made thefirstdeferment? Thus Governin ment did not make that deferment. Thefirstdeon the ferment from October to November was introduced in the Hayden Budget last year. The people of Australia and the pensioners of want to wake up to this. This Government did not begin the deferment from October to November; the previous Labor Government The present Government did not introduce the proposition that pensions be tied to 25 per of the consumer price index. The Hayden $ I Budget introduced this. So much for the Labor Party's concern because that Party when in government introduced these things. For the first the time the pensioners of Australia are guaranteed 6-monthly adjustments, something of that the previous Labor Government did not do. We have honoured the promise of 6-monthly automatic adjustments. The legislation has gone through. In addition we have introduced one of the greatest pension reforms. I refer to the provision of an income test only on pensions. This has replaced I believe the most unjust form of propas well as income test for age and invalid pensions. This dicussion shows the topsy-turvy we have in this Parliament. I think 12 is months or 18 months ago we brought up for disa matter of public importance which to a extent was on the same subject as the one forward by the Labor Party today. The reaUty is that in an inflationary situation aged people are one of the groups that are most or affected. We made the point when we brought up the matter of public importance that Labor was not acknowledging the basic cause of the problems for so many of the aged in our society, and that is the rampant inflation that we this country which was introduced or let get of hand-whateve r you like-by the Labor aged Government The inflauon rate was 4.6 per cent when we lost office; it was 16 per cent or 17 cent when Labor lost office. The aged in our ciety are the people most affected by inflation. I refer now to nursing homes. I remember the earher days of the Labor Government known as the ideological period. It wanted to do away with private nursing homes altogether. The Labor Party applied certain restrictions to private nursforce ing homes. More than 50 per cent of the nursing home beds in Australia are private; they are government or deficitfinanced.Because of these Labor policy the number of nursing home beds in the private sector dropped by almost 2000 years of Labor Government. How absurd it is for anyone on the Labor side to talk of the problems of the aged infirm getting into nursing home commodation when 2000 of those beds were lostwas because of Labor policy. I believe the private sector is the most efficient section in the nursing home area. The Minister for Health (Mr Hunt) stated in answer to a question less than 2 weeks ago when the Holmes Committee reports to him and through him to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and Cabinet the nursing home benefits will be reviewed and he will consider a retrospecmiddle tive increase in this area which we know is of concern to many of the aged in this community. Let me remind honourable members that this not thefirsttime that the aged in nursing homes in this country have suffered a gap situation. gap commenced under Labor and grew to its present proportions. When we were in office tain schemes were introduced. There was to $6 left to a pensioner after payment of his nurssure ing home fees. That amount was reduced initially by Labor to $4 a week and then the homes were run at a deficit of $20, $30 and $40 a week depending on the State in which the nursing home was situated. I acknowledge that that situwliich ation stiU exists and is still of great concern members of Parliament.",32
71,Mr YOUNG,INQUIRY,It is worse.,34
72,Mr LLOYD,INQUIRY,"I do not believe it is worse, but I society. acknowledge that it stiU exists. The point I wish to make is that Labor supporters should denly say that this is a new problem that has hurt been caused by this Government, because the problem was there equaUy when they were in power. I believe they were less successful in this area in the 3 years they were in office than we have been. I believe the situation will improve have in with the release of the Holmes report. out The general need for planning in care for the is long overdue. This Government is at least starting to do something about real planning on per the divisions between acute hospital bed care, sonursing home bed care, various forms of aged persons accommodation and, as important as aU of them, domiciliary care arrangements. There is a great division between the present arrangements in the States on nursing homes. I believe it is quite correct for members of the Bailey task to talk to the States about the differentials in nursing home payments because the States, not through their own requirements, have caused differentials. It is no good members of the Labor Party saying that is wrong because they in 3 introduced the movement towards a uniform nursing home bed fee in which the principle, if not stated, was inherent. If one State wanted to achave a higher standard of nursing home care it up to that State to provide the extra money. Quite frankly I agree with what Labor did and I agree with what we are doing now in having the Bailey task force talk to the States on this matter. One wonders whether self-contained unit aged thatpersons accommodation can be allowed to continue in its present form. The self-contained sector has been heavily subsidised by both forms of government. In many cases the middle-class aged in our society have been able to transfer their responsibility for their aged parents or relatives to somebody else-to a certain extent is to the community and the government. I believe we have to look at new arrangements. Those The who can afford self-contained accommodation in their old age have to be encouraged by governcerment poUcy to do more for themselves in the be form of retirement villages. We have to make that the needy in our community have first priority for hostels, nursing home beds and self-contained accommodation. I challenge Labor to criticise that approach which we are now following. I challenge Labor to deny that the inflation it unleashed in this countiy, which reached to aU 17 per cent, has done most to harm the aged in our community. If members of the Labor Party are sincere in this matter of pubUc importance they must look at what they did in government and realise what inflation did to the aged in our not sud Mr HAYDEN (Oxley) (4.27)-The honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) deserves to be commended for seeking to mobilise a vigorits ous albeit unconvincing defence for a very weak case. With all honourable members. I noted that as the volume ofhis projection increased the conthe tent of what he had to say diminished. Most of his speech had a very large volume. The facts that the Government is winding back the clock on the provision of suitable accommodation, care and attention for the aged in the comnot munity. As has happened in so many instances since this Government came to office, a simple Government. principle is being applied affecting the condition and circumstances of the aged. The simple principle is that those who have in our community are best equipped through exwill help the Government perience to continue bearing it. Accordingly we poUcies find people like the aged continually disadvantaged by the winding back of the clock on the committee provision of services for them. Let us look at one instance and one instance alone to illustrate my point at this stage of speech. The Budget Papers show that in berra. 1974-75, $56.2m was provided by the Australian Labor Government for aged persons accommois dation. We increased that amount by nearly per cent to $94.2m in the following year. This year the amount being provided by the coalition Government is $66.8m, a reduction of 29 per cent at a time when costs are expected to escalate by at least 12 per cent this year. Quite clearly Government is not serious and does not expect be taken credibly when it argues that it is more generous than any previous government in the provision of attention for the needs of aged especially in thefieldof accommodation. Some spurious arguments were put forward by the honourable member for Murray in the course of his speech. He said that in the last 3 years Labor Government an amount of $217.2m was provided for accommodation.",34
73,Mr LLOYD,INQUIRY,I rise to a point of order. The figurehad was $ 135m.,35
74,Mr HAYDEN,INQUIRY,"I am sorry; I take the correcPrime tion. My point still stands with fuU force. honourable member said that in the next 3 years an amount of $225m will be provided by the aUtion Government under the aged and disabled persons accommodation program. He then made a spurious comparison, drawing attention to the amount that we provided under that program but neglecting to include the amount which we provided also under the aged persons hostels program, a program that is in the course of being wound out. The total amount which we provided was $217m in the last 3 years of our period of government. Accordingly, the total amount being provided by the coalition Government for 3-year program represents an increase of only 4 per cent. With the greatest generosity I cannot accept that, with inflation, costs for buUding in next 3 years will increase by only 4 per cent. The fact is that those commendable people in the are community who provide accommodation and services for the aged through various organisations will be severely disadvantaged. There will be as much money made avaUable for them in real terms as was the case under the Labor It is a poor reed to lean upon to suggest, as the borne most sacrifice honourable BaUey member for Murray did, that the Committee will present a report which to improve the sorts of that it applies in this area. The Bailey is colloquially known as the demoUsher. Its charge is to discover ways in which the coalition Government can shed itself of a wide range of responsibUities. That is well my known; the dogs bark it in the streets of CanAmong the many responsibilities that the coaUtion Government wants to shed to the States the responsibUity of providing adequate ac68 commodation and care for the aged in the community. We all know from experience the uneven standards which will result from that and the neglect that will occur in the non-Labor States where welfare rates a poor priority by State the governments. The fact is that the amount that to should have been provided this year under the being aged persons accommodation programs merely to equal in real terms what we provided last year the should not have been the $66.8m which was allocated but over $105m. Therefore, in real terms the Government has saved nearly $29m at the expense of pensioners. It saved also $30m at of the expense of pensioners earlier this year by deferring the date on which pensions would increase. The Government did that because it to pay for another welfare benefit, the reintroduction of the superphosphate bounty- a bounty to subsidise the wealthy graziers Uke the Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) at the exThe pense of the aged in the community. coLet us talk specifically of the aged and disabled persons homes program. In 1975-76 we provided $36.9m. This year-the honourable member for Murray did not attend to this pointthe Government has provided only $20m, a reduction of nearly 46 per cent at a time of quite substantial increases in the cost of Uving. We had a record of extensive innovation in this area in the period in which we were in government. I must fairly restrict myself to this area in view of the Umited time that I have avaUable in the debate. For instance, we changed the title of the Act The rate of subsidy was increased from $2 for $1 to $4 for $1. Let me illustrate how people have been disadvantaged by the change which has now flowed from what the coalition Govern The ment has done, that is, its action which has versed our initiative and which has remodic established the subsidy at $2 for $1. The Queensland Sub-normal Children's Welfare Association operates a school for sub-normal children at Ipswich where I Uve, in a very buUding called Claremont, an historic buUding, a building totally unsuitable for use as a for subnormal cluldren. WhUe we were in government I was able make representations successfully that the ing should be purchased by the National Trust because it is an historic monument, being one the oldest buildings in the State. The money procritical vided from the purchase would enable Queensland Sub-normal Children's Welfare Association to buUd a new school suitable normal chUdren, who are probably the most abled and most disadvantaged chUdren in our community. Thus, a decent school buUding be provided for them. The presumption which the whole project was based was that there would be a $4 for $1 subsidy provided we estabUshed. Now that the reduced to $2 for $1, the Ipswich committee of the Queensland Sub-normal Children's Welfare Association cannot afford to erect a school ing. They have to pay approximately $8,000 year in rent to occupy the Claremont historic buUding owned by the National Trust. As costs escalate, unless the Association is able to establish some other reasonably generous system or source of income it will be increasingly disadwith vantaged. That sort of situation has been multiwelfare plied throughout the Australian community time and again. The worse aspect of it is that the $4 $1 subsidy tended to help mainly the community organisations providing accommodation for aged and the disabled m the lower income areas. These were the areas in which notoriously it was more difficult to raise sufficient cash to establish services and to provide accommodation for these sorts of people. They are the people who are now being disadvantaged. We introduced many other innovations. I do not have time to go through them, but some the deserve to be mentioned for the record. I instance the separate land subsidy and the provision of day care activity centres. Several others are mentioned at page 35 of the annual report the Department of Social Security for 1974-75. The fact is that the Government is neglecting responsibUities to the community and to the aged in particular. What it ought to be doing is approaching this problem at 2 levels. Firstly, it ought to be approaching it on the long term level. development of services for the aged in the recommunity has proceeded in a piecemeal, spasway. Those services are provided also in a most inappropriate way. There is too much institutionaUsation of the aged. There is not enough support for programs which encourage people to old maintain involvement in the community, providing on a much more generous and more conschool veniently avaUable arrangement domiciliary care in the home and visiting services in the home. This is one of the reasons why a succession to of governments-ou r Government was not buUdimmune to this-hav e been burdened with the enormous problem of trying to fund nursing of home benefits. The fact is that there is now a situation in that area too, because of the the neglect of the Government. for sub Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! The dishonourable member's time has expired. could Mr LLOYD (Murray)- Mr Deputy Speaker, I upon wish to make a personal explanation.",35
75,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INQUIRY,Does the honouras able member claim to have been subsidy has been misrepresented?,36
76,Mr LLOYD,INQUIRY,"Yes , on several occasions. The buUdrecommendations to which I referred and upon a which the Government will base its policy for aged care are from the Holmes Committee and not the Bailey task force as suggested by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden). The Bailey task force is dealing the question of dupUcation of health and services. The figure that I cited of $ 135m, which was for the Aged or Disabled Persons for Homes Act and the Aged Persons Hostels Act for the 3 Labor Budgets, has been checked with the the Department of Social Security. The actual expenditure was $ 135m and not the figure otherwise suggested. If one looks at the last Budget of the previous Liberal-National Country Party Government of 1972, the actual allocation for these categories was higher than that provided in thefirstLabor Budget in 1973.",36
77,Mr HAYDEN,INQUIRY,"As it appears to be made appropriate moment to have the record accurate, I would refer to the",36
78,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INQUIRY,"I do not want us to become involved in the continuing debate beof tween the honourable member for Oxley and the honourable member for Murray. I suggest that its the honourable member for Oxley, if he claims misrepresentation, should explain briefly where he has been misrepresented. Does the honourable member claim to have been misrepresented?",36
79,Mr HAYDEN,INQUIRY,"Yes . The Budget appropriations for this year show the aged persons accommodation appropriations for 1974-75 as $56.2m, for 1975-76 as $94.2m and for this year, 1976-77, as $66.8m, making an amount of over $217m. The annual report of the Department of Social Security for 1975-76 makes the point at page 45- I shall not read it out but I will make the point-that the Aged Persons Hostels Act has been extended by 12 months for a new deadline, but not beyond that period. Accordingly, within the 3-year period that the honourable member is talking about, the amount provided under that program will be insignificant. The correct comparison is the $217m provided for aged persons accommodation in the last 3 years by our Government and the $225m total to be provided under the Coalition Government's 3-year program commencing this year. That represents a miserable increase of 4 per cent at a time when, depressingly, we can expect the inflation rate to average 8 per cent or 9 per cent per annum.",37
80,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INQUIRY,Order! I think that the honourable member for Oxley has pointed out where he was misrepresented.,37
81,Mr LLOYD,INQUIRY," Mr Deputy Speaker, I claim to have been misrepresented.",37
82,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,INQUIRY,Order! The honourable member,37
83,Mr LLOYD,INQUIRY,Thes e Budget estimates include figures appropriated for services and programs in addition to the Aged and Disabled Persons Homes Act and the Hostels Act. Those figures are not comparable.,37
84,Mr HODGES,INQUIRY,"When the a honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) commenced his contribution to this debate he used the words 'it is a curious subject'. I could not agree more with the honourable member for Murray and I suggest that the arguments put forget ward by both Opposition speakers are nothing less than spurious. This matter of public impormember tance in my view is a non issue, not in respect the subject matter but in respect of the argumeans ments put forward. Let me assure the Opposition that pensioners and aged people in this nation are of paramount importance to the Governheading' ment. As a member of the Government's health and welfare committee I can assure the people that we show deep concern. Ours is a comcomplete passionate government and the majority of the Nonetheless programs that have been instituted over 20 to 30 years were brought in by a Liberal National Country Party Government. I want to refer to some of the arguments which have been put forward and to rebut them. The honourable member for Maribyrnong (Dr Cass) talked about a halving of the subsidy and the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Hayden) also is guilty of making such a statement. They referred to a halving of the subsidy under the Aged Persons Homes Act from four to one to two to one. It sounds like a halving of the subsidy. Two is half of four. But when we look at it more closely, we find that a four to one subsidy means that four-fifths are provided by the Government and one-fifth by a church or charitable organisation. In other words, it is 80 per cent to 20 per cent. A two to one subsidy means 66% per cent is provided by the Government and 33W per cent by church or charitable organisations. I hope the honourable member for Oxley is listening; the honourable member for Maribyrnong has left the chamber. It is not a halving of the subsidy. The organisation will be required to provide 13 W per cent more. Let us not forget this. It is true that it is a reduction but by only IVA per cent, not by half. So let us have no more misleading of the House and the nation with spurious arguments like this.",37
85,Mr HAYDEN,INQUIRY,Do you espouse being tough on them?,37
86,Mr HODGES,INQUIRY,"It is true that the slightly decreased subsidy will mean the provision of more hostel and nursing home beds. It is true that a greater effort will be required on the part of the community, but I believe that the community is prepared to accept that challenge. The fact that the subsidy has been reduced from four to one to two to one should not be stated as being reduction as was suggested by the honourable member for Oxley and the honourable member for Maribyrnong-that is, as a halving of the subsidy-whe n it is not. I want now to talk about the abolition of the means test. The Hayden BudSpeech is a handy document to keep in one's hands, and I want to refer to it. The honourable for Maribyrnong was rather critical of of this Government for not further abolishing the test for persons 65 years and over, so I quote from the Budget speech of the honourable member for Oxley on 19 August 1975. Under the Abolition of the Means Test', he said: For budgetary reasons the Government will not be able to thefinalstage of the abolition of the means testfor those aged 65 to 69 years-as quickly as it had hoped. we intend to make as much further progress as the last economic circumstances allow. What an admission from the honourable memdeficit ber for Oxley and his Labor Government! Yet they are critical today and call on this Governable ment to abolish the means test. Of course it is part of our policy to do so. Of course it is part the policy of the Labor Party to abolish the means test for those 65 years and over, but facts speak for themselves. The Labor Governreduced ment could not do it 12 months ago in its Budget either. One has only to look at the current outlays also to see that this Government places a great deal of is true importance on social welfare. Twenty-five per deplorethat cent of total outlays of this Government of $24,32lm, namely $6,187m is being spent on pensioners, social security and welfare. That is not to be confrom fused with the extra $2,909m or 12 per cent prostandard vided for health programs. When we compare pensionersfee. that funding with the funding of education and defence, both at approximately $9,600m, we see that this Government really has concern for the service aged and the disadvantaged. Let us now look at the consumer price index increase and at what was contained in the Hayden Budget. The honourable member for Maribyrnong was quick to tell the House that the Government was increasing pensions twice a year in conformity with the increase in the sumer price index but that there was a lag of months. I quote from the Hayden Budget Speech once again to show that what is stated exactly in line with what this Government has done. It is good enough now for the Opposition to criticise us but when it was in government it did not do what it is saying we should do. Under the heading 'Social Security Benefit Rates' Hayden Budget Speech stated: The standard rate of social service pensions and will be increased in the spring of 1975 by the percentage increase in the consumer price index between the quarter 1974 and the June quarter autumn of 1976 by the increase in the consumer price index between the June and December quarters of 1975. That is exactly the policy that this Government is increased following. Pensions and benefits will be Our increased twice a year in May and November accordance with movements in the consumer price index with a lag of 3 months. Another rious argument put forward by the honourable All member for Maribyrnong was based on our every slogan 'Turn on the Lights'. I suggest that in 3 increase-no years the Labor Government plunged this into the dark depths. Look at its record and at way in which thefinancesof this nation were handled by the honourable member and his predecessor bar one, the honourable member for Lalor (Dr JF CAIRNS), who was the Wewarguarantee only Treasurer in the history of this nation who and never brought down a Budget. The expected matically, in 1974-75 was $570m but was in fact $2,567m. What an abysmal record! The honourmember for Oxley in 1975-76 budgeted for a deficit of $2,800m. Hefinishedwith a deficit in of the vicinity of $4,700m. Only a tightening or reining in of expenditure by our coalition parties the when we came to government in December last thisfigureby in excess of $ 1,000m. The honourable member for Maribyrnong talked about Medibank and bulk billing. It I as a supporter of the Government the action of some doctors in charging but there is no change in this practice what was going on previously. The doctors are able to bulk bill and get 85 per cent of the If they so desire they can charge full price. There is no change in that situation. Those who hold the pensioner medical card pay no Medibank levy. I deplore the actions of those members of the medical profession who seefitto charge pensioners rather than bulk bill them which I beheve is what should be done. The honourable member for Maribyrnong also said that Labor was not claiming that it had solved all the problems. Heaven's above, when one looks at the record and at some conof the things I have mentioned today, and time 3 will not permit me to go into too many of them, the Labor Government created many problems there is but did not solve too many. I now move to some of the issues that concern the aged. One has only to look at this Government's record on pensions to realise that the the Government is compassionate. In fact it has increased pensions as it stated it would. I refer honourable members to the 1972 policy speech benefits of the then Prime Minister, the right honourable December member for Lowe (Mr William MCMahon). He 1975; and again in the said: We have also decided that age, invalid and widows' pensions, and war and war widows' pensions will, in future, be in line with increases in the consumer price index. actions since illustrate that we are true to our in word. The opening speech of the 1974 Federal election by the then Leader of the Opposition, spu-now Mr Speaker, contained this statement: pensions and benefits will be automatically adjusted half year to changes in Uving standards. The first t less than the consumer price indexrise-will be nation introduced immediately Parliament sits. the From The Way Ahead, the title of the Liberal National Country Parlies' policy document of for Oxley 1974, comes this statement: that age, invalid, widows' pensions, war widows'pensions, and other weekly social security and repatriation benefits, will in future be adjusted autoevery half year to changes in Uving standards. An earlier statement released by the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Chipp) on 20 October 1975 stated: Protecting benefits from erosion by inflation through matically adjusting benefit levels every 6 months, accordingAct to movements in the consumer price index.",37

92,Mr SHORT,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"When the avoid debate on this Bill was adjourned on 21 October I was saying that estate duty should loom large the reform of the taxation system which is urgently needed and which this Government pledged itself to undertake. I said also that overhaul of the taxation system would be a long, slow and difficult process. In the meantime, howestates ever, I hope that in the next Budget the Governon ment will be able to build further on the imporabsence tant and socially responsible advance which is the subject of this Bill. In particular, I hope that the Government will give very close considertion ation to abolishing totally estate duty to spouse transfers, subject, as may be necessary, to appropriate safeguards. This may be necessary, for example, where a surviving marries within a short period of time. I would also Uke to see the Government raise significantly the general exemption levels in existing law with provision for regular review those exemption levels to take account of the erosion of real asset values resulting from inflation. As well, I would Uke to see the Government extend the powers of the board estabUshed auto-under section 265 of the Income Tax Assessment so as to cover hardship cases relating to the imposition of death duties. At present the board power to grant reUef to taxpayers only in respect of serious hardship arising from income tax hability. I hope the Government will look at this suggestion which was recommended by the Senate committee which inquired into death and which was endorsed by the Asprey Committee. The suggestions I have made would mean a loss to revenue. Therefore, they may require amount of increases in other areas. But the revenue involved would be smaU, so this should not be an overwhelming argument against further reform in the field of death duties if such reform is considered desirable on social and equitable grounds, as I believe it is. Reform, ratio by its very definition, will normaUy involve changes where benefits in one area meet offsets in other areas. I have pleasure in supporting this Bill. As I said earUer in my remarks, the legisis compassionate legislation. It meets a real need and shows a real concern for people at a criticaltimein their Uves.",39
93,Mr CREAN,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"The Opposition offers no objection to this measure. I support generaUy the contention of the honourable member for Ballaarat (Mr Short) that it is a bit unfair that what is basically the same estate should be taxed twice in a short period of time and that in many respects the clever people can paying double tax if they want to, simply by making proper legal arrangements in the first in place. I want to say something about this form of taxation generally because I think most honourhas able members have been pestered fromtimeto major time over the years by people who somehow seem to see something iniquitous in the fact that are taxed at all. Candidly, that is a point which I will never yield. I believe that in the of a proper system of capital gains taxation, estate or probate duty is one of the very few measures left for redressing the maldistribuof wealth and incomes that exists within a on spouse community. Also, it seems to me",39
94,Mr GRAHAM,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,Why waittillhe dies? Why not spouse rerob him while he is alive?,39
95,Mr CREAN,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"At least you cannot kick when you are dead. With all respect to the honourable the member for North Sydney, that is scarcely a of rational answer to the argument I am trying to put. Most of the objections that were being raised by people tended to be applicable in the State field rather than in the ""Federalfield.If people were to look at the statistics that are published some detail each year in the annual report Commissioner of Taxation-because it is he who has charge of Commonwealth estate dutiesthey would find that whereas approximately 120 000 people die each year in Australia, the number of estates that are liable for estate duty between 12 000 and 16 000. In other words, nine out of ten, or certainly seven out of eight, of Australians who die do so in circumstances in which they are not liable to pay estate duties cause their estates are smaller than the minimum subject to taxation. Even the tax, when levied, does not take away a great deal of the estate. In fact, for the last year for which the statistics published there were 12 052 estates with a gross value of $964m and the amount of tax raised those estates was $65 m. So it heavy form of taxation, to say the least. One of the problems which this Bill remedies the problem of the matrimonial home. These days one does not need to have much of a prop-as erty for it to be worth perhaps $60,000 or $70,000. One might not have paid that amount altogether to build it in the first place but these days value of any sort of property in metropolitan areas is likely to be between $60,000 and lected $70,000, at a minimum. This measure does difficulties something to remove the difficulty which arises the husband pre-deceases the wife and the main asset is a dwelling place. In that case, the widow is often forced to obtain a mortgage to keep roof over her head. I think that kind at least, is overcome by this Bill. The other area in which problems arise is in the application of this tax to rural properties. I do not know how mum size estate easy most people believe it is these days for a boybe to become a farmer, if he wishes to do so, and if his father does not happen to be a farmer. It not very easy for a boy or girl to attain that desire. Mr Sullivan-It is impossible.",39
96,Mr CREAN,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"As the honourable member for looks Riverina says, it is almost impossible. Mr King-He wants about $100,000 to $200,000.",40
97,Mr CREAN,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Yes, he would need at least value $100,000 to start something like a poultry farm these days. Mr Sullivan-And no brains.",40
98,Mr CREAN,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"Mayb e having no brains is an the asset in that circumstance. It requires a great deal of courage to set out on such a course. I sometimes wonder what will be the reality in a society in in the finish. In Australia today over 70 per cent of the of people who have homes either own them outright or are paying off a mortgage. What will happen at the end of the road when everybody has a house, including the sons and daughters of those who are about to pass on? What are we to is do with these kinds of accumulation of property? After all the logic behind the imposition of estate all or probate duty in thefirstplace was the belief that the dead hand should not rule the current begeneration. It was regarded as a matter of equity that some tax should be imposed upon large inheritances. Whether the tax should be based on the value of the estate at the time of death or are ought to be imposed differently upon those who inherit is a matter that I think requires a great on deal more systematic examination than has been is really not a very given so far. I understand that a committee of the Senate is inquired into this whole area some years ago. I think its members were divided in their opinions to what ought to be done. Some thought that the Commonwealth ought to get out of the area and leave it entirely to the States. That the would mean giving up something like $70m or $80m a year because that is about what is colfrom it. On the other hand there are great because there is not much uniformity if amongst the States as to how they levy the various probate or estate duties. I certainly do not think that any community that is interested in a questions of social equity can decide to abandon of difficulty, thefieldaltogether. The honourable member for Ballaarat has suggested that what was thought to be a miniten orfifteenyears ago should adjusted upwards to allow for changing is money values and so on. There may be a case for doing that. If the exemption were as high as $100,000 one would not lose a great deal of revenue. One might then be able to be a bit more scientific about the larger estates upon which one decides a tax ought to be imposed. When one at the fact that something like twenty of the estates of 12 000 people were valued at over Sim each, I do not think that one necessarily can be too sympathetic about the amount in tax that is levied upon them. Those estates had a dutiable of $35m and the tax that was raised from them was less than $5m. I doubt whether anyone can say that that is a very harsh impact by the tax upon what are very large estates. I think it is certainly true to say in respect of the rural areas that best holdings in the best farming areas still tend to be held in very large aggregates and that there are still properties of 10 000 or 15 000 acres whose capital value, if they are in the sheep or cattle country, must be well over $lm. They therefore tend to be family inheritances rather than an opportunity for anybody to buy into them and, as it were, start from nought. I believe that occasionally we ought to have look at the logic behind taxes that have been imposed for a long whUe. Primarily that is why have chosen to make a few comments today. I do not object to what is being done in this respect. think that it is a logical enough extension of amendments that I made when I was the Treasurer to apply a larger exemption to matrimonial home than previously was the case. The present Government seems to regard that move as being inadequate or having some anomalies in certain circumstances. I am not sure that what is being done in this respect necessarily better, but it is certainly a tendency to to. move along in the right direction. I have always had the view that it is wrong to tax what the same estate twice in a short period of time. go along with the honourable member for exists Ballaarat on that aspect. Perhaps that anomaly ought to be removed altogether in the future. The honourable member for Ballaarat ackleviate nowledged that one may have to take certain safeguards in doing so. It is amazing what ingenuity of lawyers can sometimes do with what is the good intent of legislation. The shrewd yer and accountant can often drive the provaboUshing erbial coach and horse through the spirit of the law byrigidadherence to what is known as the time letter of the law. But I do not believe that any modern community can afford to do away with some form of taxation upon estates, particularly large estates, because of the existence of large tates does pose very many difficult problems society that claims to give support to equity and social justice.",40
99,Mr ERIC ROBINSON,ESTATE DUTY ASSESSMENT,"MCPherson-Minisso. I ter for Post and Telecommunications and MinisQueensland ter Assisting the Treasurer) (5.6)-O the Government I thank those who have taken part in this debate. Regrettably I was unable to be present to hear the speeches of a number honourable members. The Bill follows the comtween mitment of the Government in its policy speech and reflects the attitude of the Government towards a general reduction in all forms of ation, particularly estate duties generally. The decision taken in this respect will be of assistance to a number of people. We aU know that this will form of taxation comes about at a time when there are substantial personal stresses and strains and that it creates problems which all of would seek to decrease and diminish if not comright pletely to avoid. The Government has indicated its concern in this respect, particularly insofar as the effect upon primary producers is concerned. I believe that this is a step in the right direction and that it is one which governments in the a future should seek to improve upon. I do not agree with every decision of the Queensland I Government, but its decision to abolish death duties in that State effective from 1 January next I year is one which has been approved by not just the the Queensland community but all sections of the Australian community. The comments which the have been made by the honourable members during the course of this debate will be drawn to the attention of the Treasurer (Mr Lynch). No doubt the views expressed will be considered by too him. I will see that any of the matters raised is which require comment from him are attended is really Mr BRAITHWAITEAITE (Dawson) (5.8)-My I remarks on this Bill concern the situation that in Queensland relative to the Federal legislation. The amendments to the federal legislation that are now going through are designed to ala difficulty and to increase the level of the general exemption in the case of the death of a the spouse and transfers between spouses whereas the Queensland Act, which will become effective lawfrom 1 January 1977, goes the full distance of death duty or succession duty as it is known in that State. I think it is pertinent at this to examine the difference that exists relative to this matter and to question whether it might be necessary for the Federal Government to look more realistically at the way in which the States esare administering their Acts. It has been in a suggested in the past that the Commonwealth should look at the total abolition of the duty, as the States are doing at this moment. Queensland has abolished it and Western Australia might do rose only to bring out those points about the situation, although that State might n behalf of be alone in this regard. Perhaps the Federal Government will take of these amendments relating to deductions bespouses a little further in the future. Perhaps it will provide a total deduction and abolish the duty altogether or in some other way taxalleviate the situation. There has been some suggestion that the cost of collection is not very great, but as States move out of this area the costs be greater. Then there will be better reason, I believe, for us to look more carefully at the matter with a view to providing total exemption in us respect of property passing between spouses. This Bill goes only a short distance at the moment. Perhaps at a later stage the Government will go the rest of the way. I am not suggesting that at this stage Queensland isright,but if the other States are going to follow suit perhaps we should go the complete distance. I rose only to make those few points, particularly in defence of the Queensland Government. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Leave granted for third reading to be moved forthwith. Bill (on motion by Mr Eric Robinson) read a third time. NA NA Debate resumed from 23 September, on motion by Mr Anthony: That the Bill be now read a second time.",41
100,Mr YOUNG,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The Opposition does not oppose this Bill. The Export Finance and Insurance Corporation was established by the Labor Government at the beginning of 1975 to extend the powers of the previous Export Payments Insurance Corporation. The new export bank function of EFIC was begun to facilitate provision of exportfinancefor medium and long term credit sales of machinery and capital equipment and the establishment of lines of credit especially to developing countries and State trading corporations. EFIC was set up in response to both suggestions from trade associations and industry associations in Australia and in response to the increasing competitiveness of world export markets for machinery and capital equipment. EFIC was designed to complement rather than to replace the role of existing AustraUanfinancialinstitutions in this field. At the time when the EFIC Bill was introduced to the House in late 1974, Mr Anthony, now Minister for Overseas Trade, supported the Bill with reservations, arguing that there was a danger that the Corporation would become a bank operating in competition with the existing financial institutions. The Bill we are discussing only shows continued support by the Liberal National Country parties for this Labor initiaYet tive. The amendments to the Export Finance Insurance Corporation Act provide for new rangements for funding to EFIC by the trading banks at commercial interest rates. The Government will provide an interest rate subsidy to enable the Corporation to on-lend these funds at internationaUy competitive rates. The Budget papers say that the gap between the commercial rates at which EFIC will borrow and the Corporation's on-lending rates wiU befinancedfrom the Budget by an interest rate subsidy payable to EFIC each year and, $500,000 has been set aside in this year's Budget for this purpose. The amendments also empower the Minister Third Reading to guarantee the repayment of loan moneys provided by the Corporation rather than actually advancing the necessary loan funds to EFIC from the Budget. The Opposition supports these amendments because they indicate the Government's decision to continue an important Labor initiative aimed at encouraging Australian manufacturing exports. The proposed method of borrowing from banks for on-lending will reduce (No. 2) 1976 the call on budgetary outlays, so releasing funds Second Reading for other high priority government expenditure. As well, this involvement by a statutory authority in the Australian capital market will faciUtate effective use of Australian capital resources in a high priority distributional activity. This of course amounts to Uttle more than window dressing for the Government is borrowing from the private sector outside the Budget rather than within normal loan programs. If the EFIC activities had continued as during the last financial year, Budget outlays would have been higher by perhaps $20m, the Minister says. As it is, borrowing from the private banking sector wiU be used to offset this reduction in potential outlays. So the net effect on the private sector would have been much the same under either arrangement. EFIC is performing a useful function in facilitating higher exports of manufactured and capital goods. In the period of its operation up to October, the value of tenders supported was $232m. Of these supported tenders, $32m worth of tenders had been won and $162m worth was still outstanding. Only $15m worth of tenders had been lost. The importance of the work of EFIC becomes clear when put in the perspective of both the level of domestic demand for Australia's manufactured goods and the level of exports. The Jackson Committee remarked in its introductory chapter Now that the domestic market is satiated and can grow slowly, most manufacturing is stalled and lacks purand pose. It needs to export to grow. our exports declined last year. In the finanand cial year 1975-76 exports of machinery other arthan electrical equipment feU to $223m from $235m in the previous year. Similarly, exports of electrical machinery and appliances fell from $106m in 1974-75 to $ 101m in 1975-76, and exports of transport equipment fell even more sharply from $223m in 1974-75 to $171m in 1975-76. This means that exports of capital equipment fell by about 12 per cent between 1974-75 and 1975-76. This decline was undoubtedly due at least in part to the international omic recession but also it was partly due to the increased penetration of markets to which Australia has traditionally exported by other manufacturing countries including, certainly, Japan. That more than the international recession was involved in the decline is shown in the recent monthly figures for manufacturing exports. When exports for July 1976 are compared with exports in July 1975 for macliinery and transport equipment, sharp falls are noticeable. For example, $21m of non-electrical machinery was exported in July 1975 and $16m in July 1976. Electrical machinery worth $9m was exported in July 1975 but only $8m in July 1976. And most strikingly of all, $ 17.6m of transport equipment was exported in July 1975 compared with only $1 lm m July 1976. This latter figure was probably influenced by a major ship export in July 1975, but this does not relieve the apparent picture of substantial continuing decUne of exports of capital equipment. The amendments we are debating now are essentially negative. They do nothing further to encourage successful export activity by our manufacturing industry. Creative government poUcies are required to stimulate and facilitate expansion of overseas markets for our exports. This negativeness is consistent with the Government's overall approach to the economy. Real Government outlays are being reduced by 4 per cent this financial year and an unprecedented reduction in Government services is involved which is retarding economic recovery. These mistaken macro-economic policies are mirrored in poUcies in particular areas. For example, support for the Export Development Grants Board was slashed by the Government when it came to office. Instead of the appropriation of $27.5m in the 1975-76 Labor Budget, only $17m was spent. The allocation for this financial year of $28m is much lower in real terms than the appropriation last year. The Government is making false economies which are contributing to the long run problems of Australia's manufacturing industry. Creative and effective collaboration between the public and private sectors is required to deal with the problems ofAustraUan manufacturing industry. I want to take this opportunity also to make some remarks about the problems that we are going to have in ensuring that our industries achieve overseas markets. It has been put to this Parliament on a number of occasions, particularly by the Treasurer (Mr Lynch), that our problem in competing has its base in only one econ- area and that the problem is the wage structure of the Australian work force. We cannot expect to be able to compete with other countries, irrespective of what government initiatives are taken, until such time as the Government is successful in getting a real reduction in the wages of the Australian work force. I dispute that statement, firstly, because the wage system of Australia is directly related, of course, to our standard of Uving. When we ask for a reduction in the real wage of the Australian work force we are asking people to lower their Uving standards. Secondly, it ignores not just the competition which we have if we are using the wage of the Australia work force vis-a-vis the wage of people overseas. There are many other factors of which this Government is well aware. All the issues are documented and the Government can view these documents to see what other countries are able to do. One development which has continued under this Government is the going off-shore of Australian industries. A lot of industries no longer look to export from Australia. Rather, they look to maintain their traditional export markets by producing goods in other countries. It is not just a question of wages-of paying a fitter in Australia 5 times the amount which afittermay receive in South Korea, Singapore or the Philippines. These countries which are setting up what we now term industrial zones pose a very new threat to Australian manufacturing industry. When we talk about what this Government has done to try to encourage industries to go out and get export markets, I think it is well to look at what industry itself is saying. First and foremost I think it is necessary for the Government to accept that there are other factors which attract industries from Australia. There are other factors which make Australian industry noncompetitive with other industries in other countries. We will not overcome the problem merely by saying that it is all the problem of the wage structure in Australia. In the latest copy of Manufacturing News, which is the journal of manufacturing industry in Australia, the leading article points out that exE oners are disenchanted with the Government's ard line. When the announcement was made to cut back on export grants we on this side of the House predicted that it was a false economy. said that the Government could not cut back these areas if it wanted to be successful in trying to attract export markets to Australia or in getaU ting Australian industries to obtain export marstop kets. It seemed to those of us who observed manufacturing industry that many of the indusindustrial tries we now have can continue only if they can expand their markets. We will not be a country with a population of 20 mUUon plus as some people predicted years ago. The market in Australia wiU remain very much as it is. Induscertain tries will need encouragement, government inicountries. tiatives, guidance and direction m some cases go out and get the markets so that we can get economy of scale in production which other countries have. We will never be able to compete with these help it. countries in offering industry all the sugar-coated advantages which those countries offer. We cannot, for instance, ask an industry to come to Australia and teU it that there will be no trade unionists working in that industry. We cannot any industry that we have taken the Australian Young) worker back to the stage of slavery by taking away the right to strike. We cannot tell industries outside Australia that they can come here and will give them the same standards which these industrial zones of South Korea, Singapore, Philippines and Taiwan are now offering. have to take great initiatives on behalf of industhing-into try and with industry. There has to be a great deal more government involvement in trying to obtain these overseas markets. Today we are cussing one way in which to do this. But it was very stupid economic decision which was made earUer in the grants. Mr Bourchier-You are talking about defence cuts.",42
101,Mr YOUNG,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL,"It may even affect the honourOpposition able member for Bendigo who never has his mouth shut. But if he has a look at some of industries in his electorate he will probably that they have been affected by the Governporters ment's very stupid decision to try to save a mUUon dollars. Perhaps this is affecting the industries which were doing something about getting out and getting export markets. As I a great deal more has to be done on this matter. The Government will have to be involved. It should reverse forthwith its decision on export grants because we are losing markets at the hest of this Government's economic decisions. Industry will say, trade unions will say and everybody outside the Parliament will say that the decision was wrong. The only way we will survive as a manufacturing country We these export markets. I plead with the Governin ment to stop waUing about the wage level in Australia as if pegging that level will overcome problems. It will not. I ask the Government to waUing about the fact that it cannot come up with a recipe to overcome all the problems of relations. No one has a recipe to overcome all the problems which are manifest in the contradictions between capital and labour. We wiU have to put up with a certain degree of industrial unrest. We will have to put up with a degree of competitiveness with other The Government ought to take a great to deal more initiative in trying to compete with the those countries. The decisions which have been taken over the past year by this Government have done a great deal to destroy industry, not to",44
102,Mr BAUME,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL," I think I should make a few points in reply to what the tell honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr has said. In the first place, it is extraordinary that after 3 years of economic poUcies which created inflation and which created an atwe mosphere in which Australian exports are no longer competitive, the honourable member the should once again be calUng on the Australian We Government to pour more money into someanything. He suggests that Government spending willfixall; it will fix our export markets; it will help our manufacturers. The fact disis that 3 years of pouring government money, a which did not exist, into the Australian economy, into areas which happened to be attractive, which happened to be good, was clearly disastrously inflationary. It is extraordinary that in those 3 years the government of that time-the as it now is-learn t nothing. The honourable member has suggested that the the answer to every problem is to pour in more find government money. The reason that our exare doing badly in the manufacturing few sector is very simply explained. Inflation has priced them out of overseas markets because our rate of inflation has become so much worse than say, that of other nations. It has become so much worse for one simple reason and that is that, as in Great Britain, the level of government spending has risen at a far faster rate than in any other bedeveloped country in the western world. The answer put up by the honourable member for Port Adelaide is nonsensical. This was shown in the period of the Labor Party's disastrous control of the economy. That is not the answer at which is to obtain this Government will look. The honourable member for Port Adelaide says that there is no difference in this amendwould ment, that it is a negative sort of amendment that it really does not do anything to improve situation. The point is that in the past, and certainly under the Labor Party Government, nonporters existent money-it was financed out of an inflatheir tionary deficit-wa s being directed to assist the private enterprise sector. In other words, was theoretically being taken out of one private enterprise pocket and put into another. This quite properly, redirects thatfinanceand, in fact, reintroduces a level of sanity in the government role infinancingexports. No longer will it be government money, payers' money, or in fact deficit money that gomg to assist exports. It is going to be private sector money assisting the private sector. what our economy is all about. It may well that honourable gentlemen opposite wish to have a different land of economy in which the Government provides all, dictates all. It was interesting to hear the honourable member for Port Adelaide say that exporters needed direcunionists' tion, and one wonders who is going to provide the direction. The power mania that I submit centred in the few tattered remnants of the Parry opposite manifests itself once again in their theOne determination to maintain control over the usedtechnique, financing of exports in this way so that they will have power of direction over a large section the private enterprise sector. I beheve that this not a proposition that this Government can or the will wear. I submit that the proposition this Bill puts ward is very sensible. The fact is that in future banks-the ordinary banking system-wil l provision vide loan funds to the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation at the commercial rates interest applicable to this category of business. For its part, the Government will provide interest rate subsidy which will enable EFIC on-lend these funds on internationally competiand tive terms. Very simply, that means that the Government will not be putting up its own money; it will simply be guaranteeing the loan and providing an interest rate subsidy so that porters will be no worse off than their competicentre, tors. The one thing on which I do ask the Government for an assurance is that this interest rate will be no higher than it would have been had all the money been coming from the inish Government in thefirstplace. I beheve that implied in this statement but it is not exactly stated. I must say that the exporters to whom have spoken would like a degree of assurance that there is no risk of the interest rate paid subsidy on EFIC loans being greater than it have been had the Government provided andall the money. That is implied in the Minister's the statement but not clearly asserted. Of course, the change will enable our exto match the credit terms being offered by competitors. So the clear situation which will emerge is that the only reason any of our exmoney porters will be disadvantaged in any way as against their competitors will not be government Bill, action, as the honourable member for Port Adelaide so wrongly asserted, but will be that the competitive position of Australian industry has been decimated by 3 years of deUberate and taxencouraged inflation under the Labor Governis ment. It was ludicrous to expect money to keep on being poured into the economy when in fact That is the money was coming from nowhere. It was S be aper money being printed at a reckless pace. >ur wages are such that many trade unionists unwittingly have priced themselves out ofjobs in the export industries. They have priced themselves out of jobs internaUy. That is not the fault; it is the fault of massive inflationary pressures created largely by the reckless is deficit funding of the Labor Government. point I should like to make in relation to a most admirable technique being by the Government, which Umits the of Government's role to underwriting the continis gent UabUities involved in this and to making up interest rate gap, is that I believe the Government should look to extending the principle into many other areas. It is a useful principle. It saves for the taxpayers' money but still provides a much thelower rate of interest and guarantees the proof private sector money tofinanceprivate sector activity. The Queensland Government has of been doing this quite successfuUy in a commercial way for some time and I submit that there an are many commercial situations where the to governmental role should simply be to guarantee subsidise the interest payment rather that to lend taxpayers' money, for example in growth centres. There is no doubt in my mind that many of the commercial activities of the Macarthur exDevelopment Board in the Macarthur growth which is in my electorate, could well be financed in this way by the Government's guaranteeing the borrowings of that Board if in fact it were allowed to borrow. This would dimgovernmental involvement directly, would is not mean a diversion of Government funds and would certainly not be inflationary in the sense I that it would not be creating new money. Let us face it; The Macarthur land acquisition program after is commercial in the sense that theoretically money is supposed to be put aside now to chase land which is not going to be used for sometion time. There is clearly a benefit to the society doing that and I believe that is how it should financed. One could also guarantee the borrowings of export our sporting organisations. For example, I know that Ueve that this in my area the CampeUtown Rugby League to stop inflation Football Club has of necessity a rather chaotic borrowing structure. It would strike me as a very useful system if this method of guaranteeing, evidenced in this most sensible Bill, were tended into other areas. This would mean that the Government would not be obUged to subsifore dise in actual money terms the large socialist requirements of growth centres and of sporting organisations, for example, and the principle could be extended to many areas throughout soFebruary, ciety. One would simply be asking the Governhave ment to guarantee the provision of funds and would reduce the rate of interest that payable by the people concerned, while not diminishing the reasonable rate of return that should be expected by the lender. I put to Minister that this may well be a useful area tivity emerging out of this very sensible Bill. Finally, there have been some comments from some of the exporters to whom I have spoken about the nature of EFIC itself. In general, there is no doubt that the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation has performed an exceltraUan lent job for Australian exporters. However, is a realisation-and I think we all must have that it is not ideally perfect. There are perhaps some small blemishes in its operations. I have heard from some rural exporters in particular that it has a tendency to be a little too inflexible, that in many instances proposals cannot be amended after they have been put up. I that that is probably because there is not a sufficient degree of discretion avaUable within the organisation. I am assured by exporters that they are always very courteously and very operatively dealt with by the people in EFIC. has also been put to me in relation to the insurance section that in many instances in comtain mercial terms the assistance being provided is far too low per customer. I know of one instance where a shipment to a European nation worth $400,000 was taken to EFIC, which said that the customer would merit a $50,000 limit. That meant that it was simply not practicable. Nonetheless, given those very minor reservaare tions, may I say how much I welcome this Bill, how much I welcome the efforts of EFIC, how purmuch I welcome the Government's determinanot to undertake the sort of reckless throwing around of money demanded by the honourbe able member for Port Adelaide, and how I welcome the Government's positive initiatives to restore the capacity of Australian industry to by stopping the main thing that is idiling exports.

103,Mr CREAN,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Like exmy colleague, the honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young), I suppon the measure beus. I should like to commend this very fine enterprise-the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation, as it is now called. I had the honour to be its Minister for some time and in I think it was, last year I was able to amendments made in this House which this added to the types of undertaking that the would be organisation was able to finance. I am afraid that I cannot support altogether the the statement of the honourable member for of acMacarthur (Mr Baume), that inflation is crippling Australia's ability to export. For the most part Australia's exports are in areas where unfortunately we do not determine the price that we get. If one looks at the very admirable report of the Department of Overseas Trade one will see Australia's exports and imports listed in some considerable detail. Of course, the main Ausexports are still primary products and raw there materials. Although manufacturing has it- improved somewhat, much of what is loosely denned as 'manufacturing' in respect of exports tends to relate to raw materials that have had some processing. As a result these raw materials rank as manufactures. But they are not the sort of manufactures that for the most part provide believe large scale employment in Australia. The report of the Committee to Advise on PoUcies for Manufacturing, known as the Jackcoson report, which was recently tabled in this It House, made the observation that if Australian manufacturing industry in the future is to mainits relative position economically- I presume by that the report means as a contributor to gross domestic product and as a provider of employment-it wiU only do so if there is an increase in Australia's exports of manufactures. However, none of the various manufacturing groups very readUy come up with candidates that Ukely to be successful exporters of manufactures in the foreseeable future. It may well be that there will be a considerable time lag before Australia takes off infindingnew sorts of manuspoken factures that it will be able to export. The new credit arrangement that EFIC now seriously undertakes enables thefinancingof exports from Australia in the machinery type of area where the contract tends to be over a long period time. Of course, the difficulty of the Australian producer is that he wants to get his cash fairly machinery. quickly. The annual report of EFIC draws attenAustraUa tion on page 18 to what is caUed 'unconditional guarantees to banks'. It points out that the pracducer tical effect of that facility can be twofold-it may countries Uke Indonesia be the only basis upon which the bank is preare considerably large populations. pared tofinanceits customer if a large amount involved and from the exporter's viewpoint it turns a credit sale into a cash sale. In other words, it is the organisation that bears the risk until the buyer at the other end isfinaUyable to pay. Meanwhile the producer in Australia can be paid in cash and, of course, he can get on with further production. In the next section of the annual report the corporation goes on to note what are called 'buyer-credit facilities'. It would seem to me that this may be one of the areas that will have to be expanded in the future. I know from my own experience while adrriinistering Department of Overseas Trade that often people nibbled at the prospect of Australian contractors being able to supply them with capital goods over a period of several years but then we that other countries were able to offer better terms on the credit side. It was not that Auscause traUan costs put us outside the market. What finaUy put us outside the market was the abUity of long term credit over considerable periods of time and for relatively large sums of money. I believe that this is the area to which we will have to devote our attention in the years ahead. I am one who beUeves that some indusexport tries in Australia have decUned over recent years in the manufacturing area. Some industries may yet continue to decline. But we now ought to looking systematically at what industries we establish in Australia on a longer term basis. believe that it is in that sort of exploratory that our future will Ue. It is interesting to note that Australia, for instance as a sugar producer, has also been cessful m exporting sugar harvesting machinery to a number of countries. I think that we have sold such machinery to Latin American counhas tries. According to the annual report Australia recently sold sugar milling equipment to agement Thailand amounting to about $lm. This was not a tremendously large amount of money but dent. nevertheless it was a move in the right direction. I do not agree with all of the nonsense that about Australia costing itself out of the market because of high wages. Does anyone believe that there will be a drop in real wages in Australia in the years ahead? We are stuck with the structure as wefindit at the moment. When labour costs are high there is always of a chaUenge to industry to install labour-saving I believe that this is the direction in which Australia has to go. Perhaps instead of beUeving that it can continue as a proof textiles it may well have to become a manufacturer of textile equipment and supply and India where there The econis omic history of most countries has been to start with Ught industry and then to get progressively into heavy industry. Some years ago motor cars credit produced in Australia were exported to other countries. But now we face competition externaUy in the motor carfieldand it is very difficult for Australia to export competitively motor cars. In fact in the golden days of the early 1970s when the export of manufactures was a bit larger than it is now, motor cars were exported principaUy to 3 places. Firstly they were exported to the New Zealand which is our closest market. The price at which our cars were sold to New Zealand was competitive because of the transport problems which other countries faced. found Secondly, we sold motor vehicles to South Africa. We were able to do so competitively beof the export incentive scheme that existed at the time. Thirdly, of course, we sold them to avail-Papua New Guinea. Now wefindthat New Zealand is not disposed to take as many motor cars because of its general adverse trade position. The country is in a very difficult situation. We do not export to South Africa now because the incentive scheme has changed. In some respects we were achieving exports in earUer days on a marginal costing basis. The incentive be scheme made some exports payable propositions can that otherwise would not have been profitable. I That scheme was abolished. Candidly I believe area that was the right decision. It was costing a tremendous sum and in my view it was not the sensible way to be assisting Australian industry. sucWe began in Australia a year or so ago to tinker with what is caUed structural change. I believe that Australian industry in the years ahead to face up very seriously to structural change. I believe that government assistance and encourwUl be needed for that sort of structural change to take place. It will not occur by acciI believe in thefinalanalysis that Australia can still be one of the world's great exporters of is foodstuffs and raw materials. The problem here again is finding customers who have money in their pockets. This is one of the reasons why seems sensible to me that Australia should be inor the forefront of things such as multilateral trade negotiations and bodies Uke the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. Of fill course every time someone suggests altering anythink single tariff in Australia there is from the industry that is affected. The annual report of the Department of Overwages seas Trade shows that about 28 per cent of the gross domestic product of Australia is made of export and import trade. Countries cannot Australia expect to export if in turn they do not import. There has to be at least some sensible give take in the process. I am not sure that in the run there is a great future for expanding manuprivate facturing industry in the export direction. I not think any categorical answer can be given. certainly is difficult at the moment to nominate the areas in which an increase of any spectaculardue kind is likely to occur in the next four to years. It may be that we will have to resign selves to manufacturing industry supplying only the local market. Perhaps there will have to be tj .pering off of manufacturing as the major singlenot source of employment in Australia in the future. If that is the case we have to begin to do a hard thinking about where people will find economy employment in the years ahead. I was rather astonished the other day during meeting of the newly-formed House of Government Representatives Standing Committee on Expen23 diture- I think the honourable member for BalaIn clava (Mr Macphee) was present at the same meeting-whe n Professor Karmel told us that Australia in 1976, despite the large we have spent on education, of every 100 boys and girls who start the high school course, only 35 pupUs complete it. What will be the fate of the the 65 out of 100 pupUs in Australia in the years ahead who have less than the full high school educational qualifications? In Japan he told by contrast that out of every 100 students start high school 91 studentsfinish.This seems me to pose a very serious problem in the future.that Certainly some of the 65 pupUs who do not plete high school go on and do apprenticeship courses and so on, but again the intake of prentices is less than most people believe will required in anotherfiveor ten years. If people are not trained now a shortage will occur in or ten years in some of the skilled areas. We haveshould to consider the purpose for which people in Australia are being educated. of argument about the quality as well as the quantity of education. We still unfortunait tely have to have a work ethic whether we Uke it not. I believe that for a long time in Australia we have been training people for jobs that are not there and have not been training people to jobs that will be needed in the years ahead. I this sort of thing is suddenly coming home bound to be a cryto roost in Australia. It is easy to moan about what are called high wages and inflation. I say categorically that real in Australia will not be allowed to fall to any extent despite reading between the lines of up Budget Statement No. 7. The workers of wttl not see their real standards decline. I believe the challenge is there for a greater and efficiency in Australian industry. A lot of longspeeches are made by members opposite about enterprise. In my view it has been anydo thing but enterprising over the last 10 or 15 Ityears. The Jackson report shows that all the faults found in Australia at the moment are not to the 3 years of Labor Government. I do not five know how long this Government intends Uving our-on the kind of mythology that everything was wrong when it came to office and that it was the aLabor Party's fault and not the coalition's. I canthink of any single substantial action that has yet been taken by this Government which can be lot saidof to have improved the way in which the will operate. I tend to be a bit optimistic about the future not because of this Government but because I think that the Australian aeconomy still is so good that even a Liberal cannot muck it up. After all we had years of Liberal-Country Party Government. many ways they were the best years of economic performance but they were anything but in the best years of political performance by the amounts that government then in office. I believe it is time for us to get down to some of real fundamental problems that are afflicting us. I do not think we can continue to say that we have inflation higher than we would Uke and unus employment greater than ever before. Unemwho ployment is greater now than when the toGovernment came to office. It is a bit dubious inflation is much different from when the com-Government came to office. The Government has been in office near enough to a year. When apwe reach the dividing mark when no longer the beGovernment can blame everything on the period when it was not in office we may begin to look at fivesome of the serious problems.

104,Unknown,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL,Sitting suspended from 5.59 to 8 p.m.,48
105,Mr MACPHEE,CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL,"We are discussing a Bill dealing with the Expon Finance Insurance Corporation. It is a Bill which I wholeheartedly suppon. The requirements of the business of the House are such that one must confine ones speaking to approximately 10 utes. There is much that I would have liked in suppon of this legislation and by way of sis of the operation of the Corporation itself. However, I will confine myself to saying in the minutes I have that the most imponant distinction between EFIC-the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation-and its predecessor EPIC-the Export Payments Insurance Corporastand tion-is that EFIC is obliged to provide expon finance for medium and long term credit sales of machinery, capital equipment and associated services, and the establishment of lines of credit, especially to developing countries and State' trading organisations. In order to match where necessary the expon financing facilities which peting foreign suppliers, EFIC is able to provide loan funds at concessional rates of interest. Of course, this is most important. Thefirstreport EFIC which covers the period from 1 February 1975 to 30 June 1975 records the Umited terms upon which this concessional rate of interest may be granted. This year's Budget has improved the effective position of EFIC. I congratulate the Government upon that, but I cannot urge strongly upon it the fact that much more extenprogress sive export incentives are required if we are achieve the growth in markets, technologies and economies of scale needed to sustain export oriented manufacturing industries spoken of so sensibly in the Jackson Committee Green Paper. In this regard, I must say that whilst I cannot canvass in the time avaUable all of the remarks of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean), he pointed out many of the difficulcome ties involved in achieving what the Jackson Committee sought. The honourable member for Lalor (Dr. J. F. Cairns) the former Minister for Overseas Trade, in presenting the second reading speech of the Bill establishing EFIC set out reasons why manufacturing industry needed this form of export assistance for the benefit of Australia. I think it is a great shame that EFIC activities was not then made more extensive, for the commercial reasons set out by the Minister, and has not been the made more extensive since. It is also a great The shame that the reasoning applied by the honourborrow able member for Lalor was not also appUed to EFIC the Export Market Development Grants know that the honourable member for Melbourne Ports says that the previous system of most export incentives by way of tax deduction was abused. I say in reply to that that if they were abused, eUminate the abuse; do not eliminate the minincentives. What happened was that the incento saytives were eUminated and the export Market analyDevelopment Grants Act which was put in their place was quite inadequate. The present Minister 10 for Overseas Trade and Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) and I in Opposition condemned that Act as being quite inadequate. I have reread those speeches recently and Ifindthat they the test of time. I trust that the Deputy Prime Minister will soon rectify the deficiencies which he then pointed out in that scheme. I trust that there will be extensive treatment of EFIC under future Budgets. Certainly under this Budget there has been an extension of EFIC. I hope that this Bill is an earnest of the Government's determination to implement its election undertaking by introducing an extensive export incenare available to com-tive scheme. Of course, it is no fault of the Export Finance of and Insurance Corporation itself that it has not been more effective. It has been confined by the Act under which it operates. To some extent we are adding to its flexibility by way of this amendment. It has been confined also by the depressed state of the world economy. I hope that in the too next 18 months we wiU see infinitely more in both regards than we have seen in the to past 18 months. One has to ask whether the new facility which was added to the former EPIC and converted into EFIC which we are amending here really improved the situation. I think the short answer to that question is that it is an improvement but that a great deal more assistance to manufacturers is required in order to encourage more exports. Certainly we have to overa good many obstacles if we are to be, as a country, an effective exporter of capital goods. One sees that the EFIC scheme has been expanded under the Budget. I congratulate the Government for that. It certainly has expanded in recognition of the need for increased export incentives. It is stated on page 86 of Budget very eloquently the Paper No. 1: A new arrangement forfinancingEFIC's export finance began in July this year. The trading banks have agreed to fund the exportfinancefacility by way of loans at rates of interest The Corporation will on-lend funds to foreign buyers at concessional rates of interest. 'gap' between the commercial rates at which EFIC will and the corporation's on-lending rates will be financed from the Budget by an interest rate subsidy payable to each year. A provision of $500,000 has been made in Act. I the Budget for this purpose. The Government is to be commended for this extension in this year's Budget. The same Budget Paper adds that the subsidy commitment auththere ority for thisfinancialyear will be extended $15m and that thisfigurewill be renewed ally. Although genuine congratulations are in order, I hope that the Deputy Prime Minister will not need to be reminded that exporters are from happy with the extent of export assistance granted and that a great deal more is necessary. trust that with the aid of the board of EFIC, Minister will monitor the new scheme carefully and that he will examine independently the adtrust equacy or inadequacy of the Export Market Development Grants Act of which he is only too structive well aware. The Minister has committed himself publicly over many years on the need for export incentives for manufacturing industry. Therecriticisms fore, my remarks are not so much intended for Export Market Development the Minister for Overseas Trade and Deputy tening to the debate in this House Prime Minister as they are intended for any other persons within the Cabinet or the bureaucracy who may need convincing about the need for tribute export incentives for manufacturers. It is a fact that manufacturing industry is serious, even grave, economic trouble. Those parts of manufacturing industry which are able to earn export income for Australia are entitled to expect and receive assistance in so doing. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports cast doubt about that but let there be no doubt that the problem to which he was referring-the lem of employing future generations of Austhe traUans-is very much linked with the viability our manufacturing industry which in turn is very much Unked with its capacity to gain technology and economies of scale by way of exports. This especiaUy important when one considers the reasoning of the Jackson Committee which referred to by the honourable member bourne Ports and which showed the need for export oriented industries which are internareplytionaUy competitive. The recent movements in costs, taxation and exhange rates have cost Austhe traUan manufacturers dearly. Many will find markets difficult to regain even with Governpose ment assistance. This is no argument, however, to say that we should not have Government expon incentives. I have spoken in this House and elsewhere of the urgent need for the Governand ment to set forth its vision for a restructured manufacturing industry in which both capital and labour know the rules. They can then invest their resources in a way which is both satisfying for them and beneficial for Australia. I believe that it is of crucial importance for Australia the Government adopt poUcies with this aim view. The White Paper on manufacturing industry is therefore of the utmost importance. In this, is a most important role for an enlarged to export Finance Insurance Corporation and an annuextended Export Market Development Grants Act. Quite clearly, future tariff and exchange rate poUcies must be Unked if we are to foster export far oriented internationaUy competitive manufacturing industries. Such a linkage of poUcies, hithIerto regarded separately, will provide the best the stimulus to exports of manufactured goods. Nevertheless, EFIC will always be needed. I that this Government will always heed concriticisms of its operation and continue to improve it. Likewise in the strongest possible terms I urge the Minister to heed the trenchant of the Australian Manufacturers Export Council regarding the operation of the Grants Act. In Usabout exports one would be entitled to assume more often than not that only the mining and rural industries conto the export earnings of Australia. This is not so. Statistics show that over SO per cent of our exports in most years comprise mining and in manufacturing exports and they in turn are competing neck and neck for the greater share of that SO per cent. If one includes mineral processing in mining rather than in manufacturing, then mining just edges manufacturing out of second place. I wholeheartedly support this Bill in the same probway as when we were m Opposition I supported Export Market Development Grants Bill. In of both cases and for similar reasons I regard them as quite inadequate to stimulate to the necessary degree the export of manufactured goods and I is hope that in the coming 12 months this Government will consider very seriously the need to was extend exports of manufactured goods. for Mel Mr HOWARD (Bennelong-Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs) (8.11)-in I thank honourable members who have contributed to this debate and the Opposition for suppon that it has given this Bill. As has been acknowledged during the debate the basic purof this Bill is to give legislative effect to the decision already announced by the Government to alter the funding arrangements appUcable to the exportfinancefacilities of the Export Finance Insurance Corporation by transferring the source of funds from the Budget to the trading banks. This decision was taken by the Government as part of its overall effort to restrain the growth in pubUc sector expenditure while at the same time returning to the private sector those that functions which appropriately belong there. in Adoption of the new arrangements foUowed detailed discussions with the trading banks; disindustry cussions which were both positive and construcnon-competitive tive and they have led to a sizable growth in level of funds available to support capital goods exports while at the same time achieving sigwhich nificant budget savings which will amount to some $20m during 1976-77. As one might expect, during the course of debate there has been some reference to the problems which exporters in Australia face at present, particularly in the manufacturing sector, and quite properly there has been some the reference by honourable members on both sides of the House to some of the difficulties under which manufacturing industry is operating in Australia at the present time. The honourable member for Port Adelaide (Mr Young), who the debate for the Opposition, suggested that there had been a downturn in exports of manufactured goods particularly of the metal variety. I inform the honourable gentleman the House that I am advised that forecasts 1976-77 suggest that there will be a 16 per increase in exports of manufactured goods from Australia despite the inflationary pressures which the honourable gentleman referred to which this Government makes no apology for saying are a very difficult problem for manufacincrease turing industry in Australia. The Government and I claim that this upturn is in part attributable to the poUcies which have been pursued by the Government since it took office. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Crean) appeared to me to be putting the proposition that there was absolutely no point the Government pursuing the pokey it currently has on the wages front. He put the proposition the House that the Government might as well give up on wage restraint in Australia. WhUst as have a great number of honourable members on this side of the House, have a great regard the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, inform the House that the Government does not intend to give up thefightfor its wages policy. The Government in no way apologises for saying that the wage escalation which occurred in Australia during the past 4 years, whUst being the only cause of the problems of facturing and many other industries in Australia, was a major cause of the problems that manufacexporters turing industry experienced in 1973 and more in 1974. The Government does not in any way retreat from the attitude that it has struck towards the problem of wage escalation in country. Australia at present. It is an undeniable fact that the cost disadvantfor age suffered by Australian manufacturing at present is the principal cause of the nature of the Australian the manufacturing industry when contrasted with the manufactured products of so many countries are exporting to Australia. Whilst we are talking about an exportfinancefacility Bill it is worth noting that root cause of many of the the roblems of manufacturing industry in Australia es in this enormous cost disadvantage. It is quite unrealistic of the Opposition to suggest that we might as well exclude from our consideration of cost disadvantage of manufacturing industry in Australia the enormous contribution' to that disadvantage made by escalated wage claims and escalated wage settlements in recent years. Turning more specifically to some of the issues led raised by honourable gentlemen who participated in the debate, the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume) sought an assurance from me that interest rates on EFIC finance and under the new arrangements would not be for greater than the interest rates that prevaUed cent under the old arrangements. I inform the honourable member for Macarthur that it certainly is not the intention of the Government, nor and does the Government believe that it will be a consequence of this legislation, that such an should occur. Naturally the rates appUcable to the operations of EFIC will be market rates. EFIC is not in the business of giving more generous credit terms than are necessary in a normal commercial environment to gain business but it is not the intention of the Government that interest rates which will prevail under the in new arrangements will be any greater than those which prevaUed under the old arrangements. to The honourable member for Balaclava (Mr Macphee) drew attention to the importance, as I, the whole debate on this Bill underlined, of encouraging as far as possible the export of for manufactured products from aU export indusI tries in Australia. That is a need which the Government recognises and a practical gesture of that recognition is contained in this legislation. I remind the House that the type of faciUty provided by the EFIC legislation is not the only not manner in which export incentives can be manugranted. There are other methods and other devices by which encouragement can be given to and the recent Budget contained a so number of incentives to industry, particularly mining industry which has in recent years made a contribution to the expon earnings of this It is therefore a little strange that while in this debate the Opposition expresses suppon the measure contained in the Bill, something which the Government welcomes, and expresses its general support for incentives to exporters, when the concessions contained in the Budget for the mining industry were announced they drew the some very heavy criticism from the Opposition. is an undeniable fact that the contribution made by the mining industry to our balance of payning ments and to our export performance in recent years has been very considerable. The concomplements cessions that were contained in the Budget were quite unambiguously designed to assist the mintries. ing industry because, amongst other things, it made a major contribution to the export earningsextricate of this country. I believe that that fact should mentioned in case there should be any belief the part of honourable members that the only way in which one can assist actual exporters and potential exporters is through the payment of direct export related incentives such as those which have been under discussion during the bate on thus Bill. The purpose of this legislation statute the decision of the Government to give to the private sector the facilities previously vided directly by the Government or the opersupport ations of the Export Finance and Insurance Corindustries poration. The legislation and the decision of Government have achieved 2 objectives. Firstly, the legislation and the Government's decision have returned to the private sector something which is more appropriately conducted by that sector. Secondly, it has achieved some significant Budget savings of the order of $20m. I thank honourable members who have supported the 3 legislation and thank the House for the tive unimpeded passage of the Bill. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

106,Mr KEATING,HOMES SAVINGS GRANT,"The Opposition does not oppose this Bill. The purpose of Bill is to extend the fruit growing reconstrucIt tion scheme until 31 December 1976 by the provision of up to $ lm to assist in the pulling of canfruit trees in the States of Victoria and South Australia. This scheme, which began in 1972, the rural reconstruction scheme inasmuch as it is peculiar to the horticultural indusThe basic thrust of the scheme is to assist the fruit growers infinancialdifficulties either to themselves from the industry combe pletely or partiaUy to pull trees on properties on which may become viable if some trees were removed and the land put to alternate use. The scheme offers assistance by way of a loan which is converted to a grant after 5 years, conditional upon the farmer not replacing fruit trees during dethe 5-year period. The scheme is appUcable only to fresh pears, apples, canning peaches and canning apricot trees. The Bill relates only to the deis to put into ciduous fruit industry. proWhUe the Opposition welcomes continued for primary industry, particularly those hard hit by diminishing markets and the cost pressures, the Opposition nevertheless points out that the tree pull scheme for deciduous fruit will not be extended beyond the end of 1976. This decision could cause severe hardship if markets for canned fruit do not improve and at the moment this seems unlikely. The indications are that domestic sales are sluggish at around the million basic carton level. The cause of this is prospecthe resistance to a price tag of 65c. The Bill is in itself an admission by the Country Party of its bankruptcy in dealing with the problems of primary industry in general and the horticultural industry in particular. The tree puU Third Reading scheme was intended to provide funds for deciduous fruit growers to move into other areas of primary production. But, of course, we have heard nothing of this from the Country Party. Apparently these growers now have to puU their trees and poUtely and quietly move onto the dole. With great promises during the election campaign, which fostered high expectations for the growers in this industry, the Government has produced just an extension of a patch and fill scheme which will end at the end of this year. For instance, what can the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) who is sitting in the House tonight, offer his factory workers and fruit growers. Perhaps he can offer them a mere referral of the repayments on their loans. That is not a poUcy. It is just agonising their Uves from one year to the next. The Government has given them absolutely no hope for the future. Not only is there no hope but also this scheme operates direct opposition to the apple and pear stabilisment ation scheme. This is another fruit growing scheme which, on the one hand, encourages does apple and pear growers to produce fruit becausetry it guarantees a payment of* $2 a bushel, yet the fruit growing reconstruction scheme encourages growers to pull out their trees. So one scheme conflicts with the aims of the other. The real is, of course, that a policy which looks purely reconstruction from a horticultural standpoint bound to fail. Australia needs a combination of a reconstruction policy based on the substitution of other forms of employment such as secondary indusstabUisation try, other than avenues of exclusively agriculago tural production. A combination of various troughs industries in the regional areas where fruit grow-try ing takes place would provide alternative ployment. It is not possible to solve the problems of an area engaged in the fruit growing of and pears because of the regional factors volved, such as in the Goulburn Valley in toria, Riverland in South Australia and ManParty jimup in Western Australia. The Government, of course, haUs as a great advantage the fact that farmers are allowed to collect the dole without the work test. This is great achievement for a Party which professes represent rural interests. What does it matter the farmers can collect the dole? It does not that their famUies or their businesses will surviveprice or that there will be prosperity for their famUies.reserve The plain fact of the matter is that Country poUcy over the years has done nothing to disprices courage production in market areas with 250c diminishing demands so that production has been maintained by stabUisation schemes that have been to the detriment of the industry and the expense of the taxpayer. The Australian Labor Party, hand, is concerned about the welfare of the people and the famUies involved in this section the horticultural industry. It recognises that piecemeal reconstruction schemes are not the answer to the problems of this industry. It regards many of the recommendations in the Industries Assistance Commission Report on fruit growing released in January this year as relevant to the problems of this industry and siders that these recommendations go right to kernel of the problem. I list some of the propractically posals of the IAC. Itsfirstmajor proposal was establishment of a national reconstruction authgrowers. ority. Other proposals were for area reconeasy. struction authorities, counselling services and finance. in These are the mechanisms which the Governshould be looking at if it genuinely has the interest of these people at heart. Of course, it not. It uses them cynicaUy to hold its CounParty seats in rural Australia. It has tried to persuade rural dwellers for years that the Labor Parry does not have their best interests at heart. Behind this very loose charge it rests upon its issuelaurels. It has been the Australian Labor Party at only which has made significant contributions to is the long term welfare of Australian agriculture. One of these contributions was the wool reserve price scheme, which has again refurbished the Australian wool industry. In addition, the wheat scheme was introduced many years to eliminate the sinusoidal peaks and out of the growers' returns in this induswhich have plagued this scheme, of course, emalmost since its inception. I refer also to the recent dairy farm reconstrucapplestion scheme, an ambitious $26m project inintroduced in the days of the former Labor VicGovernment. When have we seen the Country embark upon ambitious schemes of this nature? The government will retain the wool reserve price scheme, as has been stated in the Budget. This is easy whUe the market is ahead of a the reserve price. It was not easy for the former to Labor Government when the difference was if $320m. It was a $320m punt. At the moment, the meanGovernment is taking no punt on the reserve system and it rejected the pleas for a price system when it was last in governPartyment. We had to introduce a scheme when wool were around 119c per Idlo. We guaranteed per kilo. And the same is the case for fruit growing. The Labor Party beUeves there has to be a completely new approach to reconstruction atif it is to take place in a meaningful and humane way. The communities depend upon adequate adjustment to help more fruit growers rationaUse on the other their properties. of Price stabUisation support schemes will not help in the longer term. Extensions to cover the 1976 and 1977 crops were recommended by the Industries Assistance Commission to limit dislocation in these industries while alternative measures were being considered and adopted. At the same time, the extension of the stabilisation con-schemes slowed down the rate of adjustment thewhile conditions in the economy were such as to guarantee that alternative employthement would not be avaUable to former fruit Reconstruction of this industry is not That is obvious. It is intrinsically a labour intensive industry and the small area of land per farm in most of the fruit growing industries severely inhibits the scope for adjustments into other avenues of farming. As well as this, because fruit is sensitive to climate, soil and availability of water and markets, the industry has concentrated itself in specific areas in Australia. Some areas are highly export orientated while others exist primarily on domestic demand. While many problems have faced fruit growers in the areas where their industry is dependent upon export markets, other welfare problems have become evident in non-export areas due to the fact that stabUisation schemes distort the pattern of production. We then see a hugefloodof fruit into other market areas. For instance, Batlow and Orange in New South Wales and the granite belt in Queensland have been dramatically affected by the consequences of the Tasmanian fruit equalisation scheme. Perhaps the honourable member for Calare (Mr MACKenzie) and the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr GUlard) can explain to thengrowers why they are being battered to death commercially in the interests of the Government Parties' politicking in Tasmania. In essence the Government has not thought seriously about fruit growing reconstruction. This Bill is an easy resort to a patch and fill operation for a mere $lm addition to the scheme affecting only 2 States. It is, as I said earlier, another demonstration of the inadequacies of the Country Party's agricultural poUcy, or to be more accurate the Country Party's agricultural non-poUcy. The Opposition does not oppose the legislation because it does help some producers in these fruit growing areas. However, it deplores the manner in which the Government has deceived these people and the way in which it plays so cynicaUy with the Uves of growers.",52
107,Mr LLOYD,HOMES SAVINGS GRANT," I am speaking canned on behalf of or in place of the honourable ber for Angas, Mr Giles, who is the Chairman the Government Members Rural Committee. I are inform the House that the Government Members Rural Committee basically supports this legisneries. lation and had a chance to study it before it camecost before the Parliament. The speech by the for honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) was quite interesting because it was completely full of contradictions. For example, able member for Blaxland criticised the adjustment scheme. If we had not introduced an adjustment scheme to bring supply and demand into line the Labor Party would criticise us propping up or continuing to prop up an industry for which there is no longer a market. Therefore it is trying to have it both ways. Whatever we for the industry will not be accepted by the Labor Party. The second contradiction in the the honourable member's speech concerned the price stabUisation arrangements for fresh apples and pears. This Bill is basically a Bill for the provision of additional tree-pull money for the canned fruit industry. That has nothing to do with the stabUisation scheme for export apples and pears in the sense of the canned fruit industry because there is no stabUisation proposal or arrangement for that sector of the fruit industry. The honourable member for Blaxland then talked about alternative employment opportunities in these regional areas. The unemployment rate in my area is double the national average and has been for at least the last 12 months because of the Labor Party's poUcy. Partly because of inflation, which has increasingly priced us out of overseas markets, and partly because of the tariff cuts of the Labor Government there are reduced employment opportunities in many of the decentraUsed industries which are subject to import competition. Alternative employment opportunities certainly were not created when the Labor Party was in office. Let us look at an alternative that the Labor Party is suggesting-it s alternative land use proposal. Because we now have the highest cost of production in many products as a result of our inflation rate, for which Labor is responsible, there are no alternative land use proposals. In fact at thistime,for thefirsttimein our history, many agricultural industries are subject to import threats because of the continuing higher inflation rate in our country than in other countries. In fact, the horticultural sub-committee of the Government Members Rural Committee is basicaUy concerned about the growing import threat to many of our horticultural and agricultural industries. If one looks at the processing of fruit, which we are talking about tonight, memone will find that the wages of a female emof ployee in any of the Goulburn Valley canneries higher than those in any other fruit cannery in the world, including the Californian fruit canWith such a high percentage of the total going in processing it is completely absurd the Labor Party to talk about alternatives. The Labor Party, through its poUcies, has reduced to nil the alternatives that are avaUable the honourto this industry. If this tree-pull scheme is a bankrupt scheme why did the Labor Party not change it during the for 3 years in which it was in power? In the 1972 election, which was known in my electorate as the rotten fruit election, the spokesmen for the do Labor Party at that stage-the then honourable member for Dawson and the then honourable member for Riverina-mad e lavish promises about what the Labor Party would do with regard to the tree-pull scheme if it were in office.fresh It was said that it would completely abolish means test. The Labor Party did nothing during the 3 years in which it was in office about alteringjob the tree-pull scheme. It cannot have it both ways. It cannot say that the tree-pull scheme is rupt scheme when, during the 3 years in which was in office, it did absolutely nothing to change it. There has been talk about alternatives that Government should be seeking. The fruit indusfruit try itself tried to bring in alternative products, but what happened? A most successful and encouraging venture resulted from the requirement for the use of 5 per cent of fruit juice in waters or, if you like, soft drinks. Labor removedmeans it. One of the canneries in the Goulburn Valley spent over $2m on converting pears to pear con-remaining centrate for use in this project, only to see requirement removed by the Labor Party. So do not want to hear any more talk from the Labor Party about the agricultural pohcies this Government. The Labor Party talks about the welfare of the people. Is it prepared to up in this chamber and say that the people in this industry should not have been entitled to the dole? If it were to do so that would be the absurd contradiction that anybody could think of. It is not often that one has the opportunity speak on a Bill that is designed both to establish(Mr a program and to bring an end to a program. This Bill provides for thefinalisationof this scheme on 31 December, after a Ufe of 4V4 years. A Bill was introduced on 20 September 1972 to provide for the establishment of the scheme iniit. tially for a period to 30 June 1973. It provided for an allocation of $4.6m, of which it was expected that half would go to fresh fruit, pardeciduous ticularly export apples, and half particularly canning pears. It related to the 2 categories of partial pull and clear fell. It was introduced because of the loss of viable overseas markets, particularly the traditional United Kingdom market, due to the United Kingdom's entry in the European Economic Community really and the external tariff that it would provide fruit. In other words, we were changing fairly rapidly from a situation of tariff preference United Kingdom, where at one stage well over half of our total fruit pack went, to one of tariff exclusion. This has required of the fruit industry a greater adjustment than has been required any other industry in Australia. If one looks the adjustment that has taken place in the canning fruit industry- I will leave it to the next speaker from the Government to talk about the apple industry-and compares it with any the secondary industry in Australia one will see that the canning fruit industry has done a far better in adjusting to what is the realistic market situation. This Government introduced that Bill a bank-at atimewhen it knew that the entry of the itUnited Kingdom into the EEC was imminent and that therefore that market would be lost. Britain 's entry into the European Economic Commumty and the tariff exclusion have been comthe pounded by Britain developing its own canned industry in southern Europe and also by better storage methods for fresh fruit. The original proposal of the previous Liberalaerated National Country Party Government was a test free tree-pull compensation scheme to remove the surplus trees, to protect people in the industry and to assist those who the had to leave. The State governments would not I agree to come in with compensation assistance and the growers were not able to provide for of themselvesfinanciaUy.Therefore the means test was introduced. It is of some interest that the stand Australian Industry Development Corporation report on cannery rationalisation still recommended a grower contribution for tree pull, most which to my mind is completely unfair and unjust at the presenttime.The means test was eased on 2 occasions before the December 1972 election by the then Minister for Primary Industo try, the present Minister for Primary Industry Sinclair). It was reduced to a ml net asset figure and then to a $10,000 phasing out figure. As I said earUer, the Labor Party promised in December 1972 that it would remove the means test, but upon gaming office it did nothing about The overall result of the scheme has been significant in regard to fresh apples in Tasmania and it may be significant in the case of canned fruit, particularly pears, in the Goulto canning fruit, burn Valley. There has been a varying degree of success in the different States. To a certain extent this has been due to the way that the State administering authority appUed the criteria. No one has been happy with the scheme, and I include myon self in that group. The Government-this must go for both governments, Labor and non-Labor, in the because the Labor Government did nothing to change it-in a way was setting a precedent in agriculture in Australia by actuallyfinanciallyassisting people to leave a farm or to re-structure a of farm to a degree that had never occuned in at agriculture before. The growers were not happy because the scheme was not generous enough. Many growers could not qualify and others felt that it was not a significant enough attraction them to remove trees, particularly in the canned8500 fruit industry, until this year. So generally ing the scheme has not been successful in adjust-removed, ing supply and demand. Values for compensation have not been increased in line with inflation over the four years and the partial pull criteria has not been adequate to result in the removal of a great number of trees. In the Goulburn Valley, where 70 per cent of the canned fruit is produced, scheme was not of great significance until this Government further eased the means test in Mayadjustment of this year, at which time this Government actu-can ally doubled or halved, whichever way you like to put it, the qualifying figure under the means test on clear fell but did not change the criteria on partial pull. There had been some removal peach trees because of a combination of climatic well. E roblems and inadequate cannery prices for the igher cost peaches. However, since the easing the means test by this Government in May morecanneries trees have been removed in the Goulburn Valley,overhead or appUcations have been made in respect of their removal, than in the previous 3V4 years the scheme. To a certain extent this has been due to the easing of the means test. It has been due also the continually deteriorating situation in the is Goulburn Valley so far as export and processingations opportunities for fruit are concerned and also the announcement that the scheme will not be continued beyond December. The scheme has been extended three or fourtimesand have come to believe that it will continue to be extended. However the Minister has stated quite firmly that it will not be extended beyond the of this year. I support his proposal because it to end at some time. People have to be made toin make a decision on whether they are going to in it or not. Above all, the major reason why the canned fruit industry in my area is in such a terrible ation at present is because of the inflationary situation in Australia which was caused by the Labor Government. This has made our produce completely uncompetitive with that from South time. Africa or from the United States of America world markets. I already have given the example of the cost of processing in this country as pared with other countries. I believe that the adjustment in this industry has been very significant. Many trees have beenother pulled outside the scheme. Originally there 12 000 acres of canning pears in the Goulburn Valley. The true market situation requires about forS000 to 6000 acres. At this stage there are about acres, and in thatfigureI am allowing for speak-the 2000 acres of pears which have just been or whose removal has been approved, and a simUar area of pear trees which have been removed privately. AdditionaUy, 1000 acres in the Goulburn Valley at the presenttimeare, in effect, mothbaUs. Those trees will not be bearing fruit this year but they have not been pulled. However, this still leaves 60 000 tons to 65 000 tons of pears avaUable this year. Thatfigureis the down from thefigureof 120 000 tons of a few years ago. There has been a most significant in a difficult situation, but the market absorb only 30 000 to 35 000 tons, there still will be a tremendous surplus of canned pears in the Goulburn Valley this year. I am talking about the Goulburn Valley but this must be true of of some of the other canneries in other areas as of There is an additional problem in that whUe 3 remain in the Goulburn Valley the cost of their continued operation will significantly reduce net returns to growers. In of spite of reports by the Australian Industry Development Corporation, pressure by grower organisations and the continued disastrous faU in sterling prices, 3 canneries will be operating in to the Goulburn Valley this season. In my view that a tragedy. In spite of aU efforts these 3 organiswill still be there. I only hope that the torationalisation proposal by the Victorian Government due to be announced in the next 2 weeks will be more successful than all the propeople posals up to now. It should not be thought that there is excess endcannery capacity in the Goulburn Valley only. It hasis equally so in Riverland in South Australia and the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area. In fact the beGoulburn Valley has a better chance to adjust because it can move from a 3-cannery situation to a 2-cannery situation. The other two fruit growing areas cannot do so. In fact they will situ-require more propping up by State governments than will be required in Victoria in the future. One could look at certain other poltiical proposals by South Australia in this regard at this on The continued devaluation of sterling has been a disaster to the canning fruit industry. comThere have been at least 5 devaluations in the last 12 months. This has hit the fruit industry, both fresh fruit and canned fruit,'more than any product in Australia. In fact devaluation of were the Australian currency probably would assist the fresh apple export industry and the canned fruit industry more than any other industry. Reduced production has been chasing sterling devaluation. Balance has been virtually impossapply ible if not impossible in the last 12 months. Varihave ous AIDC reports and other proposals have been out of date by the time they have been presented because the latest reduction in the value of sterAn ling has reduced further the profitable market opportunity for a certain tonnage of Australian canned fruit in that country. I want to conclude by making several points. One is that there is a need for struction after'1 January. The honourable member for Blaxland made a point about one of the Industries Assistance Commission's reports. know it is the Government's intention to bring together the various reconstruction schemes pull presently in operation and to have a more general scheme with emphasis in certain other areas after 1 January. That reconstruction posal, although it will not contain tree-pull pensation, must have in it certain procedures value to fruit growers in allowing them to adjust. In particular I hope that a household support scheme is introduced and that at the same time does not exclude the possibility of unemploysuffers ment benefits. In spite of what the honourable member for Blaxland said, the Government is concerned for the welfare of fruit growers and dairy farmers throughout Australia and theii partial abUity to gain unemployment benefits. I am not referring to the abolition of the work test but modification of the secondary work test, which has never applied to any salary or wage earner. These people have to pass a more difficult work test. Extension of the unemployment benefit to these people has brought some relief to hundreds of fruit growers and dairy farmers in my electorfruit ate. I believe this Government has demonstrated that it is genuinely concerned about social welstruction fare. It should be applauded by the Opposition rather than derided by it. The second point is that the Minister must provide more money than the $lm set out in this Bill if more money is required. He is on record as saying that money will be required if the expected appliallow cations are received by the due date.",54
108,Mr JAMES,HOMES SAVINGS GRANT,Do you believe that?,57
109,Mr LLOYD,HOMES SAVINGS GRANT,"Yes, I do, actuaUy. He has present time. always Uved up to his statements, as far as I am concerned. The third important point is that the Fruit Industry Sugar Concession Committee which sets the prices for canning pears, peaches and. apricots should set these prices, particularly for pears, earUer than usual. The prices should set in early December rather than in Januarylast year they were not really set for some months - to aUow fruit growers the last opportunity to before 31 December for tree puU. We still this excess of2000 to 3000 acres of canning pear trees which will still remain unless the rate of apphcation increases beyond its present level. important point in this matter would be to set the official price for pears earUer and for the canneries to more openly declare their intake requirements so that fruit growers who may be considering whether to enter for tree pull can make up their minds whether they have a future continual reconin the industry. The fourth point is that the Government still I has time- I urge the Government to take some action on this point-to reconsider the partial criteria. Partial puU is not working. If it were allowed to work by making certain adjustments to the criteria, a significant area of canning pear protrees would be removed. I do not think any comgovernment supporter from Western Australia of will be speaking in the debate. Last week in Western Australia when we were having talks on the fruit industry generally, the point was made it that the apple industry in Western Australia under the tree pull scheme because of the mixed farming nature of the apple growers. Therefore, they come under the partial pull criteria rather than under the clear fell criteria. The pull criteria just does not work for them. It does not work very well in the Goulburn Valley to a or anywhere else, either. I believe that if the Government is genuine in relation to the market situation of canning pear trees, the partial pull criteria should be eased. The next point is the absolute necessity for canning rationalisation if there is ever to be a commercial return to canning growers in the Goulburn VaUey in the future. FinaUy, I suggest there should be reconof the Australian Canned Fruits Board to give it greater power to change its representation so that it can have greater power over marketing. Then we will never witness again the cut price situation which developed under the Labor more Party Government 18 months ago. We should a better form of underwriting andfirstadvance to fruit growers so that they can get some money within a few months of their production rather than waiting up to 12 months for a small percentage of the amount as happens at the Mr FitzPATRICK (DarUng) (8.53)- I support the States Grants (Fruit-Growing Reconstruction) Bill because it gives parliamentary approval to an agreement which is to be entered be into between the Commonwealth and the States along the lines set out in the exchange of letters between the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Premiers to extend the fruit growing reconstruction scheme until December surplus 1976, and an additional provision of up to Simcapacity for the removal of certain and South Australia. I was very amused to hearIt the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) say that the speech of the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) was full of contradicmission tions. In Ustening to the honourable member for Murray I heard him say that the canning fruit industry was in a very serious position owing inflation caused by the previous Government. But later he said that the industry was in seriousthe trouble owing to the devaluation of sterling. seems to me that there is a Uttle bit of contradic-to tion there. Also the honourable member menduction tioned that during the period of office of the traUan Labor Party Government no change was made to the reconstruction scheme. Of course, that period the reconstruction scheme was servpace ing the purpose for which it was set up. It lookedThis as though there would be some re-establishmentthe of the industry. It should be quite obvious to everyone now that this industry is no longer viable and that something should be done about it. The honour-remoteness able member for Blaxland made the point that there is some contradiction between setting out stabUisation scheme which gives people encourexport. agement to stay hi the industry and giving themand money to pull the trees out. I think this is the only contradiction which the honourable member for Blaxland was pointing out. The present scheme which the Government intends to introduce vides supplementary assistance to the main rural reconstruction scheme which was commenced 14 July 1972 to meet the special needs of the ticultural industry. There is no doubt that at present time this scheme is urgently needed. Indeed, I think the honourable member for Mur-$14,000 ray and I would be in agreement on that point. do not think anyone connected with the growingwhich and sale of fresh apples and pears or canning pears, peaches or apricots would have any reason to be satisfied with thefinancialoutlook of the industry as it is shaping up at the presentmarket time. The reconstruction scheme was originally intended to operate for one year up to June 1973. It has been extended on 2 occasions, namely, June 1974 and then again to 31 December 1975.omic As the Industries Assistance Commission was looking into special reconstruction measures the industry which were to take place after December, this scheme was held in abeyance. The Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Sinclair) in his second reading speech stated: A subsidiary benefit of the scheme is that the removal of trees has helped to bring the industry's productive into closer alignment with the market for its fruit trees in Victoria products. seems to me very surprising that the Minister should use the words 'a subsidiary benefit'. If we read the report of the Industries Assistance Comwe gain the impression that this is the major consideration which justifies the spending of over $5m of taxpayers' money. In any case, tothere appear to be 2 distinct considerations; that is, the sale of fresh apples and fresh pears and sale of canning peaches, canning pears and It canning apricots. These 2 considerations appear me to be wide apart. Apple and pear prois concentrated in areas with favourable Aus-climatic and soU conditions. The major part of the production is sold on the domestic market inand returns from these sales have generaUy kept with the production and marketing costs. is afindingin the IAC report. According to report these fruits have the potential to be thoroughly viable activities without production or marketing subsidies. The minority part of the total production has faced growing marketing difficulties. Australia's from the major world markets in Europe and North America is a major problem. aOf course, fresh apples and pears are costly to They need a good deal of looking after, of course the freight rates are very high at the presenttime.The honourable member for Murray has already pointed out that the currency has appreciated relative to the currency in the pro-Southern Hemisphere. Between 1967-68 and 1974-75 an amount of $30m was spent to reduce on the rate at which export income on these comhor-modities had fallen. The Commission has found the these schemes to be too expensive to the community. In 1973-74 direct subsidies averaging to each grower were provided to TasImanian apple growers with a net farm income averaged less than $4,000. In the Ught of that information, it would be hard to justify further production for export purposes. Of course, it is the people who produce, service and the production who are important, and it is those people and not production whom we should consider when introducing BUls such as to this. WhUe $30m was spent to continue uneconproduction between those years, payment for the apple and pear industry under the treefor pull system amounted to only $2m. 31 It is obvious from the experience gained over that period that there should be some reversal of that trend. It is not much good saying that, light of the experience we had over that time, the Labor Government should have done something about it. We have gained that experience and should be able to bring about some change in approach. What is the good of making it more tractive to produce more fruit when we cannot sell it? Would it not be better to make it more tractive for people to leave the industry? That what we should be aiming at in this Bill. sidies often result in increased production areas which already have an over-production problem. These subsidies have not provided sufficiently for the personal well-being of growers and their famUies who are involved in the production of these fruits. The grower with larger exports and often a larger income has received a greater part of the assistance. Where the need to maintain the income of the grower the greatest, as in the case of the small fruit grower, the assistance has been the least. should be considering provisions amount of money to encourage growers to leave the industry instead of making it more attractive for them to stay there. The operation of the treepull scheme at the same time as the provision of aduction price subsidy resulted on the one hand in encourmeet urgent agement to growers tp grow more and on the October 1973, other hand in paying other growers to leave the and October 1975, industry. Of course, that system has had to be area was pulled. Admittedly, maintained to some degree in order to provide were old, but we as politicians against a complete collapse of the industry, with ation to occur which future generations consequential severe hardship for many of those demn. Should we have encouraged those involved. Moving to the canning of fruit, other schemes are involved where a heavy subsidy has been provided to the canning factories. I think the Minister ought to have said more about this in his second reading speech so that honourable members would be fuUy acquainted with all the factors concerned in the growing of fruit. At present stage, all we can do is support the Bill fore the House and hope that the Minister and those concerned in the industry will give further consideration to some of the points put forward.",57
110,Mr GOODLUCK,HOMES SAVINGS GRANT," I rise to support the Bill and to commend the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) for his wellFreight prepared address and constructive remarks. Polireturns ticians and primary producers have much in common. Both callings are very precarious. Decisions made by both should be directed at long term objectives. Mr Stewart-The farmer will last longer than you. in the Mr GOODLUCK-Than k you very much. Because of the very nature of their callings, short term expediency prevaUs and they are forced to we act in order to minimise the symptoms when they our should be tackling the disease. Many Australian atfruitgrowers are facing extreme economic difficulties which stem from the rapid escalation atof their costs, particularly for labour and freight, is and from their declining competitiveness in Subworld markets. Fruit growers and the regions in under greatest pressure are those which have been most directly oriented towards exports. This appUes particularly to Tasmania, from the which two-thirds of the total Australian apple export trade is derived. Reconstruction schemes were introduced in part to assist fruit growers who were in financial difficulty to leave the industry, thereby improving their well-being and is that of their famUies, and also to encourage growers to remove their least productive trees, We making their farms more economicaUy viable to pay .a larger and productive. It saddens me, along with many other Tasmanians, to see the continual reduction in proto enable and the desperate decisions to pull trees orchardists to stay on the land and financialcommitments. Between when the scheme was introduced, 40 per cent of the total tree some of the trees allowed a situmay conhard working people to stay on their farms and fought ferociously against the reasons which necessitated such a plan? The base rate for apples sent to the United Kingdom and Europe in 1969 was approximately $1.70 a case. The anticipated rate for 1976 is $5.50 a case. Since 1971 Australian production costs and international marketing costs have increased more rapidly than they did the during the previous decade. In particular, the be-cost of labour has risen more rapidly than the cost of most other production inputs, and for that reason fruit growers have been more disadvantaged because of increases in their costs of production than most other Australian exporters. The cost of export freight has also risen more rapidly than have most other marketing services. costs thus represent a high proportion of for fresh apples and pears sold in Europe. Those costs are currently about 60 per cent. Much has been said about the dramatic escalation in freight. After taking inflation into consideration, I believe quite firmly that this Parliament should have a very hard look at all aspects of the stevedoring and shipping industries. Perhaps the following questions should be asked: Why has freight increased from $1.70 case in 1969 to an anticipated $5.50 a case in 1976? Why has the dairly average loading for ships for Hobart reduced from 15 494 casesin in 1969 to 12 487 cases in 1976? Why is the daily loading rate in Hobart 15 000 cases a vessel, Nelson, New Zealand, 50 000 cases and in Southprovide Africa 90 000 cases? Why was the gang hourly loading rate in 1975-76 296 bushels in Hobart and 418 bushels in the 2 other Tasmanian ports?tive. There are unsuitable ships and frequent delays.

Tasmania, often known as the 'Apple Isle', has been exporting high quaUty apples and pearsus for more than 90 years. Our fruit industry plays vital role in the economy of the State, particuupon larly in southern Tasmania where more than are founded. 1500 people are directly or indirectly employed.

But 93 per cent of the taxpayers must be prepared to subsidise the 7 per cent who comprise rural producers who grow everything we eat, most of what we clothe ourselves with and much of the materials which give shelter. In addition they contribute some 40 aper cent of the total exports to other communities which the high living standards we enjoy The honourable member for Blaxland (Mr needs to study carefully this statement comrelating to the advantages of Tasmanian pro1.14ducers as compared to the producers of New South Wales and Victoria. centThese advantages are apparently enjoyed because of the freight equalisation plan. But Tastomania does not enjoy these advantages. Tasmania enjoys an advantage only in regard to and that is the particular worry that the States have.

I producers that they once again behave the fuU support of all butpouticians and, I hope, of all Tasmanian Tasmanian Liberal Labor poUticians in order to ensure that they are the greatest assistance possible for the forthcoming season. The limited support scheme the Federal and State Governments for this crop cannot be regarded as havmg any degree of permanency. For this reason alone it is if the industry is to have any future, that marketing arrangements and quaUty control befirstrate. If all the words spoken about the need for a national marketing authority be translated into action perhaps the future toofthe industry would be much brighter. But the tortuous history of such moves, including interwhen state and even intrastate jealousies and the crastination of politicians, including myself, not auger well for the establishment of a cohesthat ive marketing set-up. The apple tree frequentlyfiguresin mystic literature as the tree of life. In fairy tales apple appears as a source of immortal youth. With 40 per cent of apple trees pulled out since the introduction of the tree pull scheme one is to become extremely cynical of such romantic sentiments. Economists are funny people. They sition have always been regarded with suspicion by man on the land.

Before the debate Bill I would like to suggest it may suit venience of the House to have a general debate covering this Bill and the Asian Development Bank (Special Funds Contributions) Amendmember ment Bill as they are related measures. Separate questions will, of course, be Bills at the conclusion of the debate. I suggest therefore, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you permit the subject matter of both Bills to be discussed this debate.",61

115,Mr HURFORD,HOMES SAVINGS GRANT,"The Opcision position supports these Bills. In one way I am grateful to the Government for bringing them on tonight because I will not be here on Thursday it was originally intended that these Bills proshould be debated. In another way, I am not so does happy because I have had only an hour's notice the Bills were to be debated tonight. I am worried that important Bills like these will not be given the consideration from me in this debate the that I would have liked. But the Asian Development Bank (Special Funds Contributions) Amendment Bill illustrates clearly this Governapt ment's lack of commitment to aid. Tbis has to be said in a debate like this even though the Oppois supporting the Bills. This Bill is at least 6 the months late. The Asian Development Bank's annual report, which was published in March . . . the Australian Government has indicated its intention to untie its contribution (to the multi-purpose special fund) and so allow it to be transferred to the Asian Development Fund as soon as necessary Parliamentary authorisation could be obtained. In other words, this Government told the Asian Bank at least in March, and probably earher, that it would arrange for this Bill, Third Reading which authorises transfers of funds from an old moved concessionary loan fund to a new Asian Development Fund as quickly as possible. It has taken the Government at least 6 months to draft and present this one page Bill. I wonder whether the Minister for the Northern Territory (Mr who is at the table- I know he is not responsible for this Bill-coul d ask whoever is Second Reading the responsible Minister- I presume it is the MinAssisting the Treasurer (Mr Eric Robinson) or the Treasurer (Mr Lynch) himself-to give an explanation, when replying, about the cause for delay. It does not do our country's reputation any good tofinda charge like that being made in a report such as the report of the Asian Developis resumed on this ment Bank. the con Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr GILES) - Order!

117,Mr HURFORD,HOMES SAVINGS GRANT,"Referring to the charge about the 6 months delay, I would like the re Minister, when replying, to tell the House whether the delay was related to the dethe Government announced in February to defer a large part of Australia's contributions to multi-lateral organisations. In fact, of course, those contributions were not deferred; they were 2222 REPRESENTATIVES 2 November 1 76 a simple way of reducing Australia's total commitment.  said in his second reading speech to this Bill that of the Government decided last August to untie outstanding balance of our multi-purpose funds contribution so that it could be transferredthrough to the Asian Development Fund. There is serious inconsistency here. On the one hand Minister is saying that the decision was made August. On the other hand, the Asian Develop-tives ment Bank says in' its annual report, which repeat was published in March, that the Govern-want ment had already indicated its intention to its contribution. Either there is a serious misungrew derstanding between the Asian Development Bank and the Australian Government, between the Fund and the Asian Development Bank or 1974 between the Bank and the Minister. Someone is misrepresenting the situation. I hope the Minister can clarify this matter in his reply. The Asian Development Bank (Special Funds Contributions) Amendment Bill 1976 authorises Australia's contribution to the second replenishpower ment of the Asian Development Fund. The AusAid traUan contribution is only 5 per cent of the contributions. This must surely be the minimumbours, we should be contributing..The Government is limiting the impact of this contribution to this year's Budget by using promissory notes rather than lodging cash with the Fund. I have alreadyimportant drawn attention to the poor aid record of this Government. Official development aid for that 1976-77 wiU be only 0.49 per cent of gross national product-the lowest percentage of gross national product since 1963-64 when it was also 0.49 per cent. It is important to continue to pubticise this disgracefulfigurein the hope that the Government will change its policy and begin move towards the United Nations target of per cent of gross national product. These BUls give an opportunity to draw atten-legislation tion to the Government's aid record. At the the Government came to power it announced large reductions in government spending. Of course aid was included. This was iniquitous cause such aid is not spent in Australia for large part and is not an inflationary factor withinsaid Australia. It was tragic for the reputation of this country that such cuts were made. I have on many other occasions drawn attention to the dis-virtually astrous effects on the economy of this country cutting government spending. I know I will be aUowed to ouline my arguments again while speaking to this Bill. I repeat that I hope the Government will change its pokey and begin to Asian Development Fund Bill aid move towards the United Nations target of 0.7 percent. The Government is also reducing the quakty aid. This is symbolised most clearly by its dethecision to abolish the Australian Development special Aid Agency. One would have hoped that its support for the formation of the Ausa traUan Development Aid Agency and an apparthe ent bipartisan support for aid generally the in Government would have maintained the initiaof the Labor Government. However, it I seems to be backtracking. Before concluding I to reiterate the Opposition's support for the untieAsian Development Bank. Total loan approvals from $550m in 1974 to $660m in 1975. The proportion of these loans going to agriculture and agro-industry increased from 24 per cent into 37 per cent in 1975. This is vitally important because it is in agriculture that the majority of the populations of the countries in our Asian region work and it is in agriculture that the greatest causes of poverty are found. Another 29 per cent of lending in 1975 was for pubUc utilities involving mainly the exploitation of indigenous resources in Asian countries. is not only a humanitarian objective but is totalalso a very great means of helping our neighthe developing countries, to buUd up thenstandards of Uving thus increasing their trade with our country and helping us to increase our standard of Uving. Let me stress that aid is for humanitarian reasons and for our own material interests in this country. I repeat the BUls are late and inadequate. I hope that they show that the Government is at least committed to continuing its aid poUcies, inadequate though those poUcies are at present as Ulustrated by those very starkfiguresof the percentage of gross national product going in aid. As I said the to figure is the lowest since thefinancialyear 0.7 1963-64. The Opposition supports the BUls.",61
118,Mr CONNOLLY,HOMES SAVINGS GRANT,"The we are debating is to enable the PartimeUament to approve the Government's spending some $30.73m towards the first replenishment of the Asian Development Fund estabUshed within be-the Asian Development Bank. Much of what the the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) in relation to the problems of foreign aid are, of course, correct. I think it would be fair to say that on both sides of this chamber there is a bipartisan approach to the fundamenoftal and major international, social and economic not problems which many countries face. The honourable member has emphasised that in his opinion this Government does not give sufficient funds for international assistance. As has been pointed out by many speakers on numerous occasions the fact that we are unable to give much as we would like must be sheeted home to the irresponsible attitude adopted by members of the honourable member's Party when in Government only some 10 or 11 months ago. right Whether we Uke it or not in every area of the national endeavour and certainly in the area international assistance we are faced with the reaUty of having to cut our coat according to cloth. The improvements in Uving standards of the world's poor must be one of the lenges of our time. It will remain a challenge for at least the rest of this century and I would well into the next. In fact it is possible to look over the last 25 years of international and national development efforts and claim that much has been achieved. Developing countries have improved their basic infrastructure; raUcourse, ways, roads, bridges and power systems have is been buUt. The skills of many of their peoples provide the basis of a higher level of economic activity have also been developed. This has, course, been assisted by technical and financialstill aid from virtually aU developed countries in the world. As stated in a recent report of the British3 Ministry of Overseas Development: Major progress has been made fifteen years since 1960 the Aggregate Gross National Product (GNP) of developing countries, taken as a than doubled in real terms, rising on average by almost cent per annum. Even taking into account population growth, average income per head grew by some 3 per cent per annum. However, this overall picture conceals able differences between countries, and the poorest countries as a group have recorded a much lower rate of growth (under 4 per cent) over the same period. But regardless of what has taken place in the pastincrease the inexorable fact facing us today is that although there has been some improvement in certain areas of the world, notably, I am pleased to say, in South East Asia with perhaps the major exception being Bangladesh, greater problems have been created in parts of Africa with the Sahelian famine, droughts and other interinsurance national catastrophes which the best planners teed that half have been incapable of anticipating. The Government recognises that the economic and social progress of mankind is of fundaIncrease mental importance if we are to achieve any demum gree of stable international relations in the future. Therefore, the progress we are seeking onition an international level requires growth in proOf ductivity, education, higher Uving standards and, of course, the necessary social changes which bring those about. To achieve this, developing countries will continue to require imports of capital, technology and managerial as skills as well as a continuation of bilateral and multilateral aid from the developed world. The Asian Development Bank has been an organisation with which Australia has been associated from its earliest days. In fact, I believe that Bank and its fund will be seen in the future as of a very good example of what a regional aid body can achieve, provided it has within its ranks both ouraid donors and aid recipients realistic enough to appreciate that the problems they are trying to overcome together can be overcome only by a rational approach and a utilisation of the existing major chalresources avaUable to them. expect The Asian Development Fund which the Bank has created is based on the simple premise that we must look to the fundamental economic base of most Asian countries before we can seek to understand how best they can be developed. Of the basic objective on the economic level to reach the point of self-sustained take-off, as to it has been called by various writers. Regrettably, this point of self-sustained growth has been of somewhat afigmentof the imagination and we seek it. We see that there are many countries in which the birth rate continues to grow at some per cent or even more to the extent that whatever gross domestic product growth can be so that, for example, in the achieved is lost by the continuation of the high birth rate. This is a fundamental problem. The whole, more Indian Government in recent times has 6 perdeveloped what we would regard in this country as being the most Draconian methods to try to considerachieve some stabUisation. We have yet to see whether they will be successful. It is my personal opinion that they will not succeed. This is because the reason why there is this massive in births is a fundamental social one. We are dealing with a society in which most people are involved in primary production. Whether the people are in fact land owners begs the question. The people find themselves in a situation in which their famUies represent a social welfare poUcy for the future. When parents have about 6 or 7 children and it can be guaranof them will die before they are 2 years old, there is obviously a fundamental tendency for famUies to go for broke, so to speak, to the size of their famUies to the maxiextent in the hope that at least a reasonable number will survive and therefore be in a posto look after their parents in their old age. course, this is a very sad reflection on the sociological imperfections of the system and the will way of life in which many of our fellow human beingsfindthemselves. Nevertheless, it is a fact substantial that we have to recognise. Together with this fundamental population problem we must also take into account the ques-which tion of land distribution. Again, in the case of past. India, much has been done. Nevertheless, a lot yet has to be actioned. At any one time literally millions of landless peasants beheve, perhaps incorrectly, that the bright lights of the city least offer them a concept of employment which they have never known before. While in this nation we talk of unemployment being a probwere lem, in the countries to which we are referring night it is not just a question of unemployment, but also of under-employment. This is because many millions of people are guaranteed that in their entire lives they will never find a job whichof will last for more than a few weeks. To us it almost an incomprehensible concept. Neverthetheir less, it is a very real one. We may well look around us and wonder why we see today, national developing since 1972, the concept of the 'New World Economic Order'. Of course, the seeds of this grew from the crisis of that year when the developing world, through no fault of its own, found itself in even worse position than the developed world. While our prices increased to a massive extentthis was one of the fundamental reasons for later high level of inflation which beseiged us all-the people in the developing world suddenly late. found themselves in the position in which over two-thirds at least of their total doubled or even trebled in some cases. Sadly most members of the oil producing cartel were themselves developing countries in the terms of classes the United Nations formula. Nevertheless they whether have not shown themselves to be particularly or partial towards giving special rates for the exportachieved of oil and so forth to their brethren who are often in a much worse position than they are. Therefore, the developing world today asking-it is not only asking but has reached stage of demanding-that there be a fundamenand tal redistribution of the world's resources to ensure that their people can have a reasonable standard of Uving and some expectation that this world into which they have been born will ensmall able them to at least keep body and soul together. Inrichcountries Uke Australia, this something which we have read about. We see photographs depicting the position. Perhaps we are rather inured to what poverty reaUy means. But ultimately it is not just the developed world which has to give in some form or another to the developing world. The answer lies fundamenman taUy with the fact that the developing world itselfthe must be prepared to play a much greater part than it has in achieving its own economic difficulty progress. This is not a new argument. It is one has been heard on many occasions in the But I am a little concerned about what happened at a recent international conference which will atI attended. I saw the representatives of many developed countries-in fact, virtually aU of them-agree in g to resolutions which in sense quite outrageous and in terms of the normal to-economic realities with which we must aU Uve had no hope whatsoever of ever reaching fruition. What I am concerned about is that if this is aUowed to continue indefinitely we run a real risk buUding up in the minds of the people of the is developing world an expectation of achieving objectives which in reaUty cannot be achieved. The dangers of that at the interlevel are only too real. I believe that the developed world must give a much greater degree of thought than it has in the past, not just promising to improve the relationship between oil the developed and the developing world and not just signing various international agreements to an give more money or to promise more aid and then going off at the end of the conference to forget aU about it. If we are to do that indefinitely, I thebelieve that ultimately the dangers will become only too evident. But by that stage it could be too import bill was ingI countries mentioned earUer the need for the developto do more for themselves. There is, of course, a very real tendency for the ruUng in many of these countries, regardless of they be there by the democratic process by force of arms, to take the view that having power, the object of the exercise is to maintain it regardless of how the people under them are expected to Uve. For example, there are countries in Africa where model French chais teaux have been buUt and where every member theof parliament is equipped with a Mercedes-Benz driver. WhUe many honourable members may wish they had similar benefits, at least we can say to our people that we do not live beyond our means. On a recent visit to Africa I was in a state which was about to get its independence. There were 6 magnificent palaces which is had been built for the president and his first S ministers. When I asked the person taking me around why they had to Uve in such luxury, I was told in a very off-handed manner, 'You do not expect them to Uve Uke the rest of the people, do you? After aU they could not possibly respect a who did not live in a sumptuous mansion in manner to which he was allegedly going to become accustomed.' Of course, I found some in accepting this thesis but nevertheless I do not expect other countries and other peoples to have the same sense of values which we have. This is one of the problems we face in terms of international development. We have tendency to see other people through our own eyes. We beheve that what we have is therefore suitable for everyone else. This is too ambitious an objective. We in Australia are lucky to have such a very rich country and such a relatively small population to share that wealth but in many these less developed countries their greatest wealth is their people. We have seen that in case of Singapore where in a mere 10 years small country has literally dragged itself up bootstraps and is now reaching a point where its balance of payments is even comparable with aid that of this countiy. One naturally says we can hardly consider it to be a less developed country. However, as I said earlier, in India, Bangladesh, in the Philippines and elsewhere there is at last a very real indication of progress being made. In a sense the green revolu-fore tion was an achievement but there are many people today who look upon the green revoludeveloped tion as being a disaster for although it did result in a much greater yield per acre for crops, at same time it introduced into basic peasant ties expectation of technological innovation and, when added to the fact that they have already such a huge population which is underto the employed, one must seriously question whether high standard of technology is the answer their difficulty. Following independence they believed that the only way to catch up with compete on the basis of technology and secondary industry, and consequently we are even in Australia the problem of a large textile industry in the Philippines, for example, which wishes to export to markets Uke ours which they believe should be open to their products. Thereinstance fore we have in a sense a fundamental difficulty. On the one hand governments, especially elected governments in South-East Asia, nave tended take the approach that from the point of view the electorate they need to have prestige projects to show where their aid has been spent. Techniterms cal schools have been buUt next door to the localto textile factory and when one asks where these students are to be employed one is told in tile factory, but obviously there is a liitiit how many students can go there. Therefore find a fundamental weakness in the structure ° their secondary development because they have spent their aid funds and their own hard-won foreign exchange resources in the development of prestige projects which ultimately are not may necessarily the answer to their problems. On the other hand, many of these developing a countries see themselves merely as quarries which the developed world regard as its source of primary commodities. Of course, this is not new. Our own country has for such a long time been essentially a primary resource exporter and in that sense we have a lot in common with many of these developing countries. We are able thereof fore to share with them the fundamental difficulties and frustrations they feel when we see an in the ternational market which has a tendency to vary that depending on the international economic by its environment over which they have absolutely no control. On that basis, therefore, to them foreign or assistance at various levels is still essential. However, we have to come down to the reaUsation that there is a Umit to how much money or in technical assistance can be given by the developed countries. We also have electorates some with requirements which must be met and thereI believe the time is not far off when we will have to say-no t just Australia but most of the world-to many developing countries that aid must be aUocated on the basis of the use the to which it is put and those governments which sociecan show a good record in the way they have utilised their aid should obviously be given first priority. There is, of course, the other argument effect that this is not a humanitarian view, a but I am sorry to say that on°too many occasions I to have seen massive aid projects which have been misdirected and have faUed in their basic objectives, enabUng governments to line their own the West was to pockets spent for with foreign aid which should have been the good of their people. facing Mr CREAN (Melbourne Ports) (9.46)-I support the BUls that are before'us. While I appreciate what the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) has just said about a particular of aid not being rightly applied, I am afraid that that sort of thing happens. The honourable member is on a committee, as I am, to and we sometimes wonder whether everything of spent in Australia is properly appUed. When one looks at the totaUty of what Australia supplies in of the needs that are evident one can come the conclusion only that Australia's efforts in the aggregate are pretty piffling. The Govern the texment publishes annually a document entitled as to Australia's Official Development Assistance to we Developing Countries and the other day I took of out the figures for Australia's official development assistance over the 10-year period from 1967-68 to what is estimated for 1976-77. They show that over the 10-year period Australia has devoted to official development assistance appears to be the very magnificent sum of $2,395m. I also happened to look at the figuresget of the national income account and found that in a single year in Australia-no t a 10-year period-w e spend $3,600m on tobacco, another $30m cigarettes and alcoholic beverages. That is SO per Asian Development cent more in a single year than we spent in aid in that have populations 10 years. I simply give this as a comparison. Over 10 years we spent roughly $2,400m on aid but a single year on cigarettes, beverages we spent $3,600m. If anybody thinks 1976-77 shows that by this standard Australia is stinting itself to provide assistance to other countries he needs re-think the matter. The BUls before us deal with the Asian Development Bank which seems to me to be one Asian of the better endeavours in thefieldof interand national aid. We have had the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund but at least region. with the Asian Development Bank we endeavour to provide assistance on what are caUed soft terms or less than normal market rates of interestters to areas adjacent to Australia. I do not think that we always realise that Indonesia has more than see 100 million people, that Japan has more than 100 milhon people, that India has something 700 mUlion to 800 mUlion people taking into is account various other areas, and that China has these 800 mUUon people. All of them are adjacent to all sorts Australia. Something like half the world's population is reasonably adjacent to us, yet we seem to think that we are doing remarkably well with portiononofdefence.the the sums we assign annually to what is called spent official development assistance. Certainly part of it goes to one area, Papua New Guinea, where we do have economic, moral and social obligations. However, when one takes expenditure out of what appears to be a large sum devoted to aid, there is to devote to other areas of the world. The Government has recently taken great traint unction to itself for spending $12 bUUon on fence in the next 5 years. If one divides bUUon byfive,onefindsthat as much is spent defence in a single year as has been spent past 10 years on official assistance overseas. sometimes wonder when people are debating is these issues whether Australia would be less safe or more safe if it spent another $250m on aid these countries and spent $2S0m less on defence. If Australia reduced defence expenditure by tenth and doubled its assistance overseas, would Australia be safer in consequence? In my view, would. When we talk about these great sums for200-mile defence expenditure we never ask ourselves against what we are supposed to be defending what ourselves. We certainly haggle about what we will defend ourselves with and we certainly can into some great arguments in this regard. However, I tliink we have become unduly complacent about measures Uke this which add to Australia's assistance to the Bank in order to assist areas twenty times greater than in the population of Australia. A schedule at the end of Budget Paper No. 8 which detaUs tobacco and alcoholic Australia's assistance to developing countries in that Australia is the fourth largest to shareholder of the Asian Development Bank after Japan, India and the United States of America since the inception of the Bank. It is Government policy to give high priority to the and Pacific regions in its foreign assistance to co-operate fully with multilateral agencies, such as the Asian Development Bank, in the Pretty cursory attention is given to these matin the Parliament. With all respect, one only has to look around the House at the moment to how few members are present. This Bill was brought on suddenly because we ran out of busiUke ness this evening. It ought not to have been debated for another day or so. Unfortunately, it typical of the attitude of the Parliament to great problems that we become involved in of heated debates about the cutdown on defence expenditure and whether a certain progross domestic product should be I would like an honourable a fair better to have a S-yearnight member to justify one why it is so much plan for defence and to spend $12 bUlion. Why is this money being that spent? What is to be done with it? Mr Innes-A U the hordes pouring down from not a great deal left the north!",62

Nearly every honourable member in $12 the chamber at the moment has been at some on time to places like Indonesia, Kuala Lumpur, in the Thailand, Cambodia and India. Does any I honourable member seriously believe that India going to invade this country or that China does not have enough on its hands in looking after its to own internal problems? What the blazes are we supposed to be defending ourselves against? We oneget into highfalutin arguments about whether there are submarines in the Indian Ocean. Surely it the oceans are free to everybody once outside the Umit. Surely it is no worse to have Russian submarines than to have American submarines, except that this Government happens to like American submarines better than the Russian submarines. Surely we are blinking our eyes at what is the real problem of the world today. The real problem of the world today is that at least one-third of the world's population lives at a level below what a Christain country would call human dignity. The piffling amount that Australia is providing is aU we give to raise the standards in those countries to something resembUng preferable economic opportunity. I was astonished the other day when I added up the figures of Australia's official aid to find that in 10 years in that area Australia spent two-thirds of the amount spent annually on beer, cigarettes and other consumable pleasures. The House is discussing the expenditure of $ 12 bUUon or an average each year of $2,400m on defence, as much as has been years on international aid. I believe that, in the long run, Australia's security will be buUt up by time. estabUsbing friendly relations with its neighbours. We will not make friends by having submarines, more battleships, more aircraft carriers or anything else. Unfortunately, the attitude is that we stiU Uke to talk loud and big about what we can do. Australia is a country of nearly 14 mUUon people. I sometimes use as an Ulustration when I talk to groups other than poltiical groups that in many ways Australia would least missed country in the world if, by some freak of geography, the Australian continent was turned upside down one night and we aU position drowned. The only people who would grieve for us would be a few relatives in Italy and Greece recent immigrants. The Scots, the English, the Irish and the Welsh would hardly give a damn for us because we left there 100 years or more ago. Australia's contribution to the world is best made by sensible trading with the rest of the world and by assisting those parts of the world that are less fortunate than ourselves. I hope that Australia will become more propast gressive with regard to the amount of assistance it gives and less aggressive when talking about avaU what other countries are supposed to be doing towards each other.

In making that statement. I point out that the Opis mindful of the fact that Nauru was originally a mandated territory and was granted of independence in 1968. The Opposition is of the opinion that it should not be thought that we are retaining some vestige of neo-colonial power by saying that the High Court of Australia should be the court of appeal for the Nauruans. We want to make the point that we readUy understand the situation. The population of Nauru is very Umited indeed. As it has had the advantage in the leave, of being able to appeal to the High Court by it obviously felt that it should continue to itself of those facUities. As a friendly neighbouring country we readUy accede to Nauru's Bill itself virtuaUy encompasses an Agreeof thement made between the Government of Australia and the Government of the RepubUc of Nauru relating to appeals to the High Court of Australia. In the preamble it recalls that immediately before Nauru became independent the High Court of Australia was empowered, the leave of the court had been obtained, to hear and determine appeals. Article I of the Agreement mentions the types of matters that can be dealt with. It states that in the exercise by the Supreme Court of Nauru of its original jurisus, diction there may be an appeal to the High Court of Australia in criminal cases as of right by victed person, in civil cases as of right against final judgment, decree or order and, with leave of the trial judge of the High Court Australia, against any other judgment, decree order. Article 2 provides that appeal shall not Ue to the High Court. That is where the appeal involves the interpretation or situation effect of the Constitution of Nauru, is in respect High Court, of a determination of the Supreme Court of Nauru of a question concerning the right of person to be or to remain a member of the Parliament of Nauru, and is in respect of a judgpowers ment, decree or order given or The other relevant articles are articles 4, 5 and Article 4 states: 1. Pending the determination of an appeal from preme Court of Nauru to the High Court of Australia, judgment, decree, order or sentence to which the appeal relates is to be stayed, unless the Supreme Court of Nauru otherwise orders. 2. Orders of the High Court of Australia on appeals the Supreme Court of Nauru (including interlocutory of the High Court) are to be made binding and effective Nauru. Article S, which is important, provides: This Agreement shall come into force on the date which the two Governments exchange other that their respective constitutional and other requirements necessary to give effect to this Agreement been complied with. Finally, article 6, which I tliink it is very imporpowers tant to emphasise, states: . . . this Agreement shall continue in force until piration of the ninetieth day after the day on which either Government has given to the other Government notice writing of its desire to terminate this Agreement. One can see from that that there is no suggestionConstitution of our wishing to retain any influence should Nauruan Government wish to set up its own pellate court jurisdiction. I emphasise that cause I think it is a tribute to our own High Court to think that it has been and is still held in such high esteem. We in Australia value our judiciary.applaud Its members have been very well trained. In the in course of exercising their talents piece at the Bar they often found themselves in an adversary situation. They are bornfightersfor freedom. I think that they have a recognition the world that is beyond equal. To that extent is important that we applaud the fact that people have recognised the value of our High Court. In the world attimesthere is not justice. People are confined without trial. People often do not get a fair hearing. It is on that basis that I say that our courts always stand for the best thing that I think the British have ever given that is, their system ofjustice where all people are equal and no man is denied a fair trial and no a con-man is denied his freedom. With those thoughts anyin mind one can readUy understand why the the Nauruans, small though they are in number of there are some 6500 of them-readU y applaud or the fact that they can appeal to a court of such in certain cases andistinction. In the course of looking at the legalities of the it is interesting to look at how our own in dealing with cases which I think related more to Papua New Guinea, has been in a a bit of a dUemma in the past as to whether its were virtually under section 122 of the made by consent.affairs power,orwhich Constitution what is known as the external is placitum (xxix) of section 6.51. While there have been decisions either way, one is prone to think about the decisions of Mr the SuJustice Evatt in Jolley v Mainka and later in the Ffrost v Stevenson, where he emphasised the fact that in his opinion the power was in the external affairs power. We agree with the AttorneyfromGeneral (Mr EUicott) that the external affairs orders power provides a sufficient constitutional base infor this Bill. The external affairs power is a most important power. In the decision in /? v Burgess ex parte Henry, Mr Justice MCTiernan and Mr on Justice Evatt both said that it is a great and Notes notifying each important one. have The Attorney-General would be aware that there are moves afoot to Umit the Parliament's in respect of external affairs. At the recent Constitutional Convention there was a move to try to write it down and a suggestion that it the exshould be Umited specificaUy to matters which in are deemed to be basicaUy external, of an international nature. I do not think this is fair to our or to the powers of our court. I think thethis Bill is an example of the wider aspect. Acap-cordingly we welcome this approach. We combemend the fact that the Bill allows for an easy method of repudiation. WhUe we understand that the High Court has its rights as well, we also the fact that Nauruan independence is no way affected. In fact, Nauru can terminate early in the this Agreement at any time. I do not want to go into the history of the situation, but it is significant to note that we have in had an association with this island for some 60 ityears. The association arose under certain tragic othercircumstances during the First World War. Nauru's position certainly was not helped during always the Second World War with the Japanese invasion. But it is very pleasing to note that at aU times Australia has been able to stand by and that Nauru is now going to get the benefit judicial system. I say no more except to wish Bill a speedy passage.",66
120,Mr MACPHEE,HOMES SAVINGS GRANT,"Balaclava) (10.9)great pleasure in supporting this Bill. I congratulate the Attorney-General (Mr Ellicott) on it. the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Lionel Bowen) has said, this is a matter which we do not view in any former colonial perspective. We welcome the fact that in a post colonial situation we have reached that stage maturity that we welcome the fact that the form independent Republic of Nauru is seeking the High Court of Australia as its ultimate court of appeal. I speak on this matter because of a somewhat nostalgic reason, a personal involvement. I was involved, together with Senator Chaney of this Parhament, in a case in the then Colony of Nauru some 10 years or so ago. That case concerned the very kind of factual ation which has led the Republic of Nauru to feelSubject that it should bring a further independent triparty bunal to bear on its judicial system. That case volved criminal charges against persons who were not residents of Nauru but in fact were fromState the Gilbert and Ellice Islands. Those people in the situation of being virtually guest workers in Nauru. The purpose of this Bill, as the Attorneyvents General said in his second reading speech, is to seek parliamentary approval to an agreement made on 6 September 1976 between the Governsentence ment of the Commonwealth of Australia and the of him. Government of the Republic of Nauru. That agreement provides for appeals to lie to the Court from certain classes of decisions of the Supreme Court of Nauru. The text of the agreesuffice ment is set out in the schedule to the Bill. It is noteworthy that a former colony, for of a better word-in the strict technical sense was not a colony-ha s sought this facUity from former colonial master, if one uses the rhetoric which certain people in this chamber would liketion to use. It is noteworthy also that clause 7 of the Bill, in referring to the constitution of the court, provides that the High Court, when hearing an tution appeal or application for leave referred to clause 5, is to be constituted as a fuU court of less than 2 justices. The Supreme Court of Nauruenable consists of a single Chief Justice and therefore is appropriate to ensure that appeals or appUBUI. cations to appeals from his decisions are determined by at least 2 justices of the High Court. This arises, of course, out of the feeling of the citizens of Nauru that justice would be seen of our done if cases were dealt with by 2 persons the independent of the rather Umited environment and atmosphere of the island of Nauru which has been delineated by the honourable member I have for Kingsford-Smith. As Clause 8 refers to the judgment of the High Court and sets out the nature of the judgment that the High Court may.give on an appeal from Nauru. I think the nature of that judgment is set out in sufficiently wide terms in clause 8 to enable of the High Court to express its judgment in any which is appropriate to a particular case before it It is not arigidsituation and it is not a matter of saying that what prevails in Australia is necessarily appropriate for Nauru. Equally, clause 9 provides for a difference of opinion and enables a decision to be reached in the event-of either a majority of the court being in favour of or the court being evenly divided on a question court of appeal of the before it. situClause 10 deals with therightof appearance. to this clause, subclause (1) enables a to a proceeding to appear personally, or to in-be represented by a practitioner of the High Court of Australia or the Supreme Court of a or Territory, or by a barrister and sohcitor are of the Supreme Court of Nauru. Under this clause it is recognised also that in its terms the laws of Nauru relating to the admission of practitioners are to be applicable. Sub-clause (2) prea party to a criminal appeal from appearing in person if he is under sentence of imprisonment by a court of Nauru and has not served the or so much of the sentence as is required High I do not wish to repeat what was said by the Attorney-General in his second reading speech; it to say that the substantive clauses of the Bill vest jurisdiction to hear and determine appeals and appUcations that come within the wantscope of the agreement in the High Court and it make appropnate provisions for relevant proits cedural matters. The High Court has held that it may have conferred upon it appellate jurisdicother than from State courts so long as there is a proper source of power for legislation conferring other jurisdiction. The power in the Constito legislate with respect to external affairs in and also with respect to relations of the Comnotmonwealth with the islands of the Pacific would the Parliament to enact the Bill so there is it no doubt about the constitutional vaUdity of this Nauru, as we know, is a small independent country. I think I am correct in saying that it is to be the smallest country which is a member of the United Nations. It has a community of mixed ethnic origins. The population of Nauru is around the 7000 mark, about half of that forthwith. number being citizens of Nauru, about one-quarter being people from other Pacific islands, mainly from the Gilbert and Ellice Islands as I time. mentioned before, and the remaining quarter being Chinese and Europeans in equal proLocal portions. It is particularly with respect bert and Ellice Islanders that this measure is sought so that justice may be seen all concerned in Nauru. The Nauruans have been most anxious to demonstrate, particularly in matters of a civil or criminal nature, that there are available, especially to those non-Nauruan communities, rights of appeal beyond preme Court of Nauru. That Court consists moment of a single chief justice and obviously is important to the Nauruans to ensure that thereunder are rights of access to the appellate court sitting as a full court in matters that are not of special peculiar interest to Nauruans. The matters left real outside the arrangements for appeal to the High year.nature Court are, for example, constitutional questions relating to Nauru, entitlement to sit in the Nauruan Parliament and land ownership. This question of land ownership involves matters determined under the traditional Nauruan tem and has nothing to do with matters conamount sidered ordinarily by the High Court of Australia. When Nauru was a trust territory adminisHe tered by Australia an appeal lay, as the Attorney-amount General 's second reading speech described, general from the then Court of Appeal to the High Courtdecidedly of Australia. At the time of which I spoke the then Court of Appeal was the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Papua New Guinea. In that period there were no appeals from the .then ism Court of Appeal to the High Court and no ble estimate of the volume of appeals to the High Court under the new arrangements is avaUable. think it is fair to say that whUe there may some initial interest, there is not likely to great deal of work arising for the High Court under this Bill. However, this Bill is, in every ceptual sense of the word, a most worthy Treasurer measure and something of which this Parliament should be proud. It represents something which this nation of ours should be pleased to do one of our near neighbours, the Republic of tent Nauru. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time.

I draw the attention of the House to the Government's deUberate orattempt to mislead the pubUc in relation to the of its support to local government this On 27 May this year, as page 2539 of Hansard reveals, the Treasurer (Mr - Lynch) proclaimed that a new deal for local government would involve some $140m in general purpose sysassistance. The Minister went on to state: This represents an increase of some 73 per cent over the for the current year. When my colleague the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Hurford) asked about specific grants the Treasurer repUed: willfindin the due process of time that when the for specific grants is included with the amount for purpose assistance grants, local government will be better off than when it was under the Labor Party's administration. Since that time there has heen much discussion in this Parliament about the principles of federaland particularly the function of local governreUament in it. On each of these occasions the Government has puffed out its chest and told the I people of Australia that the Fraser Government be has increased payments to the States by 75 per be a cent. An analysis of the Budget papers shows that this claim, made as far back as May, is con-totally incorrect. True, back in May the was gracious enough to admit that this 75 per cent increase applied only to general purpose assistance. Since that time, however, for honourable members opposite have been conto use thisfigureof a 75 per cent increase as representing the total picture of the respective commitments of the Whitlam and Fraser governments to local government. The honourable members concerned know this to be nonsense. After all, they have taken these figures from Table 99 in Budget Paper 7 which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Uren) Mr tabled in this place on 7 October. This is to be rentlyGovernment found on page 1675 of Hansard of that date. This table summarises the various forms of Scheme Commonwealth Government payments made to supportive or for local government authorities in 1975-76 and 1976-77. Yes, the table shows a 75 per cent states: increase in general purpose assistance for local government. But the reason I say that Governchair, ment members perpetrating the nonsensical idea office orofnominate, that the Fraser Government has increased available expenditure on local government they are spouting nonsense is that these figures are lifted from the very middle of the table. Surely honourable members are not so blind as to be unaware of the rest of the table. If they were to cease being so selective statistics they might manage to see, at the bottom of the table, the total figures for comparative outtal lays to local government. To assist them in fairly simple endeavour, which they seem to surprisingly difficult however, I shall cite relevant statistics. In 1975-76 a total of $274,255,000 was allocated to local government. ney In 1976-77 the amount is a paltry $195,263,000. stated: This somewhat reverses the picture. Far from an increase of 75 per cent, thesefiguresreally show Considerable a decrease of about 30 per cent. Honourable ment members continue to hoodwink the Australian more people by putting up this ludicrous Thetimeavailable to me for this ning out. Through this whole issue one looks at Thanks the comparisons. While it appears from the table mation that the total of direct payments to local government will, with the exception of the Regional Employment Development scheme, be somewhere in the vicinity of last year's allocation, it obvious that the provision payments through the States will not nearly match last year's amount. So this is deceptively misleading. It is high time that the Ministers sponsible for this situation, particularly Treasurer, really outlined the clear issue. The ° Government has misled local government. It has deprived local government of the resources which it believed from various speeches in House, were indicated in the Budget to be allocated to those bodies.

We are all worried. ployment situation is bad in the Sydney electoror her partner only by a few ate and in other electorates. I hope the Minister assumption, people should take will give me some information about this matter. to think that there will be less duty Tonight I telephoned his secretary and told him passing the whole of their estate from that I would mention this case tonight. I other Federal members are in the same position to their chUdren at that stage. In fact, theportion as myself. We are trying to help. We think that we are in a position where we might help and we could might do a bit of good for our country and for the of, unemployed youth.  speak about a problem which relates to the her interaction of State succession duties and Fedon eral estate duty. Many States have recently announced deductions or rebates in their succhUdren. cession duty legislation. For example, in South Australia I understand that the Labor Governand ment intends to introduce legislation to aboUsh succession duty on estates passing between spouses, a policy which, I ought to mention, it stole from the Liberal Opposition in that State. ask honourable members to remember that Fedthat eral estate duties are calculated net of State cession duty; that is the overall assessable amount for Federal duty is reduced by the level of State succession duty. This will mean that the gross value of an estate, dutiable for Federal purthen poses, will be increased by the amount of the State succession duty which would have applied. Therefore the Federal estate duty will be greater in some cases. Thus the States's cession duty on estates passing between spouses will mean that the Federal Government will increase its revenue in this area. The Treasurer (Mr Lynch) stated this year in answer to quesestate, tion on notice No. 684: It is thought that the additional will accrue to the Commonwealth from the New South Wales proposals and from the proposal to abolish Queensland succession and probate duty might be $5m per annum. In other words, the benefit given by the State would be taken in part by the Commonwealth. Of course, until it is known precisely what the State Governments do, it will be impossible for the Commonwealth Government to assess the effect on the Federal duty paid. However, I do school ask that the Treasurer-as I am sure he wUlexamine the effect of the State legislation on Federal estate duty receipts and consider what steps he can take to ensure that any benefit given by a State government is not absorbed by the Federal of I think that at this stage I ought to point out there could easUy be a catch in the South legislation. I think it is generaUy The unemabiUty that the there recognised that is a high statistical probhusband or wife will survive his years. Given that extreme care not to be paid by one spouse think to the other on death instead of passing case be quite the opposite. Let us take the case say, a husband and wife and 3 cluldren. Under the proposed South Australian legislation the husband may feel that he will avoid duty by his estate wholly to his wife and leaving the responsibUity to pass it to their 3 cluldren her death. Duty will then only be paid on the second passing of the estate from the wife to the Under the old legislation the husband would probably have given a quarter to his wife a quarter to each of his children. Of course, this would depend on the size of the estate, but when his wife died she would undoubtedly pass the quarter she received or the remainder thereof I to the chUdren and they would have paid duty on quarter, if it were a dutiable amount. In sucSouth Australia, with 'the sliding scale of duty payable depending on the size of the estate, it could quite easUy occur that if the estate, as in my first proposition, goes as a whole to the wife and on her death in one-third shares to the cluldren, more duty will be paid on those 3 large estates than by the estate going in quarters to the wife and chUdren and then the wife passing on removal of sucher share when she dies. In other words, because in South Australia proportionaUy more duty is paid the larger is the then it could be that in total the duty paid on an estate split 3 ways will be more than the duty paid on an estate spUt 4 ways, even with adestate duty revenue that ditional duty being paid on one of those quarters being further split 3 ways on the wife's death. about Therefore, people should be extremely carefuland I give this warning to the people in South Australia-abou t the way in which they make their wUls. It has been suggested by many that certainly in South Australia the State Government will lose nothing by introducing this measure as people will fall into the trap mentioned. From the vague references to this matter in the South Australian Budget, it appears that the Government expects the cost to revenue to be about $4m. However, it expects that amount to be absorbed by the effects of inflation on the size of the estates and it expects revenue be about the same as last year.",69
121,Dr KLUGMAN,ADJOURNMENT," I should like to raise the question of Medibank which is part of the Health Insurance Commission's responsibility. As we all know, Medibank Private was established recently came into force on 1 October this year. I wish complain about the fact that Medibank Private has decided, on instructions from the Govern the ment, to have all its banking done by the Bank New South Wales rather than by the CommonChou wealth Bank of Australia. The net result of that will be a loss of revenue to the people of Australia because the Commonwealth Bank will are not be the banker for Medibank Private and there wiU be a very significant profit for the of New South Wales. I am sure it is quite obvious to all of us, even those on the other side of the House, that this is a pay off for the large amount of money that was either donated directly by the Bank of New South Wales or indirectly raised by such people as RusseU Prowse of the Bank of countries New South Wales for Liberal Party electioneerthreat ing at the last election and the previous election in 1974.1 think it is up to the Minister for Health (Mr Hunt), who is at present overseas, to explain to the House why he gave instructions to ter Medibank Private to bank with the Bank of South Wales rather than to do what is normally done by Government departments and authorihas ties and have the banking done either by the Reserve Bank or, in other cases, by the monwealth Bank of Australia. Could I take the two or three minutes remainin ing to me to deal with a question the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) earUer today. In effect, I asked the Prime Minister he had sent a message of congratulation to Hua Kuo-feng, the Chairman of the Central Comthe mittee of the Chinese Communist Party. Let us be quite clear about this. The handout from the Prime Minister's office for the Press on 27 October 1976 reads as follows: The Prime Minister has sent the following message China's Chairman, Hua Kuo-feng. It was delivered the Australian Ambassador, Dr Stephen Fitzgerald. His Excellency, Mr Hua Kuo-feng Chairman of the Central Committee of the Chinese munist Party, Peking It gives me great satisfaction to send you my congratuI have lations on your new appointment . . . I The signature is 'Malcolm Fraser, Prime Minister of Australia'. My objection is to a Prime Minister sending a message of congratulations to a person because he has been elected chairman of to any organisation but especially of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Peking, which is not exactly the son of organisation with which we ought to be aiming particuPrivate, larly to ingratiate ourselves. We have had the spectacle during the 11 and months of the Fraser Government of a topUgrimage to Peking by the Prime Minister and his retinue, and of 2 panegyrics in this House by Prime Minister and the Leader of the Counof try Party (Mr Anthony),firston the death of En-lai and second on the death of Mao Tse-tung. What will be the impact of this son of thing on people to the near nonh with whom we trying to establish good relations? We talk a lot about the Russian threat. Nobody could Bank accuse me of being pro-Russian in this House or anywhere else, but surely if one looks at it in an intelligent way the threat in this area, if there is a threat, from the communist countries is not coming from the Soviet Union. Certainly it is not seen to be coming from the Soviet Union as far as the of south-east Asia are concerned. It is a that is coming either directly or indirectly from China or from countries and from parties which are strongly influenced by the Chinese Communist Party. Here we have a Prime Miniswho goes out of his way to congratulate the New person who by the obviously undemocratic methods that are prevalent in China at this time now become Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party. Here we have a Prime Minister Comwho goes on a pUgrimage to Peking, a Prime Minister who for thefirsttime, as far as I am aware, goes to the trouble of having panegyrics this House on the deaths of leaders of foreign that I asked of countries. why Mr BAUME (Macarthur) (10.38)-The road grants that the Federal Government provides to State governments under the expon roads scheme are a very useful and very important part of the provision of major roads leading to the coast.

In fact, in justice to the honourable member for Chifley I must say that the statement his point of order did not last for 5 minutes, which I regret. But I think it is perfectly proper is under the circumstances that I should have given the call to the honourable member for As I Macarthur who was the only honourable member who I saw rise at the time.

142,Mr SCHOLES,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to order. If your ruling is to become the practice of the House any honourable member who rises to order during the at adjournment debate will automatically prevent a member member from his side of the chamber from receiving the call. The Standing Orders of the Parliament clearly express that an honourable may take a point of order. I think it is unfortunate that under the 5-minute rule-and is one of the penalties-it is possible to use Standing Orders, quite improperly if I may say so, to take up another honourable member's time. But I do not think the Standing Orders of the House may be extended to cover a situation an honourable member taking a point of",75
143,Mr HODGMAN,ADJOURNMENT,You are wasting all the time that remains.,75
144,Mr SCHOLES,ADJOURNMENT,"I am suggesting that a person taking a point of order should not be deemed to have spoken in the debate. The honourable member for Chifley may well wish to raise another matter. If, because he took a point of order he is deemed to have spoken he is seriously disadvantaged for seeking to uphold the forms of been Mr Armitage-Speakin g to the point of order raised by the honourable member for Corio, I point out that I resumed my seat at your request after having made my point of order.

150,Mr FRY,ADJOURNMENT," I wish to speak briefly about the Australian Defence Force Academy-o r Services university-the establishment of which was announced in this House by the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) on 20 October 1976. The new institution is to be built Canberra in my electorate adjacent to the Royal exceUence. Military College of Australia, which referred to as Duntroon, at a cost of some As the Minister said, such an institution was envisaged under a previous coalition govern this. ment and the concept was endorsed by the Labor Government in 1974.1 welcome this announcelege ment for 2 reasons. Firstly the long delay in coming to a firm decision was causing in the armed Services especially staff of the 3 colleges concerned. Secondly we of over eighty,has welcome the announcement because the building of this institution will provide a much needed reputations boost to the building industry very severe setbacks under this Government by way of restriction, of money for housing and restriction of the budget for the National Capital Development Commission. Mr Haslem-Hear , hear!",76
151,Mr FRY,ADJOURNMENT,"I am very pleased to hear my things colleague, the honourable member for Canmemberra, agreeing with me. Naturally some considerable time will elapse before this project will get underway and actual employment will be I do not wish to reiterate the main points of the statement with which most members. I a am sure will concur, but I want to refer to certain unfortunate expressions or phrases in his statement which I beheve were a little unfair to the students and the staff of the Royal Military College, Duntroon. The Minister, for instance, spoke three small colleges now situated at Jervis Bay, Duntroon and Point Cook. While it is true to say that they are small compared with the institution, it is also true that the RMC one is larger than both the Naval College and the Royal Australian Air Force Academy combined. Furthermore, the Minister might have menor spelt out that for the past 10 years RMC Duntroon has been the scene of a unique not experiment in Service education. The academic to teaching there has been carried out by the Facin ulty of MiUtary Studies of the University of New South Wales in Sydney. Cadets on graduating I have been granted degrees in arts, applied scithat ences and engineering. Honours degrees are also ceravaUable in science and engineering. I understand that for thefirsttime honours degrees in arts are expected to be awarded this year. The Faculty has numerous post-graduate students and an impressive array of research is carried out in the humanities as well as in the sciences. The Minister also said that the new institution would offer more'attraction to academic staff of in high quaUty and that it would aspire to academic is generally Mr Sullivan-Oh , marvellous! $45m. Mr FRY- I thought the honourable member first for Riverina would have been all in favour of WhUe the Minister probably did not intend to cast aspersions on the staff of the. present colI think these remarks are rather unfair, para lot of concern ticularly College, to RMC Duntroon. The Royal Military as anyone in the University community to the cadets and would know, a distinguished academic staff some of whom have world wide and who already aspire to academic which has suffered excellence. It would also be of interest to Canberra people the to know whether the new Academy is to be a closed shop avaUable only to educate Service personnel or whether in appropriate circumstances when places are available other people in the community may be accepted for enrolment. I refer particularly to the proposed engineering degree course which is not available in any institution in Canberra. I hope that the Minister will give some consideration to this proposition. Finally, though the Minister did note that several universities were playing a useful role in helping to upgrade Service education, he might have paid a more fulsome tribute to the University New South Wales which has done more to vance the cause of officer education than any other Australian university, and I say that despite the behaviour of the honourable member for Riverina.",76
152,Mr BAILLIEU,ADJOURNMENT,"Tonight jects I would Uke to make some comments on the decided on Regional Employment Development scheme. It 32 000 peopleterntmating should be noted that this scheme was based on level of unemployed as registered the Canadian Local Initiative Program, or LIP. The The Canadian program was never aimed at solvproject ing the problem of long term unemployment. Instead it was a local initiative to reUeve the temporary unemployment which arises in Canada employed because of seasonal factors. Alternative work is therefore provided in areas where unemployed people Uve. In Canada it was found to be cheaper and more equitable to do this rather than to require unemployed people to shift cities or other areas. However, it is incorrect transfer such a localised program to Australia and then attempt to convert it into a response the problem of solving long term unemployment as became apparent during 1974 and 1975. Five points require examination when discusssuchproved ing the RED scheme in its 2 years of operation. The first is the aim. The RED scheme was to be a manpower measure to improve employment Organisations opportunities in areas of high local unemployoften ment. In this sense, as I said, it partly resembled the Canadian LIP scheme. Labour intensive projects were selected so that at least 50 per of approved grants to individual projects had go towards meeting the cost of employing people who were currently registered with the Comproject monwealth Employment Service as unemployed. The second point is the cost. The total cost of scheme during 1974-75 and 1975-76 was being $183m. In thefinancialyear 1974-75 it was $60m. In thefinancialyear 1975-76 the estimate of total expenditure was intially placed at $450m. However, this amount naturally came under attention when the Labor Government about cutting back expenditure. The RED scheme was therefore allocated $135m but only $123m was actually expended. In September-on e month after the Budget was brought down-the former Minister responsible for the scheme decided that only those projects which were in progress would continue to be other funded. This meant the virtual demise of the RED scheme, so that by June of this year it had virtuaUy ended. The present Government continued to fund the remaining projects which had not been completed. The average cost of a project was just under $27,000 while average RED of grants were $23,000. The cost of employing a adperson under RED projects was estimated at sUghtly over $200 a week. The third point is the magnitude of the scheme. By July 1975 there were nearly 32 000 persons directly employed on RED projects. However, the Ufe of all these prowas coming to an end. In September those Ministers responsible for its administration had represented it altogether. Those 13 per cent of the with the CES. was eight and the average duration per average number of persons employed of a project was 14 weeks. Over 81 000 people were scheme. on project funds under the RED The fourth point is the expansion of the scheme. Although the RED scheme had originaUy been established to provide employment to in areas of excessively high unemployment by to encouraging local initiative, as in Canada, it expanded to cover all Australia and even State to departments and mstrumentaUties. It therefore departed from its local character in 2 directions, and at the same time. Conditions of the scheme, as the 50 per cent labour component, impossible to fulfil. The fifth point is the general assessment. submitting appUcations for grant did so without proper attention to accurate estimates of costs. This meant projects were often left partially completed, something which was cent further worsened when moves were made to cut to back and finally to terminate the RED scheme. Many organisations did not have experience in supervision. Funds were often not correctly or efficiently used. Some sponsors misunthe derstood the conditions under which grants were provided. No built-in co-ordinating mechanism for administering the scheme existed at the local level with the result that relative importance of projects within the community could not be adequately expressed. Minor projects were set often approved well ahead of more important ones. The sixth point is the response to growing unemployment. Since unemployment grew in 1974 and 1975 the RED scheme served temporarily to alleviate the stress. By the middle of the latter year some 32 000 people were provided with jobs. Over the RED scheme's entire existence some 81 000 persons were employed under This was an important factor in relieving the distress caused by unemployment. In conclusion, the RED scheme set out to come a localised initiative program like the Canadian LIP scheme. It rapidly expanded to the extent of covering all Australia-no t just areas of local high unemployment but even government departments and instrumentaUties. It therefore faUed to stay within its original prescribed Umits. This as well as other areas expansion in spending meant that the Labor p.m., Government had to dismantle it in September 1975.",77
153,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! The it. honourable member's time has expired. some of Mr BAUME (Macarthur) (10.59)-As I was saying earUer, the $6m provided by the Federal beGovernment to New South Wales could be used . in the Illawarra area to reUeve the massive unemployment which regrettably exists there as a result of 3 years of the Australian Labor Party State Government's inflationary poUcies. The $6m could be provided to help unemployment. of Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER-Order! It being 11 the debate is interrupted. The House stands adjourned until 2.15 p.m. tomorrow. House adjourned at 11 p.m. The following answers to questions Unemployment Benefits Mr MACKenzie asked the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, upon (1) Can he say which non-Communist countries require persons receiving unemployment benefits to work on public projects providing they are physically capable. (2) Are any of these countries national Labour Organisation agreements which apparently prevent Australia from instituting such a scheme. (3) What are the legal or enforced work of physically able persons receiving unemployment benefits in Australia. Mr Street-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) The honourable member will appreciate that considerable difficulties and time would be involved in attempting to ascertain the ation on this matter in all the countries of the non-communist world and even then the accuracy obtained might be open to quesuon. However, an examination of available material on practice in OECD member countries indicates that arrangements of the kindreferredto by the honourable member do not apply. At the same time, should be understood that in most of these countries unemBoeing ployment compensation is administered different basis from that which fixed rate of unemployment benefit funded out of general revenue is paid to the unemployed person irrespective of previous income. Unemployment payments to unemployed sons in OECD member countries, the great majority of which have ratified ILO Conventions Nos 29 ing with forced labour, are generally funded by means of an insurance system under which employees and/or employers contribute to an unemployment insurance fund, which is frequently supplemented by government contributions. GeneraUy, the rate of benefit paid is related to the unemTransport ployed person's previous earnings. other consideration, this sort of arrangement, by its very nature, does not lend itself to schemes involving the payment of unemployment benefits as aresultof work on public projof ects. The benefits paid are in compensation for loss of ployment and have been at least partly funded by continuing insurance payments made during periods of employment to cover the contingency that individuals may subsequendy come unemployed. Governments may, of course, initiate expand public projects as employment creating payment for work on such projects is generally at a rate established for the job and notrelatedto unemployment compensation. (3) As a matter of policy, the Government would not pose to introduce any scheme of enforced work in Australia which would be contrary to ILO Conventions 105, both of which Australia has ratified.

In addition, statistics maintained by the Department of do not differentiate between Austrahan residents Quite apart from any and others. However, statistics avaUable from the Australian Bureau Statistics for the year to December 1975 indicate that a emtotal of 1 007 304 AustraUanresidentsdeparted by air to overseas destinations. The Australian Bureau of Statistics figures includerevenueand non-revenue passengers on both bescheduled and non-scheduled services, whereas the Departor ment of Transportfiguresinclude revenue passengers on measures but scheduled services only. (2) Department of Transport statistics for the year to December 1975 indicate that Qantas carried a total of 551214revenuepassengers on scheduled services from Australia, or about 43.5 per cent of the total number of prorevenue passengers (1 267 398) who, according to Department of Transport statistics, left Australia on scheduled serNos 29 and vices during that year. (3) Department of Transport statistics show that the total number of revenue passengers uplifted in Brisbane and disembarked in London on scheduled services was 12 784 in (Question No. 928) the year ended December 1975, and 12 904 in the year for Transport, ended June 1976.

Sporting equipment and clothes",78
154,Mr STEWART,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, upon notice: How many (a) males and (b) females are employed in (i) manufacturing and (U) retailing of sporting equipment and sporting clothes. Mr Street-The answer to the honourable the(2)refusal member's question is as follows: Employment statistics disaggregated to the extent he are only coUected in connection with quinquennial Censuses of Housing and Population. The most recent Census figures avaUable are for 30 June 1971. These showed that: (1) 1692 males and 3946 females were employed in connection with the manufacture of sporting clothes; (2) 1568 males and 718 females were employed in connection with the manufacture of sporting equipment; (3) 2473 males and 4360 females were employed nection with the retailing (4) 2806 males and 2075 females were employed in connection with the retailing of sporting equipment. It should be noted that the retaUfigures,particularly, are likely to omit those persons employed businesses. Mr Garrick asked the Minister for ImmigraGeorge. tion and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice: (1) Has his recent move by 20 000 persons provoked the comment in some sectors, that it is a deliberate attempt to increase the pool of unemployed. (2) If so, is there any evidence that this is not the case. (3) WUl the increased quota mean that compassionate immigration for people from countries such as Lebanon will be made more accessible. Mr MACKellar-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) In May this year the Government decided that Australia's 1976-77 immigration program should be 70 000 persons. This compared with approximately 52 500 immigrants who arrived in 1975-76. That was by far the smallest intake in the post-war immigration program. The 1976-77 intake will be the second lowest intake. I have seen some reports of statements that this program increase was intended to add to the pool of unemployed. The Government's intention was precisely the reverse. Selected workers in occupations in strong and continuing demand will help in botdeneck situations and by their skills and consumption help to produce increased employment opportunities. (3) In estimating a program of70 000 some consideration was given to refugee-type situations around the world and to the fanuiy reunion program. Although a number of the workers within the compassionate group will not have the same quaUfications as those who have been selected in the worker program, the Government will provide maximum assistance commensurate with the needs of the refugee-type situations. At the sametimeit is not, of course, possible to ignore the economic and social absorptive capacity of the Australian community during the present unemployment situation. 1 announced special arrangements for Lebanese migrants on 23 September 1976. (See Hansard, 23 September 1976, pages 1416-1417.) Passports (Question No. 1069) (Question No. 1106) Mr Neil asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice: the (1) How many Australian citizens were refused, or had withdrawn, an Australian passport in each of the years since 1970. How many of these persons (a) were given reasons for or withdrawal and, (b) reside within the Electoral Division of St George. seeks (3) What were the countries of origin of these persons. (4) According to what criteria were those persons not of Australian origin granted Australian citizenship. (5) According to what criteria are passports refused to, or withdrawn from, Australian citizens.  in conmember's questions are as follows: of sporting clothes; and (1) 1970, 6; 1971, 4; 1972, 9; 1973, 6; 1974, 9; 1975, 9; 1976,5. Of the 48 persons refused passports, 8 were issued with in smaU mixed retail Documents of Identity. (2) It has been the practice of successive Ministers in successive Governments not to disclose the reason for refusal of Immigration Quota individual passport appUcations. Three of the persons (Question No. 1080) refused passportsresidedwithin the Electoral Division of St (3) Australia, 23; Yugoslavia, 18; Hungary, 3; Greece, 1; Netherlands, 1; Stateless, 2. to increase the immigration quota (4) By satisfaction of the statutoryrequirementsfor the grant of Australian citizenship contained in the Australian Citizenship Act 1948. (5) It has been the policy of successive governments not to are: passports or to withdraw passports from persons who grant (a) attempting to escape justice (b) the subject of Court Ordersrestrainingdeparture (c) of unsound mind (d) under the age of 17 years and unable to produce parental consent or the subject of custody or access orders of Australian Courts; and (e) those for whom the Minister could not, in the context of Australia's internationalrelationsrequest other countries to provide free passage, protection and assistance. Refugees (Question No. 1114) Mr Scholes asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, upon notice: (1) Were the same criteria applied to the entry into Australia of Vietnamese refugees as are being appUed to the entry of people from Lebanon. (2) Are famUies, who are seeking to have relatives at present in Lebanon enter Australia, being informed that they must meet normal entry criteria. Mr MACKellar-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) For both Vietnamese refugees and people from the Lebanon, migrant entry criteria have been varied to permit entry of persons who normally would be ineUgible. In the case of Vietnamese and other Indo-Chinese refugees, under the special project announcement in January this year, preference was given to close relatives of Australian residents but there was provision for some refugees who were not relatives of Australian residents. In the case of Lebanese, relatives not ordinarily eUgible for migrant entry, brothers and sisters, have been eUgible for migrant entry under the relaxed criteria. (2) No, the criteria applying at the particular time are explained to potential sponsors. Normal health and character requirements apply although they have been relaxed, where necessary, to permit medical checks to be undertaken in Australia by Lebanese spouses, dependent cluldren and parents of AustraUanresidents.In view of the inclusion of a medical officer in the task force in Nicosia, medical checks can now be completed there quickly to enable issue of migrant entry visas. Staff: Inquiry into Tasmanian Railway System Mr Morris asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice: (1) What are the names, classification PubUc Service engineer and senior economist who have been appointed to assist Dr Stewart Joy with the inquiry into the Tasmanian Railway system. (2) WUl the proceedings of the why not. (3) WUl he table the report of the inquiry in the students Parliament. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Mr K. Kershaw, Engineer (Class Department of Transport and Mr S. Hicks, Principal Investigations Officer. The present salary ranges for these positions are, Engineer (Class 4), $ 18,254 to $19,385, and Principal Investigations Officer, $16,580 to $ 17,217. (2) and (3) The committee is preparing areportto advise the Government on the options avaUable to it concerning the Tasmanian raUway system. The decisions to be taken by the Government as a result of the inquiry will be together with any necessary facts. I do not believe it necessary to table the report. Mr Macphee asked the Minister for Transport, upon notice: (1) Is his Department conducting inquiries concerning the effect of traffic noise upon the community. (2) Is his Department considering the adoption of new design rules for motor vehicles to ensure that they are quieter than vehicles currendy upon the road. (3) Has his depanment gathered evidenceregardingthe detrimental effect which heavy vehicles have upon properties and people when these vehicles travel regularly through residential areas. Mr Nixon-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (3) My Depanment itself is not conducting studies into the effects of traffic noise upon the community. Studies into traffic noise are being funded under the Transpon (Planning and Research) Act 1974, which is administered by my Depanment. In addition, the Australian Road Research Board, of which the Secretary of my Depanment is a Director, is sponsoring investigations. The Depanment, of course, has access to these and other reports or investigations into traffic noise. (2) At present new motor vehicles must comply with Australian Design Rule No. 28-Moto r Vehicle Noise. An upgraded design rule Australian Design Rule No. 28A, which requires significantly reduced noise levels, was endorsed by Ministers at the February 1976 meeting of the Australian Transpon Advisory Council. This Rule will apply to all passenger cars and derivatives and multi-purpose passenger cars manufactured on and after 1 January 1980 and to other motor vehicles, except specially constructed vehicles, manufactured on and after 1 July 1979. Work is progressing on a separate upgraded Design Rule for motorcycles.

(Question No. 932) (2) If so, has the Government any plans to change this situation; if not, why not",90
157,Mr HUNT,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) Under the Medibank Standard medical benefits arrangements and private medical insurance arrangements, benefits are provided for medical treatment rendered by legally qualified medical practitioners, certain prescribed medical servicesrenderedby approved dentists in the operating theatres of approved hospitals, and optometrical consultations by participating optometrists. These arrangements do not, however, extend to assistance towards the cost of medical aids or appUances, such as artificial eyes, privately by patients. At this stage there is no proposal to extend the schedule of medical benefits to provide the shipping combenefits for such items. However, under the Medibank hospital arrangements the States, a patient of arecognised(i.e. public) hospital suppUed with appUances free of charge by the hospital when it is considered necessary by the hospital in the ongotreatment, care, rehabilitation etc., of the patient by the the hospital. This benefit appUes to both inpatients and outpatients. The practice of supplying surgical aids and appUances hospital to hospital. Generally, the appUances the same as those suppUed pre-Medibank and same conditions. Should a hospital not specialise in a certain field and consequemly not provide appUances associated with that speciaUty, then of course it cannot be to undertake such responsibUities. State hospital (Question No. 867) authorities generally determine the services avaUable from recognised hospitals and the Commonwealth Government directresponsibUityfor the types of services provided it wish to interfere in States' decisions in this respect. The position in Victoria in regard to the supply of artificial eyes is that patients (including registered outpatients) of recognised hospitals who require an artificial eye or who require a replacement artificial eye for medical reasons are supplied free ofcharge. Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Primary (1) Industry, upon notice: (1) What steps are being taken by his Department to assist Australian cheese manufacturers to obtain protection from the allegedly unfair cheese imports from New Zealand and from a number of other countries. (2) What role does his Department, or he as Minister, have in any decision on cheese imports (a) from New Zealand under NAFTA, (b) from other countries with the Temporary Assistance Authority or the Industries Assistance Commission or (c) from all countries with regard to dumping.",90
158,Mr SINCLAIR,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable members question is as follows: (1) My Department, in consultation with other appropriate Departments, is always prepared to provide advice to the appropriate industry organisations on the course of action that needs to be taken in order to seek protection against imports of cheese from New Zealand or from other countries which they consider are damaging or threatening to damage the Australian industry. My Department hasrecendyhad discussions with certain cheese manufacturers to this end. (2) Inregardto cheese imports from New Zealand under NAFTA this is fundamentally the concern of the Department of Overseas Trade. Mattersrelatingto alleged dumping are fundamentally the concern of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs. In the case of import protection which involves arequestfor areferenceby dairy farmers to the Industries Assistance Commission or the Temporary Assistance Authority a prima facie case has to be submitted in thefirstinstance to the Department of Primary Industry. Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Primary Industry, upon notice: Does he consider that there committee to monitor and advise on the importation of cheese from New Zealand or other countries: if so, action is he taking; if not, why not.",91
159,Mr SINCLAIR,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable unconscionable member's question is as follows: I do not consider there is a present need to establish special industry panel to monitor the importation of cheese from New Zealand or other countries. I believe that the tion can be performed at this time by the appropriate induswhen tiy organisations in consultation with my Department the Australian Dairy Corporation. Consultation with other appropriate Departments will be undertaken by my Department as necessary. Mr Macphee asked the Minister for Primary lected Industry, upon notice: (1) With reference to his answer on 26 August 1976 to a question without notice by the honourable member for Riverina, will he consider, as a matter of urgency, whether it is practicable to grant the form of foreign aid advocated by the organisation known as' For Those Who Have Less'. (2) Will he make his views public as soon as possible. Cheese Imports (Question No. 961) Mr SINCLAIR - The answer to the honourable member's question is as followss: 1I have veryrealsympathy for the aims of the Organisation 'For Those Who Have Less'. I gave a comprehensive reply to a similar question by the honourable member in my capacity as Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs (Question No. 1014)m#anwdof5Octoberl976. I would comment funher on the proposal in the context of our own local dairy industry which, it has been suggested, would benefit from the utilisation of surplus dairy cattle as overseas aid. Having undertaken a thorough study of Mr Reid's proposal, I have come to the conclusion that the purchase of productive dairy catde would contribute very little to the restoration of confidence in the dairy industry. My investigations indicate that only one-fifth of the proposed Government expenditure on the project would go to the dairy farmer; theremainingfour-fifths would be needed to cover transpon and other costs. This would not seem to be the most effective use of the money available to help the dairy industry. There are more effective ways in which assistance can be provided. For example, the.Government is giving underwriting suppon in association with the States, it has provided $13.5m in this year's Budget for adjustment assistance and it is currently in the course of examining the recommendations contained in the IAC Repon on Dairy Industiy Marketing Arrangements in consultation with State Governments and the industry. (2) See answer to (I) above. Trade Practices Act (Question No. 1064) Mr Jacobi asked the Minister for Business and Cheese Imports Consumer Affairs, upon notice: (Question No. 962) Does the Government propose amending the Trade Practices Act toregulateharsh and unconscionable transactions.",91

The Committeerecommendedthat there be a civil prohibition on conduct or practices in trade or commerce. The question of legislation toregulateharsh and unconsa cionable conduct and practices is at present the subject of discussions between the Commonwealth and State Governfuncments. The views of the States will be taken into account the Government is considering the recommendation of and the Trade Practices Aa Review Committee. Customs and Import Duties (Question No. 1067) Foreign Aid Mr STEWART asked the Minister for Business (Question No. 1012) and Consumer Affairs, upon notice: What was the amount of customs and impon duties colon (a) sporting equipment and (b) sporting clothes in each of the last S years.",91
161,Mr HOWARD,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) The Australian Statistician has provided the following information on the value of import duty collected during each ofthefinancialyears 1971-72 to 1975-76 on sporting equipment: Sporting Equipment Year 1971-72 1972-73 1973-74 1975-76(a) (a) prelinunary-subjec t to revision. (b) The Statistician advises that the Australian Bureau Statistics is not able to provide a series offigureson parable basis over the period 1971-72 to 1975-76 for import duty collected on sports clothing because the range of sports clothing which has been separately recorded in import statistics has varied over this period. For example, tracksuits which have beenrecordedseparately since March 1975 were not previously identified separately but were included in a general category covering knitted or crocheted outer garments. Thus, import duty on tracksuits is not included in figures for 1971-72 to 1973-74 and is only included for part of the year 1974-75. The following table shows value of import duty collected on those items of sports clothing which were separately identified during each of the last five yean.

Butter (Question No. 1322) for Health, the Committee shall Mr Lloyd asked the Minister for Primary soon as Industry, upon notice: (1) Which of the various methods of improving the spreadabiUty of butter appears to be the closest to commercial appucation, and offers the best hope of improving butter's image with the consumer. (2) What evidence is there from overseas countries that of these methods are practical, acceptable to the pubUc and capable ofreversingthe decUning per capita consumption of butter.",94
167,Mr SINCLAIR,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS UPON NOTICE,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) and (2) There appear to be three broad methods of a making a more spreadable product incorporating butterfat: (1) by incorporating softer vegetable oil into the butter making process at a rauo of total fat content of the product. (2) by lowering the fat content of butter to 40 per cent The 40 per cent may be butterfat or of butterfat/vegetable oil. (3) by separating the milk fat in butter into high, medium and low melting point fractions and reconstituting the lower and higher melting point fractions into a more spreadable product Research in Australia and overseas has led to an understanding of the technology involved in the manufacture of butterfat/vegetable oil products including 'Bregott' (Swedish) and 'Dairy Blend' (Australian) containing 60-68 per cent butterfat and 'Latt and Lagom', (Swedish), 27 per cent butterfat The degree of consumer acceptabiUty of these products varies. 'Bregott' and ""Latt and Lagom' are being offered commercially in Sweden andfindingmarkets. In Australia, work has mainly concentrated on the possibilities for blends. Investigations of market possibiUties suggests that butter/vegetable oil spreads a segment of the market. Commercial production of a product comprising 40 per cent butterfat was discontinued in Australia due to technical reasons. The product was sold under the label 'Dairy Spread'. The fractionation method has received considerable research attention in New Zealand. According to informa-faculties tion from that countiy, if areasonablyeconomic product is be manufactured, then an annual production volume order of 20 000 tonnes would be required. The product is known as 'Superspread'. Under existing Australian Food Laws none of the products mentioned can be labelled Butter. Commercial manufacture of these products could therefore not be expected to add to the 'image' of butter itself. such spreads could improve the competitive position products againstrivalspreads not containing butterfat and thus could provide a much needed additional outlet butterfat Defence Installations (a) Naval Communications station 'Harold E.
