2,The SPEAKER,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE,"Yes, the member for Chisholm may proceed.",17
3,Ms BANKS,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. Following the leadership coup in August, I announced my decision that I will not recontest the seat of Chisholm at the next election as a member of the Liberal Party. I've always put the people before the party. After being a Labor held seat for 18 years, the people of Chisholm elected me as I promised them that I would be their representative under the leadership of the former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and former deputy leader and foreign minister Julie Bishop-both visionary, inspiring leaders of sensible, centrist, liberal values with integrity and intellect, and with significant support from my local community, and across Australia, as leaders of our nation. The gift of time and reflection has provided some clarity regarding the brutal blow against the leadership. Led by members of the reactionary right wing, the coup was aided by many MPs trading their vote for a leadership change in exchange for their individual promotion, preselection endorsements or silence. Their actions were undeniably for themselves-for their position in the party, their power, their personal ambition-not for the Australian people who we represent; not for what people voted for in the 2016 election; not for stability, and disregarding that teamwork and unity deliver success. The aftermath of those dark days in August then acutely laid bare the major parties' obstructionist and combative actions and internal games, all for political pointscoring, rather than for timely, practical, sensible decisions on matters which Australians care about. Equal representation of men and women in this parliament is an urgent imperative which will create a culture change. There's the blinkered rejection of quotas and support of the merit myth, but this is more than a numbers game. Across both major parties, the level of regard and respect for women in politics is years behind the business world. There is also a clear need for an independent whistleblower system, as found in many workplaces, to enable reporting of misconduct of those in power without fear of reprisal or retribution. Often when good women call out or are subjected to bad behaviour, the reprisals, backlash and commentary portray them as the bad ones: the liar, the troublemaker, the emotionally unstable or weak, or someone who should be silenced. To those who say politics is not for the faint-hearted and that women have to toughen up, I say this: the hallmark characteristics of the Australian woman-and I've met thousands of them, be they in my local community, politics, business, the media or sport-are resilience and a strong, authentic, independent spirit. The voice of the Australian people has been loud and clear. Hundreds from my local community, as well as hundreds more from across Australia, contacted me with their support and-knowing that my life, from humble and hard working migrant heritage, has been in the business real world and not as a career politician-many pleaded that I stay in politics and become an independent representative. My sensible, centrist values, belief in economic responsibility and focus on always putting the people first and acting in the nation's interest have not changed. The Liberal Party has changed, largely due to the actions of the reactionary and regressive right wing, who talk about and to themselves rather than listening to the people. To continue to put the people before the party and act in the nation's interest authentically and constructively, effective immediately I will serve as a member of this House of Representatives as an Independent representative. I intend to give the government my assurance as to confidence and supply. In the new year I will make a decision about my future career path. Like the three female independent representatives, the new member for Wentworth, the member for Mayo and the member for Indi, sensible, centre, liberal values are at the core of what I stand for. As a result of this political journey, I am grateful to have met so many wonderful people from across the political divide who I know will respect my decision and with whom I hope I will have enduring friendships. I am so proud to serve as a member of this House of Representatives with honour and respect because of the good people it represents, the people that the major parties have stopped listening to: the Australian people. I thank you, Mr Speaker.

4,Mr WYATT,BILLS,Hasluck-Minister for Senior Australians and Aged Care and Minister for Indigenous Health) (12:06): I present an addendum to the explanatory memorandum.,19
5,Ms COLLINS,BILLS," I want to put on record my thanks to the minister for the briefing in relation to the amendments that appeared in the Senate to this Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission Bill 2018. I think these nine amendments do go some way towards strengthening the bill. I do want to reiterate my concerns that I put on the record in the House, though. We still have a number of concerns on our side of the House. There's clearly a lot of work to do to get this new commission up and running by 1 January. I hope that the government gets onto that job without delay. I also want to put on the record that Labor has not at any stage tried to impede the passage of this bill in getting through either house of parliament. We know how important these bills are to people who are currently in the aged-care system, their families and their loved ones. We need to make sure that we give them as much protection as we can. Obviously, there's now a royal commission into aged-care services in Australia, but I just wanted to put on the record that Labor does support these amendments. We still don't think they go far enough.",19
6,Mr WYATT,BILLS,Hasluck-Minister for Senior Australians and Aged Care and Minister for Indigenous Health) (12:08): I move: That the amendments be agreed to. These amendments reflect the best of the way in which the parliament works. The amendments are a reflection not only of government but also of opposition and the senators who contributed to the amendments strengthening the bill in order to ensure the quality and safety of senior Australians within the settings they are in. I do want to thank the Hon. Julie Collins for her contribution to the debate as the shadow minister. I appreciate the support she has given in ensuring the passage of the bills so that we're able to establish the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission. I thank you and commend the bill. Question agreed to. Office of National Intelligence Bill 2018 Office of National Intelligence (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2018 Second Reading Cognate debate. Consideration resumed of the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.,19
7,Mr DREYFUS,BILLS," Labor supports the Office of National Intelligence Bill 2018 and the Office of National Intelligence (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2018. These two bills will implement a number of the recommendations of the 2017 Independent Intelligence Review, conducted by Michael L'Estrange and Stephen Merchant, by establishing the Office of National Intelligence, or ONI, which is to be led by the Director-General of National Intelligence. The Office of National Intelligence will be responsible for leading Australia's national intelligence agencies. While the new Director-General of National Intelligence will not be empowered to direct the specific activities of agencies, he or she will be able to direct the coordination of agencies to ensure there are appropriately integrated strategies across the suite of agency capabilities. The Director-General of National Intelligence will also be tasked with keeping the Prime Minister informed on matters relating to Australia's intelligence agencies. Each of Australia's Five Eyes partners currently has a single point of coordination for its intelligence agencies, and this is what the Office of National Intelligence will provide for Australia. In addition to its leadership role, the Office of National Intelligence will replace the Office of National Assessments and be responsible for preparing strategic assessments and reports in relation to international and domestic matters that are of political, strategic or economic significance to Australia. As is the case with the Office of National Assessments, those assessments and reports will be prepared on the basis of information that is collected from publicly available sources. This marks an extension of the ONA's existing assessment and evaluation function, which is currently limited exclusively to international matters. Labor also supports the Office of National Intelligence (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2018, which repeals the Office of National Assessments Act 1977 and makes a series of consequential amendments to other acts to reflect the proposed operation of the Office of National Intelligence. The bipartisan Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security looked carefully at these two bills and recommended four improvements, each of which was accepted by the government. The amendments tabled by the government yesterday give effect to the committee's recommendations. Among other things, those  amendments will ensure that the Privacy Commissioner is directly involved in drafting the ONI's privacy rules and that those rules are made publicly available on ONI's website. Since 2014, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security has considered 15 substantive national security bills and made over 300 recommendations for amendment, all of which have been accepted by the government. I commend my parliamentary colleagues on the committee-Labor, Liberal and National-for their careful, considered and bipartisan approach to these two bills and for recommending a number of improvements. This is how national security issues should be dealt with, and that is how national security issues have been dealt with in recent history. In that spirit, I urge the government to work with Labor to implement two of the other recommendations that were made by Michael L'Estrange and Stephen Merchant in the 2017 Independent Intelligence Review in relation to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. Strong and effective oversight does not undermine our national security community; it enhances it. Public trust and confidence in our security and intelligence agencies are best ensured through strong and rigorous oversight and scrutiny. Australia has a unique configuration of oversight that spans the parliamentary, judicial and executive branches of government. Institutions, such as the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security and the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, have complementary functions. Labor's existing proposal for reform of the committee recognises and maintains these arrangements. The proposal is embodied in the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security Amendment Bill 2015, which is presently before the Senate. This bill arose out of work done by former Senator John Faulkner and others, and contains a suite of measures designed to ensure that the committee has the powers it needs to acquit its duties to the parliament and the Australian people. As it happens, the substance of Labor's proposals was largely adopted in recommendations 21 and 23 of the 2017 Independent Intelligence Review. However, despite receiving the review well over a year ago, and despite the fact that the government has said that it will implement the recommendations of the Independent Intelligence Review, the government has yet to act on these two recommendations. So, while Labor is pleased that the government has now acted on Mr L'Estrange's and Mr Merchant's recommendation to establish an office of national intelligence, there is more work to be done. I commend the bills to the House. Mr TIM WILSON (Goldstein) (12:15): It is with great pleasure that I get up to speak on this important legislation, the Office of National Intelligence Bill 2018 and the Office of National Intelligence (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2018. I understand that a lot of people look at this legislation and say it's anodyne in its attempt, and it's largely administrative for a lot of the operations of different government agencies. But the reason I want to talk about it is its critical role, particularly around parliamentary oversight. As you know, there is an amendment that makes it possible for greater oversight by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security and by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. Parliamentary oversight is one of the most fundamental principles that sits at the heart of our democracy. The truth is that it is within the wisdom of the crowds of people who sit in this place-and I accept wholeheartedly that that wisdom is challenging at the moment-and of parliamentary oversight and transparency that our democracy works. When you have bodies that operate with a high degree of secrecy and a high degree of absent transparency-and, I might stress, for legitimate reasons, because of the seriousness of the issues that are being affected, like the Office of National Assessments-it's incredibly important that there is proper parliamentary oversight of their procedures, of their practices and of their activities. That's what parliamentary committees do. As you know, I'm the chair of the House Standing Committee on Economics, which has parliamentary oversight of a lot of the independent regulators. I appeared before the Senate as a former commissioner or parliamentary officer, as Australia's Human Rights Commissioner. Appearing before the Senate was a critical part of my role of making sure that those who are commissioned or charged with incredible powers are held accountable to the people whom they serve, who are ultimately Australians, and, by proxy, through their representatives. I think this is particularly important in the space around intelligence. A simple basis is: we know why information can't be released in the public square. We know that, when we're dealing with allegations of terrorism, investigations or undercover officers, and looking at how data is collected and what it's used for, there must be a robust secrecy and a protection not just to the people who may be directly affected but to people who may be undercover or contributing to the activities of an operation-and not just to them, but to their families and their friends-and to make sure there are successful investigations and other activities, and to make sure that there is success to keep Australians safe. It goes to a point of trust: trust that Australians should be able to have in our government and in our federal authorities to do their good and important work. What I've seen consistently is that there is a very high degree of  trust in agencies like ASIO and the Australian Federal Police-I don't think most Australians would know the Office of National Assessments. One of the reasons Australians trust them is that they know they do important work, and they know that they keep us safe. But there is a comfort that comes from parliamentary oversight, and, frankly, I'd like to see a lot more of that. I'd like to see parliament holding agencies to account. This is not a point of partisanship-although, sometimes we might devolve into that it's a point about how we're going to run our bureaucracies and our agencies. Frankly, I don't think there's enough oversight of the Australian Taxation Office, an agency that is set up to manage the tax affairs of the nation and make sure we secure the revenue to support the base of activities that we decide happen in this place but then goes on to provide the services the Australian people have come to expect. There isn't enough oversight over agencies often that have the power to investigate people's private affairs, particularly their tax and financial affairs, and frankly I think there is probably a case to have much greater scrutiny over how a lot of those agencies operate and whether they successfully work with individuals, small business and big business to do their job. Sometimes when I'm driving along, I hear these as on radio by companies that promote the concern that many Australians have about the Australian Taxation Office and whether it is going to be on their back. Don't misunderstand; I believe that Australians should have respect for the state and its purpose, because it is a common wealth of all of us. But I also think that there should be accountability for those people who seek to implement and interpret the law. You hear this all the time from small businesses who are concerned about it, who fear taking on the ATO because they fear they might have a very dangerous consequence to their business and they're going to get adverse rulings, or they fear they are going to get dragged through bureaucratic bullying. Certainly, that's the fear. I know that might sound a little off topic, but the same principles apply to national security agencies. We should be able to hold the police to account. That's not to question their motivations and it's not to suggest that they're doing anything wrong; but they are here to serve the people, to maintain a degree of law and order in our society. What parliamentary scrutiny and accountability does, whether it's through committees or any other means, is achieve that end in the national and public interest. So, while seemingly irrelevant amendments to the Australian Border Force Act 2015 may not excite the public mind, they are critical. They are critical to our duty to the people we serve. These amendments are critical to the degree of confidence that Australians can have in our democracy. They are critical for the electoral legitimacy that we all secure in sitting in these seats. And it's a privilege and a responsibility that should not be taken lightly. It's a privilege and responsibility that serves our country well. It goes back, of course, many decades, back to looking at parliamentary oversight of the setting of tax rates and why ministers or the Crown shouldn't be able to impose legislation or regulation around rates or any other means which has the effective consequence of a tax without parliamentary sovereignty and approval. It goes to the heart of parliament itself. And it doesn't just apply to tax; it applies to every artifice that this government-Liberal, Labor or anything else-entertains. That's why one of the great challenges we face in our modern democracy is that the executive is not all powerful. The executive has a critical and important role to represent the Crown and to administer the Commonwealth of this country, to govern for the national interest and for everyone. We're going to have some disagreements-everyone will from time to time-about how that is best done, and rightly so. The role of departments is to regulate and implement that through to execution for the Australian people, and we in this place in parliament have a responsibility as well. Based on what I've been told only moments ago, there is going to be increased scrutiny in this parliament as numbers change. That wasn't going to be the point of my remarks today, but it's an interesting coincidence. But it does highlight the power and the sovereignty of this place and the legislative means that we go through to maintain that accountability. And, frankly, one of the things that I find most difficult and disturbing in this age is how much power parliament hands to the executive. That's not a comment on this government or, particularly, the previous one or the one before that or the one before that or the one before that. We, as parliamentarians, must defend parliamentary sovereignty because, if we don't, who will?",19
8,Mr HAWKE,BILLS," I want to thank honourable members for their contributions to the debate on the Office of National Intelligence Bill 2018 and the Office of National Intelligence (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2018. As the 2017 Independent intelligence review noted, the challenges faced by our intelligence community will intensify over the coming decade. In a rapidly changing world, Australia's intelligence architecture needs to change too. Our intelligence agencies need to be positioned to respond to the next conflict, the next terrorist threat or the next technological innovation. Whatever comes our way, we need to be ready.  Our national intelligence community agencies demonstrate excellence, but, as the 2017 Independent intelligence review stated: These forces of change are challenging the structures in place for co-ordinating the activities of our intelligence agencies. That is why the reviewers recommend the establishment of an office of national intelligence, and that is why the passage of these bills is so important. ONI's leadership function and the requirement in the bill that it perform this function in ways that promote the appropriate integration of intelligence capabilities across the national intelligence community will go a long way to achieving greater coordination. ONI will also be responsible for providing advice to the Prime Minister on national intelligence priorities, requirements and capabilities, and matters relating to the national intelligence community as a whole. Further extending ONI's assessment and evaluation functions and its ability to cooperate with other national intelligence community agencies will enable ONI to better support the work of others. The positioning of the Director-General of National Intelligence as the head of the national intelligence community, with the responsibility of keeping the Prime Minister informed on matters relating to intelligence, will enhance this coordination. The Office of National Intelligence (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2018 makes amendments to a number of acts to support the proposed operation of the ONI bill. Though many of these amendments simply reflect the transition of the office of national assessments to the ONI by updating references and other legislation, other more substantive amendments will provide important functionality to the new organisation. Some amendments will improve the ability of other national intelligence community agencies to cooperate or share information with the Office of National Intelligence. Some will enhance oversight; others will enable ONI officers to better perform their functions by accessing and assuming identities regimes. All in all, these arrangements, along with transitional provisions, will ensure that the ONI is able to function effectively from its establishment. The Office of National Intelligence (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2018 contains a number of other measures to support the operation of ONI and the Director General of National Intelligence, including directions and guidelines powers, access to information provisions, secrecy provisions, the continuation of the national assessments board, and privacy rules to protect Australians. I'd like to thank the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security for their detailed consideration of the bills. The work of the PJCIS has led to four government amendments which fully implement the committee's recommendations and will be tabled shortly. In particular, the committee consideration has contributed to enhanced transparency provisions being incorporated in relation to the privacy rules, and I want to thank the PJCIS for their deliberations. I also thank my colleagues from both chambers and all sides of the chamber for recognising all of these important needs. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time.

15,Mr HAWKE,BILLS," I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill and move: That this bill be now read a second time. I am pleased today to present this bill, that will significantly reform the electoral funding and disclosure regime in the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. Reform is necessary to support the integrity of Australia's electoral system, and Australia's sovereignty, by ensuring that only those with a meaningful connection to Australia are able to influence Australian politics and elections through political donations. It will also ensure that the Commonwealth's electoral funding and disclosure regime keeps pace with international and domestic developments and provides transparency for Australian voters. The Electoral Legislation Amendment (Electoral Funding and Disclosure Reform) Bill 2017 will improve the consistency of the regulatory treatment of all political actors. This includes political actors that have emerged in the Australian political landscape, who neither endorse candidates nor seek to form government, yet actively seek to influence the outcome of elections through their campaigning activities. While this is a positive indicator of the strength of Australian civil society and civic engagement, it is important that these actors are subject to the public accountability of more traditional actors, such as registered political parties or candidates. The Electoral Act has long recognised that there are a range of political actors who participate in Australian elections. These include political parties and their associated entities (which include unions and fundraising entities), candidates, and third-party campaign groups. This bill makes several changes to the regulation of political actors, which are necessary to keep pace with modern campaigning and to assist the implementation of restrictions on foreign interference. Firstly, a registration regime will be introduced for all third party campaigners who incur political expenditure above the disclosure threshold. Political expenditure includes the production of material that is 'intended or likely to affect voting in an election'. These groups are already required to report annually to the Australian Electoral Commission on this expenditure. A registration scheme will improve transparency for voters and complement this government's reforms to the authorisation of electoral matters-enabling voters who receive material attempting to influence their vote to look up an entity on the register. Registration will also assist the AEC's compliance and  education activities by identifying political actors and providing a contact person for AEC communications. Registration of third party campaigners reflects current practices in other jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand. In the 2015-16 financial year, which included the last election, third party campaign groups spent almost $40 million on election advertising, polling and campaigning. It is clear that elections are no longer just fought between political parties and candidates, and it is appropriate all participants who choose to expend significant amounts of political expenditure are subject to transparency. In recognition of the prominent role that third party campaign groups play in public debate and their growing influence in elections, a new category of political campaigners who incur significant political expenditure, such as those who spend more than $100,000 in a financial year, will have disclosure obligations in line with other prominent political actors, such as political parties. The creation of this new 'political campaigner' category enables significant political actors to be subject to greater transparency befitting their significant expenditure while providing less onerous compliance measures for smaller third party campaigners. The relevant disclosure obligations applicable to all political actors will also be expanded to require reporting of directors' names, political memberships and the details of government grants and contracts received. Additionally, the bill will clarify the current definition of 'associated entity' to include the activities of groups who operate to the benefit of political parties. The requirement to register and disclose will not curtail in any way the freedom to participate in political activity. Instead, it will provide transparency, allowing Australian electors to access better information when evaluating the efforts of those who seek to influence Australians' voting decisions and the outcomes of Australian elections. There has been growing concern amongst the community about foreign interference within our domestic political landscape. Media reports of foreign donations to parties, candidates and third parties have affected the perceived integrity of elections which is critical to our peaceful and democratic government. The need to address this concern was highlighted by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in its second interim report on the inquiry into the conduct of the 2016 federal election, which recommended that legislative action be taken to prohibit foreign donations. To keep foreign money out of Australian elections, political parties, candidates, Senate groups and significant political campaigners will be banned from receiving foreign gifts over $250 or any money transferred from foreign accounts. Because many third party campaigners, such as charities, also carry out non-political activities, they will not be prevented from receiving foreign gifts. Instead, third parties will be prevented from using foreign money for political expenditure. It is important that third party campaigners are covered by the measures in the bill to level the playing field. Banning foreign gifts to political parties but allowing third parties to use foreign gifts to incur political expenditure would have the same effect of allowing foreign interests to fund political campaigning by some entities but not by others. A special exemption has been provided for significant political campaigners where they are registered charities or registered organisations under the Fair Work legislation to afford these entities the less onerous compliance burdens required of third party campaigners. This reduces the regulatory burden on such organisations while maintaining the integrity of the foreign donations ban. As a consequence, the bill does not restrict the ability of charities to receive foreign gifts for non-political purposes. Nor does it restrict the political activities that charities can engage in with contributions from Australians. To maintain the integrity of the foreign donations ban, no entity will be permitted to use foreign money for their political expenditure. Foreign interests do not have a legitimate role in Australian elections, so they should not be funding things like election advertising or handing out how-to-vote material at polling booths-regardless of whether these activities are carried out by a political party or any other entity. This approach is consistent with foreign donation bans in other jurisdictions. Appropriate anti-avoidance measures are included in the bill so that the funnelling of foreign donations through an intermediary, setting up a shell company in Australia or splitting donations to avoid these thresholds are banned. The bill also contains improvements to the public election funding regime. Public election funding is payable in relation to any candidate who receives more than four per cent of the total first-preference votes cast in an election. While this qualification requirement remains unchanged, the bill will limit public funding to  demonstrated electoral spending, which will prevent political actors from profiteering and achieving private gain by standing candidates. The bill introduces reforms to one of the oldest pieces of legislation in our country-the 99-year-old Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918-to improve the funding and disclosure regime for the benefit of the Australian public and Australian voters. This will improve public confidence in Australia's political process by increasing the accountability of those involved in political finance and election campaigns. It will also restrict foreign influence on Australian political actors, including campaigners, through restrictions on foreign donations. I commend the bill.",23
16,Dr LEIGH,BILLS," I rise to speak on behalf of the opposition in respect of the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Electoral Funding and Disclosure Reform) Bill 2017. It is 729 days today since Senator Farrell introduced opposition legislation in the Senate to ban foreign donations from our political system. Labor believes that political donations from foreign sources are eroding our political system, and urgent attention is required to address this. If you care about foreign cybermeddling in elections, you should care about foreign donations affecting Australian election outcomes. After the government opposed our bill in the Senate, the Leader of the Opposition sought to progress this urgent reform here, in the House. The government again refused to support this change, so Labor made the unilateral step of saying that we would voluntarily refuse foreign donations. More than a year ago we acted to say that we would not take foreign political donations, not because the law banned us from doing so but because it is the right thing to do. I today join with my colleague Senator Farrell in calling on the Prime Minister and every Liberal and National party member of this House to immediately-this moment-stop taking foreign donations. Don't wait for this bill to become law. The member for Mitchell just said that he believes that foreign donations are 'inappropriate', yet if you went to his political party right now as a foreign donor with a cheque to give to the Liberal Party of Australia, they would take that money. I say to the Liberal Party of Australia: Say no to British citizens like Lord Ashcroft. Say no to American political donors like Peter Briger. Say no to foreign political donations from any noncitizen, and say it today. Do not take another dollar in foreign donations. Do not wait for this bill to pass the parliament. Act right now, while you can. Donations that seek to influence our political system are a threat not just to our electoral system but also to public faith in our democracy, faith which has been eroded, sadly, over recent months through the revolving door in the Prime Minister's office and through what many people see as the increasing pettiness of the way in which this government behaves. Labor believes we have an opportunity to finally stop foreign political money influencing Australian elections. We won't ignore that opportunity. Two years after we moved to ban foreign donations, the government has finally presented this final version of the ban on foreign donations. The opposition will be supporting this bill, which incorporates the various lengthy amendments we've requested and which were supported by the Senate. I would also note that this bill is not the last word in donations reform. In the other place, Senator Farrell's second reading amendment indicated our commitment to lowering the disclosure threshold for political donations. As Senator Farrell said: Reducing the disclosure threshold to $1,000 is Labor policy and it has been for a long time. We understand the importance of greater financial accountability and we are going to act on that. If we form government, this is a policy we would look to implement, and we would do so with proper consultative process. We understand that there would be a range of entities that would want to have a say on how best to implement greater transparency around a lower threshold. We have shown throughout our consultation around the current Electoral Act amendments that we value the input of many different voices, and we would undertake that processwere we to form governmentin exactly the same vein. Returning to the bill before the House today, the government's approach seeks to define and prohibit a class of foreign donors. It seeks to create an offence within the Commonwealth Electoral Act for anyone seeking to influence our elections through donations or gifts from foreign sources, and extends that offence to those wilfully receiving them. This bill aims to prohibit those who seek to influence Australian voters from doing that with the support of foreign sources of funding, including foreign states or state-owned enterprises. While I've noted that the opposition is supporting this bill, the process of getting here has been far from easy. The original legislation caused such significant unrest within civil society that our trusted charities and not-forprofits created a new alliance. There we go: the Liberal-National Party bringing charities together against their ham-fisted legislation. The Hands Off Our Charities alliance was formed to combat the pernicious and problematic effects of the first draft of this bill.  The bill was referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters not once but twice-once to review the bill and then to review the proposed changes-and both times the members of that committee worked diligently to engage across the parliament and with civil society to make recommendations for reform. I acknowledge, in particular, the Labor members: Senator Ketter, Senator Brown, the member for Oxley and, particularly, the deputy chair, the member for Scullin, for their vital service on those inquiries. I also acknowledge the members on the Hands Off Our Charities alliance with whom I've worked extensively in my capacity as shadow minister for charities and not-for-profits. I would note that this is the first time that either major party has had a shadow ministry for charities and not-for-profits. This process has reinforced the importance of having that position-not just for us; it's something I would urge for those on the other side of the House. By working closely with civil society, we've secured two key commitments that give charities and not-forprofits confidence and clarity in interpreting the scope of these reforms. The first is a clearer and more concise definition of what is considered to be an electoral matter. The definition, acting as the gateway to the Commonwealth Electoral Act, won't capture legitimate public policy advocacy and should be reserved for those seeking to influence a voter or the result of an election. The second is a guaranteed review of the practical operation of the bill by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. But, over the course of the last two years, the coalition has not only moved at a snail's pace but managed to stumble in a way in which snails don't. It's a remarkable achievement that they have managed to act with such tardiness and ineptitude. The original bill didn't just ban foreign donations; it hit charities, not-for-profits, advocacy groups and churches. The coalition, it seemed to us, was trying to hijack bipartisan support for banning foreign political donations as an opportunity to shut down their critics. If they'd gotten their way, Australia's charities and not-for-profits would be reeling from yet another coalition attack; yet another front on the war on charities. Initially, when that draft bill was tabled in the Senate, the finance minister maintained that, 'Nothing in this bill prevents charities from expressing their views or advocating for or against political parties, candidates or election issues.' But the sector disagreed, unanimously, loudly and in great detail, with the minister's assessment. Charities have learnt pretty quickly that, when it looks like an attack on the charitable sector, that's probably because it is. The initial bill had no consultation on exposure drafts. It contained no regulatory impact statementa little strange from a government that touts its willingness to reduce red tape. It's little wonder that charities saw this as a strategy to marginalise their voices through the process, with the ultimate goal of silencing their vital role in advocacy. The Human Rights Law Centre warned of: … serious risks that the legislation violates Australia's constitutional protection of freedom of political communication. St Vincent De Paul said: … the ultimate effect for charities will be a set of complex, cumbersome and costly administrative requirements. This will force many charities to divert resources away from frontline services and advocacy. For some charities, it may also have a ""chilling"" effect, deterring them from speaking out about injustices in order to avoid the onerous administrative costs that such advocacy would incur. The Australian Conservation Foundation were worried that the law 'poses a significant threat to all charities engaging in issues based advocacy'. The legislation effectively conflates the advocacy activities of independent, non-partisan, civil society groups with the electioneering of political parties. They said: It's an unprecedented restriction on advocacy and on contributions to election debates … A spokesperson for Pew Charitable Trusts said the new rules would prevent Pew from using international donations to pay for groups of Indigenous Australians to visit Canberra and Perth to advocate to federal and state parliaments for Indigenous causes. He said: The government clearly doesn't want to make a distinction between electioneering and advocacy … that conflation is a fundamental challenge to what is a basic function of our democracy … RESULTS International, which receives 85 per cent of it's funding from international sources, noted that the government's initial approach would have harmed their ability to advocate for improved funding for AIDS screening and tuberculosis immunisation in Australia and our region. Pew also noted the impact on organisations such as the World Wildlife Fund, which, over a number of years, has been a strong advocate for Australia in our role in conserving the Antarctic. That advocacy is, in part, supported by international donors, and so the original version of this bill would have hampered that push. As a summary of the ACF noted: Under the proposed bills, ACF would find it much harder to amplify stakeholder voices and support communities in far west NSW in the development and implementation of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan.  The Burnet Institute, which has lobbied the federal government to include new direct-acting antiviral drugs for the treatment of hepatitis C, said that because the work was considered advocacy, the original version of this bill could have jeopardised the Burnet Institute's efforts to have medicine subsidised for people in need. I've noted Pew Charitable Trusts' concerns about the original bill impeding their ability to support Ngadju leaders to travel to meet with government officials and media representatives in Perth and Canberra to discuss their work on the Indigenous ranger program. Anglicare Australia network members provide emergency relief and disaster recovery that would have been put at risk by new rules on how charities can collect donations, meaning that they might have struggled to respond to events such as bushfires. WWF Australia receive funding from international philanthropy and uses that, in part, to help penguins in the Antarctic. They were concerned that their work of protecting penguins might have been caught by the initial bill. The heart of the problem was that the definition of 'political expenditure' was too broad to support the demanding and punitive framework of reporting compliance and enforcement. Constitutional law expert Anne Twomey explained to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters the key definition at the heart of the government's scheme was: … so extraordinarily badly drafted that it could, frankly, apply to anything. This is one of our foremost constitutional experts describing the original bill as being 'extraordinarily badly drafted'. Charities were concerned about the original bill's application to public advocacy work. The Benevolent Society said the definition of 'political purpose': … is too vague to be meaningful and enforceable … In effect, it could cover comments or views on any issue at all as there is no way to determine what is likely to become an electoral issue in the future. They also said: … almost anything that a charity says or does publicly could be captured. Acts such as preparing a submission to a public inquiry, or participating in a public hearing, or even corresponding with a Member of Parliament could be captured by the clause … It is extraordinary that this parliament would pass a bill that would shut down the ability of charities and not-forprofits to do what we often ask them to, which is to get engaged in the process of scrutinising bills before the House. Academics argued the bill would effectively prevent meaningful engagement with government and with the parliament. The university sector body, the Group of Eight, said: This definition is extraordinarily broad in scope, potentially capturing a range of common and legitimate activities routinely performed by universities and academics during the course of their required activities. They also said: … any issues significant enough to have become subject to a parliamentary inquiry or departmental consultation process have a strong potential to become election issues at a later date. Arts organisations raised concerns: It is not uncommon for works of art … to express views or to communicate and inspire public debate or insight on issues of social importance … Determining where an artist's artistic intent ends and political or social intent begins is not clear cut. Introducing a law that requires such a distinction is inappropriate. Concerns were also raised by Indigenous education groups, regional aid and conservation groups around the sorts of groups which are often encouraged by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to engage in cultural outreach. They were concerned that they might be caught by the draft bill. There was concern that, before handing around the collection platter to support an organisation such as an Anglicare or UnitingCare, the minister might have to tell those in the congregation: 'If you're not a citizen, don't put money in the collection plate.' That's how poorly drafted this original bill was. So Labor stood up for free speech. We shared the sectors' concerns and fought for their interests. It wasn't the first time we had had to do this. It wasn't the first time the government had brought Australia's charities together against them. There have been two open letters to the Prime Minister complaining about attacks on charities. Indeed, under the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government, the current Prime Minister is the only one not to have gotten an open letter from charities complaining about the attacks on them by his government. The most recent of these open letters was signed by a plethora of community groups, including Volunteering Australia, Carers Australia, the Australian Conservation Foundation, the Community Council of Australia, Justice Connect,  Philanthropy Australia and the Starlight Children's Foundation. As the Hands Off Our Charities team put it when expressing their concerns about the original version of this bill: Most if not all charities seek to change society in some way to improve the circumstances and outcomes for the people, places or issues they represent. ……… Under the proposed Bill, the legitimate role of charities as advocates for their charitable purpose is fundamentally changed, with charities that seek policy and other reforms through a public process being recast as political entities engaged in the electoral process. The problem with foreign money is it amplifies the volume of the voices who are speaking against the interests that charities seek to represent. Foreign political donations are very rarely employed in support of the little guy, in support of causes such as public health, deforestation, climate change, inequality, poverty and disadvantage. So removing foreign influence from our politics will clear the air. But, in their original iterations, these bills were far from doing that. As Hands Off Our Charities said, the proposed bills 'would weaken debate by silencing the voices' of interests that are 'typically represented by charities in the public arena, and by placing onerous restrictions on civil society groups representing the views of large numbers of Australians.' They said that, 'This will result in public debate being further dominated by those who already enjoy access and privilege.' Whether by negligence or design, that was the coalition's vision for Australia, a place in which immigrants were told that they couldn't put money in the church collection plate, in which environmental charities were told that they couldn't work with overseas partners in dealing with the global challenge of climate change, in which consumer protection agencies told us they weren't sure they would be able to continue their campaigning on product safety, and in which international NGOs were saying, 'There's no way we'd set up our headquarters in Australia when you've got foreign donations laws which stop us working with international partners to get people around the world out of poverty'. Labor values the work of charities and not-for-profits. For encouraging supermarkets to phase out batteryfarmed eggs to demanding a royal commission into misconduct in the financial sector, our charities and not-forprofits have been at the forefront of progressive activism. But under the coalition, they have tried to silence the views of environmental charities and they've tried to prevent legal charities from being involved in law reform debates. Social services charities have been asked to sign government contracts containing gag clauses, an issue that I know my colleagues, Senators Pratt and MCAllister, have been speaking about very strongly. And I know that the member for Barton is deeply concerned about it, as was her predecessor as shadow minister for families and social services, the member for Jagajaga. The coalition crusaded for five full years to shut down the charities commission. From 2011 to 2016, their official stance was that Australia should have no charities commission. And when they were finally unable to get that bill through-it was introduced here and I spoke on the second reading-and pulled that bill, they appointed a charity critic as its head. There has been a survey done by Pro Bono Australia which found that two-thirds of Australian charities find it harder to be heard by the federal government now than they were five years ago. And when we look at how the coalition has spent the last five years, it's hardly surprising. We've had six ministers over five years responsible for the Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission: Kevin Andrews, Scott Morrison, Christian Porter, Michael MCCormack, Michael Sukkar and now Zed Seselja.",25
17,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, I remind the member for Fenner to use correct titles.,28
18,Dr LEIGH,BILLS,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. After a period in which we had the initial head of the charities commission, Susan Pascoe, doing her best to keep the organisation's morale up in the face of constant coalition attacks, and enduring up to 25 per cent staff turnover-frankly, it's hard to keep your staff when the government is committed to abolishing your organisation-we saw the appointment of well-known charities critic Gary Johns to head the commission. The coalition was so proud of this that they made that announcement at the very same time in which this House was passing its historic vote on same-sex marriage! That's not what you do when you're proud of an announcement. Appointing Gary Johns to head the charities commission is like putting Dracula in charge of the blood bank, or like putting Ned Kelly in charge of bank security or like putting Bronwyn Bishop in charge of transport for politicians! Let's go through some of the things that Gary Johns has said in the past, because the minister, when appointing him, said he hadn't read his work. Gary Johns has said that the Abbott government: … should deny charity status to the enemies of progress, … Who knows who the enemies of progress are?  He believes in scrapping the Charities Act 2013, which effectively throws charities law back to the 1600s. I love the 1600s! Many great things came out of the 1600s, not least of them Shakespeare. But I don't know that our charities want their laws to go back to the 1600s. Gary Johns has said, 'There is a great deal of impure altruism in the charities business.' He has attacked Recognise, calling it the 'officially sanctioned propaganda arm of the Australian government'. He has attacked beyondblue for their work with LGBT+ people. He made the comment, 'a lot of poor women in this country, a large proportion of whom are Aboriginal, are used as cash cows, right'. I'm not sure how Indigenous charities feel about the fact that a man who made that comment now heads the charities commission. I don't know how welfare charities would feel about Gary Johns' statement: If a person's sole source of income is the taxpayer, the person, as a condition of benefit, must have contraception. No contraception, no benefit. I'm not sure how multicultural charities feel about the fact that Gary Johns, the head of the charities commission, said: Australia is sucking in too many of the wrong type of immigrant. … There is no doubt many Australians have considerable misgivings about Muslim immigration and the ability of many to fit in. That's Gary Johns, the head of the charities commission. And I'm not sure how environmental charities working to boost renewable energy and get more of those solar panels on the roof that so many Australians enjoy would feel about the fact that the head of the charities commission has said, 'We know for a fact that renewable energy is the cause of the blackouts.' Labor has engaged with charities across the country in working to boost charitable advocacy. As Welcome to Australia founder, Brad Chilcott, has said that the government's approach to charities is akin to saying, 'You can plant a tree but you can't protect the forest.' They want to put a velvet rope across the entrance to the public square. Labor is working with charities. We support the Justice Connect campaign to fix fundraising. We have held 16 Reconnected forums across Australia, with more than 1,500 charity heads discussing how to rebuild civic life in Australia-how to get around that 'disconnected' problem that Australia faces. We want to work with charities, not against them. So, in working to redraft this bill, we endorsed the Hands Off Our Charities Red Line Principles. These principles guided the final amendments that were made to the bill. The commitment we made to support them underpinned our close and consultative work with Australian charities. We set out to fix the government's mess, and we have done just that. I want to pay particular tribute to Nick Terrell, in my office, and to Ben Rillo, in Senator Farrell's office, for their very impressive work on the details of this and engaging with the charity sector. We have worked with charities but also with the goal of banning foreign donations. There were some on the Left of politics who said we just had to tear up the bill and start again. If we had listened to the Greens, we wouldn't be getting foreign money out of politics today. If the Greens had had their way, this bill would be dead. I don't think any reasonable person imagines that the coalition would have come to the table to get bipartisan support for a ban on foreign political donations. So Labor did what it always does: it found that sensible centrist path between the rip-it-all-up group on the Left and those who wanted to hurt charities on the Right. And, as a range of third parties have noted, we managed to get that balance right. The CEO of the Australian Conservation Foundation, Kelly O'Shanassy, has said: When first introduced this bill was a draconian proposal that redefined non-partisan, independent, issues-based advocacy as political campaigning and would have subjected Australian charities to many of the restrictions in the Electoral Act that were designed and intended for political parties. The proposal that has entered the Senate is: … a significant improvement … addressing many of the concerns raised by charities and non-profits. … … … The change to the definition of 'electoral matter' in particular is a substantial improvement … and will free charities from a significant red tape burden. ACF recognised the federal Labor Party, the opposition leader, and, in particular, shadow charities minister Andrew Leigh and shadow Special Minister of State Don Farrell for their ongoing consultation with the charities sector. Professor Tony Cunningham, president of the Association of Australian Medical Research Institutes, says: We're pleased to see that our concerns were heard, and this Bill now strikes a much better balance between protecting the integrity of our electoral processes while allowing for charities to speak out on important matters.  They have welcomed their ability to speak out on public policy issues, while working with international partners and receiving vital international research grants. They acknowledge the work of the Hands Off Our Charities alliance, as well as Senator Farrell, Senator Cormann, Senator Reynolds and myself. Hugh de Kretser, the executive director of the Human Rights Law Centre, says: The Human Rights Law Centre welcomes the electoral funding bill that is to come before the Senate today, which is vastly different from the initial proposal that would have stifled vital public advocacy by charities. … … … In December 2017, the Turnbull Government introduced a badly flawed bill, purportedly to address foreign influence in elections that would have stifled public advocacy by charities and other community groups. A strong campaign from the united charity sector highlighted the extensive flaws in the proposal. … … … Charities and community groups do vital work building a better, healthier society. Our democracy is stronger when they are free to speak up. David Crosbie, the CEO of the Community Council for Australia and a tireless campaigner for the rights of charities and not-for-profits, said: The Community Council for Australia (CCA) was very concerned about how the original Electoral Reform Bill (2017) would impact thousands of charities who would have faced quite complicated new administrative requirements and restrictions if they chose to make any public statements advocating for their cause or their community. … … … Since CCA first raised our concerns about the Bill, the Shadow Minister for Charities Andrew Leigh has been an active advocate for a more sensible approach that would protect issues-based advocacy by charities. We are pleased that a more reasoned Bill is now being introduced into the Parliament … ... … … The revised Bill is a good demonstration of how public policy can be improved when the concerns of charities are taken seriously. Our democracy is stronger when charities are able to actively represent their causes and ensure the least powerful in our communities are represented. Misha Coleman, the executive director of Global Health Alliance Melbourne, says: Global Health Alliance Melbourne welcomes the bipartisan and crossbench support for this version of the Bill, which is a drastically improved version from the original draft … ... … … … investments from foreign donors such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to vital health and medical research-in areas from paediatrics to malaria-will now not be jeopardised. Barry Traill, the Australian director of Pew Charitable Trusts, said: It is vital for democracy and society that charities can speak up and advocate on issues of public importance. We welcome the changes made to this Bill that will allow this to continue. We congratulate the MPs from all parties that listened to concerns from charities and worked hard to make this legislation work for Australia and for Australians. We need to get foreign money out of politics and we have done just that. The influence of foreign donations has been in the news in Australia. It was in the news last month in New Zealand with the Jami-Lee Ross scandal involving foreign political donations. It is vital we get foreign money out of politics, and I return to where I began. The Liberals and Nationals have said they are supporting this bill. They must, therefore, instruct their party machines never to accept another dollar of foreign political donations, starting right now.",28
19,Mr GILES,BILLS," I will start my contribution where my colleague and friend the member for Fenner, the shadow minister, left off. The Electoral Legislation Amendment (Electoral Funding and Disclosure Reform) Bill 2018 is about restoring trust and integrity to our political processes. That isn't all about the contents of this bill or, indeed, any piece of legislation. There is nothing stopping Liberal and National parties and, indeed, some other parties from abiding by its spirit now as the Australian Labor Party has been doing for quite some time. So I make that invitation. I join the member for Fenner in extending that invitation to our conservative opponents to act now and not wait for the enactment of this piece of legislation. They can show that they are genuinely committed to the principles this bill seeks to set out. These principles are very important. I think the biggest challenge facing our politics is the erosion of trust and confidence in our politics and our political institutions. I think also that maybe the biggest failing of this parliament in recent years-although in the past five years there have been many spectacular failings-has been our inability across the aisle to address this challenge. I am pleased to be supporting this bill and, hopefully, to see  it enacted into law, because it would represent the biggest step forward in electoral reform and campaign finance reform in well over a decade. It completes a journey that our party, the Australian Labor Party, embarked upon over a decade ago. I think this is worth reflecting on. I will also reflect on the journey this piece of legislation has been on, because I think that is instructive as well. But I think all members should be mindful of the fact that very similar proposals-adopting different mechanisms, it's true-have been, effectively, before this parliament for more than a decade. Indeed, the Australian Labor Party has had private members' bills and private senators' bills attending to this very issue in this parliament. I think that, in reflecting on that, there's another matter that needs to be touched upon, and that is to ensure that when we seek to make progress in this area-as, indeed, in any area of reform-we cannot allow perfect to be the enemy of good. I think it is fair to say that this also goes to these questions about trust in politics and frustration with our political system. We have seen in the course of this debate members and senators taking the path of grandstanding rather than seeking to effectively make change. It's very easy to commentate, but I would submit and suggest to those in this place who choose to do so that there are plenty of places outside of our legislature from which they can do so. The choice that was presented to Labor members and senators when this bill arrived in the parliament was whether or not we could fix it or simply seek to reject it on its terms, which were manifestly inadequate, as we said. We chose the path of seeking to advance reform in this critical area and chose to seek to lift up this place, this parliament, as a place which can achieve meaningful reform, responding to a deep sense of frustration right across the community. I'm very pleased to say that our interventions along with civil society have resulted in a piece of legislation which does achieve a critical political objective. If it's said that this piece of legislation does not resolve all the outstanding issues around campaign finance and donations reform, of course that's true, but it's just completely irrelevant. The bottom line here is that we have taken a step forward as a parliament and we will take a step forward as a polity, as a nation, because we have chosen not to allow perfect to be the enemy of good, because we have chosen to engage respectfully with one another as parliamentarians and, indeed, with affected stakeholders to take a big step forward. That's not to say there isn't more to be done-of course there is-but let us focus on the bill at hand. Let's also focus on the journey this piece of legislation has been on. I mentioned earlier that proposals to effectively ban foreign donations to political parties have been put before this place for over a decade. This legislation was originally introduced over a year ago and its terms were manifestly unsatisfactory, as the member for Fenner has said. He was of course correct to cite one of our most eminent constitutional scholars, Professor Anne Twomey, noting her assessment that the original bill was 'extraordinarily badly drafted'. He has quite effectively set out the consequences or the potential consequences of allowing the bill as it was originally introduced to be enacted into law. What that bill did do was enable an important conversation, a very important democratic conversation, in this place and in the wider Australian community. It reminded us that there are important considerations to be balanced here. A critical one that has been of great concern to me and all my Labor colleagues has been to get the balance right between preserving our political institutions from improper foreign interference through the mechanism of foreign donations and not stifling the legitimate operations of a robust civil society, not least as a check on people in this place and, in particular, in executive government. It is extraordinary-we should reflect on this-that the bill as originally introduced achieves something that many, including me, would have thought was impossible: it brought together the IPA, the Human Rights Law Centre and myself in opposition to a proposition. It unified almost the entirety of Australian civil society, including groups which have very diverse ideological and programmatic objectives, in opposition to a bill which, on the face of it, was dealing with foreign interference with our formal politics but would have had an extraordinary effect. Of course there are considerations to be balanced here. I think all of us in this place understand there is political activity that is conducted by organisations and entities that are not registered political parties. That is something we need to be mindful of, but we need to be mindful of that in a considered and measured way, not simply in terms of formal legal consequences but in terms of having regard to the shape of our democracy and whether or not we believe it is imperative to retain a robust civil society that can hold all of us to account. I pay tribute to those civil society organisations who campaigned and engaged so effectively over the duration of the journey to this bill being debated in this place today-those groups that came together in the Hands Off Our Charities alliance. They came together and reconciled their own positions, as well as grappling with significant first principle concerns, to establish a set of red line principles that informed my consideration of the provisions before us and, I think, shaped ultimately the disposition of senators in considering this bill too. They enabled us to address whether the measures were proportionate to the broad societal and political interests we were seeking to advance. They enabled us to come together with a package of amendments before us today which do justice to the twin objectives: dealing with the question of removing the influence, real and perceived, of foreign donations on  our politics whilst recognising the legitimate interests of many civil society organisations and ensuring that they are not unduly fettered by any such law being introduced, as would have been the case with the original bill. I'm very pleased to have served in this parliament as the Deputy Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. I'm pleased to have worked with a number of colleagues on that committee from across the parliament. I think the work of that committee in considering the original bill-the bill as originally presented to the parliament-was important and perhaps another marker of the way in which we can work together to rebuild a sense of trust and confidence in this institution. I think it is striking that a government bill was considered by this multipartisan committee, which was able to then reach agreement in terms which recommended a radical reshaping of the bill and which drew attention to its fundamental antidemocratic deficiencies. I would like to acknowledge once more the work done by the former chair of the committee, Senator Reynolds, who managed a challenging process professionally, courteously and with an eye to her very clear sense of the wider objective that ought to unite all of us in this place: to uphold the quality of our democracy so we can play out the important policy and ideological debates in this place. I think, but for the contribution of Senator Reynolds, we would not be standing here making such a statement, such a step forward, when it comes to reform of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. I'd also like to acknowledge another former member of the committee, former Senator Lee Rhiannon from the Greens party. I think, again, Senator Rhiannon showed herself to be an incredibly effective presence on the committee in dealing with this piece of legislation and, indeed, other issues, recognising that this was an issue where we should try to bring the parliament together-and we did through the committee. The Greens, the Australian Labor Party and the government came together with a series of recommendations that substantially took us to the place we are today. I note Senator Rhiannon's contribution because I think it does deal with the issue I touched on earlier. This question of us living up to the expectations of our constituents and the Australian public requires we who are given the privilege to be lawmakers to engage principally with the act of lawmakingnot with grandstanding, not with commentary and not with indulging ourselves from the position of the sidelines, but by getting in and seeing if we can reconcile issues by having the debates that certainly Lee Rhiannon and I would have when it came to questions of policy. So I pay tribute to her very significant contribution. I also acknowledge all my colleagues on the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, because that initial report did not dispose of this. The government came back with a redrafted bill. We had another look at it. On this occasion, the parties represented on that committee were unable to reach unanimity, but Labor members-me, the member for Oxley, Senator Ketter and Senator Brown-put forward another series of suggestions. I'm very pleased that the substance of those concerns we expressed have, in the second advisory report on the bill, substantially been addressed. I join the shadow minister, the member for Fenner, in acknowledging the work of staff in assisting us in this. I note that we have in the advisers' box Ben Rillo from Senator Farrell's office and also Nick Terrell from the member for Fenner's office. I am personally indebted to their contributions. I also acknowledge that Don Farrell, as the senior shadow minister, has done a wonderful job in progressing an issue that has been on the Notice Paper in one way or another for a very long time. If not for Senator Farrell's efforts, working in collaboration with Senator Cormann, we would not be in the place we are now. Members and senators have made the choice to act on this issue of foreign donations. We made the choice not to make the perfect the enemy of the good. I hope that is a choice that members in this place will also embracethat people will not give into the temptation to talk about what is not in the bill rather than what it is in it. Of course, there are many aspects which are fundamental to improving our democracy and our politics which are not contained in this bill. I would have thought that was self-evident. That's not to say that they should be introduced into the bill. In many contributions I know that both the shadow minister and I have talked about Labor's bold vision for democratic reform. It would be remiss not to mention the resolution in this place yesterday in that regard, where this place and the other place have called for the establishment of a national integrity commission-a call which it appears government members regard as a fringe matter, although sufficiently 'unfringe', I may say, for them to vote for it in Australia's House of Representatives. There's more to be done, of course, when it comes to real-time donations, lowering the donation threshold and many other matters that really go to the heart of taking money out of politics and all improper influence out of Australian democracy. These are important matters. They are so important that they should be debated properly, not used as cheap debating points in the context of this bill. We should continue-and we on this side of the House will continue-to make the case for our vision of tidying up Australian democracy and for our vision to ensure that Australians can have confidence that decisions in this place are made on their merits, not on the basis of undue influences, be they foreign or otherwise. But these are distinct debates and they should be treated with  the respect they deserve. Legislation should be introduced, and I certainly hope the government will enable us to debate either the private senator's bill or the private member's bill that have been introduced, or legislation in similar terms. Labor continue to be committed to our wide-ranging vision for restoring Australian democracy, but today we are here to debate a big step forward. It deserves to be discussed in its own terms, because those terms are important. They're important because the goal of banning foreign donations is one that, I think, is genuinely shared by every member of this place, and, equally importantly, because the issue of democratic reform has been a question that has bedevilled this parliament for decades. Today we take a major step forward. Let us celebrate that step forward, and let us then move on to furthering the work. I'm pleased to support this bill.",30
20,Mr GOSLING,BILLS," I thank the previous speaker, the member for Scullin, for his words and for framing the debate in a bipartisan way. But, in doing so, I want to remind people of some history, because I think history's important. The intent of the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Electoral Funding and Disclosure Reform) Bill 2018 is to ban foreign donations from the Australian political system, and this has been Labor policy for years. Labor went to the 2016 election with a policy to ban foreign donations, require disclosure of donations over $1,000, ban donation splitting, ban anonymous donations over $50, limit public funding of campaign expenditure and to introduce new offences and increase penalties. Not just did we go to the 2016 election with that policy; we introduced a bill into the Senate in 2016 to ban foreign donations. The government insisted on bringing in its own legislation, which had the remarkable effect of uniting all the charities, not-for-profits, advocacy groups, churches and industry associations against it-a remarkable achievement! They got GetUp! and the Institute of Public Affairs to agree on something; it was remarkable. The government's bill created such concern that a number of our trusted charities and not-for-profits formed the Hands Off Our Charities alliance to oppose the changes. The government's first bungled attempt at this bill would have captured a whole range of worthy organisations-charities, churches, community groups-in a maze of regulations and obstacles. It was absurd and ridiculous overreach. I think it's important to remember that it was incompetence on a grand scale. These organisations would have been unable to meet their quite legitimate aims. Some of these organisations were so concerned that they demanded the bill be opposed outright. During this policy and legislative disaster, we on this side did two things-took two constructive actions. We voluntarily decided to refuse to take foreign donations, something I'm very proud that we committed to. I would add that those opposite, the Liberal and National coalition parties, made no such commitment. Clearly, it was to our financial disadvantage to limit the groups and organisations we were able to receive support from, but we believed that it was the right thing to do. This was an action which did not require legislation; we simply did it. The Australian public is wondering why those opposite, the coalition parties, are not doing the same. The second thing we did was to work constructively with the charities-the churches, the not-for-profits-to fix this legislation. The bill was referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters for the committee first to review the bill and then to review the proposed changes. The Labor members of this committee-the member for Scullin, who we just heard from, the member for Oxley and Senators Ketter and Brown-did great work in making the bill more workable and more effective. That's why I want us to remember the bill's history and remember the principled stand that has been taken by members on this side of the House, members in the great Australian Labor Party. Labor members of that committee did very good work. This bill is important. We believe that foreign donations are eroding our political system and eroding public trust in our democratic processes, and we believe that there are external threats to Australian democracy and our democratic institutions.",33
21,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BILLS, Order! The debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 43. The debate may be resumed at a later hour. NA South Australia: Hospitals,33
22,Mr ZAPPIA,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," This week the South Australian Marshall Liberal government announced that $18.9 million will be paid to accounting firm KordaMentha to find $276 million of savings out of the Central Adelaide Local Health Network expenditure. Savings is code for cuts: $276 million in health funding cuts to a health system that is already under considerable strain with ambulance queuing at a crisis point, with elective surgery waiting times becoming a joke and with emergency department waiting times at public hospitals forcing people to leave without treatment. It will ultimately result in a poorer public health system within the state. The cuts come on top of $31 million of federal government cuts.  The appointment of KordaMentha is nothing but a backdoor attempt to privatise the management of South Australia's public hospitals and in turn offload responsibility from the minister on to an unelected entity when the minister already has an entire department to manage his portfolio. Even worse, it is $18.9 million that could better have been spent on much needed public health services that would make a meaningful difference to the lives of South Australians. Page Electorate: OneWave",33
23,Mr HOGAN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," OneWave is worldwide organisation that draws together the surfing community to promote mental health. The group holds fluoro Fridays each week to raise awareness about mental health. Lisa Nichols from Woolgoolga is a driving force behind fluoro Friday on the northern beaches. She recently met the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. Not daunted by the occasion, she also managed to get a kiss from Prince Harry, or should I say Prince Harry was lucky enough to get a kiss from Lisa! The Woopi group has been running for two years thanks to Lisa's enthusiasm and they were lucky enough to have been picked to attend the fluoro Friday event on Bondi Beach where she discussed mental health issues with the Duke and Duchess. I'd like to acknowledge all of the volunteers, in particular Brett Pirlon and Robert Watkins who take all the photos of the activities. Lisa is a very strong advocate for mental health and is also involved with the RU OK? movement and many other local community groups. I thank all of the fluoro Friday group for the wonderful job they do in our community. Master Builders Australia awards",34
24,Mr GOSLING,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Over the weekend Master Builders Australia held their annual awards for national excellence in building and construction. I'm very pleased to report to the House that our NT apprentice of the year is also the Australian-the national-apprentice of the year, Darwin's own Rory Walker. Well done, Rory. Rory works as a builder at a Territory owned firm Sunbuild and he played a prominent role in the development of the boulevard plaza project in the 'Palmy' CBD. Well done to Rory and Sunbuild. It's an award that is well deserved and just rewards for the hard work put in by Rory and also Sunbuild. Rory wasn't the only winner from the NT with Vanguard Homes taking the award for national alterations and additions under $200,000 and they were also a finalist in the Cbus National Medium Density Award. Well done Vanguard Homes. Other finalists included Michael Buckley from M&J Builders in the Toyota National Young Builder of the Year award, Killarney Homes, Captiv8 Homes, La Perouse Homes, MCT Design and Construction, KTM Builders NT group, Halikos Group, Probuild NT, Sitzler Pty Ltd, Sunbuild and Hutchinson Builders. Congratulations again to Rory, Vanguard and all those finalists, and well done to everyone for showing once again that Territorians punch above their weight. Good on you. Calare Electorate: Roads",34
25,Mr GEE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," For 160 years, people have been trying to get a road across the Macquarie River at Dixons Long Point in the Central West of New South Wales. An upgraded crossing would deliver a wide range of benefits to Calare and New South Wales, not only opening up the entire Central West to tourism opportunities but also better connecting the communities of Mudgee, Orange and Bathurst. It's expected that sealing the road and constructing a bridge over the Macquarie River could save up to 45 minutes on the trip between Orange and Mudgee. The preferred option-a bridge over the Macquarie River at Dixons Long Point-along with the paving of about 40 kilometres of road would cost about $19.3 million. Back in 2016, the federal and New South Wales governments both committed funding for a feasibility study. We now have those reports back, and they're looking very positive. There's an impressive benefit-cost ratio of nearly 2.5, and we also have local, state and federal government representatives all supporting the project. An application for funding under the Roads of Strategic Importance initiative has now been submitted. This is our golden opportunity to fund and build a crossing at Dixons Long Point. The naysayers claim that it will never happen. Well, they said that about the Murray Darling Medical School as well, and our community proved them wrong on that one. The time for this project has come, so let's get it done. Centenary of Armistice",34
26,Ms HUSAR,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," It was my great honour to attend the 100th anniversary of Armistice in the electorate of Lindsay on Remembrance Day. The event in my electorate was organised by the Penrith CBD Corporation in collaboration with the City of Penrith, St Marys and Glenbrook RSL sub-branches. I praise the CEO of Penrith CBD Corporation, Gay Hawthorne, for bringing the three branches together for this very special event. Ron Blakely, John Wakefield and Mick MCConnell, the presidents of all three of those branches-I can't imagine what it was like to come together as three RSLs to do that-pulled off a significant and very memorable event. It's been my absolute pleasure to support the committee through the $50,000 grant that we were able to  secure from the federal government to ensure that our community had access to such a significant commemoration. It is fitting to acknowledge the struggles that we face towards reconciling our past on such days as Remembrance Day. I was able to give a speech that day and acknowledged, also, the 1,200 Aboriginal men who served in the First World War. It was the first time in their lives that they were treated as equals among their nonIndigenous peers. Sometimes we forget that we had First Nations people serving, and Reg Saunders, who lived next door to Penrith in St Marys, was the first Indigenous soldier to become a commissioned officer in the Australian Army. There are 42 wars active today, and in 2018 127,337 lives have been lost. On 11 November 2018, we made a promise that we will remember, and we will. Lyne Electorate: Community Groups",34
27,Dr GILLESPIE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," It was my great honour and pleasure to meet with the board of the Comboyne Ex-Servicemen's and Citizens' Club at the Comboyne Plateau to announce a $10,000 grant that's going to catalyse a $20,000 upgrade to the wonderful Comboyne Ex-Servicemen's and Citizens' Club. We've also supported them in an application to the Roads of Strategic Importance initiative to complete the resurfacing of the Comboyne to Lorne Road, which is an avenue of commerce. All of the macadamia industry, and dairy, beef and cattle will be linked directly to the Pacific Highway. I also visited the Kendall Tennis Club, which was also successful with a grant to upgrade the wonderful tennis facilities at Kendall. They've got the biggest junior tennis program running outside of metropolitan Australia, and they are going from strength to strength. The Harrington Chamber of Commerce was also successful in getting a grant to develop a history walk commemorating the explorer John Oxley, who visited Harrington on his amazing journey to the hinterland and out to the coast. Lots of strong community groups in the Lyne electorate are benefitting from the Stronger Communities Program. It's my great honour to be fighting for members of the Lyne electorate. All these community groups really deserve the support they get, and congratulations to them all. Safety Bay Senior High School: 40th Anniversary Ms MADELEINE KING (Brand) (13:38): Last week, I attended the 40th birthday celebrations of my old school Safety Bay Senior High School. Safety Bay Senior High School was celebrating 40 years of public education in what was, when it was built, the very outer suburbs of the Perth metropolitan area. Perth has grown very much since then, and there are many newer high schools and even more primary schools that have been built to support the education of a growing population across Rockingham and Kwinana. Schools like Safety Bay Senior High School play a critical role in the development of a community, and this school has provided generations of Safety Bay kids with the education they need and which is indeed their right. Labor is the party of education in this country. It always has been and always will be. The ability of all in this country to access public education and health care is at the core of Labor's beliefs. Whether it is university education, vocational education, high school education, primary school education or, indeed, early childhood education, it is only the Labor Party that puts education at the core of its focus every day. While the dinosaurs in the Liberal Party argue about which man is the most able to hustle the votes of arch conservatives in their parliamentary wing and their membership, Labor gets on with developing policies that will improve the lives and education of young people. Under Labor, if elected to government, Safety Bay Senior High School will receive $2 million, Rockingham High School will receive $1.75 million, Comet Bay Senior High School will receive $3 million, Gilmore College in Kwinana will receive $2 million and Baldivis Secondary School will receive over $3 million. Across the seat of Brand, if Labor is elected to government, $37 million(Time expired) Diabetes",35
28,Mr GOODENOUGH,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," There are 130,000 Australians with type 1 diabetes. It is a condition that is growing at the rate of 3,500 patients per year and affects many people in my electorate of Moore. I welcome the announcement by the health minister this week that the federal government will invest an extra $100 million over four years to support patients with type 1 diabetes by making continuous glucose monitoring devices available to more than 37,000 Australians. This new initiative will save families up to $7,000 per year. From 1 March 2019, eligibility for fully subsidised continuous glucose monitoring devices will be expanded under the National Diabetes Services Scheme to include: women with type 1 diabetes while pregnant, breastfeeding or actively planning a pregnancy; people with type 1 diabetes who are 21 years or older who have concessional status and who have high clinical need, such as those experiencing recurrent severe hypoglycemic events; children and young people with conditions similar to type 1 diabetes who require insulin-this includes a range of  conditions, such as cystic fibrosis related diabetes or neonatal diabetes. Expanding access to these glucose monitoring devices may offer many other health benefits, including reducing stress and anxiety. Mayo Electorate: Community Service Awards",35
29,Ms SHARKIE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," As we approach the end of the school year, I have spent the last month presenting the Mayo community service awards. The award is conferred to a senior student who has demonstrated a keen interest in social justice and shown great community leadership potential. This is about hearts and minds coming together. Students who have been awarded so far include Cyril Saji from Rostrevor College, Laura Wuttke from Heathfield High School, Tobias Turner from Tatachilla Lutheran College, Milla Pinney-Scales from Mount Barker High School, Ella Green from Birdwood High School and Ciel Schmarr from Mount Barker Waldorf School. While I cannot yet disclose the winners, other schools participating include Tyndale Christian School, Eastern Fleurieu R to 12, Cornerstone College, Willunga High School, St Francis de Sales College, Victor Harbor High School, Hills Christian Community Secondary School, Investigator College, Yankalilla Area School, Kangaroo Island Community school and Encounter Lutheran School. My congratulations go out to all of our young community leaders in Mayo, and we indeed have many, many leaders. I'd also like to congratulate all of the students who are graduating from year 12 this year. I know it is an incredibly difficult year for you but it is a year of great growth and hope and I wish you all the best for your future endeavours. Cowper Electorate: Belcher, Ms Rosa",36
30,Mr HARTSUYKER,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise in the House to honour Telegraph Point's oldest resident, Rosa Belcher, who turned 100 on 14 November. Rosa is a great Australian, who was born in Extremadura, Spain in 1918. She emigrated to Australia with husband, Ted, and son, Patrick, in 1950. To celebrate Rosa's 100th birthday, the Telegraph Point Community Association hosted a birthday party at the Telegraph Point School of Arts. I was delighted to attend. I would like to commend the association's president Sue Pike for organising the event, with the help of hall manager Ross Trevelyn and community members Kerry Armstrong and Ken Greenwood. Rosa enjoyed a beautiful birthday cake decorated in the colours of the Spanish flag. The cake was made by community member Mary Cass. Happy birthday was sung in Spanish. Therese Glen-Holmes, the post office manager, and her staff were diligent in ensuring everyone signed the all-important birthday card. Rosa's family travelled from Sydney, and friends came from Brisbane and the Port Macquarie-Wauchope area. It was a delight to see how the Telegraph Point community cares for their oldest citizen. Rosa lives independently at 100, and this is possible because there is a caring community on hand. Happy birthday, Rosa! Women in Information and Communication",36
31,Ms BRODTMANN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I'm the proud patron of Women in Information and Communication, or WIC, as it's known, which is an organisation that champions the role of women in the information technology, communications and cybersecurity sectors. WIC recently held its annual debate and award night. The debate topic was 'Promoting, not mentoring, will resolve gender equity in ICT.' I took part in that debate; unfortunately, our team lost. That said, I had the great privilege of presenting the WIC Student Encouragement Award to Abbie Don, who intends to pursue a career in the sector after completing university. Abbie is extraordinary. She currently attends the University of Canberra Senior Secondary College. She is doing a double major in information technology, a double major in mathematics, essential English, and photography. I also presented the WICked Woman of the Year award, which goes to a woman in the Canberra region who's made a significant contribution to the ICT industry, who's acted as a role model or mentor for women and who's encouraged women into this industry. This year the award went to Dr Lesley Seebeck, who is currently the CEO of ANU Cyber Institute. Dr Seebeck is a leader in her field and a champion of encouraging women to consider careers in STEM. I encourage any woman who is working in or considering a career in the information, communications and cybersecurity sectors to get in contact with WIC and become part of this network. Canning Electorate: Peel Health Campus",36
32,Mr HASTIE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Today marks 210 days since the Peel health rally. On that chilly May night more than 400 people from the Mandurah community stood outside the Peel Health Campus and called on the WA Labor government to give us a better hospital. Everyone in Mandurah knows that the current hospital isn't good enough. The staff of the Peel Health Campus work tirelessly for our community, and I applaud them, but the hospital was built in the nineties to service a community half the size of today's. We need action from the WA Labor state government.  The member for Dawesville, Zak Kirkup, and I have been of one voice with the people of Mandurah in calling on the WA Labor government to step up and do something about it. In September, the WA government tried to buy our silence with the promise of $5 million to renovate the emergency department. That's a welcome investment, to be sure, but it amounts to little more than eight additional short-stay beds in two years time. It's not good enough. What really bites is that, when you consider Labor's overall spending in WA, the $5 million for PHC amounts to less than 1.5 per cent of their total spend on hospitals in WA. The WA Labor government allocated $158 million to the Joondalup Health Campus. What did they allocate to the Peel region? Zero. Then they offered us breadcrumbs, when pushed. Labor is failing Mandurah. For 210 days we've demanded a better Peel Health Campus. We will continue to keep up that fight, no matter how long it takes. Burt Electorate: FIRST LEGO League Competition",36
33,Mr KEOGH,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Mr Deputy Speaker Hogan: Everything is awesome, everything is cool when your part of a team … … … We're the same unlike you, you're like me we're all working in harmony. No, I'm not talking about the Labor Party working together in opposition to the infighting on the other side. However, I can see why there might be some confusion. It's an easy mistake to make. I'm talking about the FIRST LEGO League competition, which was hosted at Cecil Andrews College in Armadale earlier this month. The FIRST LEGO League competition is a STEM activity for young people aged nine to 16. These teams work across three months to build and code an autonomous robot made from LEGO and then compete against other schools in a variety of different challenges. Along the way, students are judged on their design, their programming and the robustness of the robot, as well as on their teamwork. The students competing at Cecil Andrews were given the task of creating a solution for long-term living in space. One team proposed an entire space Olympics, while another designed ways to recycle waste in space, to reuse plastic, metal and paper. Congratulations to Cecil Andrews College, the Armadale Robotics Clubs and all 34 teams that competed from around Perth, and especially from many local schools through the electorate of Burt and Perth's south-eastern suburbs. Congratulations to Gwynne Park Primary School, Greenwood College and Clifton Hill's Primary School, which all advanced to the next round of the tournament. Everything is awesome, especially you. Groom Electorate: Heritage Bank Business Excellence Awards",37
34,Dr MCVEIGH,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Earlier this month the Toowoomba Chamber of Commerce hosted the 2018 Heritage Bank Business Excellence Awards at our wonderful historic Empire Theatre in Toowoomba, with the indomitable Lee Faulkner as MC. This was a tremendous event showing the innovation and enterprise of businesses-particularly small businesses-right across the Toowoomba region. About 400 members of the business community were there, and my daughter Marita and I were very pleased to be guests on the evening as well. I want to acknowledge some of the category winners. In tourism there was Round Square Marketing. Hospitality and heritage bank business of the year was Monkey Business Catering. In the industry category there was Electrical Sensations. Retail was Classic Beauty Therapy. Professional and business was Straney & Collier. Community and not-for-profit was Kath Dickson Family Centre. Innovation had combined winners: Straney & Collier and the Pulse Data Centre. It was very pleasing to see the best regional business being Tentworld and future leader of the year Jason Doig, Head of Operations at JJ Richards & Sons in Toowoomba. The 2018 hall of fame inductee at these awards was the wonderful Stahmann Farms. I acknowledge all of those winners and all of the nominees. It's great to see the energy coming out of the Toowoomba Chamber of Commerce, ably led by Joy Mingay, the president. Mabo, Dr Bonita, AO",37
35,Mr THISTLETHWAITE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," Along with all Australians I offer my deepest condolences to the Mabo family on the loss of Bonita Mabo AO. Ninety seconds here can't reflect the enormous achievement she made in her 75 years. Quite simply, Australia is a better place because of Bonita Mabo. A proud Malanbarra woman, she was indeed the mother of native title in this land and, with her husband, Eddie Koiki, put Australia on the road to reconciliation and, in doing so, overturned centuries-long unjust laws of terra nullius. That road was a long one, yet Mrs Mabo was a tireless fighter for the human rights of First Nations people. She was also an advocate for the recognition of South Sea Islanders. A passion for education saw Mrs Mabo start Australia's first Indigenous community school in 1972, where children were taught not only traditional learning techniques but their native Indigenous culture and language. A lifetime of service saw her recognised in 2013 with an Officer of the Order of Australia, but for Mrs Mabo there was still more work to do. Her dream was for a national holiday every year on 3 June, the day of the High Court Mabo judgement. She said it would be a day to  unite and bring all Australians together. It's because of Mrs Mabo that that dream for reconciliation in our nation lives on. Vale, Bonita Mabo. (Time expired) Australian Public Service",37
36,Mr JOYCE,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," They said that decentralisation would not work. They told us that having a centre of excellence at Armidale with APVMA was not going to come through, but now we have the evidence coming in. We have 300 job applications for merely 50 positions. There are 131 applications coming from capital cities and 110 from Armidale and surrounding areas. Thirty-eight are from interstate and nine are from overseas. There are 79 applications for 19 scientific positions. This is clear evidence that people are willing to move to a regional city such as Armidale. They do see the future in decentralisation. And it is not only that; there are also 340 applications for 32 jobs in the Regional Investment Corporation, which the National Party, with the Liberals, is setting up in Orange. Whether it is Orange with the Regional Investment Corporation, Armidale with the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority, whether it is Wagga with AgriFutures, the National Party believes in decentralisation and is seeing this through to create centres of excellence and a real reason for people to live in other places apart from Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne. This is a vision that the Labor Party lacks. There is no vision from the Labor Party that actually talks of decentralisation. There is no policy for the Inland Rail from the Labor Party. There's no money on the table. They have no vision for dams. They are bereft of any reason for people in regional Australia to vote for them. Lalor Electorate: Education",38
37,Ms RYAN,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," I rise today to give a clear shout-out to the principals, school council presidents leadership teams in the schools across the electorate of Lalor. Over the past four weeks, I've visited the schools in Lalor to see some fabulous work going on on the ground, to see professional learning communities not just working across faculties and across year levels but across schools, working together to give our kids the best start in their lives. The key to this has always been resourcing. The key to this is giving schools the tools and the funds that they need to do such important work. I also want to give a particular shout-out to Steve Butyn, the principal of Werribee Secondary College, who celebrated 50 years in public education quite recently. It's a substantial, significant contribution that Steve has made not just to the schools but to the communities that he has served. In a growth corridor like ours, our schools do the heavy lifting not just in building community from the ground up but also in training teachers. They do the heavy lifting, with some schools having over 50 per cent of their teaching staff being graduates. They're doing the heavy lifting in the first five years of training new generations of teachers in Victoria. I'm sure similar things are going on in the outer suburbs of Pakenham, Sunbury and all of our outer areas. Road Safety Mr CRAIG KELLY (Hughes) (13:55): In the First and Second World Wars, over 100,000 Australians lost their lives; every single death a tragedy leaving behind grieving families and friends. Since the end of the Second World War, over 150,000 Australians have lost their lives on roads. We've lost 50 per cent more Australians since World War II than we lost in World War I and World War II combined. Although the number of fatalities has been falling since 1970, when 3,780 Australians lost their lives, to this year, where it is down to 1,225, to have over a thousand Australians losing their lives on the roads every year is simply unacceptable. As parliamentarians, we need to do everything we can to work to reduce that road toll. There is one thing that we can do. The statistics show that new cars are safer. One of the best ways to get the road toll down is to make it more affordable for motorists to get into new cars. I call on all parliamentarians on both sides of this House to join together to get rid of those remaining taxes on motoring. Get the cost of motoring down in this country, because that will save lives. Prime Minister Mr STEPHEN JONES (Whitlam) (13:57): After four weeks of crisscrossing the country trying to convince Australians that this guy is authentic-after 20 years in public life, if you've got to convince Australians that you really are the real thing, you've got a much deeper question to ask yourself-we learned this morning that they had a two-hour crisis meeting where the Prime Minister was told that the Liberal Party are homophobic, anti-women and climate change deniers. And those are only the nice things that they had to say about each other! You would have thought that any Prime Minister with his ear to the ground would have left that meeting and thought, 'There are some things I've got to change about myself.' But, no, he did not. Fresh from a meeting of very, very frank self-analysis, the Prime Minister had the audacity to walk out and turn his back on the new member for Wentworth as she delivered her first speech. Then, in question time yesterday, we saw the Prime Minister describe the call for an integrity commission as a fringe issue. There were 4,700 complaints from the Public Service Commissioner. More than one finding of corruption a week, and you think it's a fringe issue? The Prime Minister- (Time expired)  Queensland Children's Hospital",38
38,Mr LAMING,STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS," The greatness of Lady Phyllis Cilento: the only female graduate of her class of medicine in 1919; a lady medical officer in the British colonial service; in 1924 had a private practice in New Guinea; worked in the Hospital for Sick Children from 1931; and from 1928 wrote regular columns for magazines and newspapers as 'Medical Mother' and 'Mother M.D.' promoting good nutrition and raising children, and advocating for natural childbirth, for fathers to be present at the births of their children and for the legalisation of abortion back then. Yet 30 years after her death her name is torn off Queensland Children's Hospital because 18,000 of those 23,000 votes were fake votes from just 70 IP addresses-6,000 votes from just four computers. A cybersecurity expert says there's no way they can be from anywhere else but the minister's office and Queensland ministerial offices. In the August online poll, doctors approached them wanting a name change. Since when does the Labor Party listen to doctors? They said they couldn't raise money at the Lady Cilento Children's Hospital. What rubbish! Why are public servants abusing their work IP addresses when they could vote from home anyway? What a dark day for Queensland, with Labor hatred removing a woman's name from our great hospital. It's not just the name change; it's the lying behind it. It's not telling the truth. It's giving Queenslanders a say and then ignoring it. Queenslanders wanted that name to stay, but the Premier doesn't care, and she's tearing it down. (Time expired)",39

41,Mr MORRISON,CONDOLENCES," Mr Speaker, on indulgence, I rise to acknowledge the passing yesterday of Bonita Mabo, AO. Bonita Mabo was a remarkable woman who possessed a deep, quiet strength. The wife of Eddie Mabo for 32 years, whose long fight for Indigenous land rights made him part of our national pantheon, Bonita was once described as the silent woman behind the man. But while she was reserved, she was much, much more than a supportive spouse. Bonita was a leader in her on right and in her own way, and we honour that today as we mark her passing. For many years Bonita worked in the background. As Eddie attracted the headlines, continuing what Bonita called his fight, she held the family together and raised the couple's 10 children-an extraordinary achievement. Bonita's children often said, 'Mum, I don't know how you did it.' She'd reply, 'I don't even know myself.' But she instilled in them what she knew, a lesson to us all: love, honesty, generosity and humility. Bonita had the instincts of a teacher, and it was during those years that she cofounded the first Aboriginal community school because she was unhappy with the education her children were receiving. Eddie saw his wife's talents and more than once encouraged her to study, but fear would always take hold, and Bonita thought she would be laughed away. Fortunately, those fears lessened as the years passed. Eddie's death in 1992, while devastating for Bonita and her family, was a turning point. That was when her quiet strength truly emerged. Bonita was determined to fight her own battles. As an Australian South Sea Islander woman, she spent decades seeking greater understanding of the history of her people, of the suffering and pain inflicted on them. She would travel, she would talk and she would listen, and people listened to her, captivated by the strength of her character and the depths of her integrity. Eddie was a constant presence for her, even after his death. As Bonita said back in 2004: Any time. I go for conferences or anything like that he [Eddie] seems to show up. When I went down to Adelaide he was dancing-all hours of the morning it was. While he was dancing he just looked at me and had the biggest smile. He gives me strength to do the things I do. Bonita was a firm believer in smiling. 'A smile goes a long way,' she would say. It helped her to persuade, to reassure and to calm. It helped her to move the interests of her people forward whilst also advocating passionately for Indigenous schooling and the rights of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. In this building we know a lot about leaders. Every leader is different, and so was Bonita-different from the all the others and different from her husband, Eddie. Bonita was often quiet, sometimes unassuming, but no less effective and no less powerful. Her strength was quiet, drawn from her history, her family and her deep sense of justice. Bonita's wisdom and her generous, open heart will be missed, especially by her family. As someone who's  grown up in a family where, fortunately, my parents have been together all of their lives, and to also be blessed to be in such a marriage myself, I know how much it must grieve the family to lose both of their parents now. They saw so much love, so much connection, so much inspiration from their partnership over so many years, and saw that carry on even after their father passed away and the achievements we've seen. Bonita's warm and generous and open heart will be missed; her legacy, however, will endure. Like her husband, Eddie, Bonita will always be part of the story and the heart of her land, of our land. To her beloved family, I offer the heartfelt sympathy of this parliament and our nation. Honourable members: Hear, hear.",39
42,Mr SHORTEN,CONDOLENCES," Today our parliament and our nation pause to remember and honour a remarkable woman, a person who gave hope and heart to so many for so long. When Dr Mabo met Eddie, she said it was love at first sight for her and for her parents. She remembered her father would go crabbing and fishing and have it all cooked up in time for Eddie's arrival. And as she said: 'When fruit's on the tree, Mum would say, ""Don't touch that one, that's for Koiki.""' She made a lot of sacrifices for her true love: raising 10 children; a night job peeling prawns to help raise her family. She consciously sidelined much of her own Tanna culture to bring their kids up according to Eddie's traditions. And, of course, she was there for all those false dawns and dark nights of the long struggle for justice, those emotional footsteps of a quest to overturn two centuries of legal discrimination and historical denial-a victory that Eddie himself would not live to see. Modest to a fault, she said of those years: 'That was his fight. I was his wife, but that's as far as it went.' We all know just how far that was, and we honour her for that today. The House has heard of her extraordinary contribution that she made in the years following Eddie's passing. She was a tireless champion for education, who, for all of the warmth and love in her heart, believed in firm discipline, in teaching kids self-respect and self reliance. She also fought hard for greater recognition of her people's culture, which she believed had been forgotten or pushed to the margins of our national story. She wanted to promote an understanding of the lives and the history, the identity and the contribution to Australia of South Sea Islanders. This parliament should acknowledge that more than 60,000 people were brought to our continent between 1863 and 1904 from Tanna and Vanuatu and 80 or so other islands-sometimes against their will or through deception, so-called blackbirdingto work as indentured servants in the cotton and sugar plantations. When diabetes began to affect her vision, and despite the fear she had of missing her grandchildren grow up, she said: 'I'm losing my sight, but that's not going to shut my mouth up. The main thing is to talk to people and educate people.' She did. She educated Australians. I had the privilege of catching up and meeting with her in Cairns back in 2015. I was struck by her vitality, by her fire. She exerted the pride and the power and the presence of a true matriarch. Back during the 23rd anniversary of the Mabo decision, when the High Court overturned the discriminatory fiction of terra nullius, the Sydney Observatory named a star in honour of Eddie Mabo. It's one of those sprinklings of stars that sit behind the prominent points of our Southern Cross. What is really great is that in May this year Dr Mabo was honoured with a star of her own. From now on, you can see them wherever you are: from the city to the bush, from the mountains to the Red Centre, to the beautiful islands in the north that the Mabos loved so deeply and fought so bravely for. I know that in parliament we're very busy, with many important things to do, but perhaps over coming days, on a cloudless evening, we could look up at the night sky, each one of us, and look beyond the Southern Cross and think of those two stars up in the heavens, a bright, shining couple reconciled once more. And perhaps, in the future, our nation can navigate by their example and their inspiration. Perhaps they can help light our way to greater reconciliation. Farewell, Dr Mabo. Our love and respect and condolences to all who mourn your loss. Honourable members: Hear, hear! The SPEAKER (14:10): As a mark of respect to the deceased, I ask all present to rise in their places. Honourable members having stood in their places",40
43,The SPEAKER,CONDOLENCES,I thank the House. Reference to Federation Chamber  That further statements in relation to the death of Bonita Mabo AO be permitted in the Federation Chamber. Question agreed to.  NA Liberal Party Leadership,40
44,Mr SHORTEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. Given that his minority government is consumed by division, dysfunction and chaos, was it a mistake for the current Prime Minister to replace Malcolm Turnbull? And again, today, I ask: why isn't Malcolm Turnbull still the Prime Minister of Australia?",41
45,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,41
46,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Members on both sides!,41
47,Mr Frydenberg,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Two prime ministers, you took down!",41
48,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Treasurer!,41
49,Mr Frydenberg,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You took down two Prime Ministers.,41
50,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Treasurer! The Prime Minister has the call.,41
51,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Thank you, Mr Speaker. Our government's getting on with the job. Since we were last here in this place, our government has been getting on with the job-the National Drought Summit, the $5 billion droughtproofing fund. Have we heard a whisper from the other side about the drought? Have we had a question from the other side about the drought? No. Ms O'Dwyer: They knocked it.",41
52,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They indeed did knock it. They have indeed questioned its necessity. They even sought to undermine it. We have announced major water infrastructure projects in Townsville. We have announced major changes to infrastructure and support for our tourism industry down in the Greater Geelong region, down along the Great Ocean Road. We've announced new water fund infrastructure-some half a billion dollars-to droughtproof Australia into the future and ensure that we're meeting the needs of rural and regional Australians. On top of that, we've announced clear and important plans to ensure that our veterans get the respect and the support that they deserve, whether it's ensuring that they get recognition from businesses all across the country or helping those veterans as they transition from their time in service into employment. We've announced the Pacific step-up plan, a plan that has ensured that we will continue to work closely with our family in the region to ensure that our interests are pursued within our region. We're working with important partners, whether it's the United States, Japan or New Zealand, on a program that continues to ensure the security of our government's national security agenda and protects the safety of all Australians, protects the interests of Australians and protects the safety and security of our region. We have announced the Women's Economic Security Package, a package which is giving flexibility to women when it comes to managing their work-life balance and flexibility in how they access paid parental leave. Under this government, female participation in the workforce is at an all-time high and the gender pay gap is at an alltime low. It is this government that has ensured childcare costs are coming down because of the plans and policies we have legislated. It has been almost six years and the opposition is yet to put forward a policy on child care. They have ummed, they've ahhed and they've delivered absolutely nothing. We have legislated. This is the government that's cutting taxes. This is the government that's backing small business. This is the government that's getting on with the job of securing Australia's economic future, for one simple reason: it's a strong economy that pays for Medicare and it's a strong economy that pays for affordable medicines. The Labor Party found that when they couldn't afford to list affordable medicines, because they couldn't manage a budget. (Time expired)",41
53,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Just before I call the member for Petrie, I say to members on both sides, including the Treasurer: I'm not going to allow constant interjections by members who interject regularly to disrupt proceedings. I'm not going to raise my voice; I'm just going to deal with members. I'm giving them fair warning now. I've mentioned a number of members already, who know they've been mentioned. They paused for about five seconds before resuming interjecting. Economy",41
54,Mr HOWARTH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister please explain to the House how a strong economy helps the government to back small business across the country? Is the Prime Minister aware of risks proposed by alternative proposals? ,41
55,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Petrie for his question. He understands how important having a strong economy is to delivering the essential services that Australians rely on, such as the important road infrastructure which is going to get his constituents home on time to see their families. It doesn't get paid for by promises; it gets paid by for a strong economy and a government that is bringing the budget back into balance. As I announced earlier today, our government will hand down a budget next year, and it will be a surplus. It'll be the first surplus budget since the coalition was last in government. We will be handing down a surplus budget because we promised we would stop the boats, and we have. We promised that we'd get rid of the carbon tax, and we have. We promised that we'd bring the budget back into surplus, and we will. We promised there'd be a million jobs created under a coalition government, and there have been. Our plan for a stronger economy is working. That's why unemployment is at five per cent. That's why there are 50,000 fewer unemployed people today than there were at the last election. Our plan for a stronger economy, that guarantees Medicare, that guarantees affordable medicines, is working. A key part of that plan is our government being the strongest backer of small and family business in generations. Ours is the government that has brought forward and delivered tax cuts for small and family businesses. Those cocky individuals over there, with their swagger and arrogance, thinking they'll put the cue in the rack and just walk into government-their cockiness and arrogance is evident for all Australians to see. But what we're focused on is delivering for small and family businesses, because we know they're the ones who are driving the economy. We know they're the ones who put more than 100,000 young people in work last year-the strongest growth in youth employment on record. There is our small business plan. We are cutting their taxes and introducing the Australian Business Securitisation Fund, which will give them access to capital and finance, along with the Australian Business Growth Fund, which will mean they don't have to go to the bank cap in hand and mortgage their house. There will be more competition, and there will be more loans available for small business so that they can get access to it. We are simplifying employee share schemes to give more options for small business and to allow their employees to benefit more from the growth of small business. And we're going to make sure that both government and big business pay small business on time. We are taking a 30-day payment rule down to a 20-day payment rule, as a government, and we're saying to any big business that wants to do business with our government, 'You've got to pay your small business on time within 20 days.' At COAG I'll be seeking that same commitment from all the states and territories, as New South Wales has done-and we recognise that. All governments and all businesses need to pay small business on time. That's how you back small business. That's what our government is doing. Prime Minister",42
56,Mr SHORTEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. When Malcolm Turnbull was Prime Minister, the government had a majority in the parliament; the members for Wentworth and Chisholm were government members; and the government was backing the National Energy Guarantee and was considering Labor's national integrity commission. I repeat: why isn't Malcolm Turnbull still the Prime Minister of Australia?",42
57,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," The former Prime Minister lost the support of the Liberal Party room. That's what happened. And I was elected to lead the Liberal Party. That's why I'm here. There you go: it's a pretty simple answer. But, from that day to this day, we have been keeping on with the job of strengthening the Australian economy. We have been expanding our trade commitments. We have been opening up new markets. We've been ensuring that the Australian economy continues to transition and diversify, whether it's through our traditional industries, like our resources industry, or whether it is through our agricultural and agribusiness sector going through to our financial services, education and tourism industries. In our defence industry we are revolutionising what is happening to rebuild our defence forces from the shameful record of the Labor Party when they were in government. They didn't commission one ship. They didn't commission one penny. What they over there did to Australia's Defence Force, leaving our serving men and women without the resources to support them and the important work they do, was shameful. They failed on their watch to look after the budget. They failed on their watch to deliver a stronger economy. They failed on their watch to look after our defence forces and ensure they had the right support and investment to give them the capability that they need. They failed when it came to trade as they failed to secure the agreements that our government has been able to achieve. They failed when it came to employment creation, whereas our government has presided over more than a million jobs being created over the last five years. They failed when it came to border protection. They failed as 50,000 people turned up on 800 boats.  That is the record of the Labor Party, and they have learned nothing-not a thing-in the last six years about how to manage a budget, how to protect our borders, how to look after our defence forces and how to protect Australians when it comes to national security. They were failures in government last time; they'll be failures in government if they ever get the opportunity again. The big revolutionary changes that this Leader of the Opposition wants to wreak on the Australian economy with $200 billion in higher taxes would be the biggest wet blanket thrown on the economy in generations. That is the design of the leader of the Labor Party. This is a leader of the Labor Party who is union bred, union led and union fed. This is a Labor Party that will take us back to the industrial relations activities of the 1970s. That's not the future for the Australian economy. This leader of the Labor Party is an old Labor throwback. Economy  strong economy helps government deliver certainty and economic security for Australians, including in my electorate of Barker? Treasurer, are you aware of any divergent schemes which might threaten the prosperity of hard working Australians?",42
58,Mr FRYDENBERG,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Barker for his economic question, because we don't get anything on the economy from those opposite. We get nothing on the economy. The member for MCMahon is Mr Invisible. He can't get a question up in here about the economy. The reason is that the Australian economy is growing. The Australian economy is growing strongly and performing well. That's the view of the Reserve Bank of Australia. That's the view of the OECD. That's the view of the IMF. We are at five per cent unemployment, the lowest level since 2012, and wages have started to rise, with the biggest jump in three years. Australia's AAA credit rating was reaffirmed by the leading credit-rating agency, and Australia is one of only 10 countries in the world to have a AAA credit rating. There has been 3.4 per cent GDP growth, which is the fastest rate of growth since the height of the mining boom. The benefit of a strong economy is that we can deliver health and education services in record amounts. We can deliver the infrastructure, defence spending and border protection that the people expect, need and deserve. The biggest threat to the Australian economy comes from those opposite. It comes from their taxes, from their changes to negative gearing, abolishing it as we know it, and from their changes to retirees' franking credits. It is a $45 billion tax grab on retirees and senior Australians, 84 per cent of whom have a taxable income under $37,000. Nine hundred thousand individuals will lose more than $2,000 on average as a result of Labor's plan. Two hundred thousand people with self-managed super funds will lose out as a result of Labor's plan, like David in Adelaide. He and his wife do not claim the age pension, but they will lose $10,000 a year as a result of Labor's plan. This will put them on the age pension; this will put them on the part pension. The Labor Party talks about fairness, but how fair is it to increase taxes on retired Australians? How fair is it to take away the money from people who have planned for their retirement? How fair is it to push people onto the pension who have taken upon themselves a personal responsibility to save for their own retirement? Only the coalition can be trusted to cut taxes and help people who save for their own retirement. Coalition Government",43
59,Ms PLIBERSEK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. The former Liberal and now Independent member for Chisholm today confirmed the coup against Malcolm Turnbull was 'led by members of the reactionary right wing' and was supported by MPs who traded their votes for personal ambition. The member for Chisholm said: Their actions were undeniably for themselves-for their position in the party, their power, their personal ambition-not for the Australian people … The member for Chisholm has explained why Malcolm Turnbull is no longer Prime Minister-why won't you?",43
60,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the House, on a point of order.  else in the House about matters that are not even part of his responsibility. He's not responsible for the remarks that she's made. It does not fit within his prime ministerial responsibilities, and therefore the question is not in order.",43
61,Mr Burke,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,On the point of order: the question goes to why Malcolm Turnbull is not Prime Minister of Australia. It's a reasonable question that people want to know the answer to. Mr Littleproud interjecting,43
62,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources is not assisting at all. Quite clearly, a bit like yesterday, only the last part of the question is in order, and that's clearly in order. Normally I would agree  with the Leader of the House on this matter because the statements of a private member are not the responsibility of the Prime Minister or any minister. This case is different, I believe, because there's enough of the statement quoted that relates to the change of Prime Minister and the prime ministership, and on balance I'm going to allow the question. Mr Champion interjecting",43
63,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Wakefield will not get to hear the answer. He can leave understanding order 94(a). The member for Wakefield then left the chamber.,44
64,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,44
65,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Before the Prime Minister answers, I'll give members a tip: if it's quiet, it's probably a bad idea to interject; the moment has probably passed! The Prime Minister has the call.",44
66,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I refer members to my earlier answers to these questions. But I know the member for Chisholm would be very proud of the following things that our government is doing: in particular, the release of the Women's Economic Security Statement, which has been announced by the minister. That has included $18 million in grants through a women's start-up fund for boosting female founders to increase entrepreneurship opportunities for women. It includes $3.6 million for the Future Female Entrepreneurs program for around 55,000 girls and young women to encourage entrepreneurism and self-employment; $1.2 million to extend the Curious Minds program and get more girls into science, technology, engineering and maths; increasing the flexibility of paid parental leave and extending access through changes to the work test, and some $32½ million in commitments from our government under our government's plans to ensure there is greater economic security for women. We're supporting regional employers through $1½ million dollars in carer revive initiatives to support businesses to attract and retain women returning to work after a career break. We're providing scholarships to women in economics and finance through the Women's Leadership and Development Program. There is $8 million to streamline data collection for the Workplace Gender Equality Agency. There is $31.8 million for existing specialist domestic violence units and health justice partnerships. We're enabling women experiencing family and domestic violence to have early access to their superannuation to cover the significant costs of rebuilding their lives. Ms Claydon: You can't even get women in your party room!",44
67,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I note the interjections from those opposite. If they don't support these initiatives, I'm disappointed but I would hope that they would. There is $14.9 million to 2023 to expand the Good Shepherd Microfinance No Interest Loan Scheme, to help up to 15,000 additional women experiencing family and domestic violence access finance when they need it most every year, and $50.4 million to support an additional 31,200 families to resolve family law disputes quickly through mediation. This government is getting on with serious business. We're getting on with putting serious policies in place that address the real needs of Australians, whether they be women, whether they be young people or whether they be senior Australians who will be supported by the work we're doing in our billion dollars extra every year for aged care. There is the royal commission into aged care, which we believe will be essential to provide the platform for important reforms in our aged-care sector into the future. Our government is focusing on the issues that Australians are concerned about: their jobs, their livelihoods, their services and the economy that delivers all of these things. The Labor Party has become so obsessed with their own political opportunities that they can only focus on the politics of Canberra. They have become so arrogant and cocky about the election- (Time expired) NA The SPEAKER (14:31): I'd like to inform the House that we have joining us in the gallery this afternoon the former member for Hasluck, Mr Stuart Henry. On behalf of the House, I extend a very warm welcome to you. I'd also like to inform the House that we've just had join us on the floor of the House the ASEAN parliamentary delegation. On behalf of the House, a very warm welcome to you to the floor of the House of Representatives. Honourable members: Hear, hear! NA Hobart City Deal",44
68,Mr WILKIE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, yesterday you spoke glowingly of the city deals being struck around the country. But I understand that the Hobart City Deal, as it  currently stands, won't include any funding other than for the Bridgewater Bridge, which has already been announced, and doesn't include light rail. Prime Minister, city deals are good in principle, but are just thinly disguised election pork-barrelling if the Commonwealth contribution only flows to seats you want to win or hold. Prime Minister, can you confirm that the Hobart City Deal will be finalised before the election? Will it include funding other than for the Bridgewater Bridge? And will it include a commitment to light rail?",44
69,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I will ask the Minister for Cities, Urban Infrastructure and Population to respond, but I would add that a total of $2.2 billion in transport infrastructure in Tasmania included $921 million for projects we announced in this year's budget. That's true-that includes $461 million for the Bridgewater Bridge. It includes $400 million under the Roads of Strategic Importance Initiative. It includes $400 million to upgrade and improve safety on the Midland Highway in Tasmania. It includes $38 million towards the $40 million Hobart International Airport runway extension, recently completed, which created 360 jobs. There was $17½ million for the Huon Highway and Summerleas Road intersection upgrade, creating 350 jobs. And there was $119.6 million earlier in our government for the freight rail revitalisation project, supporting 200 jobs and improving freight transport links to key domestic and export markets throughout Australia and the world. Our government is delivering for Tasmania, and I will ask the minister for cities to add to that.",45
70,Mr TUDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Aston-Minister for Cities, Urban Infrastructure and Population) (14:34): Thank you very much to the member for Denison for his question, and to the Prime Minister. I can confirm to the member for Denison that the deal will be completed before the next election. Indeed, we hope that the deal will be completed by the end of this year. It will be a terrific deal for Hobart and, indeed, it will make Tasmania the first state or territory in the country to have two city deals signed. So we're looking forward to that. Just a few weeks ago, I was down in Tasmania with the state Treasurer, Treasurer Gutwein, as well as the mayors from the local councils, discussing what the shape of that City Deal is going to look like. We have foreshadowed that the centrepiece of that deal is going to be the redevelopment of the Macquarie Point precinct and the creation of a new Antarctic and science precinct at Macquarie Point. That will build on the very significant world-class research that Tasmania already does.",45
71,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Denison on a point of order?,45
72,Mr Wilkie,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,On relevance: the question is very pointed. I asked very specifically whether it goes to additional funding other than the Bridgewater Bridge and also whether there will be a commitment to light rail.,45
73,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I just say to the member that there was a long preamble to the question, which, as I've mentioned to all members previously, does open up the scope for the answer. I acknowledge that there were three very specific questions right near the end of the 45 seconds. I think the minister is being relevant to the question. To confine him to those three areas would have meant simply asking about those three areas.",45
74,Mr TUDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you. I was talking about the shape of the city deal for Hobart. Macquarie Point will be the centrepiece of that. It, through our contributions, will contribute to Hobart being one of the world centres for Antarctic research. Of course, we have the $2 billion federally funded icebreaker, which will be arriving soon. It will be docking at Macquarie Point as well, adding to that. There will be other elements of the city deal as well, and those details will be revealed, including the funding commitments, when we sign that city deal, possibly later this year but certainly by early next year, well before the election. Of course, this adds to all of the other city deals we've announced in recent times, including the terrific Geelong City Deal, the great Darwin City Deal and the city deals for Western Sydney, Launceston and Townsville. Employment",45
75,Mr HARTSUYKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE, My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport and Regional Development. Will the Deputy Prime Minister update the House on how a strong economy assists the government to create jobs and opportunities in regional areas such as in my electorate of Cowper? Are there any risks to this approach?,45
76,Mr MCCORMACK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Riverina-Deputy Prime Minister, Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development and Leader of The Nationals) (14:37): Life teaches us many lessons, and the member for Cowper has just taught Labor how to ask a question! He asked an important question about jobs, because jobs are important. Not only do we have the economic policies of the Liberals and Nationals that have helped support small and medium enterprises and big business to create more than a million jobs in five years; we have also had a decentralisation agenda which is helping rural, regional and remote areas to create local jobs. The Liberals and the Nationals believe in regional jobs. We believe in those employment opportunities way away from the big city lights-good jobs, well-paid jobs, local jobs, long-term jobs and sustainable jobs. Through our decentralisation program, we are delivering for the regions, and we will continue to do so. Just last week, I  joined the member for Cowper; Australia's first decentralisation minister, Nationals Senator Bridget MCKenzie; and the excellent National Party candidate for Cowper, Pat Conaghan, to make an historic announcement: 50 new jobs for Coffs Harbour. We will establish the regional headquarters of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority in Coffs Harbour, to be operational within the next 12 months. Think about that. Contemplate that for a moment: 50 careers, 50 families, 50 opportunities, 50 people coming to call Coffs Harbour home. What a great future those people have. This is only possible because we have a strong economy. The member for Cowper has delivered the $971 million Coffs Harbour bypass, part of a $1.2 billion project with the New South Wales government in collaboration with the Liberals and Nationals from Macquarie Street. We are providing the services that the regions deserve. Why shouldn't regional Australia have the same opportunities for good, long-term, local Public Service jobs? Why shouldn't they? Thanks to our investment, AMSA will also provide up to 16 further positions across Australia, including in places such as, but not limited to, Cairns, Mackay, Gladstone, Geraldton, Karratha and Port Hedland, taking the total number of relocated jobs across Australia to 69. As Gary Prosser, the acting CEO of AMSA, said on Friday: We're a maritime authority. Being in Canberra is fantastic for Government and other relations but a lot of us like myself as an ex-mariner love the smell of salt in the air. He's delighted. He's absolutely delighted, as I'm sureDr Mike Kelly interjecting",45
77,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Eden-Monaro, the Deputy Prime Minister has the call.",46
78,Mr MCCORMACK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I don't know why he is against it. I also don't know why the Labor candidate for Cowper came out and bagged this proposal. What's to mock about this? By creating local jobs in the region through decentralisation, such as the 50 jobs in Coffs, we can keep more young people in the region, to stay, grow their career and start a family. Morrison Government Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR (Gorton) (14:40): My question is to the Prime Minister. The former Liberal, and now independent, member for Chisholm said that the policies of this government have changed: … largely due to the actions of the reactionary and regressive right wing who talk about and to themselves rather than listening to the people. Prime Minister, when will this chaotic and divided Liberal government stop fighting itself and start listening to the Australian people, who are saying that everything is going up except their wages?",46
79,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I'm asked about the government's policies. I understand that's what the question was about: the government's policies. Our government's policies are for a stronger economy. Our government's policy is for tax relief to encourage and reward hard working Australians. It is our government that delivered the personal income tax cuts, which will change the future of our tax system over the next decade. If you're a young person in your early 20s going to work today, the changes that we have legislated to our tax system means that bracket creep will not be a thing that you face over the course of your working lifefor some 94 per cent of Australians. If you are a young person or a middle-aged person-or whatever stage of life you're in; you may be going into retirement-and you start a small business, as a small business owner you are going to pay only 25 per cent in tax, because that's what we've done as a government. Our policy is to reduce the tax burden on Australians, to grow the economy. It's our government's policy to back small and family businesses, whether it's ensuring they get access to the finance or the capital or to ensure that we're reducing their red tape burden by removing and lifting the threshold for compliance burdens with ASIC for small business. Whether it's ensuring that they get paid on time, that governments pay them on time-the federal government, state governments-and that small businesses are not used as a bank, our policy is to fix the budget and that's exactly what we're doing. Before the Australian people go to the next election they will have a surplus budget delivered by a coalition budget. We said we'd fix the budget. It's taken us five budgets to get there, but the heavy lifting had to be done. We have done that by keeping expenditure under control, by keeping taxes under control and by growing the economy, which ensures that we can invest, importantly, in the funding for schools, hospitals and essential services-an extra $37 billion in funding for schools over the next decade and another $30 billion in the next five years for hospitals. Our policies are delivering this, because we're focusing on delivering a stronger economy. Our other policies are about keeping Australians safe. Last week I announced that we'll be introducing the legislation into this place this week to ensure that if there is a radical Islamic terrorist, or any terrorist of that nature, who we believe has another citizenship we will strip their citizenship away from them. You would never  have got those policies from the Labor Party, because the Labor Party subcontracts out national security policy to the coalition on every single occasion. They might happily on occasion follow us. But when it comes to keeping Australians safe Labor is never in the lead. They are always trailing along behind, often making excuses but sometimes turning up to the event to ensure that we can keep Australians safe. We'll also be putting in place the exclusion orders. They're our policies- (Time expired) Economy Mrs WICKS (Robertson) (14:44): My question is to the Minister for Jobs, Industrial Relations and Women. Will the minister update the House on how a strong economy helps the government support women to take control of their financial future? What are the risks associated with a different approach?",46
80,Ms ODWYER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Higgins-Minister for Women and Minister for Jobs and Industrial Relations) (14:44): I thank the member for Robertson for her question. I know that, as a mum and a former teacher, she is absolutely passionate about young women being able to fulfil their full potential. Like all of those on this side of the chamber, she wants the women of Australia to not only survive but thrive. We know that, when Australian women do well, their families do well and our economy and our nation prosper. I'm very happy to report that our government is building on the achievements that we have already laid down. We are helping women to build their financial security. We recognise that girls and women deserve an equal stake in our economy and in our nation. It is one of the reasons we delivered the first ever Women's Economic Security Statement, which includes a number of measures to help women to be able to build their financial future. We want them to be able to take control of their financial future. Just one example of the new measures in this Women's Economic Security Statement is the Future Female Entrepreneurs' Program. We want to make sure those women who want to start a business, to create an economic opportunity for themselves and for others, have the capacity to do so. This is particularly true for all of those women in rural and regional communities. This is why we are backing them. We are backing them with this particular program and we are doing it because we recognise that today around a third of all businesses are operated by women. We know that the potential is there for there to be so many more. Around 55,000 girls and young women will benefit from this program. I was asked the question: 'Are there risks to this potentially very bright future for Australian women?' There are; they are sitting opposite. We will deliver our programs and our measures without raising taxes, because we, as Liberals, believe in lowering taxes and in smaller government. We believe in individuals being able to be free to choose their own path in life. We will support them in that choice. That is why under our economic plan as a government we have been delivering record female employment. There are more women in work than ever before. There are more women in full-time work than ever before and we have seen a reduction in the gender pay gap, which went up under the previous Labor government but has come down under us. They do not want the $200 billion of new or increased taxes that Labor would deliver. (Time expired) Equal Representation",47
81,Ms PLIBERSEK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is also to the Minister for Women. Does the minister agree with herself that this Liberal government is widely seen as, 'Homophobic, antiwomen, climate change deniers'? Does she also agree with the Independent member, the member for Chisholm, who told the House earlier today, 'Equal representation of men and women in this parliament is an urgent imperative which will create culture change'?",47
82,Ms ODWYER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Higgins-Minister for Women and Minister for Jobs and Industrial Relations) (14:48): I thank the member for her question and I would very much encourage her to read the Women's Economic Security Statement, which will tell her more about what we are doing for Australian women than all of Labor's promises. They are all talk but very short on delivery. Under our government, as I said, we have been able to see more women in work than ever beforeDr Chalmers interjecting",47
83,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister will pause for a second. The member for Rankin will leave under 94(a). The minister has the call.,47
84,Ms ODWYER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It's a very popular choice. Under our government, we will create the pathway for women's economic empowerment. We genuinely want to see women be able to build their financial security. Not only do we want to see women safe in their communities, in their home, online and also in their workplaces, but we want so much more for Australian women. We want them to have an equal stake in our economy and in our society. It's one of the reasonsMs Claydon interjecting",47
85,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The minister will resume her seat. The member for Newcastle will cease interjecting. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition on a point of order. Ms Plibersek: Mr Speaker, I have a point of order on relevance. The minister still hasn't told us whether she agrees with herself. ",48
86,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the House will cease interjecting! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition well knows how to make a point of order, and I'm warning her.",48
87,Ms ODWYER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Those opposite refuse to support our government measures in the Senate that would help Australian women. We have measures in the Senate right now that they could vote for that would help secure the financial future of Australian women, particularly those women who are about to retire, because we would put limits on the fees and charges that could be applied to low-balance accounts. Those are low-balance accounts that the member opposite, the Leader of the Opposition, uncapped when he was the minister responsible, seeing so many superannuation balances brought to zero as a result. We would stop the rorts and rip-offs of the superannuation system that would see people defaulted into insurance premiums that they either do not want or do not need. We are ensuring that Australian women can build their financial future to save for their retirement with catch-up contributions in superannuation. We're levelling the playing field so that all women, no matter how they're employed, can make a tax deductible contribution to their superannuation. Yet those opposite would scrap both of those measures. Those opposite also have a mega retirees tax. Let's not forget that their mega retirees tax would impact on 30 per cent more women as a result. Their tax would hurt vulnerable women. So, despite all of their talk about how much they care for Australian women, they have no runs on the board. We do. I commend to them that they read it. Health Care",48
88,Mr MORTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Health. Will the minister update the House on how a strong economy helps the government deliver record funding for hospitals, Medicare and new medicines? How might conflicting ideas risk the delivery of these essential services?",48
89,Mr HUNT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I want to thank the member for Tangney, who was a strong advocate for increased access to continuous glucose monitoring for pregnant mums and for concession cardholders. He also knows that you can only support new and extended services in health and elsewhere in the economy if you have a strong economy and, therefore, that's the reason why we need to take steps to ensure that we have more than a million jobs created by reducing taxes on income, reducing taxes on business and taking away taxes on electricity. These are the reasons why we do these things. It's because they have a benefit in themselves and they create a strong economy which allows us to provide essential services. In Medicare, what we've seen is an increase from $19 billion under Labor to $25 billion this year to $26 billion, $27 billion and $29 billion over the course of the budget. In hospitals, what we've seen is a 50 per cent increase in hospital funding under this government compared with Labor's last year-up from $13.3 billion to $21 billion, $22 billion, $23 billion and $24 billion. Bulk-billing is up to record levels of 86.1 per cent, up 3.9 per cent over what it was in Labor's last year. But what we are very, very proud of in particular is our record in listing new medicines, such as Orkambi for cystic fibrosis, SPINRAZA for spinal muscular atrophy and KISQALI for breast cancer. They have all made a difference. Added to that, on the weekend, we were able to list new devices because of a strong economy, with a $100 million commitment to continuous glucose monitoring. In particular, in terms of continuous glucose monitoring, we announced that pregnant mums and nursing mums would have access, where they have type 1 diabetes, to continuous glucose monitoring technology, saving them $7,000 a year, and the same for concession card holders. We're up to 37,000 Australians with that access. Of course, this compares with what happens if you cannot run a strong economy. We know that under Labor",48

93,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,No! The member for Barker will end his conversation.,48
94,Mr HUNT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"When the Leader of the Opposition was the Assistant Treasurer they deferred the listing of new medicines because of fiscal circumstances, until fiscal circumstances would permit. In other words, they couldn't  run the economy-therefore, they blew the budget. Because of that, they stopped listing medicines. It's very simple: you can't trust Labor with the economy and you can't trust them to list- (Time expired) Energy",48
95,Mr SHORTEN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that at a time of record high power bills and record low wages growth the former Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party has called on the Prime Minister to work with Labor on the National Energy Guarantee, saying: The government needs to consider energy policy through the prism of securing bipartisan agreement with Labor, to establish a long-term, stable regulatory framework that will support private-sector investment … Why won't the Prime Minister take the sage advice of the member for Curtin and work with Labor on energy policy that he's previously said he supports?",49
96,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I'm asked about energy policy and electricity prices by the Leader of the Opposition. I can assure him of one thing. This government will not introduce a carbon tax. But it's not so clear when it comes to the Labor Party. The shadow Attorney-General was asked by Laura Jayes today on Sky: Will you have some form of carbon tax? He said: Well, obviously not. That's not part of the policy. She went on: Are you ruling it out though? He said: I'm not going to rule it in or I'm not going to rule it out. 'I'm not going to play that game,' Mr Speaker! The Australian people have heard from the Labor Party about carbon taxes before. Even when they ruled them out they introduced them, as Julia Gillard did the carbon tax that would never be introduced, the carbon tax that they did introduce. It was the carbon tax that our government abolished when we came into government in 2013. What the Leader of the Opposition doesn't understand is the difference between two numbers. Our government has a responsible emissions reduction target of 26 per cent, meeting our commitmentsMr Frydenberg interjecting",49
97,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Treasurer will cease interjecting. The Leader of the Opposition on a point of order.,49
98,Mr Shorten,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,On direct relevance: the Prime Minister hasn't referred to what the member for Curtin said. And why doesn'the ever talk about the National Energy Guarantee? Mr Albanese interjecting,49
99,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the House will cease interjecting. He's baiting you; you're baiting me. Just before I call the Prime Minister, I'll rule on the point of order and refer the Leader of the Opposition to his preamble, which opened both gates.",49
100,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. The Labor Party gets very sensitive when you bring up two issues. One is the carbon tax. They don't want to talk about the carbon tax and the fact that the Labor Party today have not ruled out introducing a carbon tax on the Australian people. The other thing they don't want to talk about is the reckless nature of their 45 per cent target-which is almost 10 times larger, in terms of the carbon price that was proposed under the previous carbon tax-that they've announced. It will push up electricity prices and will close industries around the country. It is a wrecking ball on the Australian economy, what the Labor Party are proposing. They believe that they are going to walk into government. The leader of the Labor Party is the most cocky, swaggering, arrogant leader at the moment. He thinks it's all done. The hubris that is coming from the other side of the chamber is quite extraordinary-very, very cocky. But what the Australian people will increasingly focus on between now and the next election is that Labor are planning big changes for our economy: $200 billion worth of taxes; reckless targets which will put up electricity prices for pensioners, for families. Labor cannot be trusted on the economy.  Education",49
101,Mr CREWTHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Minister for Education. Will the minister update the House on how a strong economy helps the government deliver the quality child care and education that young Australians rely on, including in my electorate of Dunkley? Is the minister aware of any alternative schemes that would threaten these essential services?",50
102,Mr TEHAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I'd like to thank the member for Dunkley for his question. I know that he has a passionate commitment to young people in his electorate. It is an important question, this question, because the government is delivering for young Australians with record funding for child care; record funding for state schools, for Catholic schools, for independent schools; and record funding for universities. But there's an important point to make here as well. Our young Australians and their families of course don't just deserve record funding; they deserve a government that is focused on delivering outcomes for them and their future. And that is exactly what our government is doing. Under the new childcare package, we're providing more access to subsidised child care to families who work the most, and more financial support to families who earn the least. Around one million Australian families who are balancing work and parental responsibilities are benefitting from these reforms-the most significant reforms to child care in 40 years. Importantly, our new childcare subsidy has driven down the out-of-pocket costs for parents around Australia and-I know you'll be very pleased to hear this, Prime Minister-in the ABS's December CPI data we saw an 11.8 per cent decrease in out-of-pocket childcare costs. By contrast, childcare fees increased by 53 per cent under the previous Labor government. When it comes to schools, the coalition government is providing a record $309.6 billion in recurrent funding to all Australian schools over the period 2018 to 2029, which represents, as the Prime Minister said earlier, a $37.6 billion increase in funding. Now what would put all this at threat? It would be an opposition that has a program of big taxes and big spending-something that would choke the Australian economy, something that would reduce tax receipts, something that would saddle young Australians with future debt. What the Australian people have to understand is that those opposite have a radical agenda to change everything, including when it comes to the Australian economy, and this will put at threat the future of young Australians when it comes to child care, schools and university. Minister for Home Affairs",50
103,Mr NEUMANN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to revelations in the media that the Minister for Home Affairs' ability to cancel criminal visas is being challenged in the Federal Court because of serious doubts about his eligibility under section 44 of the Constitution. Given that all sides of politics support cancelling the visas of dangerous criminals and deporting them, will the Prime Minister now refer the Minister for Home Affairs to the High Court to remove any doubt over the minister's decisions?",50
104,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I'm asked about cancellation of visas by the member. I can inform the House that the Minister for Home Affairs does not have responsibility for the cancelling of visas. That power is actually held by the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs. The shadow minister may wish to pay attention when ministries are announced, because these things are set out very clearly. But I'm asked about cancellation of visas. It is very true-absolutely true-that this government has cancelled the visas of 3,000 criminals. As minister I cancelled them. Other ministers cancelled them. Bikies, murderers, rapists-we cancelled their visas. I remember when the member for MCMahon and the member for O'Connor were ministers for immigration. I remember that when I became the minister for immigration, one of the first issues that was raised with me was about a certain Australian-he wasn't an Australian, actually. He was a visa holder. They never like me talking about Alex Vella.",50
105,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister will resume his seat. The Manager of Opposition Business on a point of order.,50
106,Mr Burke,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,On direct relevance. I've waited for there to be substantial time for a preamble. The question is not a general question about visa cancellation. It goes specifically to the serious matter of making sure that cancellations that have been made by the Minister for Home Affairs have full legal protection and then asks whether a High Court referral will be made to be able to clear that up. It is not a general question in the way the Prime Minister's answering it.,50
107,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I'll rule before I call the Prime Minister back to the dispatch box. I listened carefully to the question. I appreciate the point the Manager of Opposition Business is seeking to make. The member for Blair did refer to newspaper articles about the cancellation of visas. That was certainly my recollection of it-unless the Manager of Opposition Business wants to say otherwise? ,50
108,Mr Burke,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,To that point: the revelations in the media are that the minister's ability to cancel those visas is being challenged in the Federal Court.,51
109,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Visas-that's right.,51
110,Mr Burke,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The question is specifically about his capacity to be able to do that.,51
111,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I appreciate the point the Manager of Opposition Business is trying to make. I don't judge the factual accuracy of questions, but I don't mind pointing out it's not the Prime Minister's power to refer anyone to the High Court; it's this House's power. I'm not going to nitpick, but, given that that was in the question and the Prime Minister very early on referred to the minister for immigration, I think he's still in order. Simply: in the three minutes, the Prime Minister needs to remain relevant to the topics asked in the question, and I think there were two topics that were asked. The Prime Minister has the call.",51
112,Mr MORRISON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was referring, again, to cancellation of visas, and I made the very clear point that under our government the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs is responsible for visa cancellations. He is the one within the government who has responsibility. And it's true that I used to be the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection and that one of the first issues that was brought to my attention was a certain Alex Vella, the president of the Rebels bikie gang. I cancelled his visa, and he's never come back to these shores. That started a long list of actions by our government to ensure that we did the right thing on visas. When I cancelled Alex Vella's visa when he was away from Australia, ensuring that he could not return, it became very well known to me that this was a matter that authorities had been seeking governments to take action on for some time. I know for a fact that the former ministers for immigration never had the decision to take to cancel that visa, and nor did I. Do you know what I had to do? I had to ask for it. I said I wanted to see the cancellation papers for Alex Vella's visa, and so I took that decision. You on that side could have taken that decision. You didn't. You squibbed it. That's why Australians cannot trust the Labor Party when it comes to immigration and border protection. Australians can trust the coalition when it comes toMr Dreyfus interjecting",51

Will the minister update the House on how a strong economy helps the government support Australians through our social security and welfare system that provides the essential services that families and elderly Australians rely on? Are there different alternatives, and what are their consequences?",51
115,Mr FLETCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," I thank the member for Fairfax for his question. As he knows, on this side of the House, we are delivering the services that families rely on and we are delivering the services that older Australians rely on. We are delivering those services because of a strong economy and a strong budget. If you look at the measures that we are introducing this week to give older Australians more choice and more options, you'll see we're extending the pension work bonus from $250 a fortnight to $300 a fortnight. That's a greater amount you can earn before your pension is affected. We're extending that option to self-employed pensioners, and the result is that more than 90,000 people will get increased payments. That is an extra burden on the budget, but it's a burden we can afford because of our good management of the budget and because of a strong economy. We've announced that we're expanding the Pension Loans Scheme to offer pensioners the option of higher payments through borrowing against their home and receiving a convenient fortnightly payment through Centrelink. Through a combination of their pension payment and a loan payment, they can receive up to 150 per cent of the full pension, or $1,374 a fortnight for a single pensioner. That's more choice and more options for older Australians, and we're able to deliver that because of our strong management of the economy and of the budget. Of course, we're also providing new options for seniors through a fairer assets test for pooled lifetime retirement income streams. Since we've been elected, the pension has increased by $107.90 per fortnight for singles and $162.60 per fortnight for couples. That's been achieved because of a strong budget and strong fiscal management. Compare by contrast a very different message for older Australians from Labor. When Labor are in government, they always lose control of the budget. It happens time after time, and they always have to wind back on the capacity to deliver services because they run out of the capacity to fund them. What is their message for  older Australians who have saved to acquire a modest parcel of shares: 'We're coming to take away your franking credit refunds.' That's Labor taking away benefits from older Australians. On this side of the House, we are delivering for older Australians and we are delivering for families because of strong budget management.",51

I call upon those honourable members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",52
120,Mr MARLES,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Can I start by congratulating Daniel Andrews, the Premier of Victoria, on the most remarkable victory on an incredible night on Saturday. He leads a serious, progressive, practical team, which in 2014 promised Victorians greater investment in schools, infrastructure and hospitals, and he delivered. In a nononsense way, he went to this election promising to do more, and that was rewarded in spades. It was an incredible win for Daniel Andrews. It was perhaps best put on the night by this commentator who was quoted as saying: ""This Premier, Daniel Andrews, has embarked on the biggest infrastructure spend Australia has ever seen."" ""He's promised schools, hospitals and he's building a big underground train network … ""In an era of no wage growth, no real wage growth, he's offered free TAFE, free dental for schools, free three-year-old kinder, … and people love public expenditure on roads, hospitals, trains and schools."" ""This is the genesis of the Andrews government's success. The guy took a huge risk in putting this agenda out, and he's been rewarded for it."" It shows that at least one member of the Liberal Party had his eyes open about what actually happened on Saturday, because those were the words of Michael Kroger, the President of the Victorian Liberal Party. When the question was being asked as to whether or not there were any federal implications of what occurred on the weekend, some other Liberals also understood what was going on. Denis Napthine, the former Liberal Premier of Victoria said: If the federal Liberal Party doesn't understand and learn from this, then they're doomed to have similar results, and not just in Victoria but across Australia. Perhaps it was most succinctly put by Andrew Katos, the Liberal member who lost his seat in South Barwon and who said very simply, 'The Feds killed us'. Then we heard from none other than the member for Higgins who made the point that hers was a party that was 'homophobic, anti women and climate change deniers'. But, when this was all then put to the Prime Minister, in a sense we waited with bated breath to hear how he interpreted the events which occurred over the weekend in Victoria. The Prime Minister said this yesterday in respect of a question in just those terms, he said: … in Victoria an incumbent premier who has been presiding over a strong economy, which has enabled him to deliver services and infrastructure which the people of Victoria have clearly respected … has been re-elected. What does that sound like? 'Our government is running a strong economy'? 'Our government is delivering infrastructure and services that the Australian people respect and want more of'? That is what we hear from the Prime Minister. Can you imagine being more out of touch than that? 'It's all tickety-boo. Everything is going completely fine.' It was added to by his deputy, who simply said, 'This was a state election fought on state issues'-basically, 'There's nothing to see here.'  When the Victorian Liberals, two of whom are sitting there, think about what happened on the weekend, has it got anything to do with what's gone on in this building in the last few months on their side of politics? 'Nothing to worry about. We've got no issues here at all.' In fact, more than that, bizarrely, the Prime Minister yesterday seemed to think that in fact what occurred on the weekend in Victoria was somehow an endorsement of the way he has been governing. That's what he was saying. It was like he was the national version of Daniel Andrews. It is worth checking whether or not actually this is a government which looks like the Andrews government. In the area of education, the Andrews government was promising free TAFE, universal access for three-year-olds to kinder and 100 new schools over the last eight years. But I tell you what the Prime Minister's government has been about: cutting $14 billion from schools across the country and cutting $570 million from universities in Victoria. That doesn't sound very much like Daniel Andrews to me. By contrast, I'll tell you what a future Shorten Labor government will do: it will put $804 million into Victorian schools over the next three years and uncap tertiary places, which will see 50,000 Australians getting access to tertiary education. In the area of health, the Andrews government promised 10 new hospitals across Victoria, including-indeed, in the electorate of Geelong, in my electorate, the federal electorate of Corio-a women's and children's maternal hospital. By contrast, what the Morrison government has been doing is cutting $183 million from hospitals from 2017 through to 2020. That is the equivalent of cutting 250 doctors and 500 nurses. Again, that doesn't sound a lot like what Daniel Andrews is doing in Victoria. There's not a great equivalence between Morrison and Andrews in those facts. I'll tell you what a Shorten Labor government will do: we'll invest $2.8 billion into health over the next five years and we will end the Morrison government's freeze on Medicare. In infrastructure, the Andrews government famously has now got rid of 29 level crossings across Victoria in a much larger program; has promised to invest $16.5 billion in the North East Link, the process of which began yesterday; and has promised the visionary Suburban Rail Loop, which will literally transform public transport in Melbourne. By contrast, this is what the Morrison government has done in relation to infrastructure: cut a billion dollars from road projects in Victoria, from blackspots, from repairing bridges; and pushed off a range of new projects, such as the airport rail link and the Monash rail project. There's nothing like Daniel Andrews in those actions. But I tell you what: federal Labor, when we were last in government, doubled the infrastructure spend in Victoria. We invested in a range of projects, from the Regional Rail Link to upgrading the Geelong to Colac highway. The truth is, Scott Morrison, this Prime Minister, looks nothing like Daniel Andrews. He is the polar opposite. The idea that the Prime Minister sees something positive for him in what occurred on the weekend simply shows how completely out of touch he and the team that he leads are. The truth of the matter is this-and everyone on that side of the parliament knows it: on the night of the Longman by-election, when they watched the collapse in the Liberal vote in that particular electorate sitting in the northern suburbs of Brisbane, they got spooked. To the extent that there was any thinking at all going on during coup week-but I'm not sure there was a lot of thinking going on during coup week on that side of parliament-when they ripped themselves apart and made this place an utter shambles for the whole nation to see, it was perhaps due to the idea that they could get rid of a Prime Minister who actually resonated in Victoria, as they well know, in the hope that they might get a Prime Minister who could, in some little way, project into Queensland. I really don't know whether the hope to get that projection into Queensland worked, but I'll tell you one thing: I absolutely know that in coup week what this mob over here did was open up a massive flank in Victoria across the entirety of the eastern suburbs of Melbourne, where we were seeing 10 per cent swings across a range of seats like Aston, like Chisholm, like Deakin and like La Trobe. You all know it, and that's what you were all saying to your Prime Minister when you met with him at 9 o'clock yesterday. Of course, in Corangamite, on the southern part of Geelong, the Liberal vote completely and totally collapsed. The reality is simply this: since coup week, the federal Liberals have been unable to speak Victorian. They have absolutely no hope of projecting into our state. By contrast, the Shorten Labor opposition is being policy big. We also seek to be a serious group of people who want to meet the challenges that are facing this country today, unlike the populist rabble that we sit opposite. We will be, if given the opportunity, a government which invests in health, education and infrastructure. We will do that in Victoria and we will do that across the entire country. If there was one lesson that we learnt on Saturday night, it's that that's exactly what Victorians want.",52
121,Mr TEHAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," If there is one thing that it is certain that the Labor Party will do if they form government it is that they will tax the life out of the Australian people. They will spend like drunken sailors and they will place a debt burden on future generations of Australians the likes of which we haven't seen.  What we've seen here today from the member for Corio are exactly the type of lies that we saw during the last election campaign. Australians know that we have put record funding into education. We've put record funding into child care. We've put record funding into schools, whether they be state, Catholic or independent schools. We've put record funding into higher education. We've put record funding into health and we've put record funding into infrastructure. We will make the case strongly at the next election. You over on that side might be measuring up the curtains, but I can tell you we're going to put up one hell of a fight and we are going to make sure we retain government. Let's have a look at school funding. What are the facts? The government will boost our investment in public schools from $6.8 billion, which is what it was in 2017, to $7.4 billion this year, to $10.8 billion in 2023 and to $13.7 billion in 2029. There are no cuts. That is an increase year upon year, making an absolute mockery of what they on that side were saying. Let's have a look at what we're doing for Catholic schools. It's exactly the same$6.3 billion invested in 2017, $6.6 billion in 2018, $8.6 billion in 2023 and $10.2 billion in 2029. For independent schools it's the same-$4.4 billion in 2017, $4.7 billion in 2018, $6.6 billion in 2023 and $8 billion in 2029. That is an increase year upon year, making an absolute mockery of this idea that somehow when you invest more and more each year the Labor Party can call that a cut. What about health? Health is exactly the same. The government will invest $130.2 billion in public hospitals, an increase of $30.9 billion, with record funding each year for each state and territory. Our government's funding for public hospital activity will increase from $99.3 billion between 2015-16 and 2019-20 to $132 billion between 2020-21 and 2024-25. Commonwealth funding for public hospital services will more than double from $13.3 billion in 2012-13 to a record $28.7 billion in 2024-25. Commonwealth funding for Victorian hospitals has increased from $3 billion per year in 2012-13 under Labor and will increase to over $7 billion in 2024-25, at the end of the new hospital funding agreement. The pattern is also clear in Medicare services. Investment in Medicare services to Victoria has increased from $4.6 billion under Labor to over $5.5 billion under the Liberal-Nationals government. And the same is true when it comes to medicine. The last Labor government reversed the policy of the coalition to list all medicines approved by the independent PBAC. In fact, they deferred the listing of seven medicines due to their financial mismanagement.",53
122,Mr Tudge,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,They couldn't pay for it.,54
123,Mr TEHAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes, because they couldn't pay for it. They deferred the listings of seven medicines because they stuffed up the budget.",54
124,Mr Tudge,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,How many people were affected by that?,54
125,Mr TEHAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"How many people, indeed? And they are probably still affected, sadly. For Victoria, Australian government funding for schools and hospitals has increased. The opposition should not say anything else. When it comes to infrastructure, it is the same story. Since coming to office in 2013, we have committed $17 billion to land transport infrastructure projects in Victoria. I must confess that my electorate of Wannon has been a beneficiary. There is the Murray Basin rail project of over $400 million, reopening the rail line between Maryborough and Ararat. When it comes to passenger rail, there is an investment of over $100 million in upgrading the Warrnambool-to-Melbourne line. I must say that-and this is one of the great ironies-during the state election campaign in Victoria, the state government members were out there claiming this as their own investment. It is $100 million by the Commonwealth to upgrade that line, and they were making up that it was they who did it all. We will give you the facts on a daily basis between now and the next election and we will not let you get away with these lies. Funding for schools has increased. Funding for child care has increased. Funding for universities has increased. Funding for health has increased, whether it be hospitals or Medicare. And funding for infrastructure has increased. It's worth knowing that the Labor Party will promise a lot, but how are they going to pay for it? This is something that the Australian people will become more and more aware of over the coming months. They will pay for it by increasing taxes by $200 billion. They are going to tax the life out of the Australian people and they are going to spend and spend. And we know this because their track record says that they will do this time and time again. They will place this nation back into debt. How long is it since we've had a budget surplus?",54
126,Mr Sukkar,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I think it was Costello.,54
127,Mr Buchholz,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,About a decade.,54
128,Mr TEHAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Costello. How long is it since the Labor Party delivered a surplus?,54
129,Mr Joyce,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,It was 1989. ,54
130,Mr TEHAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It was 1989. I remember Wyatt Roy say in this place that he didn't think he'd seen one in his lifetime. So we know you'll never be able to deliver a surplus. We know that you will place this country into debt. We know that future Australians will be saddled with a burden that will take years and years to pay off. That is what you are promising. It is the most radical change that this nation has seen since Whitlam was in power. No opposition has promised to increase taxes like you are, to increase spending like you are and to saddle this country with the debt that you will. When it comes to our government, what we're able to do is, through sound economic management, deliver record funding for schools, record funding for hospitals and record funding for infrastructure. We know that, while we're doing that, we can deliver a surplus and we can start repaying the debt that you mounted up when you were last in government. That is going to be the contrast that we will put to the Australian people at the next election, and it will be a stark contrast: big-taxing, big-spending opposition policies versus sound economic management on this side. The Australian people will know that, through our delivering of a strong economy, when we make promises, we can keep them. When we say that we have record levels of funding for schools, for hospitals and for infrastructure, they know that it is there because of our sound economic management. They know that what you are promising to try to deliver we will never, ever see. It will never see the light of day. We only have to look back at education, for instance. What happened with the Building the Education Revolution? Six billion dollars was wasted. It didn't lead to a better outcome for a student. It was $6 billion of waste. We know you are about big spending and big taxes. We on this side know about sound economic management that can deliver the programs, the education policies, the health policies and the infrastructure outcomes that this nation needs. I can't wait till we get that election campaign going, because you'll be there measuring up the curtains and we'll be making sure that you never, ever get the chance to put them there.",55
131,Mr GILES,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," What a fantastic note for the minister to end on. I welcome his invitation to join the battle at the next election. I think on this side we say: bring it on. We are ready to have our offer, our policies, contrasted to yours. I also took on board a really interesting contribution from another senior member of the government in question time today, the Deputy Prime Minister, who said, 'Life teaches us many lessons.' Well, the Minister for Education doesn't seem to have been heeding that maxim, although, of course, he should. Of course, so should his present leader, the Prime Minister. Yesterday, the Prime Minister compared himself to Daniel Andrews. Let's be clear: the Prime Minister could not be more wrong in making this comparison, and this MPI makes clear exactly why. The governments which preceded him, led by the former member for Wentworth and led by the present member for Warringah, have a record for underinvestment across Australia and particularly in Victoria. There have been big cuts to health. It's a pity the Minister for Education is no longer with us in the chamber, because his comments about education and the record of this government are simply risible. Can I start with one point: in question time, why can'the say the words 'early learning' when he talks about the education of threeand four-year-olds? Why can'the acknowledge that this is about more than just child care? Why can'the also offer more than just a bandaid when it comes to funding four-year-olds' kinder? Why can'the join us and join the Victorian government in committing to fund three-year-olds' kinder? Why can'the admit that he is short-changing 2.5 million kids in our public schools? He can talk all he likes about our record but the thing that he can't walk away from are the budget papers, which show the massive cuts to education under his budget. When it comes to infrastructure, we know that Melbourne is the fastest-growing city in Australia, and we know the pains of that growth have been exacerbated by a federal government that's refused to give it its fair share of Commonwealth infrastructure funding and that has consistently played politics with infrastructure. The contrast could not be clearer with the Andrews government. This is a tale of two governments, and it has serious implications for the formation of the next government in Australia. We saw a Victorian government that was rewarded by the Victorian people for being resolutely focused on the things that matter to Victorians. Daniel Andrews said on the night, 'Victorians overwhelmingly endorsed our positive and optimistic plan for our state.' And Victorians are looking very seriously at, and taking very seriously, federal Labor's positive and optimistic plans for Australia. The Prime Minister yesterday, on the other hand",55
132,Mr Tudge,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Don't get too excited!,55
133,Mr GILES,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"No, we're not excited. We take nothing for granted. Isn't it telling that the Prime Minister talks about us being cocky when that is his demeanour to a tee? He struts in here and he shouts. He talks about the Canberra bubble, but all he can do here is talk weirdly and, quite frankly, disturbingly about some intimate conflict with the Leader of the Opposition. He cares about Bill Shorten-the member for Maribyrnong; the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition is focused on the Australian people.  We understand, as did Victorian Labor, that what we need to offer the Australian people is hope, not fear and not narrow divisiveness. One of the big reasons why federal factors were at play in the Victorian election was that Matthew Guy was telling the same narrow, nasty story as the federal government. He was appealing to the same base notes that the federal government have been appealing to, and I am hopeful that the Australian people will react in much the same way. I think many government members, although perhaps not the minister at the table, Minister Tudge, are seeing things in exactly that way when they have commented on what happened in the Liberal heartland of the eastern suburbs of Melbourne. When Senator Hume said, 'Victorians sent the Liberal Party a message: shape up or ship out,' that is a message that should be heeded. When conservative members of the federal caucus acknowledge that pitches to the alleged base are actually alienating people who've been Liberal voters all their lives, members opposite have to pay attention. What happened on Saturday should be a wake-up call for all of us in this place. But, on this side, we understand that both Victorians and Australians want a government that's on their side-a government with a plan for the future and with a real policy agenda to make genuine change, not nasty cuts and appeals to base motives.",55
134,Mr TUDGE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Aston-Minister for Cities, Urban Infrastructure and Population) (15:39): It says something about the dishonesty of the modern Labor Party that the matter of public importance is: The Government'sso-calledcuts to schools, health and infrastructure in Victoria. Those in the gallery and those listening should be aware that, far from cutting, in each one of those areas the government is actually adding record amounts of dollars each and every year-this year, next year and well into the future. It is adding record amounts of funding into schools, record amounts of funding into hospitals and record amounts of funding into infrastructure. Yet the dishonesty of the Labor Party today presents that as cuts. They believe that if they say that over and over and over again some people will be gullible enough to believe it. People listening to this debate should know that's exactly what they are doing, that that is their strategy. It is their dishonest strategy, and people should be aware of that, because we are investing record amounts across the board in each of those three areas. I'd like to discuss my responsibilities as they relate to the matter of public importance, and that is in relation to infrastructure, particularly urban infrastructure, in Victoria and, indeed, in the city of Melbourne. Melbourne is our second-largest city and one of the fastest growing cities in Australia. We have a very significant record in relation to infrastructure dollars going into Victoria-over $20 billion since coming to office has gone into Victoria-and that includes some very significant projects which are under way or which have already been delivered. I'd like to mention three, though, because they go to the nature of what our government is doing to deliver citywide projects which have been on the agenda for many, many years, in many cases, and sometimes decades-projects where the government is actually putting the money in and getting things done. The first project is the Tullamarine rail. Melbourne Airport is the second-busiest airport in Australia. That proposal has been on the books for probably five decades and never been achieved. It has taken this government to put $5 billion on the table to make that happen. Finally we'll get the rail link out to Tullamarine airport. The second project is in some respects in a similar vein. It is the Monash-Rowville rail. Monash University is the largest single university campus in Australia. About 55,000 students go there every single day, yet we don't have a rail link out to the largest campus in Australia. This has been on the books for five decades, but it still hasn't been delivered. This government has finally put it on the agenda with a $475 million commitment to get the rail link built to Monash and out to Rowville. That means that instead of having the single busiest bus route in Australia, as that between Huntingdale station and Monash University presently is, we'll have a rail connection, which will free up the busy roads from all of the buses that are presently using it and make it so much more convenient and accessible for students to go to that magnificent campus in Clayton. The third project is one which would finally create an effective ring-road for Melbourne, which is so desperately needed, by linking up the Eastern Freeway across to the Tullamarine Freeway. That is the East West Link project. We have got $3 billion sitting on the table ready to be deployed for that project whenever a state government is willing to do so. We want to see that project done. The residents across the eastern suburbs of Melbourne, certainly, want to see that project delivered, because everybody who takes the Eastern Freeway knows that you effectively come to a full stop when you hit Hoddle Street. It adds to so much congestion. We want to see that project built, and we hope that Bill Shorten, as a Victorian, will be big enough to lean on the re-elected Andrews government to get that built, because we're there, ready to be a partner. ",56
135,Ms RYAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Victorians returned a Daniel Andrews government on the weekend, and they did so because it was clear that what Daniel Andrews says so often-which is, 'I say what I do and I do what I say'-really reached Victorians. They thought about the last four years and what had been delivered by the Andrews government. They couldn't help but see what was being delivered. There it was and there they were: the grade separations on the rail corridors-29 of them delivered in four years. In my electorate, there were the schools being built. Across the electorate we had five new schools built in the last four years. We had refurbs done in our schools. What else could they see if they thought about the Andrews Labor government? Locally, they could see an $80 million stage 1 rebuild of the Werribee Mercy Hospital. That's what they could see. They could see a new children's hospital going up in Sunshine. That's what Victorians were focused on: a government that got things done. In contrast, what they saw was not just an opposition not focused on them but they saw an opposition which had failed to hold a federal government to account for starving Victoria of funds across those three portfolios. They starved Victoria in infrastructure. This government starved Victoria in health and they starved Victoria in education across the last six years. I believe the Prime Minister conceded that today. He might want to jump in four months early, but he conceded six months today. That's what Victorians were focused on. They were focused on the fact that Matthew Guy had not once in that four years stood up to this federal government and demanded what Victoria deserved. Week in, week out they heard this side of the chamber stand at that dispatch box and demand Victoria's fair share of infrastructure spending. Week in, week out the shadow minister for infrastructure, Anthony Albanese, did nothing but bang on about starving Victoria of infrastructure. That's what Victorians heard. Victorians know what they deserve. They know they have the second-biggest city in the country and the fastest growing. They're living it. They're living it every day. And when they thought back to the last federal government, they thought back to a Labor government that delivered in the western suburbs. It delivered the Regional Rail Link, which was the biggest rail project in Australia's history.",57
136,Mr Drum,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,We built it! I was in the state government; we built it!,57
137,Ms RYAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You did not build it! The Labor government built that. The Napthine-Baillieu government got to open it, I believe, but failed to order the trains so that it could open on time! That's the record of the Liberals in Victoria, and that's what Victorians were focused on on Saturday and in the weeks leading up to the election. It's not an accident that today, when I look across to the other side of this chamber, I see the Right ideologues sitting here for this MPI. I see very few of Victoria's moderate MPs, except, of course, our old friend sitting opposite",57
138,Mr Joyce,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Thank you!,57
139,Ms RYAN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The ideologues are in the room today-the people who have held this government back. The member for Deakin is in the room today. When Victorians think of him, they think of the man who failed to bring in the changes their government had agreed to on the payday lenders. They've failed to do the things they promised to do, not just in Victoria but nationally. They've failed to protect the most vulnerable people in our communities. All we've seen are cuts, cuts, cuts and a Victorian opposition that wouldn't call them to account. It's a Victorian opposition that wouldn't stand up for our pensioners. Did I ever hear a member of the Victorian Liberal and National opposition complain about the nine months people are waiting to get their pensions? Not a word from the Victorian opposition about the people in my electorate waiting months and months. There's not a word about the tertiary students waiting a full semester to get the youth allowance-not a word from the state opposition. That's why Victorians voted for state Labor on Saturday, because they're delivering. I am ever grateful to the Victorians who voted for state Labor on the weekend because they're going to give Labor an opportunity to deliver for another four years-to deliver the hundred schools that they've promised, to deliver the grade separations in my electorate and to deliver for all Victorians every day of that four years.",57
140,Mr DRUM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," I agree with the previous speaker from the coalition. He said that it doesn't really matter how many times the Labor Party want to repeat lies; it doesn't make them true. They can keep rolling out lie after lie but it doesn't make them true. They keep talking about cuts to the education system, when we know that there has been an incredible and consistent allocation of record funding not just at the moment but right through until 2029. We have a situation where we have done away with the Labor Party's 27 different deals that were done in 27 different jurisdictions. Whether it be government, whether it be Catholic or  whether it be independent, there are 27 different models of funding around Australia and somehow or other the Labor Party thought that was a good way to go forward. To the credit of this government, we now have one system that is consistent across all states and territories, one system that is consistent across the government schools, the private schools and the Catholic system, one system that is consistent in relation to an SES model of need, to actually look at the wealth that is associated with each school to make sure the funding is appropriate. This is the system to which the Labor Party should be saying, 'I can't believe that the coalition has got the guts to actually make this funding announcement, put this policy in place and then see it through,' because this is the type of funding that we need from governments all around Australia, and it's great to see the federal government leading the way with this needs based funding that is both consistent to the government system and consistent to the private sector. The same can also be said for health. At the moment we have the highest bulk-billing rate ever at 85 per cent. It has risen three additional percentage points since our term in government. Yes, it costs more money. Again, there's more benefit in having an economy that is doing well. It enables us to invest more money into health and more money into schools. There is record funding all the way through and yet the Labor Party continue to go on about 'Mediscare'. They continue to put these lies on the table, trying to convince the Victorians or the Australian public, that somehow or other the health system is under threat. The only reason the health system will ever be under threat is if the Labor Party wreck the economy. Then they would have to start taking the actions that they took the last time they were in government, where they resisted putting extra drugs on to the PBS simply because the economy couldn't afford it. If you want to move over into infrastructure-this motion also goes towards infrastructure-we have a $75 billion commitment on the table which is going to see a continual pipeline of projects rolled out one after another right around the state. The most pressing of all of the infrastructure stories to be told around state Labor is what has happened in relation to passenger rail across Victoria. Whilst the Labor Party has been in government now for 14 of the last 18 years, they like to blame a lot of damage on what happened in the four years that they weren't in government. They blame Jeff Kennett's time 19 years ago and beyond. They have to acknowledge that, having created strong passenger rail systems out of Bendigo, Ballarat and Geelong, they have left the other half of the state to perish. The Wangaratta and Wodonga lines are a joke. The Shepparton line is a joke. The line to Warrnambool past Geelong is terrible. The Latrobe Valley is hopeless. And yet they have functioned on just making sure that we have three cities that are well serviced by passenger rail. What Victorians don't understand is that every time somebody uses a V/Line system, the taxpayers from other parts of Victoria subsidise that. Each and every one of those fares is subsidised by $20. Everybody in Victoria is paying for a train system but only the people in Bendigo, Ballarat and Geelong have a proper service. You might think that maybe the metro system pays for itself. The fare box at the metro in Melbourne pays for 20 per cent of the cost of running that service. Again, the people who live in Horsham, Shepparton, Mildura, who have no public service that they can be proud of, are paying their taxes for the people who use the trains, who the Labor Party look after-a fraction of the state. It's getting subsidised by all the other taxpayers around Victoria. It's an absolute joke. The Victorian Labor Party have to fess up. They have been in control of the place for 18 years and they need to fix it.",57
141,Ms VAMVAKINOU,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," I'd like to begin by congratulating my state Labor colleagues on a remarkable win on Saturday, with very big congratulations, of course, to our Victorian Premier, Daniel Andrews. The swings were bigger than expected and they came from everywhere across the state. They especially came from within traditional Liberal heartland seats. The Victorian election was a resounding affirmation that people in my electorate of Calwell and electorates across the state want governments to get on with the job of investing in the key areas of education, health and infrastructure because these are the areas of concern and of most importance to our communities. It also showed clearly that Australians want a united, stable government. They want governments who listen to them, who understand them and who get on with the job of delivering to them, as opposed to the infighting, division, instability and chaos that we are witnessing in this place day after day after day after day. As it stands, Calwell is one of the fastest-growing areas in the state, and it includes Australia's fastest-growing suburb, the suburb of Mickleham. Knowing this, the re-elected Andrews Labor government has committed to building six new schools in Calwell as part of its $850 million investment in education. In contrast, knowing this, the Victorian Liberal Party sat on its hands and did nothing to support and assist in the education of the children in my electorate. We shouldn't be surprised because a previous Liberal government, under Jeff Kennett, became infamous for shutting schools down and selling them off. Clearly, today's Liberals have not understood the message that investment in education is key to a community's aspiration and opportunities.  The six new, desperately needed schools that are being built in my electorate include: Aitken Hill Primary School, which will be opening in 2019; Craigieburn South Secondary School, opening in 2020; Greenvale NorthWest Primary School, opening in 2021; Merrifield West Primary School, opening in 2021; Greenvale Secondary College, opening in 2020; and Kalkallo Common Primary School, opening in 2022. The Greenvale Secondary College is one I'm particularly proud of. I want to thank the tireless efforts of our state member, the member for Yuroke, Ros Spence, and the Greenvale Progress Association for seeing the Barrymore Road site, which had stood vacant for decades, finally transformed into the much-needed school that is set to service the Greenvale community. Earlier this year, I also took the opportunity to visit Tullamarine Primary School, who were in desperate need of more funding to repair the declining school buildings. I immediately spoke with my state colleague, the member for Sunbury, Josh Bull. He, along with the Minister for Education, James Merlino, did not hesitate to deliver $4.5 million into repairing the new buildings for the Tullamarine Primary School. I want to thank Josh for his efforts and contribution to a school which is experiencing increased enrolments year by year. This sort of investment isn't saddling future communities with debt, nor is it playing catch-up or making choices from Liberal or Labor electorates. This is an investment that is for the future of our people, our local constituents. I'm really grateful to the Victorian Labor government for understanding the importance of education to my community because this federal government and their state counterparts do not. Instead, up here in Canberra, our Prime Minister has ripped $14 billion out of public schools in Australia. Our Prime Minister leads a government which has cut $572 million out of Victorian universities. In stark contrast, federal Labor has committed $804 million to Victorian public schools over the first three years of a Labor government. We will uncap undergraduate university places from 2020 and see approximately 50,000 more students attend universities, and this means more opportunities for my local young people. My electorate is a fast-growing area, and infrastructure is paramount to our electorate. We've already seen a re-elected Andrews Labor government start work on their promise to build the North East Link that will ease traffic congestion in Calwell. (Time expired)",58
142,Mr BROADBENT,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," I asked to speak on this today for one very good reason: the question before the House from Richard Marles, the member for Corio, is: The Government's cuts to schools, health and infrastructure in Victoria. I can't say that he's lying. You're just not allowed to say in the House, 'He is lying.' What you can say is that the statement may be deceptive, dishonest, disingenuous, duplicitous, exaggeration, a fabrication, a falsehood, a fiction, mendacious, part truth, perfidious, sneaky, tricky, two-faced, underhanded or a straight-out untruth. And I think it's all of them. I think a lot of the Labor members today, in what they have said, have been intentionally misleading. For every one of my hospitals-Leongatha, Korumburra, Warragul, Morwell on the boundary and even those in the new part of Phillip Island-if you asked them, 'Have you had more money from the federal government than you had last year?' what would the answer be? 'Yes.' Yes, they've had more money. But the Labor Party has been saying, 'No, our proposition is we'll give more; therefore it's a cut,' and that's misleading and untrue. Every school in my electorate-Catholic, non-Catholic, primary, secondary, tertiary, all of them-got more money than they got last year. There are record amounts of money being spent on each child from every household, and that money is coming from the federal government. Where did the moneys the member for Calwell talked about come from? The money came from the federal government. The money came from this Liberal-National coalition so they can spend it on those schools. Where do you think the increase in money for infrastructure and education is coming from for my private schools and my Catholic schools? It's coming from this federal government in record amounts. I was taken out to Chairo Christian School's Pakenham campus the other day, and they said, 'We brought you out to thank you for the extra money that you put into our school to make this place happen and to support out families and our children.' Record numbers of families in the Pakenham area-which will soon be in Jason Woods's seat-are choosing Chairo's type of education. We've still got very good secondary schools and primary schools like Nar Nar Goon Primary School and St Joseph's Primary School just down the road. Did they receive more money this year than last year? Yes. Who gave them that money? The federal government gave them that money because we want our children to know that they're special, they're important and we want the best facilities we can possibly give them. We want the very best we can possibly give them, and it's right across this nation. So don't be misled by these signs that I saw on the weekend that said, 'Don't vote Liberal in this state election, because of cuts by the federal government.' It is an untruth. It is unbelievable that politicians in this country can intentionally set out to mislead.  I know Medicare was mentioned before by the member for Murray. That was a straight-out mistruth. It worked. They say, 'But if it works and it's a mistruth, who cares?' I'll tell you: I care. I think integrity in politics is really important. I think the people in each electorate want to know that what their member is telling them is the truth. Sometimes the truth is hard to tell when you go through hard times, but when in fact you've increased your expenditure and your outlays in all these areas of health, education and infrastructure, when you've poured more money into the roads-I've watched what my colleague Darren Chester has done for the seat of Gippsland and the highways through there-I want to acknowledge the truth. I want to be in that place of the truth. I'd like politicians in this House who are true representatives to begin to tell the truth.",59
143,Mr WATTS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," In the wake of Daniel Andrews's landslide election win, we have heard plenty of commentary from conservative figures about what went wrong. But we didn't hear anything from Prime Minister Morrison. There was no statement on election night. There was no statement on the Sunday, the day after the night before, as the full extent of the bloodbath became clear. There was no statement after his so-called crisis meeting with federal coalition MPs from Victoria on Monday. It wasn't until question time on Monday that we heard what the Prime Minister took from the Victorian state election result. I knew that this Prime Minister was out of touch but I couldn't have anticipated just how out there his response would be when it came. In one of the worse question time performances since the member for Warringah took to the dispatch box, the Prime Minister told question time that he saw Daniel Andrews's election win and he saw himself in it. I want to say this to the Prime Minister: Prime Minister, I know Daniel Andrews. Daniel Andrews is a friend of mine. Prime Minister, you're no Daniel Andrews. Daniel Andrews campaigned on a comprehensive agenda for improving Victorians' health care. In my electorate, the Andrews government pledged $1.5 billion for a complete rebuild of the Footscray Hospital on a prime site co-located with Victoria University. It committed to building 10 community hospitals, seven new early-parenting centres-centres for new parents-including a transformative $9 million commitment to that great Footscray institution of Tweddle Child and Family Health Service. It committed to increasing nurse-to-patient ratios. In contrast, Prime Minister Morrison is a leader who is responsible for ripping $715 million from the nation's public hospitals between 2017 and 2020 and $183 million from Victoria alone. That's the equivalent of cutting 250 doctors or 500 nurses. The Prime Minister saw himself in the Andrews government's commitments. This is a Prime Minister trying to lock those cuts in for another five years, ripping another $2.8 billion from the nations' hospitals. He is the leader of a government with a six-year Medicare freeze, which has ripped $3 billion out of Medicare, forcing up the cost of seeing doctors and specialists for all Victorians. That's not the Andrews government's model of governing. What do look like the Andrews model are the commitments of the Shorten federal Labor party: investing $2.8 billion in a new better hospitals fund; reversing PM Morrison's cuts and funding more elective surgeries and essential services; ending the Medicare freeze; granting 20 new Medicare MRI licences around Australia, including in Werribee; reducing out-of-pocket costs for vital services; and capping private health insurance premium increases at two per cent for two years. It is the same story in education. The Andrews government has delivered free TAFE. It has committed to universal free kinder for three-year-olds. It has committed to 100 new schools in the next eight years. And, somehow, Prime Minister Morrison sees himself in these commitments too, despite having ripped $14 billion from public schools and despite having ripped $572 million out of Victorian universities. Again, it's federal Labor, not the Morrison government, following the Andrews's model and committing $804 million to Victorian public schools over just the first three years of a future Shorten Labor government, should it be elected. That's the equivalent of around 2,000 new teachers or 3,400 new teacher aides. We'll also uncap university places from 2020 and see approximately 50,000 more students attend university. No, the Morrison government is far more like the Guy opposition than the Andrews government: narrow, nasty and out of touch with modern Australia. I've heard reports from Labor booth volunteers in the south-eastern suburbs, perhaps in the member for Deakin's seat, telling me that Liberal campaigners on election day, wearing the Liberal blue T-shirt, were handing out how to vote cards, accompanied by totally normal statements, like, 'Say no to gender fluidity,' and, 'Say no to cultural Marxism'. This is Looney Tunes stuff. I spent the full day on election day at polling booths in Victoria too, talking to voters about commitments on health, education and infrastructure, things that citizens want to hear about. Do you know what the most common question I got from voters was-from citizens? It's not good news for those opposite. It wasn't: 'I can't believe how similar the Morrison government is to the Andrews government.' It was: 'When is the federal election going to be?' Victorian voters want a new federal government.

144,Mr SUKKAR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," What we've seen today is a succession of federal Labor MPs trying to bask in the glory of somebody else's win. Never before have we seen in this federal parliament any government or opposition try to take the credit for a state election win or a state election loss in the way that we've seen those opposite. I would have thought those opposite would have taken the approach of trying to be humble, trying to see  how they could emulate their state Labor government. But no: what we've seen here is them, as the member for Wannon said earlier, measuring the curtains, so to speak. They're very, very cocky. To refer to the member for MCMillan's contribution, there is no doubt that this MPI today is grossly inaccurate. I won't go through the list of words that the member for MCMillan used to describe it, but it was a very long list. It didn't include the word 'lie', because that is against the standing orders, but it was a very long and descriptive list. If you go through each and every one of the points in this MPI-that the government has cut funding to health and to education, and has not invested in infrastructure-they are manifestly incorrect. The Labor Party have been saying for the better part of 30 years that the Liberal Party has cut health and cut education. I'm surprised there are any hospitals or schools left, if we've supposedly been cutting them for 30 years-God knows how there are any hospitals or schools left! The truth is: every single year that this government has been sitting on this side of the chamber it has increased its investment into health in every state and territory, not just Victoria. We've invested each and every year, year on year, into growth in schools. And, as the member for MCMillan said, it's not just one sector of education; whether it's the public sector, the Catholic sector or the independent sector, we've increased funding to each and every one of those. You cannot increasing funding year on year, though, as we have done, if you don't manage the economy properly or manage the budget, because, in the end, that's what funds it all. On this side of the chamber, we don't obsess over managing a strong economy or the budget just for the sake of it or because we're bean counters and we want to ensure that the numbers look good-no. It's the only way that you can deliver outcomes for Australians, if you do that. That's what the Labor Party clearly haven't learned from their time in opposition. They still think that you can spend and spend and spend, and borrow and borrow and borrow, whacking ever more debt on the national credit card and expecting that the piper won't want to be paid at some point in time. Well, the truth of the fact is that that's not how you manage a federal budget and that's not how you manage a national economy, which is what we're doing on this side of the House. In relation to infrastructure spending, we have invested enormous amounts into infrastructure in Victoria. I'll get to one area where we've, sadly, not been able to invest money, but I'll go through a list of some of the projects. Firstly, we recently announced a $5 billion commitment for the Melbourne Airport Rail Link. For so many decades, the idea that we haven't had a rail link to the airport has perplexed Victorians. It took this government to announce a $5 billion commitment to get that built. We've committed $1.6 billion for regional rail; $475 million for Monash Rail, which the member for Aston spoke about; $225 million for the Frankston to Baxter rail line; half a billion dollars for the Monash Freeway upgrade; and $500 million for the M80 Ring Road. Sadly, though, we've not been able to spend $3 billion to ease traffic congestion on the Eastern Freeway-the most important piece of infrastructure for people in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne, including in my seatbecause the Labor Party has denied the people the entitlement to the East West Link, a link from the end of the Eastern Freeway to the Tullamarine Freeway. There was $3 billion on the table from the federal government, and what did Labor do? They spent $1.3 billion to cancel that contract. What are we left with? We're left with the people of the eastern suburbs of Melbourne being ignored, traffic on the Eastern Freeway getting worse by the day and no answer from Labor. We have $3 billion committed to the East West Link which remains available- (Time expired)",60
145,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," The discussion is now concluded. NA Defence Amendment (Call Out of the Australian Defence Force) Bill 2018 Returned from Senate Message received from the Senate returning the bill without amendment. NA Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the United Kingdom, France and Ireland",61
146,Mr DANBY,DELEGATION REPORTS," I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the United Kingdom, France and Ireland, 3 to 14 June 2018. I ask leave of the House to make a short statement in connection with the report. Leave granted.",61
147,Mr DANBY,DELEGATION REPORTS,"I was part of a very illustrious delegation led by the President of the Senate, Senator Scott Ryan. The other members included myself; my colleague and friend Mr Steve Georganas, who happily returned many times; the member for Hindmarsh; Senator Pauline Hanson, who I had my first opportunity to get to speak to in detail; Mr Tim Wilson, the member for Goldstein; and Jason Wood, the very active local member for La Trobe.  The delegation was ably supported by Duncan Pearse, advisor to the President; and David Sullivan, the delegation secretary. We went to the United Kingdom, France and Ireland, and had many focuses of our visit, including trade and investment policy, particularly the UK's future trade relationship with Australia after it leaves-it is still trying to-the European Union; counterterrorism and security policy, including the security of parliamentary precincts; LGBTI policies and program; approaches to healthcare administration; youth and gang violence; energy policy; and policies to address foreign interference and the spread of misinformation and fake news via new and emerging social media platforms. Our visit to the United Kingdom was, for Australians, as usual, very engaging. We, of course, remain an enormous economic partner with what many Australians used to call the motherland. The UK is Australia's fourth-largest inbound market by arrivals and third-largest by tourism expenditure. The UK is also Australia's fourth-largest short-term destination, with 632,000 short-term resident departures from Australia to the UK for the year ending 2018. The strength of the bilateral relationship is difficult to comment on. We were received very graciously by all kinds of people. Of course, there were many visits by prime ministers and foreign ministers. In our case, we had just been to the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting before we were there. Trade and investment between the countries is immense. The UK is Australia's fifth-largest two-way trading partner, worth $27 billion in 2016-17, and our third-largest service trading partner. Interestingly, with all of the interest in investment by Beijing, the UK remains Australia's second-largest source of total foreign investment and the second-largest destination for foreign direct investment. While we were there, the United Kingdom was transfixed by the Brexit debate. Our visit to the trade committee was extraordinarily divisive, with, particularly, members of the Conservative Party fighting each other throughout the meeting. It was in a very polite way and done very pleasantly, but it demonstrated to us how deeply divisive that issue was within the governing party. We were extremely graciously received by the high commissioner, the former Attorney-General, the Hon. George Brandis QC, who was kind enough to take me to visit Karl Marx's grave. I think the pictures of the two of us there were quite extraordinary. I think we were both establishing that he had indeed passed. That was at Highgate Cemetery, of course. It did surprise us that his grave was surrounded by the tombstones of many minor Socialists who sought to associate themselves, even in death, with the honourable Karl Marx-well, 'honourable'? I don't know. The UK's exit from the EU will fundamentally change the framework of Australia-UK trade and investment. I'm sure the delegation is confident that we're not going to have our economic relationship affected by the Brexit issue. In fact, it may enhance, in an odd way, Australia's relationship. We met the intelligence committee, headed by the Right Hon. Dominic Grieve, who is currently conducting major inquiries into historical detention and rendition, drone strikes into Syria against IS, and recent terrorist attacks in London and Manchester. We were able to attend the commemoration of the first anniversary of the attack on London Bridge, which was held at Southwark Cathedral on 3 June, and that was extremely moving. I was very pleased, as was the whole delegation, to meet with friend of Australia the Right Hon. Mark Field, Minister of State for Asia and the Pacific. He was able to remark, and we were able to agree, that Britain's interests in this part of the world were being re-cemented. British interests in the South Pacific and in the Asia Pacific area more generally were being enhanced. We had just seen the first visit of a British ship to the South China Sea, which enhanced international navigation rights by making free transit of that ocean as guaranteed under the international Law of the Sea treaty. It is pleasing to see that a number of European powers, including France and Britain, have sought to associate themselves with transit of that international sea. We had fascinating meetings in Paris, including the most moving breakfast with deputies of the French National Assembly from the Somme, where my grandfather fought in the First World War. I just thought it was an amazing piece of serendipity to have breakfast with them and to just sit opposite people from the area that my grandfather actually fought in. At a broad level, Australia and France share a common vision and work cooperatively in global security to combat terrorism and violent extremism. I was particularly pleased to introduce Senator Hanson to a young female Muslim deputy of the National Assembly. She had made a brilliant presentation to us about how, in France, they are legislating to prevent fake news influencing presidential elections. It appears that Russia tried to do this at the last elections, and influenced the election against Mr Macron. In France, what they're going to do is have an independent judicial group make judgements within 24 hours about fake news interventions on social media during the election period. That independent judicial group will make a deliberation about those issues and stop them, if necessary. I've seen that Mr Zuckerberg is in trouble in a number of jurisdictions around the world France, Britain, the United States and even here-and it's particularly over the issue of the use of Facebook algorithms to increase division in society and to interfere in democratic political decisions. There was one thing that I really wish we'd had an opportunity to do more of, and that was to discuss the bilateral relationship with France on the Future Submarine program. We could have done a bit more on that. But, altogether, the visit to France-the impression of its magnificent historical settings for the French Senate and the National Assembly, and it's archive-really make you understand the great history of that country. The delegation was interested to learn about the policies and procedures in place for France's parliamentary precincts. They're even stricter than they are here. Terrorist attacks in 2014 and 2015 and public order disturbances have become a focus of attention, with the security system for the parliamentary precinct upgraded, as Senator Ryan reports, to include high levels of surveillance, the arming of security guards with weapons and protective jackets, and restricted access to the building. However, the French parliament's buildings, some of which date to the 17th century, create many practical constraints on implementing security measures, most of which aren't faced here. Our visit to Ireland focused on issues of Brexit, electoral reform, data protection and standards of public office. We were most graciously received by people in the Dail. Everything they say about the Irish-their hospitality and their warmth-I found to be accurate. Apart from thanking my colleagues who were on the delegation, I want to thank, in particular, John Bercow, the Speaker of the British parliament, and the High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, George Brandis-our visit to Highgate Cemetery was particularly memorable. I want to thank the President of the Senate, Scott Ryan, for the organisation of the visit and the very intense program that was prepared for us. I found it extremely worthwhile; in particular, in the area of data protection and intelligence sharing.",61
148,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,DELEGATION REPORTS, I thank the member for that extensive and interesting report. NA Treaties Committee Report,63
149,Mr BROADBENT,COMMITTEES," On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present the committee's report, incorporating a dissenting report, entitled Report 184: nuclear cooperation UK. Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).",63
150,Mr BROADBENT,COMMITTEES,"by leave-Today I rise to make a statement concerning the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties' Report 184. The report deals with the Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland on Cooperation in the Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy. The Australian government has an export policy for Australian nuclear materials that permits Australian nuclear materials to be used only for peaceful purposes. Australia's policy also requires the safe and secure storage of Australian nuclear materials, and imposes an accounting framework to ensure that Australian nuclear materials are always subject to Australian standards. The United Kingdom will leave the European Union on 29 March 2019. Subject to final agreement between the UK and the EU, a transition period during which the UK will be subject to EU laws may apply up until 31 December 2020. When the UK leaves the EU, it will also leave Euratom, the European Atomic Energy Community. Australian nuclear materials in the UK have until now been covered by the Australia-Euratom nuclear cooperation agreement. When the UK leaves Euratom, that agreement will cease to apply to Australian nuclear materials in the UK. Consequently, a new nuclear cooperation agreement with the UK is necessary to enable the uninterrupted transfer of Australian uranium to the UK and to maintain smooth commercial operations for Australian mining companies. The proposed agreement will ensure that Australian nuclear safety standards continue to apply to Australian nuclear materials in the UK post-Brexit. The UK and Australia have an extensive history of nuclear cooperation, and the UK has a reputation for supporting non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. The UK also has an established and expanding civilian nuclear industry.  The UK holds a third of Australia's nuclear materials in the EU, and is a significant international manufacturer of nuclear fuels. This means that Australian nuclear materials exported to the UK are regularly transferred to third parties following processing into nuclear fuel. Third-party transfers of Australian nuclear material from the UK can only be made to countries with which Australia has a nuclear cooperation agreement. As an added precaution, third-party transfers from the UK can only be made with Australia's prior consent. This means that Australian nuclear materials exported to the UK will always be subject to Australian standards and can be accounted for through their life span. The committee believes that the Australia-UK nuclear cooperation agreement is in Australia's interest and recommends that binding treaty action be taken. On behalf of the committee, I commend the report to the House. Human Rights Committee Report",63
151,Mr GOODENOUGH,COMMITTEES," On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, I present the committee's report entitled Human rights scrutiny report: Report 12 of 2018. Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).",64
152,Mr GOODENOUGH,COMMITTEES,"by leave-Of the new bills examined in chapter 1 of this report, 15 have been assessed as not raising human rights concerns as they promote, permissibly limit, or do not engage, human rights. The committee has also requested further information in relation to the human rights compatibility of two bills, and has considered three bills on an 'advice only' basis. Chapter 2 of the report contains the committee's concluded examination of a number of pieces of legislation. Of the bills assessed as not raising human rights concerns, I would like to highlight the statement of compatibility accompanying the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Legislation Amendment (Streamlining Regulation) Bill 2018. This bill amends a number of acts relating to the regulation of agricultural and veterinary chemical products in a manner that engages and limits a number of human rights, including the right to privacy, freedom of expression and criminal process rights. The statement of compatibility comprehensively sets out each of the rights that were engaged and limited by the measures in the bill, which allowed for an assessment that the measures, in context, were permissible limitations on human rights. The statement of compatibility accompanying this bill is an example of how, when human rights issues are fully addressed in the statement, the committee is able to conclude its analysis without needing to seek further information from legislation proponents. In this regard, statements of compatibility are the primary document that sets out the legislation proponent's assessment of the human rights compatibility of legislation, and are a key starting point for the committee's technical examination of the human rights compatibility of legislation. The committee has, in recent months, been undertaking a project to improve statements of compatibility including by engaging with legislation proponents and providing training. The aim is to improve the quality of statements of compatibility by explaining the committee's expectations, underpinned by the legal requirements, as to the content of the statements of compatibility and information as to how the statement of compatibility could be improved. I encourage my fellow members and others to examine the committee's latest scrutiny report to better inform their consideration of proposed legislation. With these comments, I commend the committee's Report 12 of 2018 to the chamber. NA Electoral Legislation Amendment (Electoral Funding and Disclosure Reform) Bill 2018 Second Reading Consideration resumed of the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.",64
153,Mr GOSLING,BILLS," I am in continuation. I previously outlined our history, the history of those on this side of the chamber in relation to this issue and, in particular, the foreign donations policy we took to the last federal election. That's on the record. Suffice to say, we've been leading in this area. Actions are important. This bill will mean that foreign donations are banned. We will get improved protection of our elections from foreign interference, and that is important. This is going to be achieved without imposing unnecessary and onerous restrictions on charities and the civil sector, and that is important.  It does remain to be seen how effective compliance and enforcement will be, so I just wanted to make the point that consultation with the Australian Electoral Commission, the AEC, will be required to ensure that the practical operation of the foreign donations ban has good outcomes for our electoral processes and our nation. We need to ensure that there are no unfortunate unintended consequences. I hope that all of us in this parliament will remain vigilant to ensure that the integrity of our democracy is maintained and public trust in our democracy is preserved. For our part, Labor have consistently said that we support increased transparency throughout our political system. We believe that the current disclosure threshold for political donations is too high at $10,000, indexed to inflation, which effectively means it is now $13,800. We propose it should be $1,000 and not indexed. This bill is a significant reform. It's a significant step forward. But it's taken a lot of hard work by many people, including by many charitable and not-for-profit groups, who have had to expend considerable resourcesresources that should have gone to their charitable objectives-to save those opposite from their own incompetence. Having said that, this bill is a step forward. It remains to be seen how enforcement will work, but hopefully it will, with proper enforcement, mean that, in the future, our electoral process remains good and without foreign interference.",64
154,Ms SHARKIE,BILLS," I won't take up much of the House's time with respect to the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Electoral Funding and Disclosure Reform) Bill. While I think every person in this House believes that electoral funding reform is important, it's fair to say that we've had very slow movement in this place with respect to electoral reform. Now we know that political campaigners will now need to register to disclose their donations, it's disappointing that Labor did not pursue a thousand dollar donation limit for all donors, not just foreign donors. I note that in the other place they got cold feet and moved a second reading amendment instead. Let's face it: that was tokenistic and a meaningless gesture. It's important to remember that if we want to restore the faith of the Australian people we can do that in no easier way than through donation reform. Personally, I would like to see something closer to Canada's model. I think that politics has become about big business. It has become about big money and less about grassroots movement and grassroots representation. So, for a future parliament, or perhaps even this parliament, I would like to see that we have real and meaningful reform with respect to political donations. We should have real-time disclosure. We should also have, I believe, a limit of no more than $1,000 being donated by man, woman, child or, indeed, corporation. I think there's a sense out in the community that if you donate a couple of thousand dollars to a candidate or a political party it is a gesture. However, when a organisation or individual donates $100,000-or more than that-one has to question the motives for donating that much. I believe we need to question whether people in this place make decisions based on the donations that they receive and the vested interests that they are. I will be moving some amendments. These are amendments that were moved in the Senate, and I would hope that the opposition in particular would look at these amendments again. These amendments require the disclosure of gifts and loans that exceed the disclosure threshold to be delivered each calendar month. We need to be sharing this. The value of the gift and loan and the identity of the person who provides the gift and loan must be disclosed, and those disclosures must be made within 10 days after the end of the calendar month. As I said, the disclosure threshold at the moment, which is more than $13,000, is too high. That really means, effectively, a family of five can donate the best part of $50,000 and nobody knows-nobody has any idea of the money flowing, particularly into the major political parties. In closing, I think we can do a lot more if we want to gain the trust of the Australian community. We need to get money out of politics. I look forward to a time when members from both of the major political parties actually take this issue seriously and we address real funding reform for political parties. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Consideration in Detail Bill-by leave-taken as a whole.",65
155,Ms SHARKIE,BILLS," I move: (1) Schedule 1, page 62 (after line 14), after item 45A, insert: 45AA After section 304 Insert: 304A Monthly disclosure of gifts and loans Gifts  (1) If, in a calendar month, a political entity or a political campaigner receives one or more gifts, the recipient must notify the Electoral Commission, in the approved form, of the total value of those gifts within 10 days after the end of the calendar month. (2) If, in a calendar month, a political entity or a political campaigner receives a gift whose value exceeds the disclosure threshold, the recipient must notify the Electoral Commission, in the approved form, of the following within 10 days after the end of the calendar month: (a) the value of the gift; (b) the name and address of the person who made the gift. Loans (3) If, in a calendar month, a political entity or a political campaigner receives one or more loans, the recipient must notify the Electoral Commission, in the approved form, of the total amount of those loans within 10 days after the end of the calendar month. (4) If, in a calendar month, a political entity or a political campaigner receives a loan the amount of which exceeds the disclosure threshold, the recipient must notify the Electoral Commission, in the approved form, of the following within 10 days after the end of the calendar month: (a) the amount of the loan; (b) the name and address of the person who made the loan. The amendment is quite simple. It is an amendment that was moved in the Senate on 15 November, and it is my hope that this House considers the amendment differently than the Senate did. It will require the disclosure of gifts and loans that exceed the disclosure threshold, including if the cumulative total exceeds a threshold each calendar month. The disclosure can be made within 10 days after the end of the calendar month. The value of the gift loan and the identity of the person who provides the gift loan must be disclosed to the Electoral Commission. These disclosure requirements are not audited; they are in addition to the annual disclosure requirements that are audited and can be found in section 305B. The disclosure threshold of $13,800 indexed until June 2019 is not altered in any way by the proposed amendments. As I said in my speech, if we want meaningful change in this place, and if we want the Australian community to have faith in us, I believe changes to political donations need to happen.",65
156,Dr LEIGH,BILLS," The question of the donations threshold is one that has a long and special history to those of us on this side of the House. It was the Hawke government in 1983 that first introduced laws requiring donations to a political party exceeding $1,000 to be disclosed. Labor opposed the decision of the Howard government in 2006 to increase the disclosure threshold to $10,000 indexed to CPI, which has taken it to the $13,800 it is today. Indeed, I would note the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters back in 2011, which recommended reducing the disclosure thresholds on donations to $1,000 not indexed. Labor believes that donations over $1,000 should be disclosed. It is the practice that we maintain as a political party. But Labor will not be supporting this amendment because it is important, in making the reform, to ensure that there is significant consultation with the Australian Electoral Commission and, indeed, with charities and notfor-profits. It has been Labor that has stood shoulder to shoulder with charities and not-for-profits throughout this debate, making sure they are not impeded by the way in which we crack down on foreign donations. Real-time disclosure may be straightforward for a large entity, but real-time disclosure may not be feasible for a small entity. We on this side of the House will not support changes which would see small entities incurring significant fines for failing to comply with the law. We want to work with those charities and not-for-profits, as we've done through this process. I'd say to the member for Mayo that we have made clear to her colleague Senator Griff in the other place that we will work with her party, should we be fortunate enough to win government, to see these two things happen: to move to improving transparency and to disclose donations over $1,000. But we must do it in consultation with the AEC. We must do it in a way that doesn't hurt charities. And anyone who has been watching this debate over the last year will have seen how badly hurt charities and not-for-profits are. To now support this amendment would risk hurting the very same charities and not-for-profits that Labor have stood up for over the course of the last year. We will not see that happen. We support the reducing of the disclosure threshold, we support greater transparency but, because we also support charities and not-for-profits, we cannot support this ill-considered amendment at this time.",66
157,Mr HAWKE,BILLS," I want to thank the member for Mayo for this amendment. The amendment proposes a form of regular disclosure of political donations. The government is committed to consulting all the relevant experts through the open government partnership to progress the work of open government. Civil society groups, however, as the opposition has noted, who would have to disclose under the electoral funding and disclosure scheme, would need sufficiently sophisticated internal administrative processes to deal with any new requirements of the new regime. Unlike the many other amendments that have  been adopted in this bill, this proposal hasn't been subjected to consultation with regulated entities and there hasn't been consultation with the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in a thorough policy process. For those reasons, the government's committed to a considered and collaborative approach to real-time disclosure and will not be supporting the amendment. I note that this amendment was considered in the Senate and was rejected. Question negatived. Bill agreed to. Third Reading",66
158,Mr HAWKE,BILLS, by leave-I move: That this bill be now read a third time. Question agreed to. Bill read a third time. Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2018 Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2018 Second Reading Cognate debate. Consideration resumed of the motion: That this bill be now read a second time.,67
159,Mr ROBERT,BILLS," It's a great privilege to provide the summing up to the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia Bill 2018 and the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2018. I'd like to thank all members of this chamber for their contributions to this debate and thank the Attorney-General for all the work he's done in this debate. The main FCFC bill brings together the Family Court of Australia and the Federal Circuit Court of Australia, to be known as the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia. Contrary to the contributions of members opposite, this bill does not in any way abolish the Family Court. It provides a consistent family law court structure, designed to make it as easy as possible for Australian families to get on with their lives. The consequential FCFC bill removes the appeal division of the Family Court and establishes the family law appeal division in the Federal Court. It also facilitates the transition for court users from the Family Court of Australia and the Federal Circuit Court of Australia to the new Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia on the commencement of these provisions. These changes will help to ensure that Australian families have certainty and consistency in their experience navigating the court system. I note that, when the government introduced these bills into this parliament on 23 August this year, it was scheduled to commence on 1 January 2019. However, due to the time frame for the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee's inquiry into the bills, the commencement date of 1 January 2019 is no longer achievable. The government will move amendments today to substitute the original commencement date reference to '1 January 2019' for a reference to 'the commencement day'. The commencement day will be defined in the bill as: A single day to be fixed by Proclamation. However, if the provisions do not commence within the period of 6 months beginning on the day this Act receives the Royal Assent, they commence on the day after the end of that period. The government amendments to be moved will also make two changes to this bill to clarify that the Family Law (Fees) Regulation 2012 applies to services requested or documents filed in the family law appeal division-the FLAD-of the Federal Court of Australia, and to ensure the continuation of the current practice of the federal courts of not charging fees for child support matters. I also acknowledge the issues raised by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills in Scrutiny Digest No. 10 of 2018 in relation to the delegation of administrative powers. These issues are under active consideration, and the government will respond in due course. We know the family law system is in bad shape. The cracks in the system have turned into crevices. Families are exhausted by the time taken to transfer matters between the Federal Circuit Court and the Family Court, the outcome of which can often require them to start their matter afresh. It takes over a year from filing for defendant matters to be heard at trial. The potential difference in cost between matters going to trial in the Family Court compared to matters going to trial in the Federal Circuit Court is substantial. This government has made addressing the family law system a priority. The best way for Australian families to feel immediate benefit from  family law reform is by resettling the federal family law court structure. This is the most appropriate starting point, and it will allow us to implement the recommendations of the Australian Law Reform Commission in the context of a more efficient and effective user-friendly court structure that is not the subject of the ALRC's family law system review. The main FCFC bill brings together the Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court. The Family Court will continue as Division 1 of the Federal Circuit and Family Court of Australia, the FCFC, and the Federal Circuit Court will continue as Division 2 of the FCFC. Judges appointed to both the Family Court and the Federal Circuit Court will continue their appointments in the new courts. Judicial family law expertise will not be lost. The bill retains the family law qualifications for judges appointed to Division 1 and introduces a new appointment requirement for Division 2 judges to ensure they are suitable for that position. Importantly, the new requirement will enshrine in legislation a broader consideration of a potential judge's qualifications, experience and attributes. That being said, the government is very confident of the family law expertise of the family law judges in the Federal Circuit Court of Australia. We note that, currently, the Federal Circuit Court has the highest number of specialised family law judges, at 41, with an average of 25 years experience in family law. The FCFC will effectively be a single point of entry into the family law jurisdiction of the federal court system and will hear first instance family law matters. Both Divisions 1 and 2 will have the same original jurisdiction in family law matters, with Division 2 also retaining the Federal Circuit Court's existing general federal law and fair work jurisdiction. Family law appeals will go to the new family law appeal division in the Federal Court. Removing the appeal division of the Family Court means that more judges of the FCFC will be able to hear more trials. This will ease the growing backlog of first instance family law matters waiting to be heard and reduce median case waiting times. The reforms will also improve the family law case management system. The reforms mean there'll be no wrong door for family law matters. People will be able to file their matter in either division knowing it will be overseen by a case management team led by judges, and allocated, at the appropriate time, the most appropriate judge in the most appropriate division. The government is serious about improving the family law system. To assist this work, we've allocated $4 million in funding to the Federal Court to review court rules and assist with implementing the reforms. By creating standardised rules and procedures within family law, the FCFC will be simpler to use and more efficient. While these increased efficiencies are predicted to save $3 million like the reforms in 2015-16, this money will be invested back into the courts to continue rebuilding the family law system to improve Australian families' experiences. The consequential FCFC bill amends the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 to establish the new family law appeal division, which will hear appeals from judgements of the FCFC, a family court of a state or single-judge decision of a supreme court of a state or territory exercising family law jurisdiction. The government anticipates that the majority of appeals from the FCFC (Division 2) will be heard by a single judge, freeing up judicial resources to reduce delays in family law appeal matters. The bill ensures that appropriate transitional arrangements are in place, including for matters before the Federal Court from the commencement date of the provisions. This bill is an important companion to the main FCFC bill. This is an important day for Australian families. The purpose of the government's reforms is to ensure Australian families experience shorter waiting times at court and a reduction in the potential for conflict caused by prolonged and acrimonious family disputes in our court system. The government is committed to delivering better family law court structure for Australian families as soon as possible. We are ending the confusion in the family law jurisdiction caused by striking different procedures, practices, rules and fees. We're stopping delays caused by cases bouncing around between these two federal courts. We're ceasing the prolonged pain drawn-out cases can cause to children and families. I encourage the parliament to say yes to a new federal court structure that will put the needs of Australian families first and support them getting on with their lives. Question agreed to.

168,Ms STANLEY,NOES," I rise to speak on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Housing Affordability) Bill 2017. The bill that is currently before the House is yet another example of why this government is not for Australians living on low incomes. This is a bill that hides punitive, draconian measures targeting the most vulnerable in our community under the guise of housing affordability. This is a bill that's like The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. This is a bill that combines sensible administrative changes to the National Rental Affordability Scheme with an attack on those in our society who are already down and out. The member for Barton has already highlighted the opposition's support for ensuring landlords are not taking advantage of the National Rental Affordability Scheme. That is not our issue with the bill. In my speech today, I want to highlight the disturbing nature of the Automatic Rent Deduction Scheme. This is a scheme that targets low-income Australians, demonstrates a disregard for social housing and lays bare a disgraceful ideology around the nature of government assistance. The bill has been brought to the House by a government that doesn't care about Australians living on low incomes. We know that 99 per cent of social housing tenants are able to pay their rent on time, and are happy to do so. Already, 86 per cent of Australians living in government owned housing participate in voluntary rent deduction schemes. Going after one per cent of tenants who may not be able to pay is cruel and it is petty. This is a government that only cares about economically supporting the top one per cent rather than the bottom one per cent. With no cap on the amount of arrears that might be deducted from each fortnightly welfare payment, who, does the government think, will suffer under these measures? We know that families make up a large proportion of social housing tenants. In putting up legislation like this, have the government considered who they are going to impact by recovering 100 per cent of an individual's Centrelink payments? This will impact not just those on welfare payments but their children and other family members-those who will have done nothing to contribute to the situation of rental arrears but who will suffer greatly should a significant portion of the welfare payments be forcibly quarantined. This government has been nothing if not consistent in its failure to take meaningful action on Australia's housing crisis. The name of the bill is misleading. This is not a government that is for housing affordability. It's quite the opposite actually. Social housing is an essential component in providing adequate supply of affordable, quality housing to all Australians. This piece of legislation makes clear how little this government values social housing. It views social housing as a handout rather than as an essential piece of economic infrastructure. It views circumstances that may cause tenants to default on their rent as reason for punishment rather than compassion.  Social housing is an important component of tackling housing affordability in this country. Social housing represents opportunity. It is a vital public infrastructure. It is the secure, stable home that all Australians deserve. It also enables those Australians on minimal incomes to access the housing market, relieving cost pressures on the low-cost private rental market. I grew up in social housing in south-west Sydney. This was in an era when the government actually valued such a commodity. Those opportunities that come when children have secure, stable housing are remarkable, and the reason why I'm here. The value of family, a good education, a consistent roof over your head and adequate nutrition afford children the best possible start in life. The government must look to create these circumstances, which individuals living in social housing need to thrive, because we know that when we give vulnerable Australians the tools they need to succeed in society they are able to thrive. Growing up in a secure and stable home affords children the wealth of opportunities that this country has to offer. Implementing these compulsory rent deductions will create further undue stress upon family environments, which goes against the very principle of social housing itself. The bill represents ideological whiplash. The minister, in his speech, discussed the benefits of streamlining NRAS delivery. In the same breath, he cited the need to get tough on social housing tenants who default on their rent. This is in spite of the fact that 99 per cent of social housing tenants pay their rent on time each fortnight. Given the minimal amount that the government might hope to recoup, the proposed Automatic Rent Deduction Scheme seems to be just another attempt to look tough at the expense of vulnerable Australians. The Prime Minister is more than happy to wander around wearing a baseball cap supporting the cause of men than to stand up to those who commit the act of interpersonal violence. However, this week we need to meet in this place to debate a bill that could see uncapped automatic rent deductions for the damage caused as a result of domestic and family violence. We hold grave concerns on this side of the House about the practical implementation of these measures. It's difficult to imagine ordinary circumstances where social housing tenants would simply fall into rental arrears of their own volition. They're happy to be in social housing; they know what an honour it is to get a place. If a stressful financial system causes individuals and families to fall behind in their rent, acquiring entire welfare payments to recover the debt is likely only to worsen that situation. When Labor was in government last we introduced the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Public Housing Tenants' Support) Bill 2013. This bill capped the rental reductions in order to allow for a reasonable ability for individuals to manage their other financial affairs. We required this to be communicated to tenants well in advance, and the compulsory deductions only applied to tenants at considerable risk of becoming homeless. In contrast, this bill that I speak on today allows for deductions that are unfair, unexpected and uncapped. Worse still, it includes all those on government benefits, the disability support pension and carer payments-people who are vulnerable and people who are looking after the vulnerable. The Automatic Rent Deduction Scheme this bill proposes is a disproportionate and draconian response that patronises social housing tenants by suggesting they're unable to manage their own finances. We believe that any form of rental deduction should be applied as a last resort only, and only as a means of preventing homelessnessremembering that we're only talking about one per cent of these tenants. What's more, a Shorten Labor government would take a holistic approach to the issue of homelessness, encompassing all homelessness and housing insecurity, not just the rental arrears of one per cent of the nation's housing tenants. In conclusion, as I said at the start of my speech, this bill is a strange case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. The government claims it is about housing affordability, and, while the NRAS reforms are badly needed and sensible, it's difficult to see how coming after social housing tenants in tough spots does anything to promote housing affordability. Really, all it will do is make people's lives worse and take away their opportunity to get better. Tying two separate reforms together demonstrates that this government does not care about the integrity of its policy. Labor will support the changes to NRAS, but the bill needs to be split so that we can deal with each component separately. If this were a government truly committed to the housing needs of our vulnerable and lowincome Australians, it would allow the NRAS changes and the Compulsory Rent Deduction Scheme to be considered separately. As it stands, it is not right to support this legislation.",83
169,Ms OWENS,NOES," I am pleased to speak on this bill, the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Housing Affordability) Bill 2017. What this government bill does is introduce an automatic rent deduction scheme that can be mandatorily applied to all tenants receiving social security or family assistance payments who live in public or community housing. Currently, under the Compulsory Rent Deduction Scheme, social housing tenants are able to request that Centrelink withholds a portion of their income support payment to directly pay their rent and other costs, such as utilities. So there is already a scheme. It's voluntary-people in  social housing can ask to have a portion taken-and the scheme is already used by 86 per cent of households in the public and social housing sector. But this bill goes further than that in that it creates an Automatic Rent Deduction Scheme. Under that scheme, state and territories, as well as community housing providers, would be able to request that the secretary withhold a portion of tenants' income support and/or family tax benefit payments and use these funds to directly pay rent and utilities costs on behalf of those tenants. The bill would allow automatic deductions from people in receipt of the age pension, disability support pension, carer payment and family tax benefit as well as those relying on Newstart or youth allowance. It would extend across the broad range of people receiving government payments. It would mean that funds could be withheld from tenants without their permission if a state chooses to apply it in this way. States and territories would have the absolute discretion to decide whether the Automatic Rent Deduction Scheme would apply in their jurisdiction and the extent to which it is applied. The government argues that evictions as a result of rental arrears of public household tenants are a cause of homelessness. According to data from the states and territories, in 2013-14 more than 8,900 households living in social housing were more than three weeks in arrears of rent and 2,300 people were evicted from public housing due to rent arrears. But given there are nearly 400,000 households living in public and social housing, that is actually a small number-less than 2.5 per cent-of people who are more than three weeks in arrears. So this is a very big stick, to use the government's language, to use on a circumstance that applies to a very small number of people. As I said, 86 per cent of people in social and public housing are already using a voluntary rent deduction scheme, as of 2015-16. We also know, because of evidence to the inquiry, that 90 per cent of tenants have no problems meeting their rental obligations at all. The Parliamentary Library has also advised that over the five years from 2011-12 to 2015-16 national rent collection rates have averaged over 99 per cent across public housing, community housing and state owned and managed Indigenous housing. So we have a sector that is working 99 per cent of the time. But for that one per cent, we have a measure that this government wants to introduce that will make it possible for states and territories to make it mandatory for all those tenants-all of the 99 per cent that are managing quite well, as well as the one per cent-to have money taken from their payments without their consent. It's a disproportionate response. It is a very big stick for a problem that involves only a relatively small number of social and public housing tenants. The Senate inquiry also heard that rental arrears are not a significant cause of homelessness-and we know this. Those of us that have organisations in our communities that work with the homeless will know that it's more likely to be complex issues such as mental illness, substance abuse, family violence and a lack of affordable options that contribute more greatly to homelessness in Australia than social housing rental arrears. I would urge the government to look at the broader causes of homelessness rather than impose such a harsh process on people in social and public housing. A form of compulsory rent reductions, I have to say, was actually recommended in The road home: a national approach to reducing homelessness white paper, which the former Labor government commissioned. At the time of losing government in 2013, we did actually have a piece of legislation to enable a compulsory rent reduction scheme, known as the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Public Housing Tenants' Support) Bill 2013,which lapsed in the 2013 election. It was quite different to this very harsh, one-size-fits-all approach that the government has. There are a number of critical differences. Firstly, under Labor's proposal the changes in the public housing tenants' support bill would only have applied to tenants who had rental arrears of more than four weeks, and only once other reasonable recovery action had been taken. This included requirements to connect people to financial counselling and other services. In the Labor proposal we had something that only applied to people who were in trouble, rather than this harsh measure that applies to 100 per cent of people, of whom 99 per cent are now doing just fine. Also under Labor's bill, the deductions in the public housing tenants' support bill were capped. Deductions, under the public housing tenants' support bill, could only apply temporarily, up to 12 months after arrears were addressed to enable a person's circumstances to stabilise. The amount deducted was able to be varied in accordance with changes in rental and utility amounts, provided the tenant was notified. So Labor's proposal provided solutions for people who were in difficulty; the government's approach applies to everybody across the board. There have been a number of stakeholder concerns, as you'd expect. The majority of stakeholders are strongly opposed to an automatic rent deduction scheme; most argue that compulsory deductions can only be justified in very limited circumstances to prevent imminent homelessness, and with strict oversight. They talk about some of the circumstances in which you find tenants who would be incredibly harshly dealt with under this government's very large stick. Withholding a portion of income for rent decreases the capacity of tenants to respond to  emergencies, such as the need to replace an appliance or pay a large bill. Currently, it is common practice for social housing tenants to negotiate with the housing provider to defer a rental payment so they can meet unexpected expenses when they occur. As we all know, many people in social housing are on very, very tight financial constraints and aren't able to respond to those unexpected expenses. There is also concern that those who are named on the lease will shoulder an unfair proportion of costs. For example, as in other households, there are some cases where several adults share the rent. There is no capacity in this process for that to be taken into account. In their submissions, welfare organisations have recommended that a cap be placed on the amount that the secretary may deduct from a tenant's income support payment to ensure that a minimum residual amount is available to meet the tenant's other needs. The Salvation Army has suggested the cap could be set at 30 per cent of household income. There are a number of different definitions and indicators of housing stress, but most of the definitions are that where households are spending more than 30 per cent of their gross income on housing costs they are in housing stress. There were several witnesses to the inquiry that raised concerns that the amount deducted could include an amount to cover damage to the rental property. There was a universal condemnation of that. It was of concern that social housing tenants may not have damaged the property themselves and, as a cohort, are less likely to follow up on their rights to review and appeal as a result. So there are many concerns with this bill as it stands. I would urge the government to consider why they feel the need to apply such a very large stick-again using their language-on people who are already coping quite well with the payment of rent. As the inquiry stated, 99 per cent of social, public and community housing tenants are paying their rent on time. There is a very small number that aren't. We would recommend that the government also look at Labor's proposal back in 2013, which addressed those who were having difficulty but left alone those who were capable of managing their own finances. Again, this government is very, very good at attacking those who are most vulnerable. It can be very harsh in its approach to people experiencing difficulty. We would urge it to reconsider. There will be a Senate inquiry, and we will be looking very closely at the outcome of that inquiry as we put together our final view on this bill. But, as it stands, it's unreasonably harsh and it targets a broad range of people when perhaps it would be more appropriate if the government provided support mechanisms for those who are experiencing difficulty, rather than apply these harsh measures to the whole sector.",84
170,Mr HAYES,NOES," I would also like to make a contribution on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Housing Affordability) Bill 2017, and indicate at the outset that I certainly strongly support the second reading amendment moved by the shadow minister. This is another example of the government's inaction when it comes to housing affordability. The government love to talk it up-they love to talk about housing affordability-but this is just another example of their inactivity when it comes to dealing with housing affordability. As speaker after speaker on our side have indicated, this bill, really, in terms of community housing, applies to about one per cent of the rental base. But, nevertheless, they actually see this as almost signature legislation for them. I would have thought it would have been far more beneficial for the government to actually address the issue of housing affordability and take a serious view about homelessness in this country. If this government was serious about homelessness, it would certainly be doing something about mental health, which is one of the main triggers and issues of homelessness. It would also, particularly-as experienced in my own electorate-be doing something about the issues with crisis accommodation, particularly for women fleeing domestic violence. Clearly there are many, many other vulnerable Australians who would be part of this cohort of the one per cent that the government is really applying this legislation to capture. I'd like to read to the House what Associate Professor Lisa Woods from the Centre for Social Impact says in her submission in terms of the intergenerational effects of the failure to invest in people for whom housing is unaffordable or inadequate. She says: 'We see there is a risk of inequity. A lot of people who are homeless have experienced childhood drama. There are many who are experiencing mental health issues. Many of them are victims of sexual abuse, so there are complex cases. These inequities are deep-rooted.' I think that's right. When it comes to these issues-when you think that 99 per cent of all those in social housing are able to meet their rental responsibilities on time-this is directed to that one per cent. On many occasions I've spoken in this place about how I have the very distinct honour of representing what is the most multicultural community in the whole of Australia. It's very colourful; it's very vibrant. We certainly revel in its diversity. But, regrettably, it's not a rich community. As a matter of fact, I disproportionately have, it's probably fair to say, the lion's share of immigrants and, particularly, refugees who come to this country. The bulk of them feature in my area in south-west Sydney, particularly in the local government area of Fairfield.  It is also worthwhile noting that the average household income in my electorate is a tad over $60,000 per annum. That's not the average income; that's the average household income. As I say, mine is not a rich community and, therefore, housing affordability and social housing are very, very big and material issues for the people I have the honour of representing. As such, the issue of housing affordability is something that my office deals with regularly. I am indebted to the great work that is done by the various community housing organisations I have working in Western Sydney, particularly Hume housing and St George Community Housing. There is also the housing provided by the Gandangara local land council, as I have a large Aboriginal population based around Liverpool. These organisations do a great job, together with various other government funded agencies, in trying to accommodate the essential needs of people-and that is putting a roof over families' heads. One other organisation I would like to mention-and I spoke a fair bit about it yesterday-is the Bonnie Support Services. Yesterday we spoke in this place about White Ribbon Day and violence against women. Bonnie Support Services is an extraordinary organisation that does an incredible job in providing not only support services and counselling to victims of domestic violence; it also provides crisis accommodation to those victims. So it is something which is just so fundamental in my community when bearing in mind that more than 50 per cent of all assaults reported to police in my community are domestic violence related. I would like to read to you what Tracy Phillips, the executive officer of Bonnie Support Services, particularly advised me. She said that: … there is a clear lack of crisis and transitional housing for women and children, with individuals having to be referred to other organisations on a daily basis, due to their lack of capacity. These are not figures that are just plucked out. These are things which are happening. I would imagine, in terms of domestic violence, my electorate doesn't stand alone in that. This is something that affects everybody. But I certainly know the impact it has in my community. Instead of taking steps to rectify housing affordability in this regard, the government are fixated on this automatic rent deduction for social housing tenants and making changes to the administration of the national rental administration scheme. As I said from the outset, this is not a serious attempt to deal with housing affordability. It's just another tick-and-flick process that we've come to expect from this government. They have probably picked the most marginalised community to have a go at. That is what this does. It is clear from the outset. We will support modest amendments to the National Rental Affordability Scheme, particularly in schedule 3 of the bill, which actually brings the scheme back in line with what our targets were when Labor formally introduced them. However, we still, as I say, hold great reservations about schedule 1 and schedule 2, which impose a mandatory automatic rental reduction scheme. In trying to dig through this I sought the advice of the Parliamentary Library, a great asset we have in this place in terms of research capability. That advice shows that 86 per cent of public and social housing tenants voluntarily use the Rental Deduction Scheme. The Parliamentary Library also was able to indicate that, in terms of the rental collection rate, 99 per cent of all social housing or public housing tenants are able to pay their rent on time. Hence we get back to the one-percenters. This time we're not talking about the bikies, who those opposite like to talk about. The one-percenters in this case are the most vulnerable in our community, those who are, perhaps, age pensioners, people on a disability support pension or carer payment or people on family tax benefit-not to forget those on Newstart and youth allowance. This may not be a big thing for those opposite, who have more-affluent electorates than the one I have the honour to represent. I've said my electorate's not rich, but it's certainly not uncommon for members, whether they're on my side or the other side, to have pockets of disadvantage. Perhaps my pockets, in areas of Western Sydney, are just a bit larger. These are matters that really go to the heart and soul of a community. Through this bill we are going to marginalise those least likely to be able to assist themselves without support-those who are suffering from mental health issues, those who are suffering from domestic violence, as I've mentioned, and the many, many age and disability support pensioners that my community supports. The Senate inquiry into the bill heard overwhelming evidence that rental arrears is not the main cause for evictions from social housing and that homelessness in Australia cannot be tackled without assessing the issues of mental health, domestic violence and the lack of affordable housing. The Joint Committee on Human Rights noted that this bill appears to disproportionately negatively impact women, people with disability and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. I think that captures much of what I said earlier about the way I see this being applied in my electorate to those at the sharp end of this Liberal government legislation. A Labor government will tackle the holistic aspects of homelessness and ensure that the causes of homelessness and housing insecurity are addressed-not just issues around rental arrears but the underpinning issues-so that we can help people effectively break these bonds which link them to disadvantage.  We've got to actually listen to real people. There is no doubt some whiz-bang person, whether a consultant or otherwise, within the department thought, 'This is a good way that the government can retrieve a bit of revenue. It sounds really good out there in the public domain. We're going to get tough on social welfare. We're going to get tough on those who use and rely on social housing.' But, realistically, this is not what a government should be doing. A government should not have as its central aspect a signature policy that demeans the most vulnerable in the community, but that's what's occurring with this legislation. We'll be moving amendments to ensure there are appropriate safeguards to protect tenants and ensure the scheme does not place them in undue financial hardship. We see ourselves as the alternative government, and as the alternative government we have a responsibility to help lift people out of social welfare dependency. We need to help people to be able to raise a family. We need to be able to help people overcome issues of mental health. All these things go to what this bill strikes down. I don't know what credible research the government want to pin this on. They're not going to make an arm or a leg that's going to affect the fiscal outlook of the country. This is not going to change the fact that they're going to rush to bring down the budget a month early next year so they can work out where they're going to throw the cash before the next election. Clearly they're not going to throw anything to assist people at the margins and the people that this bill is designed to negatively impact. This is legislation that is retrograde for the parliament. It's certainly retrograde for anyone who wants to hold their head up and say they're a parliamentarian representing a community. Professor Richard Holden, a professor of economics at the University of New South Wales, referring to the last budget, said that the biggest disappointment … of all was the absence of any measure whatsoever to address negative gearing and CGT exemptions for rental properties. This mob opposite want to fudge around and say they're doing something about housing affordability, so they just pick on the most marginal but don't do anything about the root cause of issues affecting housing affordability or, in particular, in this instance, homelessness. This is something that they should hang their heads in shame about. We have a real privilege in this place to do things for the benefit of the community. This is a piece of legislation that does the opposite.",86
171,Ms CLAYDON,NOES," I rise to also contribute to the debate on this Social Services Legislation Amendment (Housing Affordability) Bill. It will come as no surprise to anyone that this legislation has absolutely nothing to do with housing affordability, despite what the government might have named it. The bill before us today is a continuation of this government's policy of inaction and complete reckless disregard when it comes to housing policy. It does nothing to address the single greatest issue facing lowerand middle-income Australiansthat is, rent is too expensive and purchase is simply out of the question for too many. Not a single affordable home will be built or designed as a result of this legislation. Not a single young Australian will find it easier to compete against investors to buy their first home. Not a single person will see a reduction to their sky-high rents. Worse, Labor is very concerned that some of these provisions may only serve to drive already vulnerable social housing tenants deeper into poverty. Housing affordability remains a diabolical problem for millions of Australians. While there is some correction underway in Sydney and Melbourne, there are many parts of the country where housing prices have risen more than 50 per cent in recent years while wages are barely keeping up with inflation. This is inflicting real pain. In fact, ACOSS's 2018 Poverty in Australia report showed that three million Australians are living in poverty, largely as a result of housing costs. Meanwhile, the National Debt Helpline is on track to receive a record number of calls this year, particularly from older Australians who are struggling to meet their mortgage or rent payments. Older women are especially vulnerable, with a 31 per cent spike in homelessness in this cohort between the 2011 and 2016 census. This is absolutely appalling and totally unacceptable. If there is one area that demonstrates how out of touch, how heartless and how utterly beholden this Liberal government is to vested interests, it is housing policy. Regardless of who has been the Prime Minister, this Liberal government has consistently ignored the dire plight of millions of Australians struggling to pay their rent or get a foothold in the housing market. Housing affordability remains a national crisis that is driving people deeper and deeper into despair, and yet this government has spent the last five years doing nothing. It has failed to invest in affordable housing. It has abolished the position of housing minister. It has shut down the National Housing Supply Council. It discontinued the National Rental Affordability Scheme and it has doubled down on the absurd situation we have in Australia where property investors get more subsidies to buy their fifth, sixth or seventh property than young Australians get to buy their first home. Not only that but the Australian taxpayer is footing the bill for these tax concessions, to the tune of more than $10 billion a year. This is more than we are spending on universities or child care. But this government has utterly  refused to act on these blatantly unfair, expensive and market-distorting tax concessions. Mr Deputy Speaker Goodenough, I seek leave to continue my remarks later. Leave granted; debate adjourned. NA Days and Hours of Meeting  program of sittings for 2019. Copies of the program have been placed on the table. I ask leave of the House to move that the program be agreed to. Leave granted.  That the program of sittings for 2019 be agreed to. Firstly, I'm sure members will be pleased to have the schedule in good time before the end of the year in order to allow them to plan their 2019 arrangements around their work and family commitments. Some of the highlights of the schedule-it's quite unexceptional in terms of the schedule planning-include 17 sitting weeks of the House of Representatives, which would be about the average. In fact, under the former Leader of the House, we sat for 16 weeks in one of the years he put up during the 43rd Parliament.",88
172,Mr Albanese,BUSINESS,Are you bagging me?  you the table.,89
173,Unknown,BUSINESS,"Opposition members interjecting about the average, and they are evenly spread between the first half of the year and the second half of the year. We will begin sitting again on 12 February, and the budget will be on 2 April, and there will be a normal period of about four or five weeks before the budget, in which time the Treasurer will prepare the first surplus budget since the last coalition government. Obviously, there's an election next year, in 2019, due by midyear. Whoever wins the election-which we hope will be the coalition!-will probably return in the second half of the year with a different sitting schedule, but obviously we are required to put a whole year of proposed parliamentary sittings to the parliament. I commend the sitting schedule to the House.",89
174,Mr BURKE,BUSINESS," Can I first of all explain what's in front of us. This year, before the budget, between the houses of parliament, there were five weeks on the sitting schedule before we got to budget week. Last year, there were five weeks of parliamentary sittings before we got to the budget. The year before that, we had-guess how many weeks?-five weeks of sittings before we got to the budget. In 2015-quite an exceptional year-we had five weeks of sittings before we got to the budget. In 2014, we had five weeks. In 2013, we actually had six weeks. In the sitting schedule that has just been tabled before the parliament, there will be a fortnight of sittings before the budget. In that fortnight we don't even sit on one of the Mondays. I'm going to quote someone who only last week was described by the Treasurer as a legend: … what strikes me is that a government that does not have an agenda does not need to sit … Unfortunately, the sitting pattern gives away what Australians know about this government, which is that it does not have a plan for the future and it does not have an agenda … Why doesn't it have to sit? There are two reasons. Firstly, it does not have a plan for the future for the Australian people. Secondly, it cannot rely on its numbers in the House to pass legislation to win a procedural vote. Be in no doubt: this is a surrender from this government. This is a decision from this government. The last thing they want to do is govern. So they have decided, having already explained pretty much that budget week will be the final week before we go to the polls, that there will be a total of 10 days of parliament sitting before the next election. They've already been in a situation, from the first day that this parliament sat this week, where they had to vote for things that they don't believe in in order to avoid the humiliation of the fact that what began this term, with the Leader of the House boasting about it being a strong working majority, had become a hopeless, dwindling minority. That is all they've become. The Leader of the House knows it and those opposite know it. What's in front of us now is the surrender document. They've decided they don't want to risk what democracy might think of this government. They don't want to risk the fact that they have 73 votes on the floor and they don't know whether or not they have a capacity to govern. So, with that in mind, I move the following amendment: That the following words be added""and the following additional meetings of the House are specified:  Tuesday, 5 March 2019; Wednesday, 6 March 2019; Thursday, 7 March 2019; Tuesday, 12 March 2019; Wednesday, 13 March 2019; and Thursday, 14 March 2019."" By virtue of those extra dates being added to the calendar, we will get two extra sitting weeks. It will still be shorter than it has previously been, because of the budget being early, but it will be four sitting weeks instead of just a fortnight of sittings. I know it will hurt the government if parliament has to sit, because the Prime Minister won't be able to have his face on the outside of a bus that he's not inside. He won't be able to do that incredibly fair dinkum, dinky-di, trueblue campaigning that is clearly working so well for him! What will happen is that the legislature will be allowed to legislate. We'll be able to turn up and do our jobs here in the parliament. An additional two weeks of sitting simply brings us into the ordinary parliamentary calendar. I love the way the Leader of the House was explaining how 'none of this was anything unusual'. He said: 'Look, you just put the dividing line between the second half of the year and the first half of the year, packing as many weeks as possible into the second half of the year, when parliament will have been dissolved. Then, bingo, you've suddenly got a first half of the year, because of an election, that will have only sat for three weeks.'",89
175,Mr Howarth,BUSINESS,"Except that's not accurate. If you look at it, they're in the first half as well.",90
176,Mr BURKE,BUSINESS,"The concept of an interjection is meant to be that it helps. To the crossbench, because this will come to a vote: we have an attempt by the government to render the crossbench as irrelevant as possible. We have a calculated attempt by the government to try to make sure that they eliminate the risk of a majority forming against them. They know already that it's not going to be a problem for confidence and supply-enough people have given them that guarantee. What the parliament will be able to do, though, is debate issues. What the parliament will be able to do is debate legislation. What the parliament will be able to do is deal with amendments on a series of issues that this government simply want to run and hide from. Take, for example, what they have done with live animal exports. It is legislation that, the moment they thought they might not win on the floor of the parliament, even though we'd been told the penalties legislation was urgent, all of a sudden, when there was a risk of it being amended on the floor, it disappeared, never to be seen again, just existing on the Notice Paper and nowhere else at all. That won't be the only issue where this government are wanting to run and hide. What's in front of us now will be an amendment that will very simply allow next year, because the budget is early, for us sit one week fewer than we ordinarily do. But for anyone to claim that in the period from the beginning of the year to 2 April we can only turn up for a fortnightMs Claydon: It's not even a full fortnight!",90
177,Mr BURKE,BUSINESS,"It's not even a full fortnight; it's seven days. It's a government running and hiding. So I simply put to the House: everyone will have different views on what we do on these additional sitting days, but we should turn up. It's a democratically elected parliament. Our electorates voted for us to be here and to represent them. The fact that the numbers on the floor have become inconvenient for the government doesn't change our democratically elected duty. I commend the amendment. For those people who are the reason that the government is suddenly wanting to hide from the parliament, the outcome of this amendment will rest on their capacity to make the case for their electorates and their capacity to use the fact that we are now in a hung parliament. I commend it to the House.",90
178,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,BUSINESS, Is the amendment seconded?,90
179,Mr ALBANESE,BUSINESS," I am very pleased to second this amendment and to oppose what is the biggest try-on by a member of the coalition that we've seen with regard to a sitting calendar since the former member for Mackellar misread the sitting calendar and argued at this despatch box that parliament was sitting on Christmas Day, according to the schedule-a legendary performance! The coalition admired that contribution so much that it led them to make the member for Mackellar the Speaker in the government-and didn't that work out well for them! Well, we have another legend, according to the Treasurer: the Leader of the House, who has put forward this quite extraordinary and bold timetable. What this timetable has is that parliament will get up here on 6 December, next Thursday. Then there's a seven-day sitting. By the way, the Senate is not sitting on four of those days. They are for the estimates processes. So there are three days for the Senate to deal with legislation. Then we have the budget week. Then the Prime Minister, whoever it is at that time-because there's still time to change your mind,  folks; there's still time for one more coup-will go to Yarralumla to request an election on 11 May or 18 May, which are the only two dates now that the Prime Minister has effectively announced the budget on 2 April. That means he's announced the election date in May, as well. So there will be 10 sitting days between now, when parliament gets up next Thursday, and July or whenever the parliament comes back, which is most likely to actually be August. So we're talking about 10 sitting days in eight months. That is what they're proposing here. For the Senate, they're proposing six sitting days in eight months. That's what's before this parliament here. We worry about a government that has lost its way and doesn't have an agenda before the parliament. But-for goodness' sake!-this is just lazy. It is opportunistic. But it's something a little bit more serious than that, too, because it is contemptuous of the democratic will of the people. It's contemptuous of this parliament as an institution. It is contemptuous of the rights of members of this House of Representatives and of senators to actually do the jobs that they are elected to do. And would we just go along with a timetable such as this? Clearly, this is a government that is terrified of the parliament that it's supposed to preside over. What we know is that it's not just that they're scared of us on this side of the chamber and of the crossbenches; they're absolutely terrified of each other. They know that in the next fortnight as well, we'll have more articles about whether there will be another Deputy Prime Minister, because the National Party are still engaging in the hunt of Michael MCCormack by the former Deputy Prime Minister, Barnaby Joyce. And we know the problem that they have, really, is that when the parliament meets the party room meets, and that's what they want to avoid. It isn't too late for the government to change leaders. Remember that the current Prime Minister-according to the Prime Minister-twice-removed, the member for Warringah-got there with just a handful of votes, five votes, in the caucus. He wasn't supported by the Liberal Party. He wasn't the preferred leader. He wasn't even the second-preferred leader, who was the member for Dickson. He was not even the third-preferred leader, who was the member for Curtin. He was the fourth choice as the leader of the Liberal Party. No wonder they're worried about having party room meetings. That's their problem. But the problem for the Australian people is that the government are proposing here to come back late. I've put out a few parliamentary sitting schedules in my time. I did it six times. What we normally do is look for when Australia Day is. Australia Day this coming year, of course, is on a weekend. We would normally come back on the Tuesday after Australia Day. That's the normal process. But those opposite are not doing that. They're leaving it until 12 February, and because the Manager of Opposition Business is a generous fellow we let them have that week so they get all the Christmas cheer and they get extra time with each other. Quite frankly, the only thing in favour of this schedule is we don't have to see them. We come back to sit on 12 February but for just two weeks. So what we're saying is to have two extra weeks with just three sitting days in each of those weeks, because there are public holidays on the Mondays. So there are six extra sitting days to hold the executive to account, and that is appropriate because that's the job of the elected representatives. The member for Wentworth changed from being the Prime Minister to being the honourable member who was sworn in just yesterday. It seems like a long time ago; I'm sure it seems longer for those opposite. And today there's another new crossbencher up there as well. So, because of that, parliament suddenly becomes too hard and we won't meet. Well, that's not the way that it works. You have to deal with the parliament that the Australian people give you. We dealt with the parliament, and I, as the Leader of the House, could rely on 70 votes out of 150. But we worked in a mature and cooperative way with the crossbenchers and we worked as well with many of those opposite in the coalition. We actually had policy debates in the national interest and we ensured that we were able to get through a legislative agenda in that parliament that included the National Disability Insurance Scheme, that included climate change action, that included the Gonski education reforms and that included rewriting the shipping policies. The fact is that we were able to deal with the parliament that the people of Australia elected. The problem for those opposite isn't just that they can't deal with the parliament that the Australian people elected they also can't deal with the caucus that the Australian people gave them. That's the real problem here; their internals. But they're terrified by the externals in terms of the parliament that they can't deal with. So parliament should sit for two weeks extra-three days in each week. It's a reasonable proposition, and if the government is smart they'll actually roll over on this and support it.",90
180,Mr BANDT,BUSINESS," When the Liberals couldn't decide who they wanted to be the Prime Minister they shut the parliament down for six hours. Now that they've decided who he is they're going to shut it down for six months! They don't want the capacity for him to be questioned in here. I have been through a parliament where that government did not have the majority. What can happen in that sort of parliament is that you get things done that the Australian people want. And when the government has goodwill, it will work with the crossbenchers to make that parliament effective. When we had the minority  government in 2010, we sat for the full allocation of sitting weeks and we got things done. Yes, it was the case that during that time there were some motions and proposals that got put through the parliament that didn't necessarily have the government's support at the beginning. But they got there because people across the political spectrum worked together. That's what happened. If you have goodwill and if you have the interests of the people at heart you can make a minority government work. But this is a calendar from a government that wants to hide-that wants to hide as much as possible between now and the next election. They've brought on an early budget; it's their right to do that. But it is not their right to say that everyone else who sits here in this parliament, representing people from across Australia, has no capacity to hold the government to account just because the government wants to have an early budget because they want to go to an election at the time of their own choosing. One of the things that's particularly egregious about this sitting calendar is what it means for the role of the Senate. I understand why the government is scared of the Senate. We've already seen, on the first day back in this parliament, the Senate expressing its will that we need a national integrity commission-a national commission against corruption-bringing that down to the House and the House supporting that. That's because the Senate is a place that has a greater diversity of opinion in it, probably, than the House of Representatives does because of the different electoral systems. And there are many more things that the Senate could do to hold this government to account-just like it did with the national ICAC and just like it did with the royal commission into the banks. I suspect there is a reason that the government is basically saying that the Senate will only sit for six days next year before we go to an election. And then after the election is called we may not resume until August, meaning that the Senate in this country will only sit for six days in the first six months of next year. That is an outrageous attempt to hide from accountability. One of the purposes of the Senate is to be a house of review, and the Senate is there to hold the government to account, just as the opposition and the crossbenchers have the right to do here. The Senate is there to scrutinise what the government does and, increasingly, the Senate is standing up to this government. The answer is not to cancel the Senate sittings; the answer is to come up with better legislation. The answer is to come up with a climate policy. The answer is to say, 'We will go ahead with an integrity commission.' But to simply say, 'We are not going to allow the Senate to sit for more than six days before the election next year,' is outrageous. When most people in this country realise that this government is attempting to hide from scrutiny, this is going to come back to bite the government at the election. The Senate and the House have voted, as we did yesterday, to say trust in government and trust in politicians is at an all-time low, which is one of the reasons why we need a national integrity commission. The message from that should be loud and clear: people do not want governments hiding from accountability; people want governments to be held to account for the decisions that they make. So it would actually be in the government's interests, if they have any interest at all in improving their own electoral stocks-I hope they don't, but if they do-for them to say: 'Yes, we're quite happy to have the Senate sit the usual allocation of weeks. We're quite happy to be held to account by the opposition and the crossbenchers.' You would imagine the government would say: 'We've got a wonderful program. Let's bring it to parliament to test it.' But, no. This is the most cowardly calendar I have seen. This is a calendar written by cowards. This is a calendar that is attempting to hide the government from the scrutiny of the crossbench, the scrutiny of the Senate. I support the amendment to have the House and the Senate sitting for those additional weeks so that before we go to an election we don't have a situation where the government just drops a budget on us and we have no time to scrutinise it, and so we're asked to take them on trust. No. No. We should have the capacity, before the government are put to the test of the Australian people, which is likely to be in May-in May-to scrutinise them. The Senate should have the right to sit for more than six days before May to be able to hold this government to account and to make its case. The House of Representatives should have the capacity to sit for-it will sit for less than three full weeks before the government will call an election. To go to an election next year with a parliament, and this House of Representatives, having sat for fewer than 10 days-no; one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. It is 10 days. That is all the scrutiny that we're going to be able to put on them in here before an election. It speaks volumes about the cowardice of this government and it's why the amendment should be supported.",91

182,Ms CLAYDON,BILLS," As I was saying, this is a government that has utterly refused to act on blatantly unfair, expensive, market-distorting tax concessions. Again and again those opposite back in wealthy property investors over the hundreds of thousands of Australians who just want to be able to buy their own home, and, when backed into a corner, they offer ridiculous suggestions to young Australians, like: 'Go get rich parents,' or, 'Move to the country.' Then, of course, they peddle nonsense about Labor's plan to rein in those expensive tax concessions. They use modelling that does not reflect our policy at all. They say that our policy will drive house prices down. Then they say it will send them sky-high. Sometimes they even say both things in the same interview! But, whatever they're saying, you can be sure they have the best interests of property developers and wealthy investors front of mind. Labor understands this government has utterly failed lowand middle-income Australians, especially young Australians, when it comes to housing affordability. We have been listening to stakeholders and communities across Australia about what needs to happen. One of the lead organisations in this push has been Compass Housing Services, a non-government, community organisation based in my home city of Newcastle. Compass are world leaders in their field, so much so that they were the only Australian community housing organisation to take part in the global United Nations Habitat III conference in Quito, Ecuador. I congratulate Compass and the coalition of housing and social service organisations that have been actively campaigning for a national housing strategy. Labor understand that we have a deep responsibility to address these issues, should we have the privilege of forming government. We recognise that safe and affordable housing is the foundation for a cohesive, productive and fair society. That's why housing will be a central feature not just of our housing policy but also of our infrastructure policy, our cities policy and our population policies. We've already made some fantastic announcements. If elected, a Labor government would: (1) reform negative gearing and capital gains tax concessions; (2) limit direct borrowing by self-managed superannuation funds; (3) facilitate a COAG process to introduce a uniform vacant property tax across all major cities; (4) increase foreign investment fees and penalties; (5) establish a bond aggregator to increase investment in affordable housing; (6) develop and implement, through the Council of Australian Governments, a national plan to reduce homelessness; and (7) re-establish the National Housing Supply Council and reinstate a minister for housing. Lastly, we would provide an $88 million injection  over two years for a new Safe Housing Fund to increase transitional housing options for women and children escaping domestic and family violence, young people exiting out-of-home care and older women on low incomes who are at risk of homelessness. And that is just the beginning. There will be more announcements in this critical policy area as we get closer to next year's election. I can assure you Labor understands that there is no more fundamental obligation for governments than to ensure that everyone has a roof over their head. I'd like to now consider some of the details of the bill before us today. As I've already mentioned, the bill doesn't go anywhere near doing the things that need to be done to address the dire housing affordability problems. Indeed, the changes that are being proposed are largely technical amendments which have absolutely nothing to do with delivering housing affordability. The first measure in this bill creates the Automatic Rent Deduction Scheme, which gives states and territories the option of automatically deducting an amount from social housing tenants' income support payments for rent and utilities. It also allows the inclusion of an amount of money for property damage. Currently, there is a voluntary scheme in place in which social housing tenants on income support have the option to ask the Department of Human Services to transfer some of their fortnightly pay directly to the housing provider for rent and some bills. It should be noted that the majority of social housing tenants are able to manage their budgets and keep their rent up to date. This is an important point because, in fact, 90 per cent of social housing tenants have absolutely no problems meeting their obligations and the rental collection rate for public and community housing is well over 99 per cent. Having said that, Labor accepts that in principle there may be a place for automatic rent deduction. We understand there may be situations where such a system would have value-for example, if tenants are being pressured to give up their rent money to support people with drug or alcohol habits somewhere else. We realise there are times when compulsory deductions may make the difference in avoiding homelessness. Indeed, when we were in government we introduced a bill that would allow for the automatic rent deductions in response to recommendations in The road home homelessness white paper. At the time, the Liberals opposed this bill, saying it would 'increase housing stress and financial hardship', and now they've brought to the parliament this bill which is so much harsher. But there are some important differences between what the Morrison government wants to do and what Labor had proposed in the past. Critically, the Liberals' bill contains none of the safeguards that would protect vulnerable social housing clients. Labor's legislation would only have applied to tenants who had arrears of more than four weeks and only after there had been a reasonable attempt to recover the money. There was also a time limit of 12 months that the scheme would be maintained after the arrears were paid off. Also, tenants needed to be informed before changes were made to the amount of their pay that would be withheld. These are just some of the fundamental differences between Labor's approach and that of the government. We were so concerned about the impact this would have on vulnerable Australians that we referred the bill to the Senate for an inquiry. The inquiry heard from a number of witnesses that these provisions were unnecessarily broad. Senators were told that rental arrears are much more likely to cause homelessness and more complex issues like mental illness, substance abuse and family violence. The Chairperson of the National Social Security Rights Network, Genevieve Bolton, told the committee: … we don't think that the proposed bill will meet its stated objectives, and we think it's a disproportionate response. It doesn't address some of the critical causes of homelessness. On a similar note, Mr Roland Manderson, Deputy Director of Anglicare Australia, explained that the automatic rental deduction scheme has a number of serious flaws and said it would only serve to 'generate other problems for tenants across the board'. Labor is persuaded by the arguments of stakeholders that there must be safeguards and limitations to the scheme. We want it limited to those in arrears and at risk of homelessness. We want deductions capped and we want a time limit on how long the scheme can apply. We want a provision that requires lessors to let tenants know of any changes to how much will be taken out. We would like to see changes such that only money for rent and utilities is deducted. We also agree there should be a requirement for the lessor to let the tenant know if any change is made to the amount deducted. Some of these issues are covered in the government's amendments, but Labor wants to see all of these protections guaranteed. I also mentioned earlier that the bill seeks to make changes to the National Rental Affordability Scheme. NRAS, of course, was a fantastic initiative of the former Labor government. It was the first direct supply-side financial incentive scheme for the supply of new affordable rental housing. NRAS has provided 38,000 new homes and was on track to deliver 50,000. Regretfully, it was capped in the coalition's first budget. Labor would have continued and expanded NRAS. The changes in these bills don't do that; in fact, they are largely technical.  They give authority for the transfer of an NRAS allocation from one property to another in specific circumstances. They also allow the Secretary of the Department of Social Services to make variations on the conditions attached to the incentive allocations. They allow flexibility on how maximum vacancy periods are prescribed, and they remove ambiguity on how below-market rents are calculated in any one year. Of course, all of this is just tinkering around the edges and doesn't do anything to lighten the load for vulnerable Australians. Having said that, Labor will support the changes to the NRAS, but, as I mentioned earlier, none of this will help Australians who are being forced to take one or even two or three jobs just to keep a roof over their heads. In short, the legislation before us today does nothing to address the core issue of housing affordability. Like so many times before, this is a missed opportunity by the government. Only Labor will deliver on housing affordability in this country.",94
183,Ms MCBRIDE,BILLS," I rise today to speak on the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Housing Affordability) Bill and to support the amendment moved by the member for Barton. The cost of housing is making life hard for so many Australians-young people, low-income families and older women. According to a recent Grattan Institute report, house prices took off in the mid-1990s. Average house prices have increased from around two to three times the average disposable incomes in the eighties and early nineties to about five times the average disposable income more recently. This means median home prices have increased from four to five times the median incomes in the early 1990s to more than seven times the median income today. In Sydney, not far from my electorate on the New South Wales Central Coast, it's more than eight times the median income. In a wealthy country like Australia, why are one-in-three single women over 60 living in poverty, many at risk of homelessness? Why is a young mother I met at her first appointment with a financial counsellor after leaving a violent relationship struggling to find $460 a week to keep her rental so her three children have a roof over their heads? Why is the grandmother I met in Bateau Bay, while on a surgery waiting list, housing her adult son in her garage because his partner died and he is no longer on the priority housing list? Why are some high-school students in my electorate living in refuges or struggling to get by in the private rental market while trying to finish high school? If the government were serious about housing affordability and homelessness it would take action to address some of the causes of homelessness, particularly to improve the provision of services for mental health in the regions, to provide more support for women leaving family violence and to make sure that vulnerable Australians at risk of homelessness have safe, affordable housing. Why is it that a single-pensioner household faces spending up to 94 per cent of income on rent? This extreme level of housing stress is exacerbated by other pressures, such as increased healthcare costs, and must be urgently addressed. I'll turn to the actual substance of the bill. What does this bill actually do to address homelessness? This bill imposes an Automatic Rent Deduction Scheme on social housing tenants and makes some changes to the administration of the National Rental Affordability Scheme. Labor referred this bill to a Senate inquiry to ensure it was given proper scrutiny. Labor has listened to the concerns raised by the housing and community sector. We know that the majority of social housing tenants manage their budgets and pay their rent on time. Evidence presented to the inquiry showed that 90 per cent of tenants meet their obligations. However, a form of automatic rent deduction may be appropriate to protect some social housing tenants who are genuinely facing a significant risk of homelessness in particular situations. Labor will move amendments in the Senate to put safeguards in place to protect tenants and ensure that the scheme does not place them under financial hardship. At the moment, some social housing tenants who are also income support recipients can choose to have the Department of Human Services withhold a portion of their fortnightly payment and pay it directly to their housing provider to cover rent and some bills, like power bills. In this rent deduction scheme, participation is voluntary, and participants can leave the scheme whenever they choose. Around 86 per cent of the approximately 400,000 public and social housing tenants currently use the voluntary rent reduction scheme. This bill would introduce an Automatic Rent Deduction Scheme. Under the Automatic Rent Deduction Scheme, everyone who receives an income support payment and/or family tax benefit and lives in either public housing or community housing could have part of their payment withheld by Centrelink and paid directly to the housing provider. Like the voluntary scheme, this amount could cover both rent and some bills, like power bills. It would be up to each state and territory to decide whether they wanted to be part of the automatic rent reduction scheme and, if so, how it would apply. Victoria and the ACT have said they will not participate in an automatic rent reduction scheme. When Labor was in government, we introduced a Social Security Legislation Amendment (Public Housing Tenants' Support) Bill 2013, which would have introduced an automatic rent reduction scheme. We did this to act  on a recommendation from the housing and homelessness white paper The road home. The Liberals opposed the bill. At the time, the shadow minister, the member for Menzies, claimed that it would increase housing stress and financial hardship. Yet they have now introduced a scheme that is much harsher than the one that Labor proposed. Let's look at some of the differences. The changes in the public housing tenants' support bill would have only applied to tenants who were in rental arrears and at risk of homelessness, once other reasonable recovery action had been taken. The changes in this bill could potentially impact all tenants of public housing and community housing, including age pensioners, disability support pensioners and those with carer payments. Responsible people managing their own affairs and paying their rent for years could be caught up in these changes. The amount deducted in the public housing tenants' support bill was able to be varied in accordance with changes in rental and utility amounts, provided the tenant was notified. This bill does not require that the tenant be notified of these changes. This bill allows for the deduction to include an amount to compensate landlords for property damage, which could be as a result of domestic and family violence. Labor's bill limited deductions to cover only an amount for rent and utilities, to protect people from being forced to pay for damage caused by others. Labor has always said that most income support recipients are capable of managing their own finances. In fact, the rental collection rate for public and social housing in the five years to 2015-16 was over 99 per cent. Labor will move amendments in the Senate to ensure automatic deductions only occur when people are in arrears and at risk of homelessness. We will move an amendment to cap the maximum deduction to prevent the scheme forcing people into housing stress and to make sure people have money to meet other needs and pay other bills. Labor will move amendments to require that compulsory deductions can only be made for rent and utilities and not for property damage. As I mentioned earlier, this is to protect people from being held unfairly responsible for other people's actions. The Labor amendments will also prevent deductions being taken from the discretionary portion of an income managed payment. Labor amendments would require social housing landlords to inform the tenant of any changes in the amount to be deducted from their payment. The amendments will also ensure that, if a tenant's payment is suspended, the accrued rent cannot be deducted when the payment resumes, potentially leaving people with nothing to live on. Without significant changes to the Automatic Rent Deduction Scheme, Labor will not be able to support this part of the bill in the Senate. Labor has concerns about the interactions of the Automatic Rent Deduction Scheme with deductions being made from income support payments through Centrepay, particularly payments for household goods under consumer leases with businesses such as Radio Rentals. Consumer leases cost low-income earners up to eight times the retail price of consumer goods. The Senate passed a Labor private senator's bill in the 44th parliament to exclude consumer leases as an eligible service reason for the purposes of Centrepay third-party payment system. While Centrepay is closed to payday lenders, it remains open to consumer leasing businesses which continue to inflict financial hardship on low-income earners. Consumer leases are just as damaging to vulnerable low-income earners as payday loans. Labor therefore remains committed to excluding consumer leasing as an eligible service reason for Centrepay. Before touching on the National Rental Affordability Scheme, I want to refer back to my community. In this recent report, regional New South Wales remains the least affordable regional area studied in Australia in terms of the rental affordability index, with households facing rents of sometimes upwards of 27 per cent of income. Let me reiterate that rental arrears are not the main cause of social housing evictions and that homelessness in Australia cannot be addressed without addressing issues of mental health, domestic and family violence and lack of affordable housing. A Shorten Labor government will take a whole-of-government approach to the issue of homelessness, to ensure that all causes of homelessness, housing insecurity and housing stress are addressed, not just the rental arrears of a small number of social housing tenants. The National Rental Affordability Scheme is a Labor program, and Labor will not oppose changes to the scheme that help the achievement of the scheme's objective of increasing and maintaining the supply of affordable rental dwellings and reduced rental costs for lowand moderate-income households. What is of concern is the capping of this scheme by this government. Labor's original scheme provided for 50,000 new, affordable rental dwellings to be built. Given the strong interest in the scheme, Labor undertook to extend the scheme by a further 35,000 dwellings, to provide a total of 85,000 dwellings. But in the 2014-15 budget the Abbott government announced that the NRAS would be capped at 38,000 dwellings. That decision has been widely criticised by housing sector stakeholders, including the Property Council of Australia, the Housing Industry Association, the Urban Development Institute, Homelessness  Australia, National Shelter, Mission Australia, ACOSS, the Federation of Community Housing Associations, Anglicare, the St Vincent de Paul Society and many others. This short-sighted decision, along with the government's failure to bridge the funding gap, has severely curtailed the supply of affordable rental housing. As I mentioned earlier, in regional New South Wales, where my electorate of Dobell is situated, upwards of a third of households are in extreme housing stress, according to the Rental Affordability Index. Housing policy experts are unanimous that bridging the funding gap is essential to improving housing affordability and securing better housing options for all Australians. Labor will support changes to the NRAS that will encourage approved participants to retain their dwelling in the scheme, which will minimise the loss of dwellings to the scheme. While we support changes contained in the bill to ensure rents for NRAS dwellings are at all times at least 20 per cent below the market rent valuation for the dwellings, Labor believe there needs to be additional flexibility to allow unintentional rent overcharges to be refunded or credited to a tenant in a timely manner. The alternative is for approved participants and investors to face penalties in the form of reduced incentive payments for unintended minor technical breaches of the rental charge provisions which could easily be remedied by a timely refund or credit to the tenant. Labor therefore welcomes the proposed amendments by the government following the Senate inquiry. The amendments are consistent with recommendations in Labor senators' dissenting report. They include an amendment that will permit the National Rental Affordability Scheme Regulations 2008 to include a power for the Secretary of the Department of Social Services to grant dispensation from the 20-per-cent-at-all-times rule to approved participants where there has been an unintentional overcharging of rent and the tenant has been compensated for the error. In concluding, I would like to turn once again to my community on the New South Wales Central Coast, which is like many other communities in regional Australia. In my community there is acute housing stress, which is exacerbated by other pressures, including increased healthcare costs and transport. It is of extreme concern to me for communities like mine across Australia. I refer to my time working in mental health units at Wyong Hospital, the public hospital in the community in my electorate of Dobell. I worked in those mental health units for almost 10 years. It was particularly distressing when someone was well and ready to make the transition back into the community. Sometimes the decision of multidisciplinary teams would be that, yes, they would be accepted into a community mental health team, but those community teams were stretched. There wasn't capacity within the teams to be able to meet properly the needs of these people who had faced mental health problems and a mental health crisis and were now moving back into the community. One of those particular stressors was housing. I recall coming out of a team meeting and a patient review. The social worker gave a phone book to a patient who was about to be discharged and said, 'You now have to find yourself a place to live.' In a competitive rental market in a regional community, how is somebody who is being discharged from a mental health unit in a public hospital meant to secure themselves a place to live, with a phone book and a public phone? This bill is not addressing the cause. It is not looking at how people find themselves homeless and at the things that government can and should do, and this should be done urgently. There shouldn't be a situation in a wealthy country like Australia where one in four single women over 60 are finding themselves in poverty and at risk of homelessness. There shouldn't be the situation in Australia today where a person being discharged from a mental health unit is given a phone book and told to use a phone on the ward to try to find themselves a place to live. In a wealthy country like Australia, there should be provisions, safety nets and safeguards such that no vulnerable person finds themselves in this extreme housing stress or at risk of homelessness. I call on the government to urgently act on this and to look at the cause, to look at where housing and homelessness problems stem from and the crisis that exists in Australia today, particularly in regional and remote Australia. The government must act. The government needs to act urgently to properly address this housing and homelessness crisis in Australia today.",96
184,Mr BANDT,BILLS," Housing in Australia is cooked. It is seriously messed up. If you go back to the 1990s, the average house price was six times an average young person's income. Fast forward about 20 years and the average house price is 12 times the average young person's income. There are over a million households in Australia that are paying more for housing than they can afford. That is why our personal debt and household debt in Australia is going up and up. People just can't afford to buy a house; they are going into huge debt just to make ends meet. Two hundred and sixty-one people are turned away from homelessness services every day. In my home state of Victoria, where we've got public housing that is in many instances poorly maintained and people are living in conditions that are really substandard, there are 82,000 people on the waiting list for public housing. Why? It's  because, over time, governments have lost sight of one basic fact: housing is a human right. Everyone, especially in a wealthy country like Australia, should be able to have a roof over their head and a stable home at a price they can afford. But, instead, what we've done in this country is treat housing like a stock market. We've set up rules, including rules that this parliament has passed, that say that, if you've already got a house and you want to get some additional houses, the government will actually give you a tax break for it. So what that means is we've got people who have already got a house fronting up to auctions to buy another house as an investment property. They can bid and bid the price up and out of reach of a first home buyer because they know that, when they rent it out, if they make a loss they can write it off as a tax loss and then, when they sell the property in a few years time, they can claim a tax break on that. It costs the Australian government and the Australian taxpayer billions of dollars to do this. What is the effect of it? It just keeps putting up prices more and more. Meanwhile, if you decide, 'I'm just going to give up on the idea of owning my own home; I am just going to rent,' you have the situation at the moment where 97 per cent of rental properties are too expensive for a minimum wage earner. So, if you are working full-time and doing the right thing but you are on the minimum wage, you can almost forget being able to rent a property that might suit you in Australia at the moment. We are the third least affordable housing market in the world. That should shame us all. We've lost sight of the fact that housing is a human right. If we turned 261 people away from public schools every day because there weren't enough schools, there would be a national outcry. If there were a million households that couldn't afford to go and get health care because the public healthcare system was too expensive, there would be an outcry. It's time that we started thinking about housing the same way that we think about schools and education-namely, that it's a right that everyone has and it's what government is there for. If people, especially young people, can't find an affordable place to rent or buy then that is because we, as government, are failing in exactly the same way we'd be failing if we didn't build enough public schools or public hospitals for everyone. That's the situation we've got at the moment. A big part of the reason we're in that situation is that we just haven't built enough affordable houses for people to either rent or buy. My electorate, last time. I looked at the statistics, has got more public housing dwellings than any other electorate in the country. But most of those were built in the sixties. They're the big tower blocks that you see as you come into Melbourne on CityLink-you can see them when you hit the CityLink sticks. We haven't had a large-scale build of that equivalent size since then, and that is part of the reason that the public housing waiting list keeps blowing out. But it does another thing too. When you don't have a lot of affordable public housing rental at the bottom end of the market, that means more people are competing in the private market, and it helps push prices up. One thing we could do is invest in a 1960s-scale build of new public housing, which would help drive rents down, put more roofs over people's heads and go some way towards making Australia a place where housing is treated as a human right. We could build rent-controlled homes. We could introduce a system of rent control and rent capping. We have a situation at the moment where you're in a rental property, and you think, 'This is good; at least I can afford this,' and then you come to the end of the lease and up goes the rent for pretty much no reason at all. We could pass laws to cap it so that landlords could only increase rent to, say, CPI. That's something we could do that would go a long way to making housing more affordable. We could enshrine the ability for renters to have long-term leases. But, especially if we get rid of those unfair tax breaks I was talking about before, we'll actually save money for the Commonwealth budget to spend on other services and we will help make housing more affordable. We have got to do other things too, of course, like stop the pit of insecure work that so many young people are falling into, where a bank manager won't even consider writing you a mortgage because your work has been casual or short-term contracts, through no fault of your own-it's potentially been like that for several years. We can lift the minimum wage, because we have the appalling situation in Australia at the moment, where one in four people who are living in poverty are actually working full-time. Australia has become a place where doing the right thing is no longer enough. It should shame us that you can work full-time in Australia and still be in poverty. That is the case for one in four people who are in poverty. If we embarked on a large-scale build of public housing, if we got rid of the unfair tax breaks that favour people who have already got a home to the detriment of people who don't and if we passed laws that capped rent and gave people more security, we might start making housing a human right again. We would also need to give more money back to those housing services that are looking after those people and that are, at the moment, turning 261 people away every day. They wouldn't have to any more if we took some of the money that's currently going to the very wealthy in negative gearing tax breaks and instead put it into those services. The money is there. If we had the courage to stand up and say, 'Let's get rid of those unfair tax breaks for the very wealthy that favour people who have got two, three or four houses and that lock out young people,' then we could fund all of these  things. We don't have to go around looking for extra money; let's just take the money that we're currently throwing away on lining the pockets of the wealthy and use that to make sure that housing is a human right. Those things, sadly, aren't included in this bill. This government is taking a very narrow focus to what counts as housing affordability. I want to place on the record here an indication of the position that we're going to take when this bill comes to the Senate, where Senator Rachel Siewert will tackle this issue more broadly. We do have concerns-opposition, in fact-with respect to schedules 1 and 2 of the bill. The government's proposed amendments go some way to ameliorating that, but, even then, we have concerns with the amendment that provides that a tenant's agreement with the lessor that authorises the lessor to make a request under the Automatic Rent Deduction Scheme is not required to be in written form, for example. There are a number of other detailed concerns that we have with the bill, as well as some principal concerns with schedules 1 and 2. That won't stop us seeing this bill progress through this place, but those certainly are amendments that we will be pressing when the matter comes to the Senate. At the end of the day, we need a bit of a mind shift in this country. I hope, going into the next federal election, we can start to make housing a human rights issue. In our election campaigns, I hope we can start expecting our political parties to talk about housing the way we talk about public schools, the way that we talk about public hospitals. There's not a person in this country that either isn't locked out of the housing market themselves or has kids who are now only able to get into housing if they have significant help. And many parents just can't provide that, because they're not in a position to be able to do it. It is reaching crisis point. And the solution cannot be for Australians to keep getting further and further into debt, because our debt-to-income ratio is now getting to the two-to-one point, and it is at crisis point. People are just borrowing and borrowing and borrowing to try to stay alive because wages are flatlining, if not going backwards. If we want to avoid the calamity in this country of locking young people out of ever having a stable and affordable home, we've got to start treating housing as a human right. We've got to stand up and wind in some of those tax breaks. We've got to invest in public housing at a scale that we haven't done since the 1960s. If we did all of that, Australia wouldn't just be a wealthy country; it would be a country where we looked after everyone, no matter how much money they earned. It would be a country where we say that having an affordable roof over your head is something that we take seriously. At the moment the government's not doing that. We'll try to fix up this bill, but I fear that what we are really going to need is a change of government. We need a new government that will put affordable housing on a pedestal-not just tinker at the edges, but put it on a pedestal. If we can play some role in that, either here in the House or in the Senate, to make sure the next government treats housing as a human right, then we will go some way to making sure Australia remains an equal society and that egalitarianism in Australia is not put at risk. Mr JOSH WILSON (Fremantle) (19:22): In the time that remains, I want to say some pretty clear and simple things about the Social Services Legislation Amendment (Housing Affordability) Bill 2017. It's not impressive in itself. I don't think there's much evidence that it's going to do anything to address homelessness or help people at risk of homelessness in this country. It points to the glaring absence of policy and program action by the government in this space. We know that homelessness is a pressing issue in Australia. Despite the government spending a lot of time talking about how great the economy is, there are a lot of people who are not experiencing that, and that has got worse for people who are experiencing homelessness or facing circumstances of insecure housing. Earlier this year, Homelessness Australia pointed out that there are 195,000 Australian households waiting for social housing, there's a shortfall of nearly half a million affordable homes across Australia, and each year 300,000 Australians attend homelessness services for help. So there is a desperate need for action on this front, and yet the government bowls up with this bill that really is fundamentally punitive. It will make the ability to apply mandatory rental deductions available to state and territory jurisdictions, even though there's no real evidence that that will achieve anything. In material from the Parliamentary Library, which the Senate inquiry considered, it said that for the five years from 2011-12 to 2015-16 national rent collection rates averaged over 99 per cent across public housing, community housing, and state owned and managed Indigenous housing. Eighty-six per cent of all households that currently live in public and social housing are already making use of voluntary rent deductions. There's no great gap to be addressed in terms of the use of rent deductions where it's appropriate; there's no revenue problem as far as the return of rents from public, community and social housing; and rental arrears in themselves are not a significant cause of homelessness. All the evidence to the Senate inquiry and all the evidence that we've seen from sectoral stakeholders in recent times shows that the causes of homelessness are things like mental illness, substance abuse, family violence and so on. So, there's already a mechanism in place for people to opt into rental  deductions if that's going to help them stay in housing, and there's no evidence to suggest that mandatorily making that the case is really going to deliver any significant change. What would, of course, deliver some significant change is increased funding to address all of those things I mentioned before. I mean, 300,000 Australians attend homelessness services each year. Last year, 66,000 people were turned away from homelessness support services, and yet earlier this year, when the government came along with what I termed at the time the 'N-HAHA', the national housing and homelessness agreement bill, it really just maintained the status quo as far as the National Affordable Housing Agreement and the National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness are concerned. There was no growth funding to support social housing growth, nor was there any growth funding when it comes to the services that actually support people facing homelessness. More than that, in terms of its wreckage and relentlessly negative agenda, the government that will come to be known for the things that it damaged and got rid of, will be known in this space for getting rid of the Housing Help for Seniors pilot, for defunding homelessness and community housing peak bodies and for abolishing the National Housing Supply Council. That's the record of this government. And it turns up here, late in 2018, in the face of that aching need and the gross inadequacy of the Commonwealth when it comes to meaningful action to deal with homelessness and provide better services and more affordable housing, and instead proposes something that's more punitive: to mandatorily extract rent from people when they have the opportunity to opt into that if they like. There's no evidence to suggest that, if it's imposed upon them, it's going to do anything meaningful to help them in their circumstances. That's why Labor has flagged a series of amendments that would mean that you would only even contemplate the mandatory application of rent deductions when you had already ensured there were proper counselling and financial services considerations. You'd only do it after there was a substantial period of rental arrears; you would cap the amount that could be deducted; and you would ensure that it would only apply to rental arrears and arrears in relation to utilities, and not to property damage, because there is evidence that, if you go down that path, you will cause harm and damage to people who are already disadvantaged. I make the point-and my colleagues would know-that it's passing strange that you'd even look at something like this when you've got no appetite for dealing with consumer leases and no appetite for dealing with payday lending. If you really wanted to look at people who are in difficult financial circumstances, the last thing you'd go and do is just whack on this additional punitive measure when you're doing nothing to address the causes of homelessness, you're doing nothing to address an increase in social housing stock and you're not looking to get out the shonks and the predators in payday lending and commercial leases. I finish by saying that, on the day that the Minister for Women was trumpeting the statement that's supposed to look to provide financial security for women, they have withdrawn funding under the Women's Safety Package, which supports family and domestic violence programs in Western Australia. They might start by focusing on those practical things rather than the production of glossy pamphlets. NA",98
185,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT," It being 7.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Economy Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR (Gorton) (19:29): I rise to discuss the issues of gender pay equity. It seems now that the government wants to talk about some improvements in narrowing the gap between men's and women's wages in the country, and I think it's important for the record that we make it very clear that there is long way to go. It seems we've had one very modest upturn in wages, with private sector wages most recently ascribed as 2.1 per cent. Well, 2.1 per cent in modern Australian economic terms is very low wage growth. It's not sufficient to ensure that people can keep up with cost-of-living pressures. For that reason, to listen to the Prime Minister and the Treasurer starting to boast about wages increasing, given that they've presided over the lowest wage growth in this country in more than 25 years, is quite remarkable. The reality is that wage growth has been stagnating. In many sectors of our economy we have wages falling in real terms. Frankly, one of the reasons why we've seen any narrowing of the gap between men's and women's wages is that there's been wage suppression, wage repression and, some would argue, wage oppression. The fact is we've got too few opportunities for people to have their wages grow. You've seen too many forms of exploitation in the labour market. We're seeing systemic underpayment in some sectors of our economy. We're seeing a government willing to support a decision to cut penalty rates, which is really cutting real income from up to 700,000 retail and hospitality workers. Low-paid, hard working Australians are getting real cuts because this government refuses to support Labor and back our private member's bill to restore penalty rates as they were before 30 June last year. That is a crying  shame. It's not really good enough for the Treasurer, the Prime Minister or, indeed, this government to boast about wage growth when, in fact, we've seen how little wages have grown and how much pressure it's placed on household budgets. The fact is that household debt is growing remarkably and becoming more of a problem for people. Indeed, household lending is being relied upon because wages are not keeping up with cost-of-living pressures. Paying the mortgage, paying the rent, paying for school uniforms, putting petrol in the car-these essential day-today living expenses-are becoming more difficult for too many of our fellow Australians, and all we hear from the Prime Minister and the Treasurer is that they can now boast that wages are growing. Frankly, there is not sufficient evidence to suggest we are out of the woods with respect to wage growth. It is the lowest wage growth, as I say, in a generation and is compounded by the government's obstinacy in not supporting Labor's position to restore penalty rates and, of course, in not tackling exploitation in the labour market. The most obvious example of that, of course, is the huge scale of underpayments by 7-Eleven, which is estimated to have refused to pay their workforce up to $150 million. Unfortunately, 7-Eleven is not a one-off. 7Eleven is certainly a huge example, but increasingly we're seeing the failure to comply with the awards and enterprise agreements; therefore, we're seeing people suffer as a result. On top of that, you are seeing insecure work. Again, the government likes to argue there is no such thing as insecure work and we haven't had any changes to the labour market for the last 20 years. What tosh from Josh when the Treasurer said that",101
186,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"The member for Gorton will refer to members by their correct titles or I will sit him down. Mr BRENDAN OCONNOR: Indeed. The fact is that the labour market is changing. We've seen significant changes. We've seen the misuse of labour hire, where you have labour hire workers standing next to direct employees and being paid up to $200 a week less but still doing the same work. We've seen the abuse of casualisation, where people are working on permanent rosters year in, year out yet not given any sense of permanency at work. They're not provided any security of employment. That is unfair. We're seeing sham contracting arrangements, where workers are deemed to be businesses so they don't have to pay them the minimum wage. They actually pay them $7 or $8 an hour to deliver food from one outlet to a consumer. This sort of behaviour, this problem that's besetting the labour market, is not being attended to by this government. They can continue to boast about wage increases, but the reality is they're not happening and more needs to be done to help workers in this country. (Time expired) Dawson Electorate: Infrastructure",102
187,Mr CHRISTENSEN,ADJOURNMENT," In North Queensland we know a good, reliable source of water is essential to create jobs and to drive the local economy. That's why the Morrison Liberal-Nationals government has committed $3.3 billion to water infrastructure. In the northern half of my electorate, we have invested funds in the planning of a project to raise the wall of the Burdekin Falls Dam. We've also recently announced an investment of $200 million for a pipeline to take water from that dam, the Burdekin Falls Dam, to the City of Townsville, providing water security for that great garrison city. The Prime Minister has agreed to provide up to $54 million to build the first stage of Hell's Gate dam. That is called Big Rocks Weir. The entire dam project has the potential to open up 50,000 hectares of irrigated agricultural land providing 4,000 ongoing jobs, not to mention the 12,000 construction jobs that it would create. What I want to focus on tonight is the southern half of my electorate where we have invested $3 million to do up-to-date planning work on the long-talked-about, long-waited Urannah Dam project. It is a project that will transform the economies of townships like Bowen and Collinsville, the Whitsundays and the entire Mackay region, reinvigorating rural communities by boosting agricultural enterprise, creating jobs and also supporting our resources sector. The project would do so by providing water for agricultural, urban, mining, industrial and green energy usage. It has the potential to open up large-scale sustainable irrigation of up to 40,000 hectares. That's going to be for high-value export products like macadamia nuts, table grapes and avocados. One of the biggest benefits this dam will deliver is efficiency. Due to the shape of the dam, it has a large volume with a small surface area preventing excessive loss due to evaporation. In comparison with the Burdekin Falls Dam, Urannah could provide 80 per cent of the capacity with only 16 per cent of the footprint. Urannah Dam is also in a strategic location, providing the development of a water grid linking Urannah Dam to the Proserpine and Eungella dams and providing the most cost-efficient option of water delivery to all areas of the northern Bowen Basin coalfields It could also provide pumped hydro options ranging from 237 megawatts to 1,021 megawatts. Abundant water and dispatchable energy is a win-win combination for North Queensland. That's a combination that will create thousands of jobs in construction and many thousands of jobs in new and expanded industries that  will result. I'm pleased the business case for the dam, which was funded under the Liberal-Nationals government's National Water Infrastructure Development Fund, is almost complete. The final technical studies are now being done, and the first draft is expected to be published in February 2019. Early indications suggest a dam with a capacity of more than 1.5 million megalitres. That would generate a yield of 150,000 megalitres a year. A project on this scale can facilitate more than 20 resource projects-20 mines, 16 existing mines-generate more than 1,000 megawatts of renewable energy and open up more than 40,000 hectares of prime agricultural land for irrigation. The town of Bowen in particular, and Collinsville as well, have endured many years of difficult economic times. Businesses have struggled and some have closed down; people have lost jobs or been unable to find jobs and some have been forced to leave town. The good people of Bowen and Collinsville can see the potential Urannah Dam offers them and their families-jobs and food on the table. But not everyone wants to see those jobs and people put food on the table. The extreme Greens have sought to denigrate water projects in North Queensland-sadly, including the Urannah Dam. Not even the scope for developing green energy can placate the Greens. They hate it because it will provide jobs and people will earn money through hard work. They hate it because businesses will flourish and employ local people. They hate it because it will create more people farming the land and providing food and fibre for the national and export markets. North Queenslanders are sick of listening to the predictable whinging of these extreme Greens. They want to see jobs and economic prosperity to get on with their lives. North Queenslanders look forward to seeing the final Urannah Dam report. So do I. I promised them. I would get funding to get the ball rolling on Urannah and have I delivered. And I'm promising now to fight for funding to get the thing built. National Integrity Commission  in politics and our public institutions? Yesterday, the Morrison government went from opposing a national integrity commission to voting for a national integrity commission to considering a national integrity commission to finally calling the establishment of a national integrity commission-and this was from the Prime Minister-a 'fringe issue' all within a couple of hours. The Morrison government was a divided and chaotic minority government yesterday-and today? Well, it's even more divided, even more chaotic and, in fact, even more in the minority. A national integrity commission is an important issue. Labor knows that and the government know that, but I fear that the government have no real intention of supporting a national integrity commission. They only voted for it because they have lost the numbers on the floor of parliament. They were caught in a bind where their only choice was to pretend to support a national integrity commission or to lose a vote on the floor of parliament. Of all the issues that this Morrison government would play politics and cynically skew a vote in parliament with, I would have thought that the vote for a national integrity commission would be the last one where they would ever be so disingenuous. A sleight of hand on integrity is the ultimate betrayal of the Australian people. Australians are sick of politicians who care more about their own jobs than about what is best for the country. The Prime Minister is so out of touch with ordinary Australians that he can't see that a national integrity commission is an essential part of beginning to restore faith in our politics and our democracy, and that it would be good for everybody because of that. Labor has been advocating for a national integrity commission since January when the opposition leader announced that a Labor government, when elected, would get on and do the job. Australians don't have to wait until next year for a commission to be established to ensure that politicians are accountable and to ensure that there is not one set of rules for politicians and another for everybody else. It could actually be commenced now. But we know that the Prime Minister has form when it comes to being out of touch. Remember when he said that calling for a banking royal commission was 'a populist whinge'? The member for Cook then voted against establishing the banking royal commission 26 times. The government has really run out of excuses for not establishing a national integrity commission. It voted for it just yesterday and the time has come. This parliament should now establish a national integrity commission. There is now an opportunity for all members of parliament-Labor, Liberal, Nationals and Independents-to come together and work to help design the most effective national integrity commission. Labor has set out seven design criteria for a national integrity commission: (1) it must operate as an independent statutory body, with the appropriate resources; (2) it would be constituted by one commissioner and two deputy commissioners; (3) it would have sufficiently broad jurisdiction and operate as a standing royal commission into serious and systemic corruption by Commonwealth parliamentarians or their staff, public servants, statutory office holders, the Commonwealth judiciary and even the Governor General; (4) it would have the investigative powers, effectively, of a royal commission; (5) it would have discretion to hold hearings in public where it is in the public interest to do so; (6) it would be empowered only to make findings of fact, and any criminal findings that constituted  criminal conduct would be referred to the AFP or the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions; and (7) a bipartisan joint standing commission of parliament would be established to oversee the commission and have the power to require the commission to provide information about its work. These are good checks and balances. For me, integrity is never, ever a fringe issue. I believe a national integrity commission goes to the heart of our democracy. It is imperative that the community has faith in our public institutions and our leaders. The community is entitled to expect that those leading our nation are always governing for everybody, never for themselves or for improper purposes; that politicians are looking after all Australians, not just themselves; and that where there is a hint of impropriety it will be swiftly and thoroughly investigated by an independent body and then acted upon. Australians want a national integrity commission. Labor wants a national integrity commission. The crossbench wants a national integrity commission. Now let's see if the Morrison government really want a national integrity commission. Let's see if they're fair dinkum. If they do, there is no excuse. It can be done now. The process can start now. If the Morrison government don't act, a Shorten Labor government, if elected in 2019, will get on with the job. Leichhardt Electorate: Mossman Mill",102
188,Mr ENTSCH,ADJOURNMENT," I rise tonight to highlight a transformational project within my electorate. The Mossman Mill has been a feature in the local landscape for more than a century. In 1897, Annie Rose fed the first sugar cane into the mill, with the mill producing its first sugar after crushing 27,905 tonnes of cane for its initial season. Fast-forward a century to today, and the mill supports more than 520 local jobs and is the lifeblood of Mossman, a small community on the doorstep to the World Heritage Daintree Rainforest. However, the Mossman Mill faced an uncertain future. The mill's owner, Mackay Sugar Limited, planned to close the mill in November, at the end of the current crushing season. It was unable to contend with crippling debt in excess of $180 million. That would have signalled the end of the Mossman community, along with 560 local jobs. The mill's closure would have had a profound impact on the 380 business services in the Mossman area as well as the 12 schools and childcare centres, 33 community and sporting organisations and nine welfare groups. I highly doubt many of them would have survived if the mill had closed. A determined group of growers, led by Maryann Salvetti, stepped in and devised a plan to ensure the future of the mill and, more importantly, the region. They realised that doing nothing was not an option. Three grower groups-Mossman CANEGROWERS, the Australian Cane Farmers Association and Tableland CANEGROWERS-formed an alliance to secure the mill's future. The new alliance, Far Northern Milling, had a vision to buy back the historic mill and pave its future as a clean energy powerhouse for the Daintree Bio Precinct. This project would transform not only the mill but also the region through technology and innovation. These growers have skin in the game. They invested their own money in the project but needed assistance from all levels of government. However, time was running out as the crushing season neared its end, and the mill was days away from closing unless funding could be secured. I'm proud to say that the Australian government has stepped in and announced a $20 million commitment, subject to the completion of a positive business case and a significant contribution from the Queensland Labor government. Douglas Shire Council also chipped in with $250,000 to help Far Northern Milling cover the cost of acquiring the mill, and I want to take this opportunity to publicly thank the mayor, Julia Leu, for her unwavering support and advocacy for this project. I'd also like to thank the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Finance, Senator Cormann, who saw value in this project. More importantly, the vote of confidence from these three shows the Australian government backs our farmers and our agriculture industry. The only party that hasn't come to the table in support of this job-creating project is the Queensland Labor government. A further $16 million from the Queensland government is required to see this project become a reality. They've been completely silent on the issue and they've left the project in a state of flux, in spite of the fact that it was Queensland's department of state development that actually encouraged the growers to go down this track. In fact, the state bureaucrats are doing their utmost to ensure the project will not meet its deadline. Furthermore, the Queensland Labor government has told Far Northern Milling that it has no interest in funding the actual mill. Sadly, the local member, the member for Cook, Cynthia Lui, has been missing in action on the issue. She has all but turned her back on the Mossman community. She was more than happy some time ago to smile for the cameras, beat her chest and say the Australian government should offer financial assistance to the mill, but, when push came to shove, she didn't deliver her end of the bargain. She should hang her head in shame for her utter silence on the issue. It is widely known that Ms Lui has been a bitter disappointment to the communities that elected her only a year ago.  The Australian government and the Douglas Shire Council have stepped up to the plate; the Queensland government have not. Their refusal to support this project has placed it in jeopardy. If this project falls over because of the Queensland Labor government, mark my words, I will personally ensure every resident in Mossman and the Douglas shire region knows who's to blame. It's time for the Queensland government to back our farmers and primary producers. Talk is cheap. It's time for them to stand up and commit, given that they're the ones who introduced this in the first instance. They were the ones who called on the federal government, through me, to deliver the support. We've done that. It's now time for them to stand up and deliver. Banking and Financial Services Ms O'NEIL (Hotham) (19:49): I want to use this time this evening to provide a bit of an update for the House on the discussions Labor's been conducting with bank victims around Australia. Labor has been calling for a banking royal commission for a long time now, and at a time when it was actually quite controversial to be doing so. It's not a secret that those on the other side of the chamber did not want a royal commission into banking. They fought it with everything they had. The Prime Minister voted 26 times against holding a banking royal commission and he called it 'a populist whinge'. When the government was dragged, kicking and screaming, into this accountability that was so obviously necessary, they didn't really give the royal commission the time that it needed to have a look at this; that would have involved bank victims. One of the consequences of that is that, of 10,000 bank victims who made a submission to the royal commission, just 27 have had their chance to tell their story. We believe these people who have lost so much at the hands of the big banks in particular have a very serious right to participate in this debate. In fact, we actually need them to participate in the debate because there is no-one better in this country to tell you how we can fix this sector than people who have suffered at the hands of it. For that reason, Labor has been conducting discussions with bank victims around Australia. It's not a replacement for a royal commission. It's not even second-best to a royal commission; it's something much further down the list. Nonetheless, we are doing the very best we can to try to provide those people with a voice and an opportunity to tell their story. We would have liked to have seen the royal commission extended so that more of those victims were able to tell their stories in public, which I think they are entitled to do. Nonetheless, we're doing the best we can to provide them with an opportunity. Members of my party and I have spoken to victims from Perth to Launceston, from Adelaide to Karratha, to Frankston, to Newcastle and to Brisbane. I want to share some of the outcomes of those discussions. The first thing I really want the parliament to understand is how incredibly damaged and hurt people have been by some of the things that the banks have done. I've been disgusted by some of the things that I have heard. I think there are stories that I have heard in some of these roundtables that would make the skin of every single person who sits this this chamber crawl. I've heard of behaviour by the banks that is inhuman, virtually, in the way people have been treated-some people who are going through the worse thing that's ever happened to them in their lives. One of the things that's really important to understand is that when I speak to people outside of this community of bank victims they say, 'People borrowed too much, they did the wrong thing.' In some instances that's the case, but in other instances it's not. I've dealt with a lot of people through this process who are victims of wrongdoing by the banks, and the banks took them to court for some reason. We're supporting a woman in Melbourne who owned her own house and was a victim of bank fraud by CBA. The bank took her house when she didn't repay a mortgage she never took out, and still today, 12 years later, she is trying to reach a settlement with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. That's just one example of so many stories I hear at every single one of these roundtables. I hear about people who have got lifelong mental health impacts, people who have lost homes and farms that had been in their family for generations, people who have had marriage breakdowns, and people who have had illness emerge. One of the other issues I want to make sure is put on record is the way some of the banks have abused the legal system in order to get an outcome they want and to prevent access to justice for people in this country who are using bank services. It is not uncommon-in every round-table, in fact-that the key issue is the way the banks have used the law to stop people from getting something that in many instances I believe they're entitled to. I frequently talk to people who are representing themselves in supreme courts around this country, and opposite them sit two law partners, a QC and a bunch of junior lawyers. That's who they're meant to be arguing with in a court of law in Australia. What I see is a legal system that is stacked against these people. We should not have laws in this parliament that support the big end of town against the little guy. That's an issue that Labor is very much looking at at the moment. I want to quickly mention the failure of FOS and AFCA to deal properly with these disputes. This is an issue that must be looked at.  Can I finally say the government still has the opportunity to do the right thing and extend the royal commission and provide these people with a voice. They have lost so much. They are entitled to participate in this debate-not through our round-table process but through the proper royal commission which allows them to voice their concerns. (Time expired) Brisbane Electorate: Small Business",104
189,Mr EVANS,ADJOURNMENT," There are more than 30,000 small businesses in the electorate of Brisbane, many of them small, family-run businesses. I've spoken about them here before many times because they are the heart of our community, as well as being the backbone of our economy. Coming from a small-business family myself-indeed, growing up on the shop floor of family businesses and working so closely with the retail and small-business sectors when I was with the National Retail Association-I know just how hard it is that small businesses work and what they put at risk to create the prosperity and the jobs we need to encourage here in Australia. And it is small businesses that create the majority of the jobs, especially in our local communities, driving the innovation, the growth and the prosperity that we want to see for future generations. Most Australians who work in the private sector work in small businesses. As I said, those small-business owners take the risks and provide the capital that, in turn, benefits literally millions of families across our nationseven million families, I understand. That's why our government continues to work so hard on fostering an environment that supports those small businesses by growing confidence and by encouraging investment to help them create the next job in our local communities. And, despite opposition, quite often from those opposite, the coalition has provided a strong track record in this term of office for small businesses, including tax relief. The tax rate of small businesses has come down to 27½ per cent, and it will fall further to 25 per cent by 2021-22. Of course, the unincorporated small-business tax discount will also increase to 16 per cent in that same time frame. I was very pleased to have the Treasurer come to visit Brisbane last week and to talk to many small businesses in our community. I took him to a couple of very typical small businesses, including the Clayfield Seafood Markets, to show how local businesses are really benefitting in practice from the government's strong economic management and the policies that we implement to support small businesses. We saw how they're using our policies to create those new jobs we want to see. The owner there, Nick, now employs 28 people, and he told us that he'd been able to use government policies, including the instant asset write-off extension, to invest in new grills, range hoods and refrigeration and a new kitchen so that he can ramp up his staff in peak times to double what it used to be to ensure that all of those new local jobs are created and, of course, ultimately, to ensure that the Brisbane community enjoys his excellent and, indeed, award-winning local seafood. We also had a local small-business round-table with the Treasurer at Racecourse Road, where many of the small businesses right along that shopping strip came along and asked questions, and some, indeed, did raise their deep concerns about what Labor's high-tax policies would mean in the future for their businesses and livelihoods were Labor ever to occupy this side of the chamber. The Treasurer outlined three important new policies that the government has recently announced to further help small businesses like theirs. Firstly, we're trying to improve their cashflow by making sure that small businesses get paid on time. For some small businesses I talked to, improving cashflow and payment terms is their No. 1 priority. Now we've committed to ensure the government pays all invoices of up to $1 million within 20 days. We're also putting pressure on the state and territory governments to match that, and, in turn, we'll be pressuring big businesses to match that if they want to keep getting government contracts. Secondly, we had another recent big win when it came to red tape. We've streamlined GST reporting, which will mean the average small business saves about $590 every year, which is no small measure for many small businesses, and of course we need ongoing vigilance when it comes to monitoring the ongoing creep of unnecessary regulation. Thirdly, very importantly, the Treasurer announced that we're helping small businesses to access finance through a $2 billion securitisation fund. All of us know that finance is getting very difficult for some small businesses to access at the moment, and essentially Australia has a thin securitisation market, meaning that, while the big banks can have access to securitisation, the small-bank lenders and the mutuals often can't, which means that small businesses are finding it harder to access finance right across the banking sector, or they face higher funding costs or, alternatively, they have to put their house up as security when they otherwise wouldn't have to. So there are three big new announcements there about our ongoing support for small business and some very critical areas around red tape, access to finance and payment terms.",106

197,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOTICES,"Mrs Wicks) took the chair at 16:00. NA Symonds, Mrs Elizabeth Ann, AM",111
198,Mr ALBANESE,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," I rise to pay tribute to the late Ann Symonds. Ann Symonds was a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council from 1982 to 1998. She was made a Member of the Order of Australia, an honour bestowed in recognition of her significant services to social justice, particularly through drug law reform, and to the New South Wales parliament. Ann passed away last week peacefully with her family. Ann was a collectivist. She was elected as Waverley's first female deputy mayor in 1977, and she continued to be a trailblazer. From her Bronte home, she embodied the spirit of 'agitate, educate, organise' with the formidable eastern suburbs left, including Jeannette MCHugh, Ernie Page, Sue and Paul Tracey, Fay Gervasoni, Paul Pearce and so many others, and believed in social movements and in translating that into legislative change, working with New South Wales left leaders, including Bruce Childs, Tom Uren, Jack Ferguson and Frank Walker. Ann, though, had a capacity to reach across the aisle, and the tributes made to her last week in the New South Wales parliament from Liberals, from Nationals, from Greens Party members and from Independents are an example of that. What distinguished Ann, I believe, was her preparedness to pursue causes that were not high on the public agenda at the time of her initial engagement-the issue of women in prisons and the impact that that had on their children; the issue of safe injecting rooms as part of drug law reform, a challenge that was opposed strenuously when it was first advanced by people who had family affected by drugs; the issue of juvenile justice. These issues were never fashionable, but Ann took them forward in a way that was courageous and passionate. Ann Symonds blazed the policy trail in the causes of peace, progress and justice. She was a principled, determined and, at times, provocative advocate. She had the respect of all who dealt with her. She was a mentor to many, including me. She was patient and generous with her time. Ann was a serious person, but Ann was also tremendous fun. She enjoyed life and she had a capacity to give pleasure to all those who knew her and had the privilege to be in her company. I pay tribute to Ann. She was much loved and she had so much love to give: to her family, to her friends, to her party and to generations of activists. I loved her and I will miss her. The world is a better place as a direct result of her presence here on this planet. Forde Electorate: Crematorium Mr VAN MANEN (Forde-Government Whip) (16:03): I would like to take this opportunity to raise an issue in my electorate of Forde which is a concern for the quiet suburb of Bethania in particular, a suburb that is home to young families, retirees, homeowners and businesses. Sadly, it's now proposed to be the site of a crematorium, or should I more correctly say, given the design of the facility, a furnace. Understandably, this has left the local community very disturbed. We've seen seniors put their hard-earned life savings into their well-earned retirement at the neighbouring retirement villages. The concern is that these investments and this lifestyle are now compromised by the prospect of this tasteless crematorium on their doorstep. What I find tasteless, as well, is that the person behind this proposal-a Brisbane funeral director-has previously been convicted for fraud and other charges as a result of incorrectly dealing with bodies in a previous role. The man was entrusted with taking care of loved ones to cremate at the Mount Gravatt and Logan crematoriums but instead drove them hundreds of miles to Rockhampton to make a quick buck, because of cheaper cremation prices. In the end, he made over $30,000 out of this and then failed to properly and adequately detail what had happened. In fact, the CEO of the Australian Funeral Directors Association has confirmed that this man and his company are not members of their organisation and he is not bound by their strict code of conduct. The Australian Funeral Directors Association shares our concerns in relation to this applicant's past history. Quite rightly, the residents of Bethania have a number of concerns with respect to this proposed crematorium. They're worried about whether it will negatively impact on their health, due to toxic emissions from the crematorium, which the council has done no work to identify. Will it have a negative impact on the health and well-being of the lives of the residents in the aged care and retirement facilities in Bethania and Waterford, and their families? Will it have a negative impact on our local community, by putting existing and future job prospects at risk?  It is an inappropriate location, given its proximity to the Bethania Lutheran Primary School and nearby Aldi shopping centre and local shops. I call on the council to reject this application and the proponents to withdraw it. (Time expired) South Australian Government",111
199,Mr ZAPPIA,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," The South Australian Marshall Liberal government has turned its back on the people of Makin. Since being elected, the Marshall government has announced the closure of the Tea Tree Gully TAFE campus, cancelled the Tea Tree Plaza park and ride expansion, axed bus routes in the area, privatised patient transfers from Modbury Hospital, and is wanting to close the very busy and needed Modbury Service Centre, which provides a range of state government services, including motor vehicle registration, licensing, and payment of most South Australian government department accounts. None of these closures or cancellations were announced prior to the state election, but were decisions made with no community consultation immediately on the Marshall government winning government. Not all transactions can be done online, as some would claim, and nor do all people have access to computers. Yesterday, it was revealed that the South Australian government will pay KordaMentha $18.9 million to cut $276 million of funding from the Central Adelaide Local Health Network. South Australia's public hospitals are all connected and dependent on each other, so the $276 million in cuts will not only have a direct impact on health services across Adelaide, but very likely would directly impact on Modbury Hospital, which serves the north-east and northern suburbs of Adelaide, which I represent. Health services at Adelaide's public hospitals, including at the new Royal Adelaide Hospital and at Modbury Hospital, are under extreme pressure, with ambulance ramping at a crisis point, waiting times at emergency departments putting patients at risk, and elective surgery waiting times getting longer. Of course, health services should be delivered efficiently, and that's the responsibility of the minister and his department. However, my expectation is that the $276 million in health funding cuts will result in cuts to public health services, which in turn will push people into private health cover, or, if they already have private health cover, into a higher premium policy, or even worse, to choose not to seek health care when they need it most. The combined effects of all the cuts or closures that are proposed in the region that I represent will profoundly impact on the lives of local people each and every day. The services are there because they are needed. They were put in place by previous governments when it was clear that they were needed. I'm therefore not at all surprised by the widespread level of disappointment and anger about the South Australian government's proposal to cut or close all of these services. I call on the Marshall government to reconsider its decision, consider the impact its decision will have on people in the area-particularly the elderly-and reverse its heartless decision to close all of the services that it proposes to close in the electorate of Makin. Leichhardt Electorate: Wujal Wujal Community",112
200,Mr ENTSCH,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," I rise this evening to highlight an initiative that is achieving amazing results in Wujal Wujal, a small Indigenous community in my electorate. The 51st Battalion, Far North Queensland Regiment, plays an important role in the security of northern Australia by conducting surveillance patrols in sparsely populated and remote regions of Far North Queensland. The 51st Battalion is tasked with reconnaissance and surveillance of approximately 680,000 square kilometres from Cardwell in the south, to Torres Strait, including Cape York and the Gulf Country, and west to the Northern Territory border. About 58 per cent of 51st Battalion's personnel are Torres Strait Islander or Aboriginal people. Wujal Wujal is a very small community that is prone to isolation due to a number of factors, including natural disasters. The community's isolation has also led to a rise in social issues. Sadly, it once had a relatively high rate of crime and was considered to be in the 10 worse communities in Cape York for domestic violence. Something had to give. Wujal Wujal Aboriginal Shire Council approached the 51st Battalion to assist them with the social issues facing the community. Since engaging with the community in early 2017, approximately 10 per cent of eligible members within Wujal Wujal are now trained members of the 51st Battalion. The immediate results have been staggering. Crime has reduced significantly. Public nuisance rates have decreased by 60 per cent. Domestic violence rates have decreased by 31 per cent. Work participation rates have also increased in the community. The baseline work participation rate for the community is 35 per cent attendance. However, members who have completed training in the Army are now averaging 85 per cent attendance. The experience gained through working in the Army has supported generationally unemployed members to have credible work history that can be used to support subsequent job applications. This has also increased confidence in an attempt to build new things both individually and in the community. Positive momentum gained over the past 18 months has given the community the confidence to attempt more initiatives, develop resilience and grow sustainability. It's just been absolutely amazing.  I want to acknowledge the outstanding efforts of the 51st Battalion commander, Lieutenant Colonel Tim Rutherford; Wujal Wujal mayor, Desmond Tayley; and Wujal Wujal's CEO, Eileen Deemal-Hall, who led by example and is a fully fledged member of the 51st Battalion. Let me tell you, there is now a reason for Wujal Wujal, driven by this program, and let me tell you, Wujal Wujal is so good that you have to say it twice! Climate Change Mr JOSH WILSON (Fremantle) (16:13): The people I represent want to see action on climate change. They know that rising carbon emissions have affected our climate and that our planet has already warmed significantly as a result of human activity. They know it's vital that we keep global temperatures well below two degrees, so they expect government to take appropriate action. People in my electorate don't buy the nonsense in the government's claim that more coal equals cheaper and more reliable power, they've no truck with those who make the ridiculous claim that more renewable energy means higher costs, and they're sick to death of the dangerous lie that climate change isn't real and that Australia should take no part in confronting its causes and its effects. In fact, they understand very well both the science and the economics. They understand that sound energy policy and action to address climate change go hand in hand. The recent IPCC report-which, sadly, this government and its minister pretended was of no particular consequence or authority-made our circumstances and the challenge before us perfectly clear: Climate change represents an urgent and potentially irreversible threat to human societies and the planet. We must respond to this threat, but we're not doing that at the moment. Carbon emissions have risen under this government; they are rising every year. Investment in renewable energy has fallen off a cliff, and we have suffered through five years of inaction. There is no area of policy failure that has been more bleak and more hopeless in the course of the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government than the failure to put in place as a matter of urgency a responsible and effective forward-looking climate change and energy framework. I'm fortunate to be the representative of an engaged and indeed often activist community. In the last few months alone, in addition to the hundreds of emails and telephone calls I've received on this issue, I've met with local representatives from the Australian Conservation Foundation, young people from the Australian Youth Climate Coalition, the Conservation Council of Western Australia and various business whose are pushing ahead with new technologies in renewable energy, energy efficiency, batteries, electric vehicles and zero-emission hydrogen projects. All those things must be part of our future. That's why Labor is committed to achieving 50 per cent renewable energy by 2030, to supporting the serious expansion of household battery capacity and to providing $10 billion in additional funding for the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. In Fremantle we recognise the need to dramatically reduce carbon emissions and dramatically increase renewable energy, but I don't think the community I represent is significantly different from communities right around this country, a continent that is at risk of suffering disproportionate environmental, social and economic harm from a drying and warming climate and a spike in extreme weather events, storms, droughts and bushfires. Like the good people of Fremantle, Australians want action on climate change. I'm determined to work with my colleagues within this parliament to deliver that action. Centenary of Armistice Mrs PRENTICE (Ryan) (16:16): Mere words cannot do justice to the significance and importance of 11 November 1918. At 11 am on that day the armistice signed by Germany earlier in the morning came into effect. This signified the long-awaited end to the war. When the news broke, cities and towns around Australia erupted into celebrations. The Armistice represented the end of a four-year campaign of bloodshed and destruction, of casualty and loss. This year we commemorate 100 years since that fateful day. A conflict which had brought about the mobilisation of more than 70 million people and left nine million to 13 million dead can never be glossed over as just a period in our history. Since the first anniversary of Armistice in 1919, observed by a two-minute silence, Australians have not forgotten the ultimate sacrifice so many Australians made in not only the First World War but all conflicts since. Today I want to speak briefly about the Armistice Centenary Grants Program. This grants program supports local community based commemorative projects and activities that commemorate the end of the First World War, remember Australian service men and women from all conflicts, and celebrate a just and secure peace. In my electorate of Ryan four organisations share in almost $50,000 worth of funding through the program. The Gap RSL Sub-branch received funds to design and install a memorial at Walton Bridge Memorial Park. This lasting commemoration will honour the sacrifices made by local and surrounding community members. The Kenmore and District Historical Society successfully received funds to partly research and publish a book about the Kenmore War Memorial. The book was launched on Armistice Day this year. Similarly the Moggill Historical Society, under the leadership of Professor Neville Marsh, will also publish a book and website commemorating  the service of soldiers from the Moggill district in Brisbane's western suburbs with funding from the program. Finally, the Toowong RSL received a grant to produce and unveil a plaque at the start of its ANZAC Discovery Trail. The beginning of the discovery trail will also have some special interactive display panels. As a result of other commitments this year I was unable to participate in a local Remembrance Day service. However, I was honoured to attend a very special service held in Suva with the President and Prime Minister of Fiji. I joined with our High Commissioner, John Feakes, to lay a wreath on behalf of Australia. As a community it is essential that every generation understand how Australia's involvement in wars, conflicts and peacekeeping operations shaped our country and learn about the sacrifice of so many service men and women. Lest we forget. Footscray-Yarraville City Band",112
201,Mr WATTS,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," I rise to congratulate the Footscray-Yarraville City Band for their successful tour of the United Kingdom, France and Belgium to commemorate the centenary of the armistice that ended World War I. Footscray-Yarraville City Band is a long standing institution in my electorate in Melbourne's west. Established in 1961, the band formed through merging several bands, the oldest of which was established in 1883. For over 100 years the band has entertained our community, particularly at the Whitten Oval, contested national competitions and toured around Australia and the world. For the centenary of the Armistice of World War I, the band wanted to do something special for themselves and our community. Supported by the ANZAC Centenary Local Grants Program, the band wrote and produced a show, The Silent ANZAC, that honours the sacrifices of Australian service men and women during World War I. In addition to performing this original work around Melbourne, the band wanted to take the show to Europe and the United Kingdom, to commemorate our fallen soldiers with the communities where our soldiers fought and died. The Silent ANZAC is not just about performing and remembering our fallen soldiers; the band wanted to engage with the community too. Throughout 2018 the band embarked on a roadshow, where they encouraged schools and community groups to participate in The Silent ANZAC project. The roadshow included displays of World War I memorabilia and talks about World War I history. Schools, community groups and councils donated wreaths and handmade poppies that the band took with them to Europe. On the tour, the band performed The Silent ANZAC at the Australian Embassy in Paris; Le Hamel in France, the site of General Sir John Monash's most famous battles; and Australia House in London. The band also performed at centenary of Armistice ceremonies in Belgium and in France. In Belgium the band played hymns and paid their respects to the 55,000 men whose names are etched at Menin Gate but whose bodies were never recovered. Over 6,000 of those names are of Australian soldiers, including 16 from Yarraville and Footscray, in my electorate. After performing at the Australian National Memorial at Villers-Bretonneux in France, the band laid wreaths donated by members of the public, local community organisations and local councils, and hundreds of poppies handmade by students from Altona Primary School and Box Hill North Primary School. I want to congratulate the 25 members of The Silent ANZAC project team, for the hard work that they put into make the tour happen, and the 46 people who went on the tour, for the great job they did representing our community. Special thanks to Colin Harrison, without whose hard work The Silent ANZAC could not have happened; Phillipa Edwards, the band's musical director and creator of the show; Lorraine Wright and John Hoppe, who did brilliant jobs fundraising and coordinating with other organisations; and Jamie Lawson, who helped whenever it was needed. Finally I would also like to give a shout-out to Joanne Mathrick at Altona Primary School and Jessica Riley at Box Hill North Primary School, for their hard work in engaging their students in the project. Harvie, Mr Jake Mrs MARINO (Forrest-Chief Government Whip) (16:22): Australia's hockey players have always had a great amount of success, and I'd like to tell you about another terrific young athlete and his family, from Dardanup, in my electorate of Forrest. Earlier this year Jake Harvie was selected to represent Australia as part of the Kookaburras squad that competed in the Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast. Jake returned from the Commonwealth games with a gold medal, after the Kookaburras defeated New Zealand 2-0 in the final. It was the second gold medal he has won while representing Australia, after also being successful in the International Hockey Federation Hockey World League in 2017. He followed his Commonwealth Games victory with a third gold medal, at the 2018 Hockey Champions Trophy in the Netherlands. That's three gold medals representing his country, at the tender age of 20. Jake comes from a fantastic Western Australian sporting dynasty, with his grandfather Gordon Pearce representing Australia on the hockey field at three Olympic Games. Gordon's four brothers also represented Australia in hockey at a national level. All five brothers once played together in the same match, in the Western Australian first XI team. Jake's father, Russell, is a hockey development coach at our very own South West  Academy of Sport, and his mother, Carolyn, was a talented swimmer and basketball player. Jake's younger brother Tom is also a rising star on the international hockey scene, after representing our nation and claiming gold at the Youth Olympic Games qualifiers this year in Papua New Guinea. Despite his pedigree in the sport, Jake has said he has never felt any pressure from his parents to play hockey. Jake Harvie and his family are a prime example of how our regional sporting stars don't just compete on the international stage but can excel on it, as long as they have access to the training and resources that are available in our regions. Jake's international hockey career will continue, after he gained selection this month to represent Australia with the Kookaburras, this time at the Hockey World Cup in India, where I am absolutely sure that Jake will continue to shine on the field. He is the second-youngest player on the 20-man squad and one of five Western Australians named in the side. I wish him and the rest of the team the very best of luck when they face Ireland on Friday in their opening match. Let's hope they're able to win their third world cup in a row and Jake is able to claim his fourth gold medal in less than 18 months. This is an exceptional achievement. I'm particularly proud of Jake, his brother Tom and our hockey players. I think all of us in this House would wish the Australian Kookaburras all the very best in their next endeavour. Islamic Council of Victoria",114
202,Ms VAMVAKINOU,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," Today I rise to support the Islamic Council of Victoria. I would like to recognise the wonderful work they do in servicing our vibrant Islamic community in my home state of Victoria and the work that they do to foster deeper and meaningful connections with the broader Victorian community. I especially want to point out the important work that the ICV does in strengthening relationships between First Nations people and the Muslim community. This was highlighted with the signing of an accord to recognise and support the First Peoples of Australia. It's an accord between the ICV and the National Congress of Australia's First Peoples. The accord was officially signed by ICV President Mohamed Mohideen and Jackie Huggins, a cochair of the congress, at the annual ICV dinner held in my electorate on Sunday, 18 November. The accord is an agreement by the ICV to support congress as an organisation and also to support a set of key objectives and principles. These include promoting the domestic implementation of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, promoting the recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the Australian Constitution and promoting the National Anti-Racism Strategy, and further partnership work as negotiated and agreed to by both parties. I congratulate both organisations on making this commitment that will nurture, support and foster cohesive relationships and enrich our local communities. I also want to congratulate the ICV on two other pioneering initiatives in 2018. The first is the creation of the Jackie Huggins Humanitarian Scholarship at La Trobe University. This scholarship is available to a recently arrived Muslim refugee student in need of financial assistance. In addition to this the Islamic Council of Victoria sponsored three beds as part of the Royal Children's Hospital Foundation bed sponsorship program. This builds on the continued long-term relationship that the ICV has with the Royal Children's Hospital. There are many other programs that the ICV is involved into ensure that the Muslim community in Victoria are able to make contributions to our community in ways that are consistent with the values of their faith. In closing, I want to say that Nail Aykan, the retiring CEO of the Islamic Council of Victoria, is not only a long-time constituent of mine but a very good friend of mine. He has been at the helm of the ICV for over a decade. He has led it to grow from strength to strength. He has been a champion of multiculturalism and a champion of interfaith activities. He has been a wonderful asset to our community. I look forward to working with Nail in whatever he chooses to do in the future. I congratulate him. (Time expired) Taxation",115
203,Mr WALLACE,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," The cranes and high-vis vests on construction sites all over my electorate of Fisher attest to our strong local economy and the jobs we're creating with the support of our government. I was involved in the construction industry for three decades and I know how quickly boom can turn to bust. The Labor Party's disastrous plan to end negative gearing and have the capital gains tax discount on housing represents a massive new tax on property. If their misguided cash grab is allowed to happen, it will have a terribly destructive impact on the Sunshine Coast's future. On the coast thousands of young people, just like my own daughter, have recently bought their first home in one of our new local developments. In total, 82,000 Sunshine Coast families own a house in our community. But make no mistake, under Labor every one of these properties will be worth less. It isn't complicated; it isn't rocket science. If you make it less worthwhile and more expensive to own a property, then fewer people will want to buy one and it will be harder to get the price you want when you are selling your house.  Thirty-seven thousand of us on the Sunshine Coast rent a home. Many who do so are young or struggling to make ends meet as it is. Without negative gearing, many landlords will have to raise their rents, while competition for rentals will increase as the number of new properties coming onto the market will fall. Under Labor's property taxes, many Sunshine Coast people are going to see their rents rise just when they can least afford it. For all of us, construction and development on the coast adds a vital $3.5 billion to the local economy. Directly and indirectly, it supports thousands of local workers. Apprentice training rates in our community are at an all-time high. But what are all of those skilled apprentices going to do for work if the construction industry tanks because of Labor's irresponsible property taxes? If Labor are allowed to make it less worthwhile to buy a property, then fewer will be constructed. Master Builders have shown that, across the country, 42,000 fewer homes would be built, 32,000 jobs would be cut and the economy would take a recession-risking $12 billion hit. As one of the fastest-growing regions in the country with construction at its heart, the Sunshine Coast would be hit far harder than most. The Labor Party need to listen, admit that they've got it wrong and ditch their devastating property taxes. Whether you own your own home or you rent it, whether you want to invest in your family's future or you are looking for a job in our region, these policies would hurt all of us. (Time expired)",115
204,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONSTITUENCY STATEMENTS," In accordance with standing order 193, the time for members' constituency statements has concluded. NA Mack, Mr Edward Carrington (Ted) Consideration resumed.",116
205,Mr LEESER,CONDOLENCES," I'm a Liberal Party partisan. I believe in our party and its traditions and its values. More than that, as somebody who believes in the institutions of the parliament, I'm a two-party person. I think, effectively, if you want to make a contribution in public life, you should make it in the context of our party or the National Party or the Labor Party. But occasionally in public life that faith is rocked by seeing originals in public life-people who are innovators, people who come in and shake up the system. Before the modern era of populist politics, the original populist politician-the original innovator, the original disrupter-was Ted Mack, to whom we pay tribute today. Ted Mack passed away on 6 November this year, and his legacy in local government and in public life is really quite extraordinary. I first met Ted before I ran for council in 1995. I was considering running, and anybody who wanted to get involved in local government in those days had heard about the legacy of Ted Mack. So I wrote to Ted and I asked him for a meeting. He sat me down in a local cafe and he gave me a whole pack of his mayoral minutes. His mayoral minutes contained his philosophy of open government. This was something that Ted was pioneering in the seventies and early eighties, when it was really cutting-edge stuff-the idea of open public meetings, the idea of referenda to decide things in local government, the idea of precinct committees. All of this came out of North Sydney, with Ted, at the time. I remember he said to me, 'Sometimes in local government one of the strange things that you find is that things that seem counterintuitive often work.' North Sydney had a real litter problem, and one of the things Ted said that you should do to get rid of litter was actually to get rid of the rubbish bins, because, if you got rid of the rubbish bins in North Sydney, people would actually take their litter home with them. And it turned out to be correct. Ted had a very successful career in local government, and it was at that area that I think he was most innovative, and lots of the reforms that he pioneered in North Sydney were taken up by other councils elsewhere. He was 10 years in council-four times as mayor-and then he went on to unseat a sitting Liberal leader as the member for North Shore and then unseat a sitting Liberal minister as the member for North Sydney, spending seven years in the state parliament and six years in this House as the member for North Sydney. As I say, he was a populist. He was determined to serve only as much time as would not qualify him for a federal or state parliamentary pension. In his life post-parliament and, indeed, in his life in parliament he was always railing against entitlements and allowances that are paid to people who work in this place. I think it is sad when people in our own line of work do that, because it underestimates the hard work and the sacrifice that many of us-all of us, in fact-undertake to be here. But that was the nature of Ted. He was an independent person of an independent mind. I got to know Ted very well-this is the main reason for my speaking today-during the 1998 constitutional convention and the 1999 republic referendum, where he and I served together on the national 'no' case committee. I think it really says something about Ted's standing in New South Wales that he at that time got the third-highest vote of anyone in New South Wales and not only got himself up but got Ed Haber elected as his second delegate.  The person who got the highest vote in New South Wales was Malcolm Turnbull, leading the Australian Republican Movement; Doug Sutherland, who was on the same ticket as me, leading the 'no republic' Australians for Constitutional Monarchy; and then Ted and Ed. Ted got 213,422 votes, which is an extraordinary number, considering that this was a non-compulsory postal ballot system, and considering that the turnout was something in the order of 40 to 60 per cent-I can't remember exactly what it was. But the fact that that many people voted for Ted, right around Australia, at a time when the size of federal electorates was about 80,000, really says something of the impact that he had made. Ted was a maximalist republican. He wanted an American-style presidency-an executive presidency. One of the things I think the republican movement had failed to acknowledge was that the most consistent figure in polls in relation to a republic was that 70 per cent of people wanted to choose the president themselves. Ted was very aware of it. The idea of giving people the power to choose the president was completely consistent with everything else he had done in his life. At the constitutional convention, he was a strong advocate for a popularly elected president. I'm a constitutional monarchist. I always have been and I suspect I always will be. After the republic referendum, because of the treatment of some of those direct-election republicans, a number of them decided that they would join with we constitutional monarchists and propose a no case for the 1999 republic referendum. Ted, along with Clem Jones, a former Labor lord mayor of Brisbane, sat on this 10-member no case committee, of which I was a member, to deal with the republic referendum. Ted's view was that the ARM's position, which was that if you vote yes now then we could bring in direct election later, was a lie. Ted believed if we were ever going to be a republic we'd get only one shot at it and that we would only get direct election-that was the only model that was worth going for. Anything less, and it was worth backing the current system. Ted also opposed the model on show because he felt that it put too much power in the hands of the PM, and Ted was always about reducing executive dominance and reducing executive power. During the republic referendum we published a book called The No Case Papers, which both Ted and I had a chapter in. I think it's worth reading a little extract from Ted's chapter, 'An independent's dissection of the ""elitist"" model'-that phrase is typical of Ted-because it reminds us of the difficulty of constitutional reform and the importance, in whatever constitutional reform people might be proposing, of getting the model right. He writes: The supporters of a 'Yes' vote have resorted even to more sophistry – 'Let's get the republic in and we'll sort out the details later and consider a direct election model'. Only the very naive and woolly minded could accept such a proposition. The ARM and the establishment, having achieved a 'Yes' vote, would never let the issues come back on the agenda. The ARM leaders already misled the voters before the Constitutional elections with statements such as by Mr Turnbull that the Australian Republican Movement had always been willing to accept popular election if that is what the majority of Australians want. Or Neville Wran who said in his Whitlam Lecture, 'But if at the end of the day when all the arguments have been put the people of Australia say they want an elected President, then let's embrace their decision and work to implement their decision.' At the Constitutional Convention in spite of these statements, an iron curtain descended against any idea of the public having a say in the appointment of the President. In their panic at the idea of the people having a real choice in the appointment of their President the ARM claimed all sorts of fearful consequences and ironically now say our system of government must be preserved. Frankly, I do not think there are many supporters of the 'Mal Colston' democracy that has developed in recent years. Public distrust and dissatisfaction with government has never in fact been greater. There are some 132 republics in the world and 91 have various forms of direct election of Presidents. There are obviously many possible models. The ARM desperately tries to shift the debate off their model of a republic and to conjure up all sorts of problems with the public having the right to vote. This is yet another diversion. If you accept their argument that people might elect a pop star and football hero who cannot be trusted, then we would have to give up democracy altogether. How very Ted Mack in its sentiments. It was such a privilege to learn from Ted Mack on that committee. He was a wily politician. He was a great populist. He was always very much in sync with his own community in North Sydney. He was always very much in sync with the general public mood. We are honoured in the Chamber today by the presence of his granddaughter Eloise, who is here for these condolence motions. Can I say that Ted Mack will be a person much missed in public life. He certainly had a great impact on me in terms of his thought and his philosophy, and I commend the motion to the House.",116
206,Mr ZIMMERMAN,CONDOLENCES," It was appropriate that this parliament paused on Monday to remember the extraordinary life of the eighth member for North Sydney, Ted Mack. Ted brought to an end his career in public office over 20 years ago. Despite the passage of the years since, the respect and affection in which he has been held in my community has endured. I know that we will see this in large numbers on Friday at the public memorial service, which will be held at 9.30 am at the Luna Park ballroom.  In days gone by, his Citroen was the most famous vehicle on North Sydney's roads, and that shock of silver hair was always unmistakable until the end. His reputation as a mayor, a state MP and a federal MP was founded on both his work on the Lower North Shore and the changes he sought to bring to the way in which politics operates in this country. North Sydney residents continue to enjoy his legacy as mayor to this day in the communities he protected, the facilities he built and the environment he saved. Civic Park in North Sydney, those unique bus stops and the North Sydney Oval, which remains one of our nation's most beautiful, are the most obvious examples of his work. But just as important is what goes unseen-the preservation of those characteristics of our area which make it so special, which so easily could have been lost if it were not for Ted's vision for our community. His work in public life extended beyond bricks and mortar and our natural environment. For those of us cutting our young teeth in the Liberal Party, Ted Mack was of course famous for slaying Liberal luminaries. A state opposition leader fell first, followed by John Spender in 1990. In many ways, Ted Mack can be best described as one of the first disrupters, before that term had entered common parlance. He wanted to turn politics on its head and, in equal measure, he scorned both major political parties. He railed against big business, big unions and big government. His own political ideology did not fit neatly into any political box. On some issues he could be described as incredibly conservative; on others, left of centre. He was in that respect genuinely independent. In fact, Ted was the first Independent elected to this House in over 25 years. He hoped that he would be the catalyst for many more. While not the revolution he predicted, he would note that the crossbench is somewhat larger today-in fact, a little bit too large today-than during his solitary experience at that time. He would certainly smile at the synergy of the parliament pausing to remember his life on the day that the new member for Wentworth was sworn in. In some ways, Ted was a populist but perhaps not quite in the sense that we would use that term today. He scorned representative democracy and preferred directly empowering voters. He argued passionately for the direct election of our leaders and for citizen-initiated referenda. These ideas have not come to pass, and for those of us who would describe ourselves as liberal democrats, who believe our institutions must protect individuals against the tyranny of many as much as they do against the tyranny of some, we are, frankly, glad they didn't. Yet his life in this place did leave an enduring impact. For those representing the major parties, he taught us the hard way the lesson that no seat is ever really safe and all of us have an obligation to work equally hard for our communities, no matter what the nominal margin may be. On a personal note, I'm grateful for the advice that Ted was always prepared to proffer during my time on North Sydney Council and, more recently, as a federal member of parliament. Indeed, there was never such a thing as a short conversation with Ted. On several occasions, I was lured into having a glass of wine, or three or maybe four, as I walked down Blues Point Road in MCMahons Point on a Saturday afternoon, where he regularly held forth with his closest friends. The last such occasion was only six months ago. Whilst his illness had taken its toll, the sharpness of his mind and the strength of his views had certainly not diminished. Ted Mack will be remembered for so many things-his integrity and honesty, his passion, his attention to detail, his commitment to transparency and open government and his refusal to accept the perks of office. Most famously, one of his first acts as Mayor of North Sydney was to sell the council Mercedes to buy two community buses. It is worth noting that Community Connect, the organisation that was the beneficiary of those donations, celebrated its own 30th birthday just a few months ago. Of course he had that elephantine memory, which I experienced when he reminded me more than once of some disparaging comments I had made about him when I was a 20-year-old Young Liberal. It's interesting to note that he was referring to an article that appeared in The Sydney Morning Herald that featured a photo of me, Joe Hockey and John Brogden, all Young Liberals, standing on the steps of North Sydney Council building, threatening to demolish the rule of Independents with a thrust in local government across the state. I should note that of the three of us I was the only one who actually went on to a council career-but I'm not sure that John Brogden or Joe Hockey ever regretted their own failure in that regard. Most importantly of all, he will be remembered for showing us what a true servant of the people should be. Ted's journey was shared with his proud and loving family. I want to acknowledge in the chamber today his granddaughter Eloise Mack, who works for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I'm not sure whether he would have approved of that career path with a major party, but I am sure he would be very proud that the tradition of activism and community service continues to flow in the blood of the latest generation of the Mack family. To his great partner on his public and private journey, Wendy Mack, and all their children and grandchildren, I send the condolences of a community that will forever be grateful for his service to our nation.",117
207,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,CONDOLENCES," I thank the member for North Sydney for his contribution. There being no further statements at this time, I call the Clerk.  NA Melbourne: Attacks Consideration resumed.",118
208,Mr BANDT,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE," I am the member for Melbourne but I was born in South Australia and then grew up and did my high school and university in Western Australia. I love lots of things about Perth and Fremantle, but to a young man in the 1990s Perth wasn't big enough and I spent quite a few days and weeks in Melbourne. As soon as I finished my degree, I moved to Melbourne and I have stayed in Melbourne ever since, knowing that it is the place for me. One of the moments very early on when I knew Melbourne was the right city for me was one Friday evening and I was able to go out and see a night game at the MCG and then go out after that and find that there was not only a paperback bookshop open but a coffee shop open as well. For somebody who had spent time in Perth in the 1990s, finding a sporting event, a bookshop and a coffee shop all open on a Friday night in the middle of the city was really quite something to behold. That coffee shop was Pellegrini's. I was in Pellegrini's on that Friday evening with my dad. He remarked to me that this is what Melbourne was all about. Many of us have spent time making many visits to that place since. To say it holds a special place in the hearts of Melburnians doesn't go anywhere far enough in conveying the significance of this cultural institution. A lot has been said about it. When many of us heard the news that, in the attack that took place, Sisto Malaspina had lost his life, it struck pretty deeply for many people in Melbourne. I also remember where I was on the day that it happened. I was at a public housing estate. We all looked up, because we could see several helicopters flying over the city, within a stone's throw from where we were all gathering to have some soft drinks. We knew something had happened. As it became apparent what had happened and the news went out to avoid that part of Bourke Street, it sunk in that potentially one of the worse events had hit home in a way that everybody had feared. We saw tragedy on the streets of Melbourne that day, but we also saw the best in people. We saw passers-by selflessly putting themselves in harm's way without knowing what was going on. We saw first responders doing it. First responders are trained to do it, which doesn't make the danger they put themselves in any less. Passers-by, without knowing what was happening, jumping into try to stop further attacks is something that we would all like to think we would do, but how many of us would actually do it? To see people prepared to jump into save someone they didn't know and try to stop further attacks from, again, someone they didn't know, an event unfolding in real time around them, speaks volumes about the human spirit. Amongst that tragedy we saw the best of Melbourne and the best of people. In the following weeks since then I must say, as the member representing the area where that attack which has touched so many people took place, that it makes me feel so proud to know it has not divided us. Despite the calls from some to say that this issue should be treated politically and that a whole group of people should now be tarred with a particular brush because of the actions of one unwell individual, people came together and did not fall for it. That speaks volumes and makes me immensely proud to be the member for that area. One of the first phone calls that I made and conversations that I had immediately afterwards was with representatives of our local Somali community. They told me that they had already been out to the scene in the days afterwards to pay their respects, to talk with members of the community and to send the message that they too were grieving. To know that thus far within Melbourne there haven't been the kinds of unjustified and unfair reprisals that we had feared against particular sections of the community is also something that makes me immensely proud. One of the things that I'm always reminded of when these attacks happen is that these attacks are indiscriminate; they're not targeting particular people on the basis of their particular religion. As my local Muslim community reminds me, it is the case that many more Muslims than members of other religions die from these kinds of terror attacks around the world. It is often the case that members of my community in Melbourne have come here because they have fled terror. People from Somalia fled al-Shabaab and the kind of terrorism that has taken hold there and have come here to seek a better life. I stand not only with everyone who was suffering because they were close to Mr Malaspina or to someone who was injured but also with all those members of the community who felt perhaps fearful afterwards that they too were going to be targeted in different ways. I hope that members of those various Muslim and African Australian communities that we have in Melbourne, who make it the wonderful place that it is, have seen that in fact in the aftermath the majority of the population is with them. I think the overwhelming majority of people in Melbourne and indeed right around the country stand with them too and understand that the actions of one individual do not represent the actions of a whole group of people. I went a little while ago with the state member for Melbourne, Ellen Sandell, to pay our respects and see the long line of flowers that was passing down the lane between Pellegrini's and the bookshop. To read through the condolences book inside Pellegrini's gives you a glimpse into the personal lives of so many people. It was great to  hear the stories from the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition about dates, successful and not so successful for them, at Pellegrini's. I think everyone has a story like that, which is why this has touched us so much. If there's one thing that comes out of this, it's that we must continue to strive to make sure that Melbourne is a place where everyone has a place. The best way of ensuring that our community remains safe and that we do not experience these kinds of attacks in the future is to make sure that everyone understands that Melbourne is a place where they belong and that Australia is a place where they belong. If we want to make Australia safer, we will not divide our communities. If we want to make Australia safer, we will look to those communities where there are many people currently doing it tough, where unemployment and underemployment are going through the roof, and we as parliamentarians will make efforts to ensure that people are engaged, to ensure that we do not create in Australia classes of people who feel that they are being left behind, because it is only when people don't feel that they're included, don't feel part of the project that we are embarking on as a country, that they feel in a position where they could think about harming us. But, when people feel like they are part of us, like they are working together to make sure they have a good life-and we also take it upon ourselves to ensure that everyone in this country has a good life and feels that they're included-then the risks of these kinds of attacks diminish and diminish massively. So, if anything comes out of this, I hope it is that we continue to fan the flames of the best of us. Vale, Sisto Malaspina, and thank you once again to everyone who stepped in and put themselves in harm's way to help ensure safety on that day.",119
209,Mr IRONS,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE," I too rise today to speak on the Bourke Street terror attack which took place on Friday, 9 November, when terrorist Hassan Khalif Shire Ali crashed his ute into the Target centre, before it went up in flames and he began attacking people with a knife. I've just listened to part of the speech from the previous speaker, the member for Melbourne, who attempted to politicise this tragic accident and say it was the fault of the political class that this attack occurred. I certainly won't demean and trivialise the death of Sisto, who went to the aid of this person, by bringing politics into this issue. This was a tragedy that occurred in Australia, and it is the kind of thing that has occurred too often. I will now talk about the actual tragedy-and the life that should be celebrated-and not politicise it. The city was sent into lockdown as Hassan Khalif Shire Ali did everything he could to intimidate and terrorise Australians going about their daily lives. That's exactly what it was: terrorism, nothing but terrorism. He wanted to terrify the people in Melbourne. It was an act of unlawful use of violence to intimidate and to create fear. We as Australians will never cop that. We will always live the way we have-with freedom to live-in this country, and no-one will ever take that away from us. I believe Australia is the greatest country on earth. It is the values and beliefs we hold as Australians that enable it to be the great country it is, and the sacrifices that have been made by many before us will never, ever be forgotten in the face of fear and terror. We will stand together and remain united. I join with my parliamentary colleagues, with the speakers before me and those who will come after me, in condemning the act of terrorism that took place in Melbourne. I will continue to do everything I can in this place to ensure that we as Australians continue to prevail in the face of evil. I will not spend too much more time giving air to the atrocities committed by Hassan Khalif Shire Ali. Instead, I'd like to spend more of the time given to me to make this statement to remember the victims. A division having been called in the House of Representatives Sitting suspended 16:59 to 17:28",120
210,Mr IRONS,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE,"As I was saying, I'd like to spend the time given to me to make this statement to remember the victims and first responders of the terror attack on Bourke Street. I extend my heartfelt thanks to the first responders who were confronted by bloody scenes, to those who ran to help while most were trying to run away. It takes a special type of person to handle that sort of work-police, paramedics, nurses and doctors-who are able to keep a calm and steady disposition in the face of fear. I acknowledge the impact these scenes would have had on them, and I hope that they all have had the time to personally grieve and digest the things that they saw on 9 November. Police identified the victims of the attack as a 24-year-old man from Hampton Park and 58-year-old Rod   hailed as heroic, and I, too, would like to extend to him my thanks for his bravery. But it is the tragic passing of Sisto Malaspina that makes this incident so devastating. Sisto owned and ran the iconic Melbourne cafe Pellegrini's, located in the heart of the CBD. As we heard at the funeral service, 'pellegrini' means 'pilgrims'. It was an honour to represent the Prime Minister, along with his wife, Jenny, at Sisto's funeral and to hear of the  impact he had on the lives of so many people. It's my privilege to share with you a little of that today so that the Hansard has on record the incredible life of Sisto Malaspina. Sisto was born in the Marche region of Italy. He was the youngest son, and his full name 'Sestilio' translates as No. 6. At Sisto's funeral, his son joked that his parents must have run out of names. David, whom I met after the funeral, gave a magnificent speech in honour of his father. Sisto, after arriving in Australia and marrying the love of his life, Vicki, bought Pellegrini's, which became an institution of Melbourne. He was the father of a son, David, and a daughter, Lisa. Sisto welcomed his first grandchild, Sofia, into the world just one week before he was taken from his family. I was lucky enough to see Sofia, and she is a beautiful baby. I'm sure she would have been better off growing up with her grandfather, but there will be many people who will tell her many stories of how good a man he was. It weighs heavy on my heart that Sofia has had her grandfather stolen from her before she had the chance to experience his love for her and his love for life itself. Sisto's son, David, shared a moving eulogy, which paid tribute to his dad's work ethic and his amazing ability to make everyone feel special, and I think that has been evident in the outpouring of love we've seen at Pellegrini's. It was a request of the family that people wear bright colours to the funeral, and it was very special to see so many people wearing bright colours to pay their respects to the bright and charismatic personality of Sisto. My wife, Cheryle, pulled out my brightest yellow tie and made sure I wore it as a mark of respect for Sisto and the family. I've read many tributes that tell similar stories of Sisto sharing coffee with his customers whom he saw as friends and giving every person who knew him the gifts of time, a listening ear and a smile which could set the world right. I didn't have the privilege of knowing Sisto personally, but, from the stories that I've heard about him, I wish I had. It's amazing how many people's lives he has touched. I'm sure we all know Bradley at the Virgin Lounge at Tullamarine. He worked for Sisto, and his sister worked for Sisto for four years. After I left the funeral, and Bradley told me about his experience with Sisto and how shattered his life was, I gave him a copy of the funeral documents from the day. He was moved because of his respect for, and knowledge of, Sisto and his family. It is the Sistos of Melbourne who have made the city what it is today, particularly after the Second World War. It was the Sistos who created businesses, raised their families and worked hard after emigrating to Australia. They were honest, caring and kept an eye out for one another. Sisto came to Australia for the life that he was able to live here, and he lived it to the fullest every single day. And that's a reminder for all of us to do the same. He'll be missed but he'll be remembered. I see the member for Melbourne Ports is about to speak. I saw him at the funeral as well, and I'm sure he'll agree with me that it was a fantastic and worthwhile send-off for a man of Sisto's character and community spirit, and I think the state funeral did him proud. Vale, Sisto, and condolences to his family.",120
211,Mr DANBY,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE," As it happens, the Thursday before Mr Malaspina was killed in the streets of Melbourne, I had a hearing of the Treaties Committee in the city. I don't go into the city much these days and I decided to flake off from the hearing and go to Pellegrini's for a bit of comfort food at lunchtime, as I have for 40 years. My late mother, Margaret, had an art gallery in Exhibition St. It's also around 40 years since her passing. As her assistant, I was paid in lasagne and would be sent up to Pellegrini's as a very sophisticated 14year-old to have lunch there-to have, as someone said, a mocha in a glass and to have one of the wonderful apple strudels that Pellegrini's provided. Always sitting at the end of the counter was Mr Malaspina, with his signature cravat, the paper and a black coffee. Pellegrini's, symbolically, gave free black coffees to all of their long standing customers the day they reopened after his tragic death. I can't imagine a person who's more iconic to Melbourne who is not in show business or in politics or well known on TV and who so many people had an affection for and who embodied that great postwar immigration that Australia has benefited from. It's hard to imagine Melbourne without the Italians or the Italian contribution. Mr Malaspina always had a good word for people. He was always encouraging. He was always interested in sports. He was a strong Essendon supporter, and you'd always have a conversation with him there. One of the things about Pellegrini's that's burned into the memories of Melburnians is that it has been the same since it opened. You sit at the bar there. You go there after the theatre for a gelato. You take a break during the day and have a coffee there. It was the first place in Melbourne that had a mocha coffee. I thought I was so sophisticated, at 14 or 15, having something like that there. And it was all made possible by Mr Malaspina and his partner. It's a great institution. People who don't go there for many years and then come back from overseas-they come back from travelling-and start working in the city always go into Pellegrini's and make use of it. My brother and his family often, in recent years, would go in there on a Friday night. The last time they did that was with my daughter prior to Simon's daughter, Shani, commencing work at the Royal Melbourne Hospital in the emergency department, where she's one of the leading nurses. So it's custom for the Danbys to go into the kitchen  at Pellegrini's prior to Shani beginning work. It was not just our family custom; it was the custom of so many Melburnians to drop into that place for some comfort food-a signature place that embodied successful Italian migration and the wonderful culture that they brought to our state and our city. The funeral at St Pat's was incredibly moving. I and Peter Khalil, the member for Wills, stood there waiting for the Leader of the Opposition, who joined us there. We saw so many people that are prominent in Melbourne life, in business and in politics. Ordinary people who we know from sports and from community organisations all were there to pay their respect. The funeral booklet is, indeed, incredibly tragic. It has a picture of him as a young, confident man in his striped shirt and cravat next to a picture of him in a similar kind of shirt-I wouldn't say the same shirt-with a cravat, holding his baby granddaughter. As the member for Swan said, Sofia was born one week before he was foully murdered by this terrorist. Many people have said to me that he embodied the ideal type of immigrant that came to Australia in the postwar immigration-hard working, friendly, family conscious, building up their own business, bringing their own culture to Melbourne and making it a much more cosmopolitan place. I regret having to end this tribute to Mr Malaspina by noting something. I'm going to be writing about this and doing something more about it. I think it's important to say we have, in a non-partisan way in this parliament, often done great things via the intelligence committee-that is, we've passed laws that have prevented mass casualty attacks. Of course, this attack was a paradigm of what these jihadists do all around the world-drive a vehicle full of gas bottles to try and blow it up amongst pedestrians, and then jump out and stab people. This happens in Kabul. This happens in London. This happens all around the world. We, here in the Australian parliament, have been very responsible, working together to try and minimise these problems, and I don't underestimate it. And because of the nature of the Australian Senate, the government and the opposition have to vote together in order to see these kinds of laws passed. There have been, some people say, 80 bills-I say it's closer to 50-that have dealt with this since 9/11, since 3,000 Americans and more than 10 Australians were murdered in the Twin Towers in New York. Unfortunately, there is one group of people which hasn't supported that serious concern with the welfare, security and safety of ordinary Australians, and that's the Greens political party. In every piece of legislation since 9/11, the Greens political party have voted against measures taken by both the opposition and government, and no-one holds them to account. They have their secret state and national conferences. They have a very low bar that they're judged by. But I think there's no more sacred right of Australian citizens to have safety and security. That's the most important human right that this parliament guarantees for the citizens of this country. An iconic person, who literally hundreds of thousands of Victorians, of Melburnians, or people who visit Pellegrini's from around Australia would have known through the decades since he took over ownership of that establishment in 1974, was murdered in the streets of Melbourne by one of these people who we've all done our best to prevent having success and killing even more people. We've been very successful, with legislation for foreign fighters and for 14to 18-year-olds who were not previously catered for by the law who involved themselves in terrorist incidents, such as the terrible event that happened in Parramatta where a 15-year-old boy murdered a Chinese-Australian police accountant. We've done everything we can to prevent this. But we are not joined in our responsibility by people who are irresponsible, and they should be held to account. You can't live in a beautiful cosmopolitan, pluralist society like Australia and not do things to protect it. The vast majority of people here are very tolerant, very intelligent and determined to make sure that we continue to live in the kind of society that we do. The parliament embodies it by the sensible legislation that it has passed. We always do everything we can to protect people's civil liberties and human rights, and we have sunset clauses et cetera. I'm all in favour of that; but when we're faced with these dangers, we must act. It's very unfortunate that in every piece of legislation-and I have research from the Parliamentary Library to show that-that the Greens political party is totally irresponsible and does not want to protect the safety of Australians, the primary human right of every citizen in this country.",121
212,Ms ODWYER,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE,"Higgins-Minister for Women and Minister for Jobs and Industrial Relations) (17:44): We are here in the federal parliament today to honour the life of Sisto Malaspina, who died in an act of terror in Melbourne on the afternoon of Friday, 9 November. Sisto was co-owner of Melbourne's most famous cafe, Pellegrini's Espresso Bar, together with Nino Pangrazio, a constituent of mine and a man that I consider to be a friend. In the city that's undergoing constant change, Pellegrini's, the top end of Bourke Street, offers us a sense of timelessness, of a Melbourne gone by. There were two things in particular that you could always expect when you visited Pellegrini's: its seemingly never-changing menu and the warm and charming Italian men who served you there. The Pellegrini's menu is a classic, from minestrone soup to simple spaghetti Bolognese or lasagne, or carbonara sprinkled with powdered parmesan cheese on top and a thick slice of bread and butter on the side, to sweet grenata or an espresso from the identical brand of coffee that has been used there for the past 60 years.  But it was the staff who made any visit to Pellegrini's an event. When you entered the cafe you'd be walking into the middle of a conversation in an Italian movie scene. You could choose to join in or sit on your own at the bar and simply enjoy the solitude and time standing still. Many famous people have been to Pellegrini's, including Russell Crowe, Ava Gardner, Gregory Peck, Fred Astaire and Anthony Perkins. Sisto-or Sestilio, as he was baptised-with his colourful shirts and stylish cravats, was one of those charming Italian men. He was warm, amusing and full of the joy of life. A tribute by John Masanauskas in the Herald Sun put it this way: Everybody knew Sisto, and he knew everybody. He was 73 years young. Six days before his tragic death he became a grandfather to baby Sofia, yet tragically Sisto died during a selfless act of kindness just a few hundred metres from his cafe. Upon seeing a vehicle aflame, Sisto immediately approached its owner to help, but he was stabbed to death by the same man, a terrorist, a man engaged in a senseless attempt to inflict terror on the city of Melbourne. Instead-and this is the great ironySisto's death and his final act of generosity united an entire city to love and to mourn Sisto Malaspina and his humanity. To Nino, I say that I know Sisto's passing deeply affects you and I know how close you were not only as business partners but also as friends. Your friendship with Sisto began when you worked together in a catering business a decade before you took over Pellegrini's. I know nothing that we can say in these circumstances can console, but I say, Nino, that you and Sisto have contributed to our country in many unforeseen ways. Australia is arguably the coffee capital of the world and Melbourne the centre of its cafe culture, a culture that joins its people together in friendship and conversation every day at all hours of the day. It is variously reported that when Pellegrini brothers, Leo and Vildo, first opened the cafe in 1954 they imported Melbourne's first espresso machine. Lygon Street establishments claim that they were the first. I cannot verify which claim is correct, but if it is true or even nearly true it could then be said that the birthplace of Australia's vibrant cafe culture is in fact Pellegrini's. In 1974 the Pellegrinis passed the torch to Sisto and his partner, Nino. Fortunately for us, nothing much was changed, nothing modernised, and the Pellegrini's sign itself is now heritage listed. Many cafes that came after Pellegrini's have tried to emulate the tradition of providing an atmosphere of being welcomed and being given good food, good coffee and good company. What a wonderful legacy and what a brave man! To the Pellegrini family of staff-which is, of course, what they are-to Nino and his family; and to Sisto's wife, Vicki, and their children, David and Lisa, I, like so many Australians, offer my deepest condolences. May Sisto rest in peace.",122
213,Mr GILES,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE," I rise to make a brief contribution to this important debate on indulgence. I start by associating myself with the remarks of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. It was a privilege to be in the House for their remarks, which summed up our response to tragic events and our responsibility to look beyond those events. In making some very brief remarks, I want to speak as a Melburnian about what unites us. I was very pleased to be here for the contribution of Minister O'Dwyer, the member for Higgins. I'm also very pleased to be here with you Deputy Speaker Kevin Andrews and my friends the member for Melbourne Ports and the member for Deakin-all Melburnians, who differ on issues from time to time but, I think, share a love of our city and a responsibility towards it in this place and as Melburnians. I want to talk both about what happened in Bourke Street and what it means and also about Pellegrini's and what it means and what Sisto meant to so many. I will do so in turn briefly. I've only been in this parliament a very short time, and this is the third occasion that I've spoken on indulgence about a senseless act of terror in Melbourne-with different causes, actually. It brings me enormous sadness, and I think it presents us all with a great challenge to recognise all of the great issues that we have to wrestle with and to recognise the burden that's placed on our first responders-and I acknowledge their efficiency, their professionalism and indeed their heroism, and that of the ordinary Melburnians. Those of us who have spent our working life, or a large proportion of it, in the city understand the dynamics of Bourke Street at peak hour on a Friday. It's pretty easy to think about what an awful change those few moments presented to all involved, not just Sisto, who tragically lost his life, and others who were injured-and I know my friend the member for Bass will touch on that shortly-but to all of us. How do we get the balance right between facilitating the joy and excitement that is Melbourne on a Friday evening, celebrating the freedoms that we cherish, celebrating our civil liberties, and ensuring we are all kept safe? I know that we have processes in this place which have served us well, and there are processes undertaken by the Victorian government too. It is important that we strive for bipartisanship. It's important that we strive to engage community on this journey-in particular, the wider Muslim Australian community, especially those who I am very proud to represent in this place, in the electorate of Scullin, who have expressed their horror at the events that defile their religion as well as our city.  To Pellegrini's: I think all of us have memories, and I don't pretend that mine are particularly important beyond myself, but I think that, in Pellegrini's, we see an icon and, in Sisto, the embodiment of that icon, of generosity, of our best side-a multiculturalism born of sharing and an interest in others which I think characterises Melburnians at our best. I think it was a fitting recognition of an extraordinary individual that the Premier offered the Malaspina family a state funeral. It says a lot about Melbourne. We care a lot about coffee, and we care more about people who shape our city. It was wonderful to see the representation at that funeral, and it was a privilege to hear from the Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister, who represented the Prime Minister there, and to share his reflections. Perhaps even more wonderful than the acts of political leadership was the extraordinary response from individual Melburnians talking about the joy that Sisto had given them and their families and people that they care about. I think of many bowls of pasta and many more post-lunch espressos enjoyed at the bar, and the atmosphere that was part-cafe, part-theatre that Sisto curated-I think that might be the word. Those memories will live on, as will our enduring love and respect for the man. Our thoughts, of course, are with his family, and I extend them also to those who knew him and loved him more generally. I ask myself, 'Where to from here?' in considering both of these things-our recognition of Sisto and those directly affected and our response to the challenge. Well, I think there are complicated debates that require consideration, but there's also the question of our human response, and I was particularly struck by the closing remarks of the Leader of the Opposition when he spoke on this matter. He reflected on his last encounter and invited us to imagine our last encounter, and I think of this as being not just the last conversation between the member for Maribyrnong and Sisto Malaspina but how we always treat those who matter to us-not knowing how many opportunities we have to continue to enjoy their company. I think the invocation for those of us who are charged with legislating and making executive decisions on behalf of Melburnians and Australians is to think hard about the security challenges and to think hard about getting the balance between national security and the preservation of civil liberties right, which is, of course, the purpose of those national security arrangements, but also to think about our responsibility to each other as humans and as citizens, to think about the kindness that requires and to think about what the challenge that the Leader of the Opposition's reflections on a last conversation that he never imagined would be a last conversation means. Rest in peace, Sisto.",123
214,Mr FRYDENBERG,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE," I rise to pay tribute to a great Melburnian and a great Australian, Sisto Malaspina, who bought Pellegrini's with his friend Nino Pangrazio in 1974. Pellegrini's was established in 1954 and was famous for importing Australia's first espresso machine. Now there's an espresso machine on every corner. Sisto turned out to be a custodian for a great Italian tradition in Australia and helped grow Pellegrini's into the institution it is today. Sisto, along with his wife, Vicki, was a constituent of mine in Kooyong, and his only granddaughter, Sofia, was born one week before his death. He was known for his collection of cravats and for his generosity to all those who entered his cafe. One of my electorate staff, Maria Benedetti, tells the story of her son, Nick, turning up at the cafe in his Xavier uniform. He went to pay and Sisto said to him: 'Don't pay now. Come back when you've graduated.' Sisto wasn't born in Australia, but he represented what Australia is: an accepting, progressive, multicultural, free society. It's best summed up in what he said about his coffee, his passion and his beloved city of Melbourne. As the Prime Minister told the chamber, in Italy they follow a bible when it comes to drinking coffee: Italians usually don't drink cappuccinos after midday, and it's unthinkable to have one after dinner. But, in Australia, Sisto didn't follow those rules. He'd say, 'People should drink their coffee how they like it, the way they like it, when they like it.' As the Prime Minister said, it might sound like a small thing, but that respect for others, tolerance and acceptance of difference are the foundation of modern society and modern Australia, the most successful immigrant country in the entire world and something we should be very proud of. In a quiet moment before coming back to Canberra just a little while ago, I dropped into Pellegrini's to have a mandarin granita and to talk to the locals. The mood was very sombre but resilient. The staff came and said hello, and we shared a hug. The message that all the members in this place send to the people of Australia is that events like this shouldn't divide us and events like this shouldn't defeat us. Rather, they should unite us in redoubling our efforts to continue with the things that make Australia great. Sisto had a smile. Sisto had passion. Sisto was a patriot, and he never forgot his immigrant roots. We pay tribute to Sisto in the nation's parliament today for upholding the very Australian way of life that he, himself, helped create.",124
215,Mr HART,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE," I thank you for the opportunity to speak on this statement of indulgence with respect to the events that occurred in Bourke Street, Melbourne, on Friday, 9 November 2018. I've read-indeed,  heard-many heartfelt tributes to Sisto Malaspina, who was killed in the attack. He was clearly, and justifiably, regarded as a Melbourne institution. From those tributes, he appeared to me to embody an aspect of Melbourne that speaks of its open, friendly engagement with people from all cultures and the magic that comes from the combination of hospitality, wine, coffee, and food. But I want to speak today about a constituent. That constituent is Rod Patterson, who is one of the persons injured in the attack. Another person was injured-a 24-year-old security guard. It is appropriate that I explain that less than two weeks before this incident Rod gave an address at my uncle's funeral. Rod gave a marvellous address encapsulating the life, loves, and activities of my uncle, Terry Powell. Rod and Terry were good friends, neighbours, and co-conspirators in many escapades-sometimes involving late-night beers-and saw each other's children grow up. I know that Terry would not have been surprised that Rod ran towards a burning vehicle, implicitly placing himself in danger-even if this had been some sort of benign accident-seemingly without care for his safety. Rod was a former firefighter. He said in an interview with ABC after his release from hospital: The old fireman Rod came out of me. I got up, raced over, and I'm looking inside the cabin, because the driver side door was burst open, to see whether there was someone I was going to pull out, and there was no-one inside. Rod was attacked, as was Sisto and the other victim. Sisto was fatally stabbed. Rod ended up receiving a 10centimetre-long gash that had cut through muscle and, importantly, an artery, and required more than 120 internal and external stitches. As we've heard today, we live in a fortunate country, where bystanders will rush towards danger, without consideration for their safety, in order to assist those who might require their help. It is difficult for us to understand the motivations behind such terror attacks-whether or not the perpetrator suffers from a mental illness or whether the delusion is driven by a particular ideology. But it's also difficult to understand that our police, firefighters, paramedics and our hospital surgeons, nurses, and OA staff have to engage with the consequences of those deluded acts, and do so with such confidence that they are doing the right thing in protecting the safety of the general public. I know that training assists in ensuring that even retired firefighters instinctively react-as they've done in the past-to protect lives and rescue those in danger. We owe all of them a debt of gratitude for their service-indeed, their instinctive reactions. I think also of the police who may have thought that they were attending a traffic accident and ultimately had to act at the highest level to protect human life-ultimately confronting the offender. Such is the immediacy of modern communication that many of us saw, on hastily shot video shared on social media, the attack and the aftermath of the incident in almost real-time, whatever we were doing at that time and wherever we were. But this brings me back to my acknowledgement of the actions of Rod Patterson. Just as communication of the terror incident spread through social media, multiple informal and formal networks shared the information that a Northern Tasmanian man had been involved and had been injured as a result of the terror attack. The fact that a person that many people in my community know and trust was caught in the Bourke Street terror attack emphasised to me that security long ago ceased to be regarded as an abstract consideration. We know that our response to the threat of terrorism cannot and must not be one-dimensional. The fact is that a person seeking to do harm as a terrorist or, for that matter, to exploit public fear for notoriety for whatever purpose can utilise low-tech means to cause that harm. In this environment a person may use a vehicle as a weapon or could, as in this case, use LPG cylinders and a knife for deadly effect. I would like to think that, in assessing the risks of homegrown terrorism, proper regard is had to the likelihood that a mentally ill person either might be motivated to cause harm to others based upon a delusion or may in turn be susceptible to manipulation to achieve that same end. In essence, therefore, just as we have learned that engagement with particular ethnic and religious communities is important to ensure that dangerous ideologies are identified and reported, so too do we need to be conscious that at least in the area of mental health there may be many undiagnosed and untreated persons who may pose a threat if they become exposed to particular ideologies or their delusions lead them to believe that confrontation with police and/or security services can further their misguided objectives. In other words, the identification of potential risks to public safety extends beyond merely a review of persons who may have been exposed to terrorist ideology. It also extends to a person who by reason of their particular circumstances or their mental health or drug induced delusions may be more susceptible to seeing violence as a tool that they can use to make a statement, whether that statement is for political purposes or is later coopted for political purposes or not. Having said that, the undeniable truth is that, whether Victoria Police faced that particular assailant on 9 November or whether they faced another assailant in a different situation on another sort of criminal rampage, they were and are required to act to protect human life. My most heartfelt thanks and respect is extended to all the first responders-the police, the paramedics, the ambulance officers and others who step into address the aftermath of significant public events occasioning trauma and/or death. Sometimes those responders are  volunteers in every sense of the word. Rod Patterson was one such volunteer. He ran into danger and was subsequently stabbed in the head for his trouble. Rod, I know my fellow citizens of Launceston and Northern Tasmania are proud of your actions in seeking to rescue someone from a burning vehicle but ending up in hospital as a result of the attack. Your generosity of spirit and your willingness to chip in and help assorted charities and assorted causes in my community, whether in business or in your personal life, mean that there are many people wishing you the very best for a safe and speedy recovery. Well done, Rod. Sisto, I'm sorry I didn't get to meet you. It's clear to me that your legend will live on.",124
216,Mr SUKKAR,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE," It's a melancholy duty for all of us here in the chamber today to speak on this motion, offering condolences on the death of Sisto Malaspina, particularly for all the Melburnians in the chamber. A lot has been said about Sisto Malaspina. The reality is, for anyone born and bred in Melbourne-and there are hundreds of thousands of people who fall into this category-who attended or dined at Pellegrini's, or visited, you felt like you knew Sisto. Sisto made you feel special. The way Sisto greeted you when you walked in the door was the embodiment of who he was. In my life, I probably only visited Pellegrini's half a dozen times, and even I felt great emotion when I first heard of Sisto's tragic death. It came home to me just how many people were feeling the same way, because we all felt we knew him-he embodied our values. I want to pay my deepest condolences to his wife, Vicky, and children, David and Lisa. How tragic that just a week earlier his granddaughter Sofia was born. How tragic-the happiness and the emotion for that family, for Sisto and his granddaughter-it was spoken about his funeral-to have that ripped away from them, in the way it was, is so tragic. Sisto must never be remembered for the way his life ended. He has to be remembered for the way he lived his life. Coming to Australia in 1963, he displayed, he demonstrated-as I said earlier, he epitomised-the migrant experience into Australia. He came here, he rolled his sleeves up, he lived and enjoyed the freedom of Australia, he created employment for others, he created prosperity for others, he brought joy to so many people, and of course he built a better life for his family. Isn't that the migrant experience? Isn't that the motivation for people who come to Australia-to ensure that their children and grandchildren have better opportunities than they had themselves? And, boy, did Sisto make the most of those opportunities. He opened Pellegrini's with his very good friend, Nino Pangrazio. As was referred to at the funeral, Nino and Sisto were a bit like salt and pepper. What an enduring partnership they had in a friendship sense, in a business sense, that, again, demonstrates the sort of person that Sisto was. I want to remark, just very briefly, on the tragic circumstances that led to his death. By no means should Sisto's life be defined by this, but the reality is Sisto, a generous, kind-hearted man, saw somebody in trouble-or so he thought-in Bourke Street, and without flinching, without questioning, he went to that person's aid. He saw a car on fire in the middle of Bourke Street. Without thinking, he went to help that person. Tragically, shockingly, as it turned out, that person was the one who ripped him away from his family and from all Melburnians. This is a serious challenge for our country. The member for Melbourne Ports outlined it very wisely. It's a challenge that we have to ensure we're up to. It's a challenge that, to date, Australia has done a good job on. But fundamentalist Islamic terrorism is something that is not just a theoretical problem that we discuss in universities or parliaments. It affects the lives of real people. It has affected the life of this great man, his family, his friends and, as I said, the many, many hundreds of thousands of people impacted by it. So that's what, in the end, motivates all of us in this chamber: to ensure that we keep Australians safe and that we never, ever wave the white flag on fundamentalist Islamic terrorism, and do everything we have to to combat this very insidious ideology. But, again, I think it's more fitting to end on a high note: speaking about Sisto Malaspina's life. I was on the phone to a friend of mine last night who happened to just mention the number of times that he and his wife would attend Pellegrini's. Before the theatre it was always packed; you could never get a seat. The last time they were there, which was only a couple of months ago, Sisto said, 'If you don't mind, come down the back. I've got a couple of spots on a crate in the kitchen.' Doesn't that just highlight the generosity, the warmth, the mark of the man? We've heard so many similar stories, and, indeed, we all have a Sisto story. Rest in peace, Sisto Malaspina. Thank you for your life. Thank you for the example you've set for us all. I hope we can live up to that example and ensure that we don't suffer-and that nobody suffers-in the way you have again.",126
217,Ms RYAN,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE," Like all Melburnians-and I'm flanked by Melburnians in the chamber this evening-I was sickened to hear of the events that unfolded on Bourke Street on 9 November. Our lively and vibrant city was brought to a standstill at the hands of one lone individual who intentionally set out to inflict harm on and damage the identity of our city by threatening the freedoms that we all enjoy. Like all locals, I  was bewildered to learn that someone who was raised and had lived amongst us could be capable of inflicting such violence. Equally, I was perplexed by the lack of respect for human life and for our wonderful community. Like all locals, I was angered that the unforgivable, murderous action of one individual had cast a dark cloud over our broader, proud and inclusive community-a community that was built on and proudly fosters diversity and multiculturalism. Like all the others who've spoken today in this chamber, I express my thanks and appreciation for the efforts of the first responders. I thank members of the Victoria Police who acted so swiftly and in such a disciplined manner. I add my praise to the members of the public who assisted so quickly and, equally, thank the emergency service crews for their professional response. There is pride in the efforts of these first responders, whose humanitarian instinct in the face of such an appalling act was to help. It affirms the spirit of Melbourne. And I know I join the Melbourne community and our local Italian community in Werribee, Werribee South and across Wyndham in mourning the loss of a great contributor to our marvellous, multicultural Melbourne story. Sisto lost his life doing what we hope we would all do: going to someone to offer help when they appeared to need it-because that is what our community is all about, and that is what makes me proud to call Melbourne home. Like everyone, it is that fact that touches me and appals me most. Sisto Malaspina embodied multicultural Melbourne, and his contribution to our community is one that is symbolic of this. Many will have fond memories of the man who, like many others in our community, left behind his country of birth and loved ones to build a new life and a new home in Melbourne. I didn't know Sisto personally. I've probably been to Pellegrini's, but I know Sistos that I grew up next to. I know Sistos who came to our community in Werribee after the war to make a new life. I know, too, that hospitality is a universal value, and I know that, in my community, I can go to modern coffee shops now. I think of Chatterbox in Watton Street, where a young Lebanese Muslim man has created a new place that, like Pellegrini's, serves people daily. It is the heartbeat of our local community. If you want to know what's going on, you step into Chatterbox. So, although I didn't know Sisto, I know that, like many Melburnians from all corners of the earth who brought their heritage with them, Sisto brought to Bourke Street his proud Italian heritage, as have many others in my community, and shared it with the thousands of customers who walked through the doors of his famous Pellegrini's Espresso Bar. The loss to Melbourne is deep, not just because this individual touched so many lives, as we've heard here today, but because he epitomises the Melbourne story. I extend my sincere condolences to Sisto's family, friends and customers. I express my deepest sympathy to all those in our community who have been touched by this tragedy and hope they, like me, take solace in knowing that the murderous actions of one individual do not reflect our broad, inclusive, multicultural community. I would end on this note. I have spoken to several young people from the Somali community in my local area, and I want to share with this House that they share the thoughts that are being delivered here today. They feel injured and they are finding it difficult to express their emotions about these events and how they reflect now on them. They're struggling. So I would encourage those who know members of the Somali community to reach out to them to make sure that they are not isolated because of the actions of one deranged, murderous individual.",126
218,Mr KHALIL,STATEMENTS ON INDULGENCE," While as Melburnians, as Victorians and as Australians, we're all again shocked and angered by the terrorist attack in the heart of Melbourne on Bourke Street on 9 November, it's probably true to say we've been here before. We've experienced this collective trauma, this hatred, many times before. Again, in response, we are resolved to defeat the hatred that drives these terrorist attacks. But we're also deeply saddened by these events, and all our thoughts pour out to the families of the victims. As the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition have said in their remarks in the House today, Sisto Malaspina, the co-owner of the iconic, famous Pellegrini's cafe restaurant, was stabbed and killed by this terrorist. I, like thousands of Melburnians, knew and loved Sisto. I would go into Pellegrini's for a coffee or a pasta, and he'd force me to have a dessert on top of that, every time. You can see that he did his job well. His warmth, his joy and his generosity of spirit have been a mainstay in our city for decades. He was full of life, and, in death, he was really a hero, too, because, by all accounts, Sisto's last act in his very colourful life was an act of kindness in going to the aid of this terrorist when his car caught fire. Sisto could only have assumed that this fellow was in trouble, so the last act in his life was an act of kindness, in going to someone to assist them. The terrorist left his vehicle and stabbed and killed Sisto, but, having done that, he was unable to then drive the car further down Bourke Street to a more crowded location to blow it up. So, if there had been no kindness from Sisto in that last act of his life, many more innocent people would probably have died that day. Sisto's final act of kindness contrasted so dramatically with the last hateful acts of that murderer, and it undoubtedly saved many lives. There's been an outpouring of grief in Melbourne and around Australia, and I think that reflects the joy Sisto gave to so many during his life. But I think his act of kindness also touched a nerve, because it really symbolised  the elemental struggle we all face between love and hatred, good and evil, kindness to others as opposed to wanton destruction. He will be so, so missed by the community. His son, David, spoke beautifully about his father at the state funeral, and my condolences also go out to his family and the broader Pellegrini's family that loved him so much. As to the causes of these terrorist acts, we've discussed this many times in this place. We know that the terrorist was a radicalised individual. There are some reports that he was mentally unstable at the least, and we know that radicalisation preys on those who are vulnerable to that process. Much has been said of the Prime Minister's calls for Muslim leaders to do more. All I can say is that most of the Islamic and Muslim community leaders-the sheikhs and the imams-particularly in my electorate, and, I know, right across the state and the nation, are working very, very hard to support their youth, to create inclusive environments and to make sure that their young people are on the right path and protected from this radicalisation. And, of course, it's important to engage with the government on the state and federal level to make that happen and to prevent radicalisation. Of course, we know that our intelligence and security agencies already work so well behind the scenes, and very effectively, with the Muslim community. There is no denying that the Australian Muslim community is absolutely critical to breaking that cycle. The work that they do with our agencies and with state and federal governments is absolutely important. Let me just say this to the Australian Muslim community and to the community in my electorate and across the nation: you are not responsible for the actions of one individual. We know the work you are doing to actually help fight radicalisation in your own communities. That is something that is as critically important to your communities as it is to the broader Australian community. We in government, and our agencies, look at the research around radicalisation-what actually works, how we can apply that to both policy and counterterrorism efforts, the mechanisms and avenues that are in place that break down barriers with law enforcement and social, medical and educational services-so that we can reach those individuals before they become a problem. The work that's done with all of the agencies in government to forge those connections is so important-the connections with community leaders, with family, with friends, who work day to day with their young people to support and include them and actually protect them from harm. Lastly, I want to say that as political leaders in this place we must make a choice. There are really two types of political leadership. There's the type that seeks to unite Australians-to work with them, despite their background, their ethnicity or their faith-and seeks to push away the forces of division and hatred. Then there's the type of leadership-I wouldn't even call it leadership-the kind of politics that uses fear and preys on the fears of people to divide people based on race, ethnicity or faith. Often, that's done for short-term political gain. Often it's done as an easy way-a shortcut-to gain votes. My colleagues and I, and many colleagues on the other side, agree that we need much more of the political leadership that seeks to unite us. When we're faced with these threats, when we're faced with these challenges-the threats that we face within our community, but also externally-we have to remain united against those threats. The Australian Muslim community is part of that united team. They're a critically important part of helping us fight those threats. In many respects, we owe it to all of the victims of terror-to Sisto, his family, all those injured and all the victims-to get this right, to make this work. In closing, I know that the Malaspina family are suffering greatly at the moment, but they do take great comfort in the knowledge of his remarkable legacy to the city of Melbourne and the joy that he's given to so many thousands of Melburnians, and interstate and international visitors as well. He really has touched our country in ways that make us proud of the multicultural and migrant country that we live in, because Sisto is the type of person who demonstrates the success of multicultural Australia-the hard work that he did, the life that he built and the joy that he spread around him and his community. May he rest in peace. My condolences to the Malaspina family and all of those who've been touched and have suffered under these terrible attacks. May he rest in peace. NA",127
219,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE, I propose the question: That grievances be noted. Shortland Electorate,128
220,Mr CONROY,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," I'm pleased to provide the House with an update on the state of Shortland as we come to the end of 2018. This year has been quite momentous nationally, and it's been a busy one locally. I want to start by saying to the people of Shortland that it has again been an immense privilege to represent you in our nation's parliament. It's the fifth year I have served as the member for our region, first as the member for Charlton and then as the member for Shortland. It is a privilege that I never take for granted. I'm immensely grateful for the trust the people of Shortland have placed in me.  Before I draw the attention of the House to some of the highlights of 2018 in Shortland, I do want to reflect on events at a national level, particularly in recent months. It's beyond disappointing that we are now onto our third Liberal Prime Minister in five years. The Liberals and Nationals have clearly not learnt the lessons of the pastthat is, when Australians elect a government, unless there are some extraordinary circumstances, they expect the person who is the leader of that government to serve a full three-year term. If they do not understand the most basic lesson in Australian politics, they wouldn't have committed regicide again just a few months ago. The assassination of Malcolm Turnbull demonstrates with devastating clarity that the Liberal Party haven't learnt that lesson and that they care more about their internal opinions than serving the public. It's no wonder that Australians are so cynical about politics and politicians, given recent events. I will begin my review of 2018 in Shortland at the end of the year. Last week saw me hosting the Shortland Volunteer Awards. This is always one of the highlights of my job as a local member, recognising the selflessness and service of those in my electorate, who are anything but ordinary and who really do make an extraordinary difference in the life of our community. I want to congratulate all those who were recognised: Rhonda Domanit, Roxanna Krueger, John Cornish, Garry Stewart, Donald Roach, James Cameron, Therese Goodwin, Lachlan Steffner, Lara Wilbow, Zachery Renshaw, Kylee Peters, Samantha Peters, Michael Buckland, Steven Dunn, Robyn Roberts, Linda Clee, Christopher Hartley, Max Holmes, Ray Hinton, Elizabeth Horwitz, Mary Steenson and Montana Shoesmith. Thank you for your service to the Shortland community. I also congratulate the following groups who received volunteer awards: Sailability, the Swansea Belmont Surf Life Saving Club, the Cardiff District Men's Shed, the Rotary Club of Belmont and Swansea Meals on Wheels. Thank you for your service too. I particularly want to acknowledge the 2018 Shortland Volunteer of the Year, Graham Burge. Graham is president of the Swansea Belmont Surf Life Saving Club, and he's a well-deserving recipient of this award. As president, Graham is obviously involved in all aspects of the club and over the past two years has been integral in organising the New South Wales Surf Life Saving state titles at Blacksmiths Beach, in which 4,000 competitors participate. Shortland has the best beaches in Australia. Our surf lifesaving clubs are such a fantastic part of our community, so I'm very pleased to be able to honour Graham and the club's contribution to Shortland. Another highlight of the year as MP is the competition I hold for primary school students throughout Shortland to design the Shortland Christmas card. Firstly, thank you to all the boys and girls who took part in the competition. With almost 400 entries, picking the winner was a tough choice. A big congratulations, however, to the winner of the competition, Isabella Bliss, from Valentine Public School, and also to Abby Smith of Charlestown South Public and Lacey Joyce from St Pat's at Swansea, who were highly commended for their efforts. The winning entry was a great Christmas card. It depicted Rudolph piloting a sailboat on Lake Macquarie for some water-skiing reindeer. It had a great pun, which I really enjoyed, of 'Ski you later' in the caption. As a fan of great puns, this really ticked all the boxes, and the artwork, a beautiful sunset on Lake Macquarie-the most beautiful lake in our country-was a great effort. A great part of my job is meeting and talking with primary school students about parliament and my role as MP. From what I see, our country's future is bright and safe in the hands of the next generation. A fantastic initiative of the Australian Sports Commission is a Local Sporting Champions program, which all members are pleased to support.

221,Mr CONROY,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"As I was saying, a fantastic initiative of the Australian Sports Commission is the Local Sporting Champions program, which all members are pleased to support. It has been a privilege to meet young people excelling at sports such as netball, basketball, fencing and even petanque. There are too many recipients to name here for the past year, but all of them can be very proud of their achievements and I wish them all well in their future endeavours. Members of parliament also have an opportunity to be involved in the Stronger Communities Program. I congratulate the following organisations who have been successful so far in obtaining grants in the latest round for Shortland: the Belmont Neighbourhood Centre, for installing solar panels; the Caves Beach Surf Life Saving Club, for acoustic panelling in their club hall; Charlestown Junior Cricket Club, for installing professional nets; Macquarie Hills Community Preschool, for furniture; Marine Rescue Lake Macquarie, for a storage shed for their jet ski at their Pelican base; and, finally, Redhead Surf Lifesaving Club, for replacing club kitchen equipment. I was pleased to recently visit Camp Breakaway, who were successful in obtaining a grant of $11,800 to upgrade their activity lodge, particularly the safety railings, windows and doors. Camp Breakaway is a very  special place. It gives an opportunity for parents of children with a disability to enjoy a supported holiday with their child. It's always great to see these community groups doing great things in Shortland and improving the ways in which everyone can participate in our community. On another note entirely, when looking back at 2018 all of us will be aware of the shocking revelations that have come out of the banking royal commission-the royal commission that the Liberals and Nationals did everything in their power to prevent in order to protect their mates at the big end of town. A brave fighter for justice in this is my constituent, Michelle Matheson. I've spoken about Michelle previously in this place but I again place on the record my thanks for her campaigning for the royal commission and for keeping me up to date with her struggle. In the last sitting period I spoke on the national apology following the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse. I reiterate that the region I represent was and continues to be terribly scarred by the abuse that it suffered at the hands of institutions. I again pay tribute to the Newcastle Herald and Joanne MCCarthy, whose work was fundamentally important in establishing the royal commission. It has been a big year across Shortland. As always it was good to attend the GOATS Family Festival at San Remo, which was organised by the Epicentre. I congratulate Jillian Hogan and her team on a fantastic day. Lake Macquarie City Council's Living Smart Festival attracted tens of thousands of people to Speers Point, and it was pleasing to see the people I represent and especially their children interested in the environment, climate change and how we act locally to ensure a sustainable future. I have continued to host a series of mobile offices across the electorate for constituents who may have difficulty attending my office. I always find these great opportunities to hear directly from constituents about the issues that are important to them and how I can assist. Over 40,000 people in Shortland are over the age of 60. Throughout this year I have met with men's sheds, held three seniors expos and had lunch with the Belmont Hospital's pink ladies, who this year celebrated 70 years of volunteering and fundraising. I thank them all for their invaluable contributions to the electorate. I had the great honour of continuing the annual ovarian cancer morning tea event, which my comrade and predecessor Jill Hall started. This year we raised over $5,000 for the Cancer Council. I thank all the attendees for making it a great day. My office continues to have constituents experiencing delays from an understaffed Centrelink. However, the most disturbing development during 2018 has been the dramatic increase in the number of inquiries my office has received regarding the NDIS. This is an issue I have raised in the House on more than one occasion. All of us in this place are committed to this scheme. I am frustrated that so many of my constituents are not experiencing the choice and control that they were promised. That was the intent of the scheme. I will continue to work with the agency and my constituents to get a better outcome in 2019. Finally, it is my fervent wish that 2019 will see the election of a Labor government and that, as a country, we can finally close the chapter on almost six years of deadlock and drift under the coalition. I said in my first speech as the member for Shortland that my priorities for the electorate are Labor's priorities for Australia-jobs, schools and hospitals. It is this platform that I and my party will seek a mandate for in the coming years. I am glad, for example, that we have already committed $20 million to Shortland schools as part of our broader schools package. We will fight on Medicare, access to universal health care, taking action on climate change and dealing with the very necessary energy transition. I very much hope to be Shortland's voice in a future Labor government. On behalf of the people of Shortland, I wish everyone a merry Christmas and a happy and safe new year. O'Connor Electorate: Cancer Care Services Mr RICK WILSON (O'Connor) (18:51): I use this grievance debate as an opportunity to raise the unresolved issue of a fully funded linear accelerator machine, which will be granted to Albany through the federal Radiation Oncology Health Program Grants scheme. The machine is proposed to be operational by July 2019, but to date it has nowhere yet to call home. Back in 2017 GenesisCare secured funding to help provide a radiation therapy service to cancer patients living in the Great Southern part of my electorate of O'Connor. Their application met the federal government requirements to prove that this was an area of need. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare's cancer incidence projections indicated that the Great Southern planning region was in need of a radiotherapy facility. Support was secured from the WA Clinical Oncology Group, who advise the WA Cancer Council. In the WACOG letter dated April 2017 they quoted figures from the WA Department of Health's 2017 cancer registry. The cancer incidence for the Great Southern was 'expected to be 440 cases, projecting forward to an estimated 591 cases in 2027'. They state:  This 2017 incidence rate of 658 cases per 100,000 persons is considerably higher than the overall WA average of 527 cases per 100,000 persons. They also commented that 'approximately 50 per cent of all new cancer cases are deemed eligible for some course of radiation oncology treatment' and that regional and rural residents experience 'higher proportional rates of incidents, morbidity and mortality due to being diagnosed with cancer'. In their June 2017 letter to the grant recipient, GenesisCare, our government reiterated that there was a demonstrated need for a radiation therapy unit in the Great Southern region of O'Connor. This federal funding was to be spent on a linear accelerator, a CT simulator and a CT interfacing planning and computer system for up to three workstations. Since then GenesisCare have been working on how they can make this happen in Albany. In June this year GenesisCare's general manager, Michael Davis, and I met. He suggested that this machine could be operational within 12 months if it were co-located at the Albany Health Campus. His least preferred option was for it to be installed in a purpose-built private facility. He said that it would take twice as long to become operational and cost approximately twice as much to build. In addition, this private service would be less accessible for public patients. Michael Davis explained that co-location at the Albany Health Campus would create synergies with existing diagnostic, surgical, chemotherapy and hospice facilities that support those living with cancer in the Great Southern. GenesisCare already services the Great Southern with a visiting oncologist who has consulted in Albany for over 15 years. I had the pleasure of meeting the oncologist, Professor David Joseph, last week, and he was excited about the prospect of offering his patients radiation therapy close to home, with the support of their families, friends and local doctors nearby. I've met with many of the local GP fraternity in Albany. Most of them are similarly enthusiastic about the Genesis project to bring radiation oncology services to Albany. Currently, their cancer patients have to travel 330 kilometres to Bunbury or 400 kilometres to Perth to be treated at other GenesisCare facilities. GenesisCare has indicated that this is at considerable expense to the state government, and any repurposing of these costs towards treatment of patients at the Albany Health Campus would improve the viability of their proposed service. On 9 August I wrote to WA health minister, Roger Cook, requesting he meet with GenesisCare at his earliest opportunity to consider the option of co-locating at the Albany Health Campus. What followed was an ugly slanging match played out in local media, suggesting that I had no idea what I was talking about. When I quoted Genesis as estimating $3 million to attach a bunker onto the existing Albany Health Campus, versus $5 million to $7 million to build a private facility from scratch, the minister claimed that the true cost would be around $14 million. Minister Cook and local MLA Peter Watson suggested that my interest was merely a pre-election exercise and that the federal government grant of $6.6 million for a machine was akin to providing a homeless person with furniture or buying a saddle without a horse. But I note that this grant was allocated some 15 months ago, and, to my knowledge, the election has not yet been called. Instead, I refer the minister to the efforts of those who have been passionate about this issue: people like Mary Williams, who over two years ago began a public fundraising campaign towards the Albany Radiation Machine Project; groups like the Denmark Community Foundation and Soroptimist International of Albany, who have come on board with their support; and people like the farmers who wrapped their silage in eye-catching pink plastic and donated the sale proceeds to support the radiation machine project campaign. This is the real campaign-raising awareness and the necessary funds towards a machine, one hard-earned dollar at a time. Then there are those whose lives have been touched by cancer; those who hold great hope for therapies like radiation treatment to prolong and even save their lives. Who could not fail to be moved by their plight? When federal Minister for Health Greg Hunt visited Albany in early October, it was not a campaign for Rick Wilson. It was to sit down with the proponents behind closed doors and discuss how best we could get this machine installed and operational as soon as possible. Everyone agreed that all levels of government needed to collaborate with GenesisCare to make this a reality, and, for this to happen, we needed to properly quantify the community support. To this end, we've started an electronic petition on petition.org, and to date we've collected over 1,300 signatures. Mary and her team collected hard-copy signatures at the Albany show the other weekend, adding another 300 to that tally, and we're still counting. The media has finally recognised the grassroots support, and I thank The Western Weekender in particular for their balanced reportage. Minister Hunt also committed to raising the matter in person with Minister Cook at a recent COAG health ministers' meeting. On 25 October, I received a letter from Minister Hunt confirming that this had been done, and on 1 November I finally received a response from Minister Cook. Minister Cook stated that Albany already had comprehensive cancer care facilities and that WA Country Health Service had completed a comprehensive cancer strategy for 2017 to 2022 which provided guidance and 'direction for the development of a cancer service across country Western Australia.' He stated:  A project such as this would require significant service and facility planning. An assessment of the potential patient activity to ensure service viability, the recurrent costs and any future unknown cost for public patients in addition to the significant capital works required would all need to be assessed. However, he added, 'In the first instance, I've requested the WA Country Health Service to undertake a feasibility study.' I thank Minister Cook for committing to that undertaking, and I thank him for finally agreeing to meet with GenesisCare to discuss face-to-face their proposal. Last Friday I toured GenesisCare's impressive metropolitan facility in Wembley in Perth. They reiterated to me that they are confident they can install this machine for a fraction of what the state government has estimated. In fact, they are so confident in their figures that they have offered to pay for the feasibility study to save the state the time and the cost of commissioning their own. While I welcome the minister's office conducting a feasibility study, I believe this only happened as a result of the grassroots community campaign led by Mary Williams and her team. I'll continue to support and encourage this campaign, and will continue to gather signatures for the petition. I will personally engage with as many community groups as possible over the next couple of months, building on the groundswell of support that we already have. But I call on Minister Cook to work with the federal government, with health professionals of the Great Southern and with the wider Great Southern community to bring about this radiation therapy facility in Albany at the earliest possible opportunity. I ask him to do this not for Rick Wilson but for the best possible health and welfare outcomes for those living with cancer in the Great Southern. Broadband",129
222,Ms BRODTMANN,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this grievance debate tonight. I welcome the opportunity because I'll be talking about an issue with which I've had a grievance for a very, very long time, Deputy Speaker Hogan, and you would know this from hearing me speak in this Chamber. So it is no surprise that, tonight, I'm going to be talking about the NBN. The first time the ACT appeared on any NBN rollout map was in October 2012. My electorate of Canberra, along with many others across Australia, was not on that rollout map, nor was it on the next iteration. So I mounted a campaign, because, at that stage in 2012, when we had one iteration after another, Canberra just continued to be one big, blank space on the NBN rollout map. So I began my sustained, tireless 'Send me your speeds' campaign to actually get Canberra on the NBN rollout map. It finally paid off, and there was much rejoicing. There was much rejoicing in this Chamber. I don't know whether you were in the chair, Deputy Speaker, but I did much rejoicing in this Chamber when we finally got onto the NBN rollout map. I advocated to get this community-the nation's capital!-on the NBN rollout map and, finally, the government deigned to put the nation's capital on the rollout map and suggested that it would be connected in 2017. But, Deputy Speaker, you would not be surprised to hear that, despite my enthusiasm and my general excitement about the fact that we were finally on the rollout map, the goalposts started to move. They began to move early this year in terms of when the rollout was actually going to happen. The rollout was going to happen early this year in most parts of Canberra, and then it moved to the middle of this year. Then it moved to late this year, and then it moved to the first half of 2019. That move to early 2019 was an absolutely rock-solid assurance from NBN Co that it was going to be rolling out in the first half of 2019. The planned connection date is now scheduled for July to September 2019, which is yet another move to the right-and that's now less than 12 months from now-despite the assurances given by NBN Co at a meeting in June this year. I had an assurance from NBN Co that we were going to be rolled out before July to September next year, and now it has moved further to the right. In spite of the shifting goalposts, my community continued to send me their speeds. I thank Canberrans for continuing to take part in this campaign and I encourage them to continue to take part in the campaign. The speeds vary depending on where the person lives and also on the type of internet service provider. Many people who live in the areas already served by fibre infrastructure have speeds much greater than those in the southernmost suburbs of Canberra, which are relying on ADSL through a congested exchange. We're comparing here the ability to stream video or make downloads in seconds with not even getting a connection or having that connection time out. What happens is that they get a connection and there's great excitement at getting the connection, and then it just times out. In one part of my electorate-I'm talking here about Theodore, where I have doorknocked-there are a number of students in a house that actually have to time their homework. One member of the household does half an hour's homework and then another does a half hour and then another, and that is all in between everything timing out. We're talking here of a place just 15 kilometres from Parliament House, in our nation's capital, in 2018. There are residents in Chifley, Kambah and Coombs with download speeds greater than 20, 30 and even 40 megabits per second. But compare those to the residents in Theodore, who I mentioned before, and in Fadden, whose download speeds range from between 0.52 megabits per second-this is in the nation's capital!-and 5.5 megabits per second. With these contrasts, it's absolutely no wonder Canberrans are tearing their hair out and  expressing their anger and frustration at the disappointing NBN rollout. This is especially the case when NBN focuses on overbuilding the existing infrastructure in suburbs already served by the much better and proven fibre internet connections, instead of in areas like Theodore, Calwell, Fadden, Gowrie and Chisholm, where the speeds are proving to be much slower. So, rather than focusing on those areas that were in desperate need of a decent connection, they just overlaid areas that had a good connection-go figure! What was the point of this? Was it to ensure that NBN remained competitive with TPG or iiNet? The rollout experience has not been smooth sailing, as you can probably gather, even for suburbs that would be considered a greenfields build. Elliot in Coombs contacted me last month after he said he had 'exhausted all other options'. His building hasn't had any form of internet for months. This is despite the fact that the building was fitted with network termination devices to start the NBN installation process. But NBN Co didn't even know they had installed that device. They had no record of the installation starting months ago and needed Elliot to provide photos of their equipment at that property. Elliot has been forced to stop work, as the cost of hot-spotting his phone has become too much. This is the thing: it's having a significant impact on business and educational opportunities in my community-in our nation's capital. This is a small business owner in my community who has been forced to stop work because of the dysfunctional NBN rollout. I contacted NBN Co on Elliot's behalf to get to the bottom of what was happening, to find out what was stopping the service being provided to his apartment building. According to NBN Co: Some remediation is required from the developer to ensure the conduits are fit for purpose, as stipulated in their signed Master Developer Agreement. We had a tech on site yesterday morning in an effort to speed things along, distribute collateral, talk to residents and ensure the builder was crystal clear on what is left for them to do. Will let you know once work has been completed. Almost three weeks later, Elliot contacted me again, saying, 'We are now approaching nearly three months without internet access. As an IT professional, the internet is as important as having electricity to the property. I was advised an NBN tech was on site at some point. However, I was never told someone was attending the site, so I was not able to speak to or ask any questions of the NBN tech. This is yet another abysmal failure by NBN Co, as they even emailed me saying the NBN tech spoke to me to explain the issue. Then they backtracked and said the tech spoke to a 'neighbour' and that was apparently good enough. I obviously have no idea who they spoke to or what information they were provided. I'm honestly confused how a single company can have a complete monopoly on all new internet connections. There is literally not a single option other than using NBN, as there is no copper connection available. At this stage, I have absolutely no idea who the bottleneck is. NBN has closed my case. The body corporate said that they've done everything required of them, and we're still left without any internet or prospects of it being available.' Again I sought advice from NBN Co about exactly what was happening at Elliot's apartment block in Coombs. Six days later, NBN Co advised: Good newsWe've heard that before! The site went into service today. The applicant has been advised. Hallelujah, I thought. This was last Monday. Then today I received yet another email from poor, poor Elliot, who told me: On Friday I was contacted by Aussie broadband as our address went ""live"" and they could connect our premise to the internet. But only hours later after calling back they advised nbn Co had rolled back the update and our address was once again unserviceable. I'm worried that due to the holiday period coming any progress may be stumped, leaving us without internet for potentially a total of six months, again, for an IT professional, this is not a great situation. That's very diplomatic of you, Elliot. NBN Co's rollout in my community is haphazard and unprofessional. I fought tirelessly to get Canberra, our nation's capital, on the rollout map. Now, we're on it, the goalposts just keep shifting. They keep moving. Small business owners in my community are being affected. Business is being lost and significant operational costs are being incurred. It is simply not good enough. It is simply not good enough for those small businesses in my community, for those students in my community who are being denied educational opportunities or for the people of Canberra who are being denied citizenry opportunities. Roll out the NBN, and do it properly the first time.",132
223,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,GRIEVANCE DEBATE,"I thank the member for Canberra. And, yes, I do feel-no pun intended-up to speed with where the NBN rollout is up to now in Canberra.  Aged Care  you, Mr Deputy Speaker, my electorate is one that has a lot of seniors, a lot of retirees, a lot of pensioners and, in particular, a lot of people who are not well-off and who do not have a large amount of disposable income. The people in my electorate are being let down by providers of home care services. Some of these providers are lifting over 30 per cent of an individual's package in administration and management costs. These are real people. The amounts that I will go through are from actual invoices for real persons on particular packages who live in my electorate or who have relations in my electorate. I've got to say that it is unacceptable. This is taxpayers' money. It is being provided for a particular purpose, and the senior people of my electorate who do choose to stay at home are not being cared for sufficiently. Our government is committed to giving senior Australians as many choices as possible, and I acknowledge that. There are many who choose to remain living in the security of their own homes-a place that they love, that they may well have been in for many decades, which is close to their families and close to their communities. I think it is a message that all of us can understand, if they wish to stay at home for as long as they can with support. Unfortunately, in my electorate of Hinkler, there are a number of challenges that are making this extremely difficult for some of our seniors. Regardless of where we may live, we should all have the same opportunity. It does not matter whether you live in the city, it does not matter whether you live in a regional town or in a remote area, the long wait for level 3 and 4 packages continues. It continues for consumers in my region. They simply don't understand, when they are classed as a priority level 4, why they are still waiting eight to nine months. And I ask the same question on their behalf: a person classed as a priority level 4 waits for eight or nine months. We have an ageing population in my electorate. My office knows of a scenario where a lady in her late 60s, who is already on a lower level package, is trying to care for her 90-year-old-plus mother and has been told the wait time for a level 4 package is likely to be seven to nine months. This is not acceptable. The fees being charged by some of these providers do need more transparency. We have had a number of constituents contact my office to express their concerns about what is being charged to administer home care packages. So I'm calling for more transparency from our service providers. What is the difference between these two charges? Why are they chewing up more than 30 to 40 per cent of the subsidy that is provided for home care services? In many cases, the fees being paid are substantially higher than the care being provided. As I said at the outset, these are actual invoices provided to me by my constituents, and I'll go through a number of these examples so that it's very clear what is happening. For a home care package of level 4, the government provided $4,546.50 for the month of September 2018. The administration charge was $586.50. The case management cost was $826.50. That is $1,413, or 31 per cent, of the amount provided. For that, they provided $79.65 worth of services for the month-$79 worth of services! For August, the same package was $4,698.05. There were admin costs of $606.05 and case management costs of $854.05. Those costs were $1,460.10, or 31 per cent, of the government-provided subsidy. That was to provide $159.30 worth of services. On a level 2 package from a different provider for a different individual, the monthly charges between 16 August and 15 September were: administrative support, $257.50, and case management, $257.50; that is, $515 for $214 worth of support services. The monthly charges from 25 June to 22 July were, once again, for admin support and case management at $532.40, to provide $223 worth of support services. The monthly charges from 28 May to 18 June were $536.46, for both case management and admin support, to provide $253.47 worth of support services. The third example was outside of my electorate, but a relative of the individual lived in my electorate. It was another level 4 package, provided with $3,811.20 in May 2018 for support. The admin and case management charges were $1,488.79, or 39 per cent of the supported subsidy provided for their care, to provide $1,559.87 of personal care. In March 2018, the government subsidy was $3,557.12 and the admin and case management charges were $1,417.79-that is, 39 per cent of the government's subsidy-to provide $1,417.72 of personal care. And the numbers continue: in December 2017, there were $2,416 in subsidies, with admin and case management charges of $931.52, or 38½ per cent of the government subsidy, to provide $1,299.68 of personal care. I acknowledge that Minister Wyatt has been to my electorate a number of times because we are clearly an area where we have a high level of service need. I acknowledge that Minister Wyatt has provided additional funds for CHSP which will start in January. But we find ourselves in a difficult position, and, on behalf of the people that I represent, this cannot continue. These are the situations people are in. A 75-year-old man who is legally blind with mobility issues was receiving home care and transport. His smoke alarm was beeping for several days every minute. He couldn't get assistance to have the smoke alarm batteries changed by a provider. He was not eligible for Home Assist Secure. Fortunately, another provider organised for that to be fixed free of charge because they were concerned for his safety, and I congratulate the provider that did that on his behalf. A married couple, both in  their 80s, where the wife has dementia and the husband is bound to a wheelchair, received CHSP-funded home care and transport. Their roof has been leaking during storms due to several cracked roof tiles. They called as there were more storms forecast and they were concerned about how much water would come inside-as you would be. There were spare tiles in the shed, but the services advised that no home maintenance service was offered by their organisation. Consumers are also being told that if they require additional services while waiting for a higher-level package, they are able to access them, but have to pay extra. This can, of course, include a call-out fee. Most or many of my constituents simply cannot afford to pay. So, once again, I am calling for transparency on fees. I acknowledge the work that Minister Wyatt has been doing, and the injection of funds which will commence in January. But there are solutions to this. How is it possible that an individual organisation can charge up to 38 per cent of the provided support in service fees for no provision of service? I will repeat that: for no provision of service. There are savings and efficiencies to be found here, in my view, which could then be put towards service provision, which is the purpose of this money. We need efficiencies in this supply. We need to ensure that action is taken. Not only do we require more packages-and I am hopeful that Minister Wyatt has been successful; I know MYEFO is coming before December to provide more services of this nature-but what we are providing right now is not adequate. Minister Wyatt, as I said, has been to my electorate a number of times. I congratulate him on the work that he has done. He is genuine in his concern for elderly Australians. But the model that we have now originally started, for me, as a fight for more beds-for additional facilities in our region because we simply did not have enough. That has been provided. But, as a result of more individuals staying home for longer, some of those providers for aged-care residential services are down to under 80 per cent occupancy, which is unheard of in my region. So we need to ensure that we get the model right. We need to ensure we provide sufficient funding. We need to ensure that the service providers are not milking people of all of this money rather than providing services for people who are in need. These are our people. They deserve our respect. They deserve to have dignity in their lives. We are providing them an opportunity to stay at home for longer, which is in their interest, I think. But we must ensure that there are adequate services in regional areas. Simply because someone nominates does not mean they actually provide those services locally. So, once again, I call for more transparency on our service providers. We need to ensure they are delivering what is needed, and I hope that Minister Wyatt will be successful in his lobbying for MYEFO for additional funding to support these dignified senior Australians. Solomon Electorate: Larrakia People",133
224,Mr GOSLING,GRIEVANCE DEBATE," In the Top End the wet season is almost here. It has mostly brought heat and humidity so far, but some good storms as well as some good rain. This season is known as the balnba season in the traditional language of the area I represent, which is the language of the Larrakia people. Balnba means 'the rainy season'. The Larrakia people are the traditional owners of the Greater Darwin region, and, even though their borders extend 50 kilometres or so inland, they are known as a saltwater people. The Larrakia, of course, have an extremely important role to play in shaping Darwin and, indeed, Palmerston and the Litchfield shire-the greater area. I wish to place on the record my support for the parts of the recently signed Darwin City Deal that enhance Larrakia culture in the Greater Darwin area. In partnership with the Larrakia people, all levels of government will collaborate to showcase and celebrate Larrakia culture and to support the Larrakia people's economic development aspirations. They will do this through support to facilitate a Larrakia cultural centre where Larrakia people can meet and can, importantly, share their knowledge and promote their rich culture to both Greater Darwin residents and to visitors. Further support will be provided to improve understanding of Larrakia cultural protocols, and this will form part of a suite of outreach services known as Larrakia Nation Assist, which also includes the day patrol and Territory Connect. The Larrakia Host program will work with the Larrakia day patrol and employ six Larrakiaand other Aboriginal people too. Larrakia Host will promote the Larrakia culture to tourists, visitors and local residents. It will provide a referral service to other programs, including the day patrol. It will remind visitors from other communities about the types of behaviours that are acceptable on Larrakia country. The aim of the program is to boost tourism and employment opportunities for Aboriginal people whilst preserving and promoting Larrakia culture. Recently, I had the pleasure of hosting a participant in the Australian National Internships Program, Charlotte Maybery-Reupert. I talked with Charlotte prior to her starting the internship with me, and she was keen to do something that would really be important for my electorate, for Greater Darwin, in terms of its relationship with  its First Nations people. As you're well aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, language is a very strong element of culture, so I asked her whether her research project could look into the revitalisation of the Larrakia language. For the Larrakia, language is more than a method of communication, of course; it's a storehouse of knowledge about a great ancient culture. For the Larrakia people, preserving their language is an important means of cultural preservation and the maintenance of their identity as it gets passed from generation to generation. But as nonLarrakia people get the opportunity to learn aspects of this language, it also has a great role in reconciliation. To Charlotte, the ANIP intern that was with me, I say thank you. Your work is going to greatly assist me in assisting the Larrakia to revive their language. Because we need to be thinking of the next generations of young people, I also put on the record my admiration for the work that's done by the Clontarf Foundation, but also the two girls' programs. Clontarf is for young Aboriginal men, but there's also the Girls Academy and the Stars Foundation in the Northern Territory. I've had the privilege in recent weeks to attend many of the graduation ceremonies for the year 12s. It's a humbling and emotional experience. There were no dry eyes in those ceremonies, hearing from the year 12s about how they could never have seen themselves completing year 12 but for the assistance of these programs. I acknowledge those 2018 graduates of these important programs. I first acknowledge those who completed year 12 through the Casuarina Clontarf Academy: William Anabtowi, James Bell, Shamus Briston, Keenan Bruce, Dawyte Clancy, Dylan Collins, Burtie de Ross, Raul Ferraz, Jett Franciscus, Gregory Hunt, Kobi Jennings, Jacob Jones-Cubillo, Chance Liddy-Wilde, Dennis Manolis, Christopher May, Byron Mayo, Celestino Mayor, Scott MCCurry-Parriman, Clive MCDonald, Dominic Millar, Joseph Mills, Jye Naismith, Caleb Niki, Braydon Peckham-Hunter, Kieren Quall, Richard Rankin, Malcolm Rosas, Kobe Shepherd-Greenoff, Christopher Thomas, Lee Timms, Dwight Wauchope and Jahdai Wilson. At the Palmerston Clontarf Academy we had Dennis Alimankinni, Benjamin Crosthwaite, Joshua Croydon, Michael Harris, Ronan Lo, Menaase MCKenzie-Roe, Tyson Woodbury, Lucas Munnich, Joel Noakes, Justin Thompson, Ricardo Wees, Jahkeem Wheeler and Earl White. Finally, at the Haileybury Clontarf Academy, we had: Phillip Ahfat, Andre Ellis, Robert Fitzgerald and Fabian Rogers. I distinctly remember that Haileybury graduation. The boys did a magnificent job, as did the girls at the Palmerston College's Girls Academy. We had year 12 completers Cody Akers, Cassandra Ariuu, Jorja Ashworth, Leah Baker, Tia Barba, Annaliese Brennan, Jaymi Chisholm, Silvia Clucas, Crystal Duturbure, Shailee Edwards-Devery, Reann Fraser-Brown, Tulaha Jeffrey and Shauniece Ah Wing. With the Stars Foundation's program at Casuarina we had the fantastic result of getting all these girls through year 12: Jacinta Anderson, Ellie Ascoli, Aaliyah Bailey, Serena Barton, Emily Boeyen, Tamika Bray, T'ara Cole, Tayha Duggan-Hill, Tayla Hart-Aluni, Ally Gilmore, Tia Hewitt, Tiesha Hewitt, Whitney Koops-Corpus, Indra Mayo, Phoebe Millen, Taliyah Motlap, La-Toniya Norris, Shameka Petersen, Harmony Plues, Alyssa Richardson, Dayna Stanislaus Lawson, Niamah Walters, Kiarhii Williams, Taylah Williams and Anna WommatakimmiChapman. Finally, at the Haileybury Rendall School, the Stars Foundation's graduates were Nicole Dhurrkay, Rosharlia Djorlom, Courtney Huddleston and Tahlia Rynski. I apologise for any of those names that I may not have pronounced correctly, but I assure you that the spelling will be correct in the Hansard! I congratulate and acknowledge all of those members of those great programs, for which the evidence base is there.",135
