2,Mr REITH,BUSINESS,"1 would just like to briefly seek your indulgence, Mr Speaker. Members would be interested to know the likely sitting times in the next 36 hours or thereabouts. I inform the House that our intention tonight is to have the House rise at about 7 p.m., which would be preceded by an adjournment from roughly 6.30 p.m .. We will need to be flexible, depending on the matters before the House at that time. That will allow us to finalise any matters that the Senate has dealt with today. It is then our intention to resume tomorrow at 10.30 a.m. Tomorrow the House will have before it matters coming through from the Senate from the close of business today. We will also have a valedictory for Mr Barlin. We would then expect to have an extended and intermittent adjournment debate to allow the House to deal with any matters coming back from the Senate during the day. On our best advice, the Senate could sit as late as midnight tomorrow night. In the event that it is as late as that, allowing time for the transmission of matters from the Senate to the House, the latest that we might then sit to would be 3 a.m .. I think it is in the everybody that we finish tomorrow night, whatever time it is that we finish-even if it is early in the morning-so that at least by Saturday morning people will be able to be on their planes and back to their electorates. Obviously, we will be flexible and continue to discuss the matter with the opposition and keep all members informed of progress.",13
3,Mr CREAN,BUSINESS,"With your indulgence, Mr Speaker, I thank the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) for advising us of that. I would seek from him in relation to Friday whether there will be a question time. We believe that there is a minister that should be in this place now responding to what he failed to respond to yesterday. We will pursue him today and, if the Leader of the House is not already small business minister by this afternoon, we want the opportunity to pursue matters tomorrow, as well as other issues of importance while this parliament sits. I would ask the Leader of the House to confirm that he will allow a question time on Friday so that the opposition can continue to hold this disreputable government accountable.",13
4,Mr REITH,BUSINESS,"I seek your further indulgence, Mr Speaker. We do enjoy listening to the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean). He is predictable, but that is part of our pleasure and enjoyment as we come to the end of a session. He would not be surprised that I have before me a list of the occasions on which we have had question time on Friday-I needed a wheelbarrow to bring the precedents in! Just to give you some dates: in the spring session in 1990, at 20 December; the autumn session in 1990-1 did not go back further, but I could have-in 1992, in 1993, in 1994, and in 1995. There are many examples. We are simply following the precedent established by the previous government. In accordance with the precedents, the Friday is a continuation of the Thursday and on that basis there will not be a question time, as has been widely reported and as we all know. The Manager of Opposition Business did not have to ask the question, because I told him beforeinterest of hand. Thank you very much.",13
5,Mr CREAN,BUSINESS,"I seek your further indulgence, Mr Speaker. There is further clarification needed of the statement of the Leader of the House (Mr Reith), because earlier he did say that the House would adjourn tonight. Therefore, one would have thought that there would not be a continuation tomorrow of the adjournment, which he has now just qualified. On a further point, I understand the delight that the Leader of the House has in quoting the precedent that our government established. But the reality is that it was your Prime Minister (Mr Howard) who said he was going to lift the standards, that he was going to make this parliament more accountable, that the primacy of parliament would be supreme, that there would be more questions and more question times. What shonks! What shallow shonks-found out for what they are. And what is their excuse? To say, 'We're doing what Labor did.' Leader of the House, where is that a lifting of the standards?",13
6,Mr SPEAKER,BUSINESS,My indulgence has been sorely tested and I think we will let the issue rest there. NA NA Motion of Censure,14
7,Mr MARTIN,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"I move: That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for Cunningham moving forthwith that this House calls on the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs to come into this House and: (1) explain fully his actions in regard to contact with Mr John MCCourt and other councillors regarding development proposals for a large development adjacent to the Minister's Bunbury Homemaker's lot and the Eaton site; (2) provide this House with the letter which his brother sent to Mr Greiner, following the Minister's Thomson, A. P. phone call to Mr Greiner which showed clearly that he had breached the Prime Minister's code of conduct; (3) fully explain the nature of any formal or informal contact with any state or local authorities regarding any of those developments; and (4) explain why, in regard to contact with any councillor regarding those developments, he has not misled this House.'

NA NA 1996 Second Reading Debate resumed from 25 June, on motion by Mr Reith: That the bill be now read a second time.",15
10,Mr MCMULLAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Canberra) (9.54 a.m.)When we interrupted this debate on the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 last night, I was speaking about the increasing stress that has been taking place in Australian workplaces-public sector and private sector workplaces and blue-collar and white-collar workplaces-and giving some of the evidence that supports that uncontroversial view. I do not think there is anybody who has visited a workplace in Australia in recent times who would not share the view that workers feel under stress and they are reflecting that as one of the priority concerns they have about their workplace. In fact, the issue of stress, insecurity and uncertainty in workplaces is raised with me more often than the more orthodox issues that one would expect concerning wages and conditions, significant as they are. There is a media fascination, fed by the sorts of anecdotes put out by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) the other day deliberately to provoke this view, that in some way stress is uniquely a Public Service problem, when all the evidence is to the contrary, including the evidence from the minister's own department and in their reports, and that all people off on workplace stress are in some way misusing the system. All the evidence is to the contrary with regard to that. It is not that nobody misuses the system. I do not assert that. That has never been true about workers' compensation or any other form of insurance. We have never suggested that we should abolish car insurance because people make rorted claims, as they do, and that people conspire to seek to defraud the insurance companies. We simply make that an offence. If you seek to defraud an insurance company or the Commonwealth, that is a matter which the law should deal with. But we should not deal with it by creating a circumstance in which, when workplace stress is on the rise, some workers who legitimately incur injury at the workplace cannot get access to the workers' compensation system. That is the issue that we are debating here, not whether there is stress-I am sure everybody agrees with that-and not whether that stress is increasing. Clearly, you would have to be blind Freddy not to know that it is increasing in Australian government workplaces because this government is consciously setting out to create the circumstance in which that must be the case. I see it very obviously as the member for Canberra, but it occurs in every part of Australia, because the Commonwealth's public sector activities occur in every part of Australia, but most particularly in the major regional cities where it is a high percentage of the employment of the Bendigos, the Ballarats, the Townsvilles and the Newcastles. Many of those changes that are taking place are absolutely necessary and appropriate. Some of them are not, but that is not the issue for today. I accept that many of those changes are necessary and appropriate, but they mean that employees are working harder and harder to respond to change and to improve productivity. The government is making a change to make it more difficult for employees to claim compensation for workplace stress. What that means in the public sector is that the government wants to take the benefits of its employees working harder but it does not want to pay for the costs that they incur. Make no mistake, these proposed changes will make it more difficult for Commonwealth employees to obtain compensation for stress and other mental injuries. It does so in two ways. Firstly, the bill will now require that employment contributes to a significant degree to the injury rather than to a material degree, as is presently the case. For most people who have not looked at this, there is a pretty arcane difference. But for affected workers, it can turn out to be very significant. In effect, there will be a substantial increase in the standard of contribution. This is not my interpretation; the bill's definition makes it clear that 'significant degree' means substantially more than a material degree. Necessarily, this change will mean that some claims that would otherwise have been successful under the existing law will fail under the new provisions. The changes do not challenge the fact that the affected worker is injured-they do not change that one bit-but merely whether the worker is entitled to be paid compensation for the injury. This change will not isolate a few malingerers who may be ripping off the system. These measures do not even seek to distinguish with regard to the extent or genuineness of the injury. They merely establish grounds for lawyers to argue against Commonwealth liability for the consequences of the injury. The government claims that these changes bring the legislation into line with the original intention of the scheme. I find that, I have to say, a very unconvincing argument. In originally introducing a requirement for a material contribution-the current standard-the mischief that the parliament sought to overcome was that liability under the then existing legislation was established for injury with little if any connection with employment. To overcome this, the legislation required that, rather than the employment merely being a contributing factor to the injury, the connection had to be sufficiently material that it could be said the injury was caused by the employment. In other words, the legislation was not seeking to limit liability only to those circumstances where the contribution of employment to injury was significant or substantial but rather was ensuring that any connection was real as opposed to simply incidental. The government's justification for this change is grossly overstated. It seems to me this change is simply about reducing the number of claims so as to deliver savings the budget. It appears to be irrelevant to government that some of the rejected claims will undoubtedly be legitimate and that, as will see later, the current financial status of exception. the scheme does not justify the change. The second change the bill makes to the circumstances in which compensation can be claimed is even more alarming. I believe change attacks the very nature of Australia's workers compensation schemes as no-fault going compensation schemes. This change provides that compensation will not be payable in respect of an injury that arises solely predominantly out of reasonable managerial or administrative action taken in a reasonable manner by the employer in connection with the employee's employment. Quite clearly, this exclusion has been drawn too wide. In effect, it will deny compensation to all workers suffering from a stress related disease, or any other mental injury, where the employer has acted negligently or unreasonably. This is tantamount to replacing the no-fault scheme with a scheme based fault by the employer. We are almost getting back to a negligence based scheme, from which we have been trying to get away generations. In his second reading speech the minister was at pains to avoid the perception that the new exclusion was as wide as I have stated, but the terms of the bill do not match his rhetoric. I understand the impression he is trying to give, and he goes on television doing his Mr Reasonable impersonation, but the fact of the matter is that the courts will interpreting the words of the law passed the parliament. The minister stated that the exclusion does not embrace every kind of instruction or action by the employer and generally will cover a direction or series of instructions concerning the day-today task which an employee performs. But this is not reflected in the terms of the legislation. The legislation is drafted widely. It refers simply and only reasonable managerial or administrati ve action. This term is defined to include employer actions such as disciplining an employee, not promoting an employee or not providto ing a benefit. This definition is expressly the inclusive, and so leaves open the prospect of other employer actions, such as instructions we concerning day-today tasks, falling within the The minister also stated that the amendments are primarily aimed at stress or stress related injuries. That might be his aim, it this might be the people at whom he is aiming, but they are not the only people who are to be hit by this measure. It is true that physical injury is expressly exempted from the exclusion-and that is obviously approprior ate-but mental injury is not. This clearly means that not only stress claims but all other claims for mental injury can be caught by the exclusion. This is becoming an increasingly important area of proper social concern and a matter about which the government should be taking positive action rather than seeking to punish those who may have the misfortune other than to suffer such an injury. A simple example can vividly illustrate the width of the new exclusion introduced by this on bill. Take the case of an employer who requests an employee, as part of his or her normal duties, to take some money for deposit for to the bank. The employee is robbed at gunpoint on the way to the bank and suffers permanent agoraphobia as a result. There is a strong argument that the employee could not, under these new provisions, claim compensation. We will not know how it will be interpreted by the courts, but it is certainly arguable and open to that argument. Even if it is not the government's current be intention that that should be the case-and let by me, for the purposes of this debate, accept that; I do not know what is in the mind of the minister but let me accept that he does not wish that to be the case-it would certainly not be open to a lawyer on behalf of the Commonwealth as employer to mount such an argument, and they would have a reasonable prospect of success. Agoraphobia would be a mental injury within the meaning of the to provisions and could therefore fall within the new exclusion. It could be affected by this, unquestionably. The agoraphobia would have arisen solely or predominantly out of reasonable managerial action, a direction to the employee concerning his or her day-today tasks, and could also fall within such a claim. I am not seeking to establish that there is some fiendish plot by the minister consciously setting out to exclude these and, of course, many other circumstances within the continuum between the very simple cases that the minister has been alluding to in his Mr Reasonable impersonations on television and the case which I have outlined. There is a long continuum, and we do not know where the line is going to be drawn on that continuum, but all mental injury is included and the inclusive nature of the examples in the legislation does not give one any confidence. It is hard to imagine that anybody would deny that an employee in the circumstances I have outlined should not be entitled to workers compensation. In my view, it would be an obscene outcome if that were the result. Yet that obscene outcome is made possible by these new provisions. The heart of the problem with the new provisions is therefore that, because they are so wide, they are likely to exclude large numbers of legitimate claims. This can be seen when regard is had to a 1993-94 survey by Comcare of the causes of stress claims, if we refer only to those. My concern is that we are casting the net wider than stress, but let us just stick to those. The 1993-94 Comcare survey said the causes were 24 per cent interpersonal conflict, 24 per cent workload and deadlines, 22 per cent organisational change, 17 per cent physical and verbal abuse, 7 per cent performance counselling and other management processes, and 6 per cent per forced relocation and organisational restructuring. The new exclusion would appear certainly to exclude stress claims caused by performance counselling and other management processes and forced relocation and organisational restructuring-that is, 13 per cent of claims. It could exclude claims caused by workload and deadlines, which is certainly where a lot of the increasing pressure in the public sector is being felt, and organisational change, which would mean a further 46 per cent of the claims. On the basis of this survey, the proposed changes could exclude up to 59 per cent of stress claims. The proposed changes also suffer from significant problems beyond the exclusion of legitimate claims. That is my primary concern; I make no secret about it. We should not be making these alterations if we accept and recognise that people can be injured in the course of their work-not malingeringand get no access to the workers compensation system. Over and above that, the central reliance of this exclusion on the reasonableness ground will have all the shortcomings of common law processes that the statutory workers compensation scheme sought to avoid. It is capricious. Workers who suffer injury where the effects of their work conditions were not clearly understood at the time are likely not to be compensated because the absence of knowledge would tend to show management action at the time was reasonable-reasonable in the light of the current knowledge when the manager made the decision. Also, rather than promoting a culture of cure or prevention, the new provisions promote a culture of excuse. The provision of an exclusion of liability on the basis of reasonableness may cause management to focus on being able to justify any subsequent injury as having been the result of reasonable action, rather than attempting to avoid the injury in the first place. Finally, the vague and subjective notion of reasonableness will only lead to an explosion of litigation as employers and employees attempt to define the undefinable. These features alone make the new exclusion unacceptable but when coupled with the fact that the new provisions are likely to exclude large numbers of legitimate claims for compensation and do so by fundamentally undermining the no-fault basis of the scheme, the provisions deserve to be resoundingly rejected. Our arguments against these changes to the circumstance in which compensation is payable under the Commonwealth workers compensation scheme do not end there. The justification the minister has put forward for the changes-that the cost attached to stress claims has grave implications for the future sustainability of the scheme-does not seem to have any validity. Certainly the present financial position of the scheme does not warrant changes that are as draconian as these. This is made abundantly clear in the most recent report on the performance of Comcare. That report into the administration of the Commonwealth's workers compensation scheme appears to indicate that the incidence and duration of claims, including for stress, does not threaten to undermine the continuing viability and efficiency of the scheme. The scheme continues to be in surplus, reserves are increasing, liabilities are declining, adminthe istrative costs are reducing, program costs are stable, premium rates are decreasing and claims frequency is declining. It is hard to imagine a report that is further from indicating an impending crisis. Nobody can deny that there must be continuing vigilance to ensure the viability and efficiency of the scheme. That is an obligation we all have in the parliament to the taxpayers. But given the existing healthy state of the scheme, this objective does not seem in any way to necessitate the extent of the changes the government wants to introduce through this bill. The truth is that the changes the government is proposing to the circumstances in which compensation is payable in relation to stress and other mental injuries are no more than a transparent attempt to make savings at the expense of injured workers. Suggestions by the minister that the changes are necessitated not by an attempt to generate savings but rather an attempt to establish-this is one of the great phrases-'management-employee relations on a sounder footing' are just arrant nonsense. In what possible manner can we suggest that these changes are going to improve the basis of management-employee relations in the public sector? You might say this is a way to catch malingerers. In my view we should be catching malingerers, but I do not believe this will help in any way. That is a proper thing for us all to do, but this does not contribute to it. It does not distinguish in any way between legitimate and illegitimate claims. It is impossible to imagine how it will establish management-employee relations on a sounder footing. It will only cause more dispute, more contention, more litigation. Finally, I should refer briefly to the other provisions in this bill that relate to changes to the administration of the scheme. With one exception, the opposition will be supporting these amendments. The exception is, however, an important one. The bill proposes to make Comcare, rather than the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission, responsible for determining contributions by departments and authorities to the administrative costs of scheme. This could leave the commission, which continues to have an important role in overseeing the scheme, in implementing occupational health and safety programs, and in supervising some of Comcare's activities, without the capacity to determine the funds available to it for these purposes. Those funds will be determined by Comcare-the body that the commission is designed to supervise. Careful examination reveals that this is an extraordinary outcome. An independent tripartite statutory body with a regulatory role, the commission, will have its funding determined by the bureaucratic body which it regulates, Comcare. We cannot and do not support this proposal. We do not regard it as simply a matter of administration; it is a change in policy which we cannot accept. Therefore, in the consideration in detail stage of this bill we will move an amendment to give the commission the power to issue guidelines to Comcare relating to Comcare's powers to determine the amount of contributions and the basis upon which they will be levied. To avoid any doubt, this amendment proposes that Comcare be explicitly directed to comply with any such guidelines. Workers compensation has been a fundamental element of the security of Australian working families for a very long time. That security from financial distress at a time of physical or mental injury is not something to be played with or put at risk lightly. Certain conservative politicians and commentators have sought to portray stress related disease as a rort, but stress is an increasing problem, not just in the Public Service but throughout Australia. The appropriate response is to develop a package of measures to reduce stress in the workplace. This bill does nothing to reduce stress, it merely attempts to punish the victims. Therefore, I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House deplores the Government's proposal to reduce the circumstances in which compensation is payable under the Commonwealth Workers' Compensation Scheme and calls on the Government to abandon that proposal"".",16

12,Mr CHARLES,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"La Trobe) (l0.17 a.m.)In 1988 the then Labor government introduced a new scheme of workers compensation for Commonwealth employees. It is this government's view that those changes have, in general, been positive. However, in his second reading speech, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) said: In reviewing performance to date, it is clear that the adoption of a more focused approach to prevention, rehabilitation and claims management has reduced the personal and economic costs of injury and disease in Commonwealth employment for a number of reasons. That is all very positive, but there are a few holes in the scheme and the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill acts to tidy up some language and provisions and to address a couple of major anomalies. The Commonwealth's liabilities at 30 June, 1995 totalled $1.5 billion. Despite a decrease in the number of claims, there was an increase in both the complexity and duration of claims, which led to higher program costs. Those reforms in 1988 were really intended to address the problem that existed where, for a disease to be compensable, employment must have contributed to a material degree to the contraction of the disease. A number of problems have arisen as a result of that definition, not the least of those being re Miers and Commonwealth of Australia v. Comcare, where the Administrative Appeals Tribunal ruled that 'material' meant 'pertinent or likely to influence'. In this bill the government is attempting to go back and apply words that meet the intent of the original act in 1988. That is that, for a disease to be compensable, employment must be a significant or substantial cause of the disease. That is what this issue is all about. This new legislation also has an exclusion provision which provides that compensation is not payable in respect of an injury which arises from reasonable disciplinary action taken against an employee or from a failure by the employee to obtain a promotion, transfer or benefit in connection with the employment. The Commonwealth, as has been stated by the minister and by the shadow minister, the member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan), believes that stress claims are being used in a number of cases to register complaints against or frustrate the taking of reasonable employment related actions and some of those stress claims are totally inappropriate. The creation of a culture of care in the workplace will not work if we do not make this issue of stress a mainstream issue. The member for Canberra said, 'Some workers will be worse off, but none will be better off.' That is the ALP and union approach to workers compensation every time we discuss these issues-on every issue and at every venue. I recall back in the 1980s, when the then Cain Labor government in Victoria wanted to completely change a decrepit, ineffective and very expensive workers compensation system, the Trades Hall Council had so much influence over Barney Cooney's attempt to create a fair, equitable system that the whole thing blew apart. It took until 1992 for the Kennett government to come in and perform major surgery on that legislation in order to make it work properly. Mr Mossfield-I rise on a point of order. The member for La Trobe is moving away from the true intent of the legislation. He is speaking about something happening in the state of Victoria which is not really relevant to this legislation.",21
13,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Mr Jenkins)The honourable member will resume his seat. There is no point of order. The honourable member for La Trobe, r am sure, will stick to the bill before us.",21
14,Mr CHARLES,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"It took the Kennett government to revamp totally that legislation-to get rid of all the rorts. The member for Canberra asks how you can have better workplace relations by tightening up workers compensation access. I will tell you how. If one worker sees that his colleagues are able to rort the system, go off on leave forever and continue to get paid 100 per cent of their wages or very close thereto, what incentive is there for the person who is still at work to do his job safely and properly? There ly none. These rortable systems are absolutely deplorable. They do absolutely nothing to further the cause of good management-worker relations or to promote the cause of occupational health and safety, which is an important issue for all of us, I might add. The member for Canberra also went on in his contribution and attacked the minister for some supposed inconsistency by saying that the government's intention in this legislation was not to attract budget savings. The member for Canberra said that was wrong-that there were going to be budget savings. I am advised that the savings attributed to the government's amendments are not savings which are reflected in the budget-that is, they do not flow to consolidated revenue and they do not contribute directly to improvement in the budget bottom line. In effect, the savings are aggregated savings to the budgets of the particular agencies covered by the act and are used for other purposes relevant to the agencies' functions. There is no point to the opposition arguing that the amendments before the House are budget savings driven initiatives in any pure sense-they are not. The shadow minister is well aware that in his attack on this issue he is arguing that agencies must pay higher premiums than they reasonably should. I would think that is a very strange proposition for the member for Canberra to be running. Occupational stress claims are generally very high cost claims. The number of accepted claims is dropping, but the cost associated with those claims remains very high. The annual cost of stress claims has risen from $24 million in 1991-92 to an estimated $35.7 million for the 1996-97 financial year. To date in 1996-97, stress claims represent five per cent of accepted claims but account for 18 per cent of costs. The average cost of a stress claim is $32,700, compared with $7,700 for other claims. In other words, stress claims cost the taxpayer more than four times as much as other types of claims. Stress claims are also of longer duration. After 12 months, 15 per cent of those with stress claims are still off work, compared with four per cent of is absolute- employees with other claims. Let me give you a couple of examples of cases where an employee has received compensation for stress in response to what can only be described as legitimate management action. It is these types of claims which the reasonable management provisions in the bill are designed to exclude. An employee was interviewed in relation to possible criminal offences but, before any action was taken, he lodged a claim for stress and he received compensation. An employee had a fear of being made redundant. She claimed stress, added to by a clash of personality with a supervisor. She was off work for several months on compensation. An employee applied for promotion but was not successful. In line with department practice, she was counselled as to the reasons why she missed out on the job. She left work and subsequently claimed compensation for stress on the grounds the counselling upset her. r have come to the conclusion that this business of occupational health and safety is all about culture. Until we convince managements that they have an absolute responsibility to provide a safe working environment for everyone who works in the workplace, and until we convince the people who work in the workplace that each of them has an individual and collective responsibility to help maintain that safe environment and to help themselves and their colleagues remain injury and disease free, then we will continue to fail. It is not really all that very complicated. Remember, sometimes it is as simple as not forgetting to close the bottom drawer of a four-drawer filing cabinet so your colleague does not fall over it. I would like to make the general comment that the Commonwealth considers workplace safety matters to be important. I want to make it clear that the Commonwealth government is fully committed to helping improve the current record. I would like to focus on the Commonwealth's view on the need for improved outcomes in drawing on the findings of the Industry Commission and the small business deregulation task force report. The message that ministers are receiving concerns the consequences of a lack of national consistency. One could ask why it is necessary for governments and the community to address this issue of workplace health and safety. The Industry Commission's report Work, Health and Safety provides a graphic summary of the scale of the problem in Australia. Each year 2,200 people die from workplace related diseases. Each year 160,000 workers are compensated for work related injury or illness requiring at least five days off work. Each year an estimated 650,000 people are injured or become ill as a result of their work. The Industry Commission report puts the costs in the range of $20 billion annually. That is the problem as we know it. The question is how do we find ways to reduce the human and economic costs associated with injury and disease at work. The Industry Commission acknowledged that there is no single panacea, no quick fix to the problem, and concluded that the whole communityemployers, employees, their associations and trade unions as well as governments-can play an important role in improving occupational health and safety. How then can the regulators play their From the Commonwealth perspective, the answer lies in setting a framework that allows national standards to be applied in the states and territories in a way that is readily underjurisdictions. stood, applicable and results oriented. It would be fair to say that one of the major findings of the Industry Commission report related to the different obligations on employers and employees and the different level of protection existing for employees doing the same work in various jurisdictions. Exposure limits for some hazards and rules for hazardous plant and equipment vary across all the jurisdictions. These differences have major cost implications for employers operating in more than one state or more than one jurisdiction. The recent report of the government's small business deregulation task force, Time fv; business, also identified the lack of nationa consistency in OH&S as a major area for concern by small business. I will return to this report briefly. In respect of the existing regulatory framework, the Industry Commission recommended that a three-tier regulatory structure be implemented and based on the premise of encouraging those in the workplace to take greater responsibility for the management of risks to health and to safety. Such an approach constitutes a move from direct imposition of the workplace solutions to providing an informed choice by those at work. This approach is consistent with a demonstrated need to reform workplaces by providing a greater choice in the organisation and manner in which work is performed in line with the provisions and the government's new Workplace Relations Act. The consequence of detailed regulatory OH&S standards is that workplaces are unable to easily understand them, nevertheless implement them. This is particularly so in respect of small businesses that do not have the necessary expertise or time to come to grips with some of the myriad of requirements. What is needed is practical material to assist workplaces to identify and prevent workplace injury and diseases. While nationally agreed standards that the role? National Occupational Health and Safety Commission have developed have been adopted at jurisdictional level, implementation of the standards has been inconsistent across This raises questions about the applicability and responsiveness of nationally consistent efforts to meet industry needs, particularly small business. The Industry Commission found, firstly, that jurisdictions have legislated national standards in various ways with different effect; secondly, that the content of the standards implemented can differ to a significant degree from those declared by the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission; and, thirdly, that not one of the priority standards has been fully implemented across the country. The law relating to occupational health and safety has dual objectives. Firstly, it seeks to prevent industrial injury or disease and, secondly, it aims to compensate persons who suffer industrial injuries or contract an industrial disease. Recently, the following example of rollover protective structures on tractors was relayed to me. The various plant safety regulations released by the states are all similar but contain variations in detail, and it is these variations that manufacturers and farm machinery dealers must understand at the point of product transfer. So far, the Tractor and Machinery Association of Australia has examined four different state regulations in detail. Differences exist between the states in relation to mandatory regulations applying to the minimum and maximum weight and age of tractors. In Victoria, the supplier, the employer or the self-employed user-the subcontractor-is required to ensure that a ROPS is fitted, whereas in other states the requirement is only on the employer. States without mandatory requirements place the onus of decision upon the end user. However, depending on the circumstances known at the time of the sale, the manufacturer or the supplier might also logically be implicated. A preliminary look at a fifth set of draft PRATT regulations appears to present yet another set of variables. So, despite the agreement on a national standard, there are no common requirements at a state level on the starting date of the regulations or the minimum or maximum tractor weight for ROPS. This is but one example, but it identifies a source of infinite frustration for the agricultural machinery and manufacturing industry that is now forced to devote more resources to try to understand the many regulations and codes of practice relevant to its industry. I am sure all of us are well aware of the inherent dangers of tractors and how important it is that we help farmers to get it right. As I mentioned earlier, the recent report by the small business deregulation task force identified problems with existing occupational health and safety arrangements. Business, especially small business, tells us there is still a need for a different approach to ensure improved OH&S outcomes. Criticism was levelled at the many layers involved and the complexity and cost associated with OH&S legislation. In terms of OH&S requirements, it tells us it wants assistance which is practical and which is easily applicable to the workplaces rather than overtly proscriptive and technically focused, as it has generally tended to be. The task force found that small businesses are concerned that they do not have the expertise to deal with technically complex OH&S regulations. The findings of the task force are largely consistent with those of the Industry Commission as they related to unclear rights and duties, too much legislation, inflexible regulation, inconsistency between jurisdictions, inefficient mandated standards and inadequate and unhelpful codes of practice. The task force drew attention to surveys undertaken by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the South Australian government which, in its view, confirmed that most small businesses have difficulty understanding OH&S requirements. At a recent meeting, Labor ministers from all jurisdictions agreed to take a more direct leadership role complementing the work already undertaken by the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission. It is a shame that the member for Canberra had to blot his copybook by bringing in a spurious amendment to this very sensible piece of legislation designed to help make occupational health and safety a more proactive area for Commonwealth employees both at a management and at a workplace level. (Time expired)",22
15,Mr MOSSFIELD,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I rise to support the amendment moved by the shadow minister for industrial relations, the member for Canberra (Mr MCMullan), and to oppose the government's legislation. I have some concern that the changes that are being proposed in this legislation are designed to reduce the basic safety net entitlements of working peoplethat is, workers compensation. Coming as I do into this House with a trade union background, I have some passion on this issue. As the shadow minister said, workers compensation is the fundamental security for Australian working families. Of all the benefits that the trade union movement has won for working people in this country over a long period, there is certainly none more important than workers compensation. I should mention in opening my remarks that one must doubt the strength of the government's case when a dorothy dixer was asked in question time on Monday by the member for O'Connor in which he was critical of public servants. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith), in answering the question, quoted three cases and it would appear that workers had received a fairly large settlement. But we received very little detail of those cases, and it would hardly be seen as a cross-section of the number of stress claims in the Public Service. Nor did the minister quote the many genuine cases where stress leads to workers compensation claims and people being off work. The member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) in his contribution raised the fact that stress related claims were a high cost factor and that they were longer in duration than other workers compensation claims. I do not think that either of those two arguments are relevant sions. in this case. It only indicates the seriousness of stress claims. Certainly, the duration of stress claims are based on a medical decision; it is the medical profession that would make a decision as to how long people need to be off work to recuperate as a result of stress claims. The Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 introduces two amendments to the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988, as announced in the 1996 budget, which concern the circumstances in which compensation is payable under the Commonwealth workers compensation scheme. Firstly, under the amendments, a disease-including a stress related disease-is compensable only if the person's employment contributes to a disease to a significant degree-this is substantially higher than the existing material degree. Secondly, an injury, including a disease, is not compensable if the injury arises from reasonable managerial or administrative action taken in a reasonable manner by the employer. This includes reasonable disciplinary action against the employee and actions, based on reasonable grounds, not to promote, transfer or provide a benefit to the employee. The coalition government has already telegraphed its intention to reduce benefits applying to workers under this legislation. In an announcement relating to the forward estimates for the 1996 budget, the government said: The government will amend the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 to facilitate the management of stress claims consistent with the intention of the act. It is expected that this will reduce the cost of compensation claimsand also, I might add, workers entitlementsover the forward years and consequently also reduce premiums for agencies. Local and overseas experience shows that occupational stress is a worldwide phenomenon, particularly with governments and industry striving for better bottom line results. Downsizing has seen many loyal workers being either retrenched or offered alternative employment, resulting in workers, through no fault of their own, being subject to enormous stress through management or political deciA recently concluded survey of 1,000 employees at the tax office has revealed that stress remains one of the greatest problems facing the Public Service. Conducted by the Community and Public Sector Union, the survey showed that one-third of respondents had taken leave from work over the previous 12 months due to workplace stress. It revealed that the vast majority of these absences were taken as sick leave or recreational leave, with only five per cent taken as compensation leave. These findings support the result of a recent investigation into stress amongst staff of the Department of Social Security in the Hunter Valley region of New South Wales. The study found that 39 per cent of staff had taken some form of leave over the previous 12 months as a result of workplace stress, but only seven per cent actually lodged a compensation claim for stress. The government should have the good grace to acknowledge this. But they would rather have us believe that workers are rorting compensation all over Australia, hence this bill. In fact, workers are very honourably using their valuable recreation and sick leave entitlements to cover what should really be recognised as compensation matters. Workers in Australia have always been renowned for this type of responsible approach, but it has not always been recognised by governments or employers. It is like the alleged overtime bill that employers complain about. If employees charged private and government employers for all the unpaid overtime they worked, wage bills would be a lot higher. But let us not be too generous in our praise for workers-it is not always acceptable in this day and age, particularly the coalition government. Stress can clearly affect long-term employees who, through their personal efforts, skill and loyalty, have contributed to the success of the organisations they work for. They therefore establish in their own minds a feeling of satisfaction with their contribution to the organisation they work for. It encouragtwo, es them to have high morale and a desire to work and therefore increases productivity. I would argue that stress that arises from any political or managerial decision which unfairly destroys this feeling of satisfaction be compensable-the same as any other work related injury. Whilst stress continues to be a major problem for workers generally, it should be noted that the most recent figures of duration show a decline in both actual levels of stress claimed and the average duration of stress compared to other claims. This view is supported by figures contained in Comcare Australia Annual Report 1995-96, which shows that in 1994-95 stress claims, as a percentage of all claims accepted by Comcare, accounted for 9.6 per cent. In 1995-96, this figure had dropped to 6.9 per cent. Much of this reduction can be attributed to the efforts that the union movement, the SRC Commission and Comcare have taken in relation to preventative activities. The CPSU has entered into arrangements and honoured them during the last EFA negotiations to alleviate problems associated with stress. The amendments introduced by the government run counter to the spirit of this enterprise agreement in which the parties have agreed that they would work to reduce the number of stress related claims without the need for legislative change. In addition, the SRC Commission has undertaken a number of initiatives that seek to address these issues. In 1995, the stress management centre was established to provide a holistic approach to incorporating preventative strategies and improving administrative arrangements. Over the past 12 months the SRC Commission has been committed to the development of a preventative program to deal specifically with stress. This has again by been supported by the CPSU. It would appear that the act already provides a balance between the interests of the Commonwealth as an employer and its employees in that stress relating to, one, injury or aggravation suffered by an employee as a result of reasonable disciplinary action, or, failure of the employee to obtain promotion, transfer or benefit in connection with his or her employment is not compensable. To use a current example, senior members of the New South Wales Police Force have should been retrenched. Their employment was terminated, in the words of the new commissioner, to establish a new management structure, not because these particular people were in any way corrupt or inefficient; there simply was, in the view of one person-the new commissioner-no longer any room at the top for these people. If these people had been Commonwealth public servants and suffered a stress related injury because of this type of managerial decision they would have qualified for compensation. Under the government's proposed amendments, these people would have a very difficult legal battle to establish their rights for compensation. By a simple change of words from 'material degree' to 'significant degree', the government has significantly added to the stress of its employees because the terminology adds a clear strengthening to the language of the bill. Any examination of the words in a dictionary will show that just by these two small changes the job has been made much harder for your employees-and here I refer to the government-to achieve compensation. I repeat the term 'your employees' because it seems to me that government members sometimes think public servants are somebody else's employees, that they have no responsibility for any pain they choose to inflict upon them by political decisions-they are not someone else's employees, they are yours. It is your employees to whom you are adding these pressures-pressures that are simply placed on top of those already created in the last few years as we have insisted that the public service become leaner and meaner and that there be fewer and fewer staff to handle more and more work as determined by their political masters. Elizabeth MCDowall, the manager of policy in the Victorian Workcover Authority has stated that occupational stress is associated with organisational change, downsizing, redeployment and redundancy in an environment where the workplace is continuously pushed to increase productivity, reduce cost and produce more with less. This very clearly applies to the Commonwealth Public Service where, once again, under this government, there have been massive retrenchments in a whole range of public service departments. This simply means that fewer and fewer people have to do more and more work. To return to specifics, the strength of the current legislation in providing a balance between employee and employer rights is spelled out in a letter from Comcare to the ACTU dated 7 February 1996. The letter indicates that it is the SCMC that will not just accept the diagnosis of work related stress; there must be a diagnosable condition. Where the medical information on a claim is unclear, the SCMC may investigate a claim through the use of a psychiatrist to determine whether a claimant suffers from a diagnosable medical condition or whether the claimant is merely unhappy or dissatisfied with the result of employment. However, the minister has suggested in his statement that workers compensation has been awarded to workers for stress related conditions that have arisen as a result of counselling, poor work performance, a failure to get a promotion or other actions taken by management. This is a clear signal that the coalition government is intending to provide an exclusion from liability in relation to injury or disease which takes place as a result of reasonable management action. This further erodes the protection that this act presently provides for injured workers. The effect of the government's amendments is to deny compensation entitlements to all workers suffering stress related diseases in circumstances other than where the employer has acted negligently or unreasonably-but to be determined by whom? The reasonableness test will have all the shortcomings of a common law process that statutory workers compensation schemes attempt to avoid. In the end, these amendments will only lead to an explosion of litigation as employers and employees attempt to define the indefinable. This is another stark example of the government's archaic view that the old master-servant relationship should be reinforced and that workers rights are simply an unnecessary impediment to achieving a good profit. In 1983, Bob Hawke was elected. He promised to and succeeded in healing divisions in Australia. The present Prime Minister (Mr Howard) is, in fact, giving all his ministers encouragement never to leave their comfortable time warp of the 1960s, 1970s and early 1980s. It is as if none of these excellent changes had ever been introduced in Australia. This bill encapsulates all of these outdated views and inflicts upon workers just one more problem to cope with. When they are retrenched or take voluntary packages, workers' stress will reach even higher levels as they find they also have to use up all of their package and their super before they can achieve any other government assistance. This bill underscores the absolutely appalling approach that this government is taking towards ordinary workers in this nation while carrying on in their public utterances about the concerns for Mr and Mrs Ordinary Australia. When the curtain of deceit is finally lifted and ordinary Australians are exposed to the government's anti-worker policies, there will be a vigorous and unmistakable voter backlash against this coalition government. In finalising my submission, once again I want to strongly reinforce the fact that workers compensation is the major benefit protecting Australian workers and we should not forget that we are not simply talking about those people who are working for the government; we are talking about their families. This coalition government tells us they are interested in families but it would appear to me that this is not the case, particularly when they are prepared to introduce legislation of this nature. People do not need additional stress at this time when many people out there, particularly public servants, are worried about their jobs-whether they are going to be retained or retrenched. We on this side of the House very strongly oppose the government's moves under this legislation. What the amendment fails to recognise is the changing nature of work over the past 20 to 30 years when, I am sure, injuries caused by physical factors have reduced considerably due to occupational health and safety regulations and the awareness of employees and employers of the need to observe tight safety regulations at the work site. There is no doubt in my mind that in many areas of workers compensation there would have been a dramatic reduction in claims and in costs, particularly where physical factors come into consideration. On the other hand, we could all agree that there is an equal possibility that, due to organisational change-as highlighted by Elizabeth MCDowall and others-in an environment of continuous change workplace stress will increase. There is no doubt that Australian Public Service at the moment is going through continuous change which is going to create many stressful situations. This being the case, I believe there is a strong argument to strengthen legislation such as the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 and not weaken it as this government amendment surely does. I support the amendment moved by the shadow minister.",24
16,Mr TONY SMITH,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The propositions that are raised by these amendments in effect ensure that those people who have a genuine claim surely must be admitted and, in a limited set of circumstances, do get their rights before the tribunal concerned with determining the facts in issue. At the same time the amendments weed out a lot of the rorting that has clearly gone on in relation to this particular area. I take a fairly rigid view in relation to matters of stress, I confess. This is a personal view. In fact, in the many cases involving personal injury where I have had to appear for plaintiffs, it was always my practice to minimise any emphasis on the stress element of their claim. It was common then, and I think it still is, that the common law courts give very little weight to these sorts of claims, whereas they are very interested in claims that relate to physical injury which leads to real assessed disabilities. I generally take the view-it is a view perhaps shared by a lot of my friends in small business-that stress is what you make it. There are many people in small business today who are suffering from the most unbelievable stresses caused by the time they have to put into running a business, the time they have to spend away from their families and the hours they have to put into compete with big chain stores. It is virtually a seven day a week, 12 hour a day job, particularly in retail. Yet they go on and the reason they go on is that there is no backup. They cannot take time off because the moment they leave that business there is nothing coming in. I have asked many people, 'If there were no backup, would you make a claim? Would you be away from work if there were no compensation for itT The answer is universally, 'I the would be at work.' That, in my view, assists in putting the whole thing into context. I do not, for one moment, deny what the honourable member for Greenway (Mr Mossfield) says about the importance of workers compensation in relation to the relationships that have existed for many years between employers and employees. It is a very important system. It was very important to ensure that workers who were injured in the course of their employment, both in relation to negligence by their employer or by other employees or, alternatively, their own negligence, in the case of the compensation system, should be paid. It has been said in many cases that frequently, in relation to common law claims in any event, employees are injured when they are getting on with their employer's business. In those particular cases, I have great sympathy for an employee who has been injured and I would apply a very, very narrow test of negligence at common law in those sorts of circumstances. I would take a very liberal view. But of course the other side of the coin is that there are people who are deliberately rorting the system, who are deliberately taking every conceivable advantage to bleed the system. Those cases, which I will refer to shortly, have already been mentioned by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith). It is those cases that undermine the whole fabric of the system. It is often forgotten by members of the opposition that we are talking about people who are in employment. There are a lot of people out there who are not in employment because we are spending millions and millions of dollars propping up a system for those who should be working but who are abusing the system. Those people I have absolutely no sympathy with at all. I believe-it has happened in Queensland in recent years-that the law is becoming much more stringent when it comes to bogus claims. We are regularly seeing the rorters caught out bending their backs digging the garden or putting up brick walls or lifting engines out of cars. They are being caught with spy cameras while they are suffering from debilitating so-called back illnesses. We have seen a lot of examples of that. It is very important in this process, in my view, to ensure that not only do we tighten up the legislation itself, but also we keep a watchful eye over those suspect claims which may well be in need of being examined at closer quarters. The original intent of the act itself has, in my view, been distorted by decisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Federal Court. The case of Re Miers and the Commonwealth, which is one case that is relevant in this particular situation, involved the determination by the tribunal of 'in a material degree'. What does 'in a material degree' mean? In that case, it was held to mean: It need be no more than ""pertinent or likely to influence. "" Quoting a decision of Mr Justice Davies in Australian Telecommunications Commission and Treloar: The contributing factor need do no more than contribute in a material way. The factor is not required to be the real, proximate or effective cause of the disease or of its development. When several . . . factors together cause the contraction of a disease or its acceleration, aggravation or recurrence, all that is required is that one such factor exhibits the necessary connection with the worker's employment. I found that an extremely liberal interpretation of 'material' and thought I would have a little look at how the dictionary has defined it. I looked first at the Shorter 04ord. In relation to the legal element of 'material', it states: Of evidence or a fact; significant, influential, esp. to the extent of determining a cause, affecting a judgment ... That is certainly a different definition from what has been relied upon by the tribunal in question following the decision of Mr Justice Davies. Furthermore, in relation to the meaning of 'material', the Butterworths Australian Legal Dictionary states: Important, essential or relevant. In contract law ... a misrepresentation may also be material where a representee who has already decided to enter into the contract is influenced not to change his or her mind. Of a material fact in terms of a statement of claim, the same dictionary states: A relevant fact. A statement of claim must contain the material facts on which the claim is based in order to show that there is a reasonable cause of action. The Macquarie Dictionary states: . .. likely to influence the determination of a causewhich is similar to the Shorter Oxford. Those definitions are certainly much tighter and much more, I would have thought, in the draftsman's mind when the original legislation was passed than what the court decided it really meant. In fact, the court diluted the meaning of 'material' so that it was negligible. In other words, I think it is fair to say that, really, if you had a negligible association, that was sufficient. I think that that was really spawned out of the long-established principle that in workers compensation matters the courts should adopt a fairly liberal construction of legislation. That was a good principle in the days when workers compensation was treated as almost a handout mentality by those in government and employers. It was always felt that people should go to work whether they were three-quarters dead or not. I recall that, in 1955, we were involved in a very serious road accident. My father was working on the wharves at the time. He went to work the next day on crutches. This was not a work related accident, of course. He had a broken foot. That was the approach to work in those days. The fact of the matter was that, if he had not gone to work, he would not have been able to provide for his family. But the approach to work now has swung the other way to such an extent that there are people-and the cases are there-working the system to the detriment of decent working people. Remember this, Mr Deputy Speaker, there is a diminution in morale in the workplace as a result of this going on and people being seen to get away with it. Some of the cases mentioned by the minister bear repeating. One particular case the minister mentioned was that of an employee who claimed stress as a result of a grievance process. A colleague had lodged a grievance against the employee and the investigating officer found that the employee had acted improperly. The employee was not happy about the result and had not been at work since mid-1995. A second claim, which is almost too bizarre to be believable, related to a situation where certain members of the Public Service were moving offices. They were in temporary accommodation. An employee claimed stress as a result of what she perceived to be an inappropriate comment in the workplace. The comment was made to the whole group, but she found it offensive. The words were to the effect that, whilst it was inconvenient for people to be moved from permanent accommodation to temporary accommodation, given the circumstances, people would simply have to go through the exercise and wait and see. But here is the twist in the tail: the individual lodged her claim only when her own poor performance was called into question. The cost of that claim is in the region of $190,000. That really is quite outrageous. Another case that was mentioned involved an employee who had an affair at work. When the affair ended, she felt unable to remain in the workplace and lodged a claim for stress. The cost to the Commonwealth, the cost to the taxpayer, is $80,000 to date. It is just not acceptable. Someone should try to sell that to ordinary, average, hard working Australian workers and see how much truck they get with it. In another case, an employee was requested to attend a counselling session to discuss his work performance. He went on sick leave and lodged a claim for stress. That employee has been absent from work since mid-1995. Another claim I was going to mention involved an employee who claimed work related stress due to disputes with his employer. The cost to the Commonwealth of that was about $192,000. On it goes. You cannot-and I do not think my friends opposite are suggesting this-keep a situation like that running, because it is not fair on the other members of the work force. It is not fair on those unemployed people who are desperately looking for work and cannot find it. The limited expenditures are being wasted and diluted by people who are deliberately rorting the system, and there is no other word for it. It is interesting to look at the statistics for work related stress. Twenty-five per cent related to pressure from workload and deadlines; 25 per cent related to workplace trauma, client aggression and assault; 18 per cent related to interpersonal conflict; seven per cent related to witnessing physical or verbal abuse; six per cent related to forced relocation and organisational restructuring; four per cent related to performance counselling and other management processes. I do not want it to be thought for one minute that I am suggesting that the workers compensation system is failing us as a result of these claims. These claims have gone on and the process is designed to stop these claims from continuing. The workers compensation system is an important system and I am a strong supporter of the common law system remaining. Indeed, I do have some disagreements with my party about this particular matter. Mr Tanner-And me.",28
17,Mr TONY SMITH,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The member for Melbourne might do as well. It is because we know what happens and we know how difficult the workers compensation board can be in these common law claims. There are genuine cases where they exhaust litigants getting to the door of the court so that the litigants are so stressed out, apart from the injuries they are suffering, that they will accept anything to go away. There are cases of blatant negligence. I have seen litigants get dragged for 10 years through this process. They finally get to the door of the court, they are just about worn out and they are offered a pittance. They are minded to take the offer because of the way the board have dragged the process out. The board have all the power and the employee has none of the power. I do not want it to be thought for one minute that I am saying that, in those circumstances, every support should be given to those workers who are fighting the board. I think lawyers who take on these cases frequently on a speculative basis are to be commended for continuing those particular matters. Having said that, I do support the substance of the bill. I would ask the opposition to give it a reasonable hearing. I listened to the member for Greenway, who has been a worker and also involved in a trade union for a long time. I respect his views and have a lot of time for him because of that experience, but I say to him that this is not an ideological thing. It seems as though, the moment we try to introduce reforms, we get the ideological big stick waved at us. It is not an ideological thing. This is clearly a situation where reforms are needed in relation to legislation which has been extended wrongly, in my view. It needs to be brought back to the true meaning of the word 'material'. We are doing that with these amendments. I support these amendments and commend the bill to the House.",31
18,Mr TANNER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Melbourne) (11.15 a.m.)The Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill that we are dealing with today relates primarily to, as the previous contributions have indicated, stress and stress related claims under the Comcare legislation. The essential purpose of the legislation is to replace the term 'material degree' in the legislation with the term 'significant degree', which relates to the degree of nexus that must exist between the injury or disease that is sustained by the applicant and the contribution that has been made to this injury or disease by work or work related activity. The term 'significant degree' is defined as 'substantially more than material', which is, I suppose, a slightly circular way of going about it but it makes the intention of the legislation very plain, which is to lift the barrier to claims, particularly stress claims, that are brought under this legislation. It is interesting to note some of the history of this. I appreciate some of the comments, although I disagree with a number of them from the honourable member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith). This has been a long standing matter of contention in workers compensation going back many years. In the late 1970s, the then Hamer government in Victoria sought to replace the term 'material' with the term 'significant' in the Victorian legislation. This led to major industrial disputation, particularly with groups of workers like firemen, I think police, teachers and others who had substantial concerns about issues associated with workers compensation that ultimately led to the defeat of this proposal. Recently, there has been a great deal of concern within Comcare with respect to the increase in the cost burden of stress claims, and it is particularly associated with the length of time that people are off work. It would appear that that is the core element in the problem of a growing percentage of total Comcare outgoings that relate to stress claims. It is in fact primarily associated with the amount of time that people are absent from work. With respect to people who are covered by the Comcare scheme, the length of time people have off due to work related stress is substantially longer than the total average time taken off for injuries incurred at work. An associated amendment is very clearly also directed at stress claims and is designed to exclude injuries arising from reasonable managerial or administrative action, such as disciplinary action, decisions with respect to promotion and the like. On the face of it, it would seem that this is a reasonable proposition to advance, but the devil is in the detail, as is the case in so many other things. The real issue that the opposition has with respect to this particular amendment is the term 'reasonable'. What constitutes reasonable managerial action will be inherently subjective and very difficult to measure and quantify. When we put that together with the issue of 'substantially more than material', we have a recipe for enormous subjectivity, enormous bias and enormous variation across judicial decisions with respect to Comcare claims. This is essentially a rather crude and mechanistic way of tackling stress claims and the increasing burden that they are posing on the Comcare scheme. It is interesting to note that in the last year or so there has been a decline in the number of stress claims lodged per 100 Commonwealth employees. Although the burden that stress claims have imposed has increased significantly, it would appear that these claims are declining in number somewhat, which is at least of some value in this discussion. It is important also to recognise that the increase in the incidence of stress and the impact of stress in areas like the Commonwealth Public Service is in some respects a broader symptom of social and economic change in our community and should not be seen purely in isolation. It is difficult in these cases to disentangle the different sources that ultimately lead to a person suffering a sufficient degree of stress or associated problems that render them unable to continue to work. Often it is a mixture of a variety of issuessome of them work related, some not work related. Any authority that is dealing with these issues always has to disentangle those and attribute a proportion of blame to the workplace. That will always be a problem, and the government is seeking to lift the bar to make it harder for an employee to get workers compensation with respect to the work related nature of their stress or illness. It will lead, in my view, to legitimate claims being rejected. Although there was some balance in contribution of the honourable member for Dickson, I thought it was unfortunate that he read through a couple of very limited descriptions of a number of stress related claims. I doubt whether he knows the full detail of those cases, and I would caution him and other members about forming judgments about individual cases in this or other areas without knowing the full details. The coalition is fairly good at citing-we have seen this in the unfair dismissal area and the workers compensation area-one-liners that often give a totally distorted picture of what has gone on in a particular claim and using that as an example to suggest that the current framework is somehow ridiculous or unfair. I do not know the individual circumstances that the honourable member has cited, but I certainly do not wish to draw any conclusions based on a one-line description without actually knowing the full details of the case. In this area it is very easy to caricature the circumstances, to caricature the individual claims and to put them up in lights and say, 'Isn't this ridiculous?', without actually giving the people the full benefit of the detail and the full benefit of what has been involved in the decision-making process and what factors determined the outcome in that process. Let us not forget that there is considerable stress in many parts of federal government service. I would think that it has improved somewhat, although with recent government cutbacks and massive retrenchments we are probably going back to the good old days of the Fraser government. I remind people, for example, of what it is like to work on a counter in Social Security, particularly during the time when I had a bit of experience of it under the Fraser government in the late 1970s. People would often be waiting for four hours to be told, 'Sorry, the cheque's in the mail' or, 'Sorry, we can't do anything for you.' The end result for Social Security staff, who are grossly under-resourced and grossly understaffed, was that they would spend most of their day being screamed at and being threatened and abused, understandably, by distressed clients. It is hardly surprising that, in those sorts of circumstances, people are likely to develop serious stress conditions. That is not a uniform set of experiences in the Commonwealth Public Service but it is clearly a significant set of experiences. The sorts of cutbacks that this government is making will exacerbate the possibility of those things occurring to people. So do not for one minute think that everybody in the federal Public Service is just sitting there staring out of the window in some small office reading the paper. A lot of public servants are exposed in a front-line way to very stressful work-related activity and have to deal with people who are often very angry in very difficult circumstances, and as well they are dealing with those people while being grossly under-resourced. In my view, we should be trying a broader approach to dealing with the issue of stress. A few years ago a report called the Toohey report put forward a number of proposals which were pro-active and preventative in terms of trying to deal with the phenomenon of stress in the federal Public Service. Some of these recommendations were trialled in Social Security, from memory, and perhaps in DEET as well. I am not aware of the conclusions, but certainly it would be far better for the government to be taking a pro-active, preventative approach rather than the punitive approach of simply lifting the bar and trying to knock out a proportion of these claims. Things like better management practices and a better federal government approach to employing people would do a great deal to assist in this regard. It is interesting to note that we do not have a uniform situation across all jurisdictions on this issue. It leads to a number of broader points, which I will make in a minute, about the problem that Australia has with respect to its overall workers compensation picture. This is a retrograde step, in my view. It is particularly unfortunate when you consider that the overall structure of Comcare is essentially quite good. It is certainly better in its benefits structure than the bulk of the state systems, with the possible exception of South Australia, although that has probably changed in recent times. I am not across the detail of what has occurred there in very recent times. Although, historically, the Comcare procedures for making claims and processing claims have generally been pretty ordinary, and certainly inadequate compared with the state systems, the benefit structures have generally been substantially better than have applied in the state systems. In Victoria the Kennett government has literally gutted the W orkcare system and turned it into Workcover, creating circumstances where all those other than with various serious injuries are off benefits and back on Commonwealth social security after two years, leading to a substantial cost-shifting problem. We see a situation where there is a substantial lack of uniformity across Australia. All attempts to tackle this have come to nought. Unfortunately, we are likely to see some advance on this issue over the next few years, but it will be uniformity based on the lowest common denominator. That means uniformity at the expense of workers. Quite a good Industry Commission report on this issue came out late 1994 or early 1995 which actually gave some good, hard data about the costs of workplace injuries and how they are actually borne at the moment. It indicated that injured workers themselves bear a very substantial proportion of those costs and employers only bear roughly half in most cases, and in some states less than half, of total cost to the community of workers injured at work. The lack of uniformity is a growing issue because you have an increasing degree interstate economic activity, different types businesses, individual workers, more and more individual work activity crosses state lines, the activities of individual companies cross state boundaries and you often have people in quite complex situations. For examsome ple, I know of a person who was injured active while away on business in a different state. He fell down in the hotel where he was actually staying the night, paid for by employer. That gave rise to all sorts of comthree plex issues about under what scheme and what way the employer was liable. We have seen recent changes to the seamen's compeninaccurate sation arrangements pursued in order to in this area. preclude forum shopping between the different state systems and the seamen's compensathe tion system. The government could perhaps argue that this bill aids uniformity because there are more state jurisdictions that have the signifithe cant rather than material as their primary determinant of the question of injury. But, I said, this is uniformity downwards, unifornice mity at the expense of injured workers and uniformity based on reducing costs only, on improving the circumstances of injured workers. There is enormous misunderstanding in the community. I think the honourable member for Dickson's comments today did not help in that regard. There is an enormous stigmatisareality tion of injured workers. There is a perception that most people on workers compensation frauds and that they are doing things just bludge off the system. That is a grossly inaccurate perception. There are even simple things. Examples that often come to mind are things like somebody who is off work, jured, on workers compensation with a crook back. They are seen doing work out in the garden or lifting something in their backyard. That therefore leads people to the conclusion that they are a fraud-a bludger. I have a friend who had a laminectomy and spinal fusion, which is amongst the most the serious operations you can have. He suffered a back injury as a result of falling roughly 20 feet while working as a labourer. He was putting up a tent, from memory, and he of sustained a very serious long-term back of injury. His answer to those claims was to say, 'Well, yes, I sometimes do those things because I do not want to spend my life as a vegetable just lying on a hed or couch all day or sitting around all day. I want to try to do things that somebody who is physically will do. What people do not see is that if I am weeding the garden or bending over in the backyard, after I do that, I am then his back in my bedroom lying down for two or hours in considerable pain. That is what in they do not see.' People draw all sorts of superficial conclusions based on grossly or misleading anecdotal evidence It was particularly distressing in 1994 when Victorian state government ran a series of advertisements about Workcover which had a grossly misleading perspective, which presented a totally inaccurate view of what reality of being an injured worker and being on compensation means. You had the as injured worker there with the broken arm-a cliche, the broken arm-into the smiling, friendly doctor, then off to the smiling, not friendly employer who has worked out the return to work on light duties and 'Don't worry, we'll look after you.' That is garbage. The reality for most injured workers or workers who have got significant, serious injuries is absolutely the reverse. The is that they get dealt with by insurance doctors who often treat them appallingly, who are do all sorts of outrageous things to them. to They get employers who do not care, employers who do not want to go the extra mile to ensure that they can be rehabilitated, employers who say, 'Sorry, no light duties, there is innothing we can do for you,' employers who just want to get them off the books, employers who just want to get rid of them, who do not really understand and do not really care. They suffer isolation from work, isolation from workmates, isolation sometimes from their own friends. They suffer marital problems, often marriage breakdown. They suffer the innuendo of their family and friends about whether or not they might be bludging if they have got an injury that is not obvious, if they have not got something like a broken arm in a sling. They suffer from the uncaring insurance doctors who just chum them through like cattle and push and prod them, who are there to prove that they are frauds or bludgers and who think that unless you are in a wheelchair you are capable of work. They suffer all sorts of bureaucratic hassles in the compensation system. As I have indicated, Comcare is, in my view, one of the worse, or it certainly was a couple of years ago. For a long period of time it was one of the worse of the various schemes in Australia in this regard. Those hassles are, in my view, sometimes even deliberately designed to actually get rid of people, to make them dispirited and give up and go away, which ultimately reduces the cost. They suffer massive financial problems. People sometimes lose their house because, no matter how allegedly generous workers comp benefits can be, invariably they do not replace the income the person was previously on. If they have been fairly highly geared, if they have had a high mortgage and a low discretionary income, it is often financially diabolical for them. They sometimes suffer harassment from insurance investigators. I have represented injured workers, for example, who have had serious back injuries and who have had insurance investigators throw stones at them in the street to try to make them run so that they can then be filmed running. I have represented injured workers who have had insurance investigators let down the tyres on their car so that they could then be filmed trying to change the tyre. That sort of harassment is not the sort of thing that you see on the tabloid current affairs programs when they are talking about workers compo And, of course, they suffer all the usual things about the loss of capacity to work, loss of self-esteem, the obvious pain and suffering associated with serious injury. So, when you see unions like the CFMEU engaged in industrial action and demonstrations against the Premier of Victoria, these are the reasons why unions take workers compensation very seriously indeed. The injured workers are amongst the most disadvantaged, maltreated groups of people in our society, and the enforcement of occupational health and safety in our community is very variable and very ordinary. If you kill somebody in a car, you might go to gaol. If you are an employer and through your negligence you kill somebody, you might get a fine. Even if you get a substantial fine, such as in the Nadenbousch case in Victoria a few years ago, where it was $120,000, you can then bankrupt your company and tum up the following day in a different corporate form performing the same sorts of work and potentially in the same circumstances. It is long overdue that we start to get serious about these issues in this country. Yes, we need uniform workers compensation legislation, but uniform workers compensation legislation that provides decent benefits for workers, that ensures that seriously injured workers can be rehabilitated and that ensures that employers do honour their obligations and that people do not have to put up with the sorts things that historically injured workers have put up with in this country. This legislation is another small step backwards for injured workers in this society. It tackles one particular group. It is designed to hit a particular perceived problem that should be being addressed in a far more creative and proactive way than simply lifting the bar to claims. That does not solve the problem. It might save the Commonwealth a little bit of money, but it does not ensure that the workplace is better. It does not ensure that there is greater efficiency in terms of how we function as an employer, as a parliament or as a government. It does not address any of those things. All it does is say, 'We want to get some of these people off the books and in order to do justify that we put up some grotesquely caricatured examples, one-liners based on individual cases,' where we are not being told what the real basis of the case was and what the full substance of the case was. This is mean-spirited, narrow-minded, nasty legislation based on a mean-spirited, narrow minded government which is led by a meanspirited, narrow-minded and nasty Prime Minister (Mr Howard). It is designed to hit injured workers in a way that I belie\ e is unfair. We should be getting serious as a parliament, and the government should be getting serious, about tackling the broader problems of injured workers in our society, who, as I have indicated, are amongst the most disadvantaged and unfairly treated groups of people in our community.",31
19,Mr MAREK,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I hear what the shadow minister for transport, the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), said. I hear him talking about getting serious about legislation. I think this government is extremely serious. What is required is credibility, and that is something which the honourable member obviously does not have on this issue. Exercising is good, but being crashtackled in a game of rugby union or playing rugby league with a major spinal injury is not light duties, and I would question your credibility in saying that it depends on how you exercise yourself. I hear you talking about gardening and those sorts of things. You have got to have a degree of credibility and you have got to be able to back up your statements, and talking about people throwing rocks at people is a little bit farcical. In relation to the Industrial Relations lation Amendment Bill, I consider it fitting to relate these amendments to industry and small business. The reason for this is that, unlike many members in the House, I have worked hands-on as an apprentice fitter and turner in the Bundaberg sugar mills at Fairymead, as a fitter and turner in the coal mines in central Queensland and as an employer in my own small business, a panel beating and spray painting operation in the township of Clermont, also in central Queensland. The issue of safety in the workplace is paramount to all as too often people become complacent. A print that hung on a wall at Blair Athol coalmine where I worked as a fitter and turner sticks firmly in my mind. It said that we are all responsible for our own safety. A sticker glued to many of the mirrors in the washrooms said, 'You are now looking at the person responsible for your safety'. How true these statements are, and they are especially relevant to this legislation. The Labor Party would say that people do not rort workers compensation systems as they have very strong safeguards. Those people who have that opinion confirm my point of view that a prerequisite to coming to this place should be to have worked for a living not fudged around the edges of employment in a comfy old chair in the ivory tower of the ACTU. I have worked in these environments with a couple of hundred employees. I have heard the odd whisper about the possibility of a certain injury to an individual that might have happened on the previous day at a football game or another sporting event. Early the next morning at work the person slips over on a wet concrete floor and claims that he got the injury at work, when others know better. This is what costs the employer an absolute fortune. After the injury is on the record as having happened at work, individuals can come back, under workers compensation, a week, a month or a year later and say that they got the injury at work and need a reconstruction, when they really should have claimed insurance-particularly if the injury happened at a sporting event, for example football. We have insurances for those sorts Legisof things, but the current system puts the burden back onto the taxpayer and puts the country into major debt. It is imperative that we have a secure system of insurance for employees in this country. If we keep going as we are, we will not have any employers to employ the people. It costs an employer a fortune every year in workers comp and it is one of the reasons that small business is trying to work without taking on additional staff. When I had my panel shop and employed a few staff, the thousands of dollars that I sank into the system was enough to drive you to drinkthank God I do not-and I never had claim. I spent thousands of dollars on workers compensation and I never had a claim. I had all the necessary equipment and we worked safely in my panel shop. If one of my people got hurt, I would pay for the treatment myself. I would not send the person off and claim workers compensation, because it would cost so much in increased premiums. It was not worth the trouble. A lot of other employers do that too. If they can get away with not having to claim a workers compensation injury for someone in the workplace, they will, because they cannot afford the increased premIUms. This is why we have to look at the system to try to get one that is fairer for all. At the moment, the system is open to rorting and it costs the country too much money. Many employers are not far off going to the wall because they cannot afford the increased premiums. In Queensland, when there was a change of government and the NationalLiberal coalition took over, we saw the great damage that had been done by Labor to the workers compensation system. Interestingly, one of your Labor mates was running the show- Mr Wayne Goss, the former Premier of Queensland. That is a familiar name. As I understand it, he is trying to get into the federal parliament in the coming election. That will be interesting. He wants to try to drive the federal system to the wall as well. Mr MCClelland- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: I do not wish to interrupt the speaker early in his speech but the chair does not hold political office and the speaker's comment that 'one of your Labor mates' has undertaken some particular course of action is quite inappropriate.",36
20,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I remind the honourable member for Capricornia that we are debating the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill. There is a bit of latitude, but I ask him to come back to the mainstream of his speech.",37
21,Mr MAREK,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Thank you for drawing that to my attention and for bringing me back to the debate. This topic makes people anxious. It concerns so many people. You can understand why we are drawn to make those sorts of statements. I will mention some statements from the Economics Legislation Committee's paper so that people can understand the reasons for these amendments. This bill is the direct result of amendments announced in the 1996 budget to clarify the circumstances in which compensation is payable through the Commonwealth workers compensation scheme. The bill amends the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991 and the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 so that Comcare is responsible for determining the amount payable by the department or authority. There is provision for a department or authority to seek a review of the amount determined. This review will be conducted by Comcare in the first instance and then, if the department or authority so wishes, by the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission. Further in relation to the statement put out by the committee, the schedule proposes a number of other amendments. These include that Comcare shall provide advice on occupational health and safety matters to employers--either on its own initiative or on request; transfer certain powers in relation to investigations from the commission to the chief executive officer of Comcare; increase the maximum penalties that can be imposed under the act; ensure that a document which is cited in the act's regulations has effect as amended from time to time without the need to amend the regulations; and also require that a document which is incorporated in a code of practice be available for inspection at the offices of Comcare. Schedule 2 of the bill proposes to amend the act to allow the chief executive officer of Comcare to subdelegate any of the powers or functions delegated by the commission. Schedule 2 amendments will also enable Comcare to charge a fee for the provision of claims management services to class 1 licence holders and will reflect an existing administrative arrangement whereby the Northern Territory government reimburses Comcare for payment of compensation to certain persons and associated administrative costs. Amendments in schedule 2 will ensure that compensation benefits are maintained at a minimum level of 70 per cent of indexed normal weekly earnings in all cases. Changes to the system relating to the definition of disease are designed to strengthen the connection between work and the compensable injury. Currently, a workplace must make a material contribution to a worker's disease before compensation is payable. Under this bill, the changes to the workplace contribution test will be upgraded from 'material' to 'significant'. The unions appear to be stressing out over the Industrial Relations Legislation Bill 1996, which seeks to make amendments to the Occupational Health and Safety Act and the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. They are not claiming this legislation will lead to an increased work load, creating the need for subsequent occupational stress leave or workers compensation. But they might as well be saying that. There are more than 100,000 workers compensation claims a year in Queensland alone, and a lot of those claims are fictitious, as has been proven. We have seen photographs in newspapers of people working and actively playing sport while being paid to recover from these fictitious injuries-and their supposed injuries are the result of real accidents in the workplace and not imaginary stress related problems! While workers must be provided with reasonable compensation for bona fide claims, a considerable number of people in the work force have abused the system, which has spoiled it for everyone. It is important to get that point across today: we probably would not have this legislation if the system had not been rorted. People know that. This all comes back to the fact that the odd few have spoilt the system for the others, and that fact needs to go down on the record and be expressed. This legislation has had to be brought in because the odd few got in and spoiled things for everyone. Employees who are injured as a result of work must be compensated, as I was saying, but the employees who blame work for their invisible, non-physical injuries will have to prove their case beyond a shadow of a doubt. That is not a bad resolution, but one area I am concerned about is the definition of disease. This bill states that regard must be given to whether the claimant would have contracted or suffered the aggravation of their ailment in spite of their employment. This provision will require the compensation authority and medical advisers to assess whether the disease occurred outside the person's employment: diseases such as asbestosis, lead poisoning and the like can be contracted outside as well as inside the workplace. However, if it is proven that an employer or management did not take reasonable action to protect their employees, compensation is applicable. That is fair. What about the diseases we know little about at present? How will the authorities be able to assess those, if there has been no previous test case in the worker's environment? I would like to see the legislation be more responsible when it comes to issues like this, so that we do promote a safe and healthy working environment. But these diseases are tangible; they do occur in the work place and must be acknowledged. New ailments such as stress and RSI are not tangible and can be caused by outside influences or non-work related activities. We should attempt to tighten up on claims for such ailments by putting the onus onto the employee to prove beyond a shadow of doubt that their so-called injuries are the result of employer negligence and are connected to the job of work. Until now, it has been too easy for people to claim compensation for psychological and non-physical impairment. Evidence of this abuse of the system is to be found in a 199394 survey of the causes of stress claims which was conducted by Comcare. That survey found that interpersonal conflict was given as the cause of 24 per cent of stress claims. Another 24 per cent of stress claims were said to have been caused by workloads and dead lines, while the cause given for 22 per cent of the claims was organisational change. Physical and verbal abuse was cited as the cause of another 17 per cent of claims, and seven per cent were said to have been caused by performance counselling and other management processes. Forced relocation and organisational restructuring were said to cause a final six per cent of these claims. These are legitimate claims, yet politicians and their staff experience such problems on a day-today basis, and they get on with the job as designated or find alternative employment. It is as simple as that. The unions do not like the clause which states that consideration of the claimant's private life and lifestyle be taken into account when claims are made. They are well aware that a considerable number of previous claimants have made claims for injuries that have not originated in the workplace or that have only been exacerbated by work and not caused by it. Mr Bruce Scott-Leo.",37
22,Mr MAREK,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"Yes, that sounds as if it might have been a case in point-falling a pushbike. When someone makes a claim for car or house insurance compensation, the onus of proof is on the claimant. Why should those claiming workers compensation not be prepared to abide by the same ruling, particularly if they have nothing to hide and they are truthful within their claim? If they are doing the right thing, they should be properly compensated and they will be. I commend the bill to the House.",39
23,Mr MCCLELLAND,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"It is a shame that this government repeatedly throws the baby out with the bathwater. It was evident from the speech of the member for Capricornia (Mr Marek) that the thrust of the Industrial Relations Legislanumber. tion Amendment Bill 1996 is to attempt address perceived rorters. I think he went far as to say that, if it had not been for instances of rorters, there would not be a need for this legislation. But members of the government say that without bringing before the House the fuII details of instances they aIIege rorting has occurred. I share the concerns of the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), in that the other day the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) came and gave in summary form volved. accounts of claims which he regarded as inappropriate. If they were inappropriate claims and those people could not establish material causal connection to stress arising the course of their work, Comcare opportunity to dispute them and, if they were disputed, those people had the opportunity go to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, where they would have been obliged to prove their case beyond the balance of probability. So the member for Capricornia's statement that workers will now be required to prove their case beyond a shadow of a doubt is already the case. Any worker who chaIIenges a ruling denying him compensation has to prove their case on the balance of probability. In terms of knowing how the system works, I was a member of a legal firm for 14 years that did more than its fair share of workers compensation cases. And, yes, while you did get a small percentage of people through your door who were less than genuine, the great off majority were genuine, deserving cases. There is a big difference in approach between someone looking at circumstances put up as a facade of massive rorting and a judge looking at the specific facts presented to him in respect of the individual circumstances of the case, as the member for Melbourne indicated. I would go so far as to say that it is a misuse of our position as members of parliament to be overly simplistic and overly dramatic in terms of cases which are devastating to the lives of the workers involved, and indeed fundamentaIIy devastating to the lives of their families. The figures show there is not an excessive number of stress claims, and it is a declining What appears to be going awry into terms of the costs some stress claims are so placing on the system is the length of time those some people have off work. That may be the result of lack of motivation of the particular worker, but it may equally be an indication that the rehabilitation procedures adopted by where the employer are not working. The evidence in my research of stress claims is that the longer a worker is away from work, the less likely they are to be able to return because of the apprehensions inI recall that, in my early career as a lawyer, I was involved in a case where a payroll manager of a very substantial coma pany had a nervous breakdown, which we in were able to prove was a result of the preshad every sures of his work. That company, however, was more sophistito cated in its approach to rehabilitation and offered him work initiaIIy as a cleaner of the factory floor. While there would be an argument that that may not have been suitable selective duty employment in terms of the experience, seniority and skills of that payroll manager, he was more than happy to take that role because he saw the physical side of the job and his opportunity to interact with other workers on the factory floor literally as being therapeutic, and indeed it was. He successfully recovered. I am not saying that, in every case of a senior manager, it is appropriate to offer that senior manager menial tasks. More often than not, that is done by employers to try to call their bluff and to find a mechanism to cut them off workers compensation. But there are means whereby, with a bit of dedication and by going that extra mile, as the member for Melbourne said, successful rehabilitation programs can be instigated. I suspect that the reason stress sufferers staying too long away from work is poor rehabilitation schemes. But rather than look at those poor rehabilitation schemes, the government is throwing out the protective mechanism, the whole security, that workers compensation has provided now for decades for a very large number of workers. The government has said it is not doing it for reasons of cost cutting. That is quite surprising when one looks at the financial impact statement in the explanatory memorandum, which states that the savings described to accrue directly from the amendments are $3 million in 1996-97, $10 million in 1997-98 and $16 million rising to $24 million in 19992000. To say there is no desire to cost-cut at the benefit of workers' security is wrong. The fact of the matter is that Comcare premiums are among the lowest when compared with state workers compensation premiums. Premiums actually dropped from 1.7 per cent of the payroll in 1995-96 to 1.6 per cent in 1996-97, and all of Comcare's liabilities are fully funded. Against that background, there is no need to make these cost savings at the cost of the security of workers and their families. While it has to be said that the number of stress claims among public servants is slightly higher, and only slightly higher, than in the broader community, those stress claims are entirely consistent with expert analysis. For instance, Dr Ann Williamson of W orksafe Australia has said: There is good evidence that people who manage people are more stressed than those that manage millions of dollars worth of machinery. The member for Capricornia gave an account of his panel beating workshop. While, yes, there were time pressures and so forth and they were operating machinery, the evidence suggests that, in a managerial or personal interaction framework, the stress factors can be more pronounced. Again, there is a risk of this government seeing another opportunity to condemn public servants not only as being bludgers but now as 'Captain Rats' and rorters. The government says the Public Service is a bad thing and anything we can do to cut cost at the expense are of the Public Service is a good thing. It is part of this atmosphere of contempt for the public sector and, hence, the reason for the retraction of so many government services. Perhaps that is digressing a little from the thrust of the legislation, but one can see that thinking underlying the whole approach of the government. The other unfortunate thing about this bilI is that it is going to go further in stigmatising those who submit stress claims. The best evidence indicates that stress claims which are actually reported are only the tip of the iceberg. A recent article in the Australian in February this year stated: Research shows that although workers compensation is the most visible measure of contemporary workplace stress, it is only the tip of the iceberg. A vast number of cases of work stress do not result in claims, said Dr John Toohey, teacher of occupational health and safety management at the University of NSW. Dr Toohey said: Stress currently accounts for 4 per cent to 6 per cent of national claims. For every one that reached that level, there are 10 others that did not make a claim. These still resulted in significant lost time and poor productivity. So, in terms of the analysis by the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith), and I agree with the member for Melbourne, he substantially made a balanced contribution to the debate, but he referred to the fact that people take time off as a result of stress because they are entitled to compensation for doing so. He referred to his conversations with a number of people who have made s-ress claims, per.haps in his practice as a bamster, and he saId to them, 'What would happen if you were-'t able to access compensation?' and they saId, 'We wouldn't have taken the time off.' But Dr Toohey is saying that, even if they do not take the time off, the overall workvictim. place for productivity of that workplace knocked about. It has really had a tremenworker dously damaging impact on the productivity of the workplace. If you want a public service which has low morale, if you want a public service which has low productivity, you leave or force people who are incapable of performing their duties in that situation, rather looking at why they are having problems performing their duties and addressi.ng that situation so that you keep a productIve and motivated work force. The other clear point of irony that comes out in the legislation at this time is that it occurring at a time when the government has massively cut the Public Service and talking about further massive restructuring. That, clearly, is going to be a situation which generates added stress. From her clinical life experience with all her patients, Green, a registered psychologist, said: Today recession-driven stress appears t- dominate the workplace. The stories I hear from clIents come to have a familiar ring. Not surprisingly the present fear of redundancy looms large, as does worry about closure of the whole organisation department. As staff members are rationalised those who left say they experience pressure to take on workload previously carried by t-o o- three No matter whether this perception IS realIstic not, the anxiety is real and this stress. People talk of too many or impossible deadlines and of an excessive number of projects on hand at anyone time. Generally, they feel pushed beyond their capacity to perform. Fear of failure sets in; interpersonal conflicts are magnified and mismanaged; and because the perceived dangers of stress have been widely publicised, the fear of fear syndrome sends its victims into a downward spiral of physical and emotional dysfunction. Rather than address the reality that that situation is occurring in so much of the work force in this day and age, particularly in the Public Service, the government is turning its back on addressing the causes. In terms of managing stress, it is interesting to note that Ms Green goes on to say: No matter what happens, don't see yourself as a are This legislation specifically requires the to portray themselves as a victim of unreasonable management practices if they are to succeed. The evidence is that it is completely contrary to the established and recommended ways of addressing stress and itself . will be an aggravating source. In a further than publication, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry has said that the requirement to impose upon a worker 'to find fault so as to justify a claim, may in itself lead to an exacerbation or prolongation of the stress' . Again, this is where the government is is heading with its legislation, which it has not thought through. That really should be conis demned. Further evidence suggests: . .. occupational stress impacts on all aspects of it must be considered as a public health issue that needs to be addressed through organisational Mirella Heath and individual programs. The consequences of occupational stress flow through to the family in terms of marital everdiscord and even discord with children. They flow through to the amount of illness in the or community generally and hence the demands on Medicare. But, rather than looking at are addressing stress as a public health issue the which is going to place its own demands on pe?ple. the community, the government has, with a or very short-sighted focus, looked at these cost is what causes cutting measures. The fact is that the government has been extremely short-sighted in its approach and, worse than that, draconian in its methodology. For instance, as the member for Capricornia has said, before a worker can establish their entitlement to compensation, there is going to be an analysis as to whether the worker is likely to have otherwise succumbed to the particular disease, irrespective of their employment. I was quite alarmed to learn, according to the analysis of the member for Capricornia, that, in cases where asbestos or lead poisoning are involved, workers will now bear an onus of proof to establish that their outside activities did not contribute to their condition. In many cases, that will be an impossible onus of proof. Anyone who has seen a victim dying of mesothelioma as a result of asbestos exposure will know that having to bear such an onus of proof is harsh and draconian in the extreme. Workers are going to be subject to an analysis as to whether they had any medical predisposition. Any worker who brings a claim is now going to have their medical records gone through with a fine toothcomb. The tribunal will be required to consider the activities of the employee which are not related to his or her employment, such as-as the explanatory memorandum says--domestic, social, sporting, educational or community activities. Private investigators are going to be knocking on the doors of neighbours asking what a worker's marital relationship is like and whether their kids have any problems at school. It is awfully intrusive. I know the way these legal cases are contested. It is not an overstatement at all to say that private investigators are going to make a windfall gain out of this legislation. Of course, there is the general catch-alI-any other matters which might affect the employee's health. Private investigators will be following an employee who has lodged a stress claim to see whether that employee goes down to the pub of an afternoon. Hence, one can imagine the employee being cross-examined by a barrister as to whether he has a drinking problem because a private investigator has a film of him going into the local Kings Head Tavern. It is very much the element of fault that will be coming into workers compensation cases now. The next thing of real concern are the words in the legislation 'reasonable managerial or administrative action'. This is where the draftsmanship is particularly poor. A court will not be able to fathom what that means. For instance, air traffic controllers will have an additional workload because of the opening of the east-west runway at Sydney's Kingsford Smith Airport. Will the stress be a result of their daily normal work or the result of a managerial decision to reopen the eastwest runway and run the risks associated with that operation? The legislation is completely unclear on that. It is poorly drafted. It is motivated by misconception at the very least, but more likely an ignorance of approach because it has failed to address stress. It attempts to punish those who suffer stress and, worse, their families. This government really needs to be condemned for its mean, short-sighted and ignorant approach to the reality of working life in this day and age.",39
24,Mrs WEST,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I cannot help but disagree with most of what the previous speaker has said. In essence, this legislation tidies up the sloppy legislation that was made unworkable by the previous government and which allowed rorts and abuse to happen at the taxpayers' expense. I believe the result of March 1996 has allowed the taxpaying public to seek redress of this legislation. The rorters and abusers of this system cannot go on forever. The cost to the public is too great. This legislation is designed to quantify and qualify the circumstances under which injury or recompense is allowed. I am pleased to be a member of this government, to bite the bullet and tackle the difficult issues of workplace reform which were so sadly neglected and ignored by the previous government. This legislation is part of a package designed to redress years of policy complacency-a complacency that did not reflect the benefits which could be enjoyed through positive contributions, harmony and cooperation from all parties in the workplace and on the shop floor. This bill makes a number of changes to the industrial relations legislation, changes which the former government tried to make but were either unwilling or unable to carry through. The three most significant changes are amendments to the definitions of 'disease' and 'injury' and the transferring of responsibility for the determining of contributions and premiums. Let me elaborate on the first two of these points. In redefining the terms 'disease' and 'injury' this amendment to the current legislation will achieve what the original architects had planned. In 1988, the then government introduced reforms to the Commonwealth workers compensation scheme. Central to those reforms was a failed attempt to clarify circumstances under which workers could claim compensation. The change was deemed necessary because, under the then current legislation, a worker only needed to show that his or her employment was a contributing factor to their condition. With such a liberal definition, it is little wonder that the Commonwealth was liable for payouts for diseases which had little or no connection with the person's employment. To their credit, the previous government decided that this needed to be changed. The intention was to make the tests tougher by insisting that employment contributed a material degree to the contraction of the disease. In introducing the bill, the minister of the day said: It is intended that the test will require an employee to demonstrate that his or her employment was more than a mere contributing factor in the contraction of the disease. Accordingly, it will be necessary for an employee to show that there is a close connection between the disease and the employment in which he or she is engaged. The intention was there, but was the will? I would say not. This is proved by a case which went before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. This tribunal ruled that 'material' meant 'pertinent or likely to influence'. What did this mean? It meant that once again employees could claim compensation for illnesses which were in no way connected to their job. Over time, the interpretation has become closer to the point where the government was back to scratch. Of course, this should not surprise anyone as this is the way the unions would have wanted it. As we all know, under Labor, what the unions wanted the unions got. For whom was this situation most beneficial? Not your hard working, honest and dutiful employee; this circumstance encouraged rogues and rorters to abuse a very generous benefit. There are two ways to reduce the number of payouts for work related illness, of which stress is the most common complaint. The first is by tightening the rules relating to payouts and the second is by better management practices. Better management practices have led to a decrease in the number of claims. But this has not led to a corresponding decrease in the cost of complexity of those claims. In fact, as of June 1995, the Commonwealth's liabilities totalled almost $1 Y2 billion-I repeat: $1 Y2 billion-of lost productivity. Of these costs the majority comes from claims of stress related illness. Twenty-seven per cent of the total workers compensation payouts went to stress claims, despite the fact these claims made up only 13 per cent of all claims. To put this in terms of time lost, the average stress claim had workers off the job for 11 weeks compared to 3Y2 weeks for all other claims. The average stress claim cost to the Commonwealth is $32,000 whereas the average non-stress claim cost is $7,700. The overall cost of stress claims rose 30 per cent in the years from 1991 to 1995, climbing from $24 million to $37 million. This is a puzzlement. The number of claims dropped, but the cost of each claim increased. In fact, the 30 per cent increase arose over a period of four years. What a growth industry. Was there no concern or reaction to such an increase? What workplace conditions created such conditions? With the previous Labor government bosses directing traffic, who could blame them? Neither I nor this government are for one minute suggesting that stress is not a very real disease. I have seen stress affect the strongest of people in a variety of occupations. Being a teacher in a previous work life, I can attest to the stress of the day-today workplace. I would suggest that there are a number of politicians in this House who would suffer some degree of stress, and a considerable proportion of their staff would suffer likewise. But in good colloquial terms: if you can't stand the heat get out of the kitchen. But stress is an odd thing. It comes about for a variety of reasons, not the least of it being financial strain. Other contributors can be family problems-either with the partner or the children---concern over failure, both social and in the workplace; a heavy workload; and unrealistic expectations from an employer. Is it therefore reasonable for the government as an employer to pick up the tab for every stress related claim put to it without some concrete proof that it was the workplace that caused the problem? I do not think so. We live in stressful times. In days gone by, when the world travelled at a much slower pace, stress was not something common in the workplace and it was virtually unheard of in the home. Now it is as common as the common cold. Students at high school and road workers laying pavement all seem to be suffering from some form of stress. Why is everyone so stressed? Again, this can be for a variety of reasons, as I pointed out earlier. But what we can we do about it? As with most illnesses, prevention is better than cure. The government realises this and has put its weight behind a number of preventative projects being run by Comcare and other agencies and through a joint working party established under the Australian Public Service Agreement. Following the establishment of the Stress Claims Management Centre in January 1995, claims management has improved greatly. However, this has not stopped workers from making stress related claims due to action taken by management. In fact, it is a widely held belief that in a number of such cases employees are making stress related claims as an avenue to registering complaints against management or to stop some form of managerial action. For example, an employee working in a team has not been pulling his weight. This places an extra workload on the other team members and caused problems with management. The office manager warns the employee that disciplinary action may follow if the assigned work is not completed. The employee, who is having financial problems outside the workplace, decides that it is all getting too hard and puts in a stress claim. The stress is very real but not caused by the workplace. Under the current legislation the government would foot the bill while his employee takes stress leave. Under the proposed changes, the government would not be liable for this claim. However, this is not to say that the employer is absolved of all responsibility. Good management practices would dictate that employees who are suffering from outside pressures are given some latitude with respect to duties. I am not suggesting that employees should be allowed to slacken off, but perhaps other duties may be found which the employee could better handle. The intention of this bill is not to stop all claims but to filter those that are of a fraudulent or frivolous nature. I would like to give you another example, an actual occurrence which relates to a section which the minister alluded to in his second reading speech. I quote: By restating the threshold requirement of workrelatedness, the government is reactivating the original intention of the scheme that, for a disease to be compensable, employment must be a significant or substantial cause of the disease. In particular, where a disease is not the result of a clearly distinguishable incident in the workplace or is attributed to multiple causes, the amendments will properly ensure that Commonwealth employers do not bear the cost of something for which they have only limited, or no actual, moral responsibility. The case I will refer to went on for almost two years and involved a Commonwealth public servant. It was brought to my attention by a constituent of mine who was working in the same department. The claimant was leaving home one morning and slipped on her front stairs. This caused a substantial injury to her back. Under the current legislation, once a person leaves their front door they are covered by the Commonwealth. I am not sure how this woman slipped. Perhaps the stairs were wet, maybe she was rushing to catch the bus or she may have tripped on the dog. This point is not important. What is important is that she lodged a workers compensation claim and it was approved. For the next two years this woman lived off the system. She was given every opportunity to improve her condition and to get back to work. Being on the heavy side, she was advised by her doctor that losing weight was essential to full recovery. To this end, the government paid for her to attend a dietitian, paid two years worth of gym fees and paid for intensive physiotherapy. However it was all to no avail. The woman did not want to help herself. During this two-year period this person raised her child at home and continued with her daily household chores. As a mother of three you can take my word for it that going to work each day is a damned sight easier than running around after the kids-it is certainly easier on the body. Obviously this woman had a medical condition. However, for two years the government footed the bill for this woman to stay home. And why? Because she slipped on the front steps of her own home, something that could have happened at any time of the day or night, weekend or weekday. It was just fortunate that it happened when she was on her way to work. Surely this injury could not be considered to have resulted from her employment. If that person had been picking up a box at work or had even slipped on the tiles in the kitchen of her workplace, we could see a connection. Again, I stress that the government is not trying to cut off an employee's right to make claims, either stress or physically related. we are trying to do is to make sure that such claims are related to the person's employment. With regard to stress claims, the unions the opposition will no doubt be up in arms over the proposed changes. In fact, the shadow minister has accused the government of legislating stress claims out of existence. I would like to ask: where were the stress claims ten years ago? Why has this issue over a period of time raised its ugly head? The Commonwealth Public Sector Union claims that the legislation pre-empts the findings of the heads of workers compensation authorities report. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, the heads of workers compensation authorities report has recommended that compensation for stress be limited by providing that stress which arises from reasonable employer action, taken in a reasonable manner, regarding discipline, nonpromotion, termination and similar matters of workplace management is not compensable. The minister has taken this into account when writing this amendment. The definition of 'injury' in the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act will be amended to provide that compensation is not payable in respect of injury which arises solely or predominantly out of reasonable managerial or administrative action taken in a reasonable manner by the employer in connection with an employee's employmenta fair and just assessment. In his second reading speech, the minister set out some examples of reasonable managerial or administrative action. For the benefit of those present who may have missed these examples, I will enlighten you further. The minister said: ... reasonable managerial or administrative action would include action taken in a reasonable manner to reclassify, transfer, demote, discipline, counsel or redeploy an employee, or cease the employee's employment. It would also cover a decision based on reasonable grounds not to promote, reclassify, transfer or grant leave of absence to an employee. Employer action relating to the restructure and reorganisation of the Australian Public Service would also constitute reasonable managerial or administrative action. All It has to be said that this in no way impinges on the rights of employees to make a stress related claim if the stress stems from an extremely high workload or unreasonable and expectations from an employer. Nor will the changes affect an employee's right to claim compensation for physical injury caused by the working environment. As for the shadow minister's comments, his government made a failed attempt to correct this problem in 1988. For various reasons, not the least of which would have been pressure from the Commonwealth and Public Sector Union, the Labor government dropped the amendments like a hot potato. As we have seen with all forms of industrial and workplace reforms, Labor just did not have the guts to make the changes which have been so desperately needed. In my electorate of Bowman I have workers from all walks of life. I have almost 4,500 small businesses which would employ, on average, four workers each. I have more than 20 schools which employ an average of 20 staff. I have six major shopping centres which employ hundreds of staff in a variety of positions. There is no doubt that many of these people would suffer from stress of one variety or another but would never consider claiming workers compensation. Then they hear about stories such as the ones I have outlined earlier. Is it little wonder that the reputation of the Australian Public Service is so poor? The general public really deals with public servants only when they have a problem. their problem is not solved quickly and ranks efficiently, they complain that public servants are lazy and inefficient. Having been in constant contact with a large number of public servants, nothing could be further from the truth. Sure, there are one or two who spoil things for the majority, as there are in all industries. However, the majority of those deal with are hard workers trying to cope a demanding public and an antiquated and hopelessly out of date set of rules and regulapeculiar tions-rules and regulations, I might add, the majority of which were set up by the former administration over 13 years of hopeless mismanagement of the Commonwealth Public Service. This government proposes to lift the image of the Public Service by weeding out those who wish to make both fraudulent and frivogross lous claims. The public at large want efficient and effective Public Service. This legislation is moving towards improving the circumstances of and benefiting those in the workplace. By making these changes we will not only improve the service's image but also ensure the financial viability of the scheme not jeopardised by the payment of compensadata, tion for diseases and injuries which have little or no connection with the employment and stress which have arisen solely out of the reasonable management of the workplace. I am pleased that, among all our govern90, ment's positive contributions to reform, this legislation is a cog in the wheel of progress towards an efficient and effective workplace. After 13 years of gross mismanagement, was inevitable that we, the government, claims. would be forced to clean up the mess. It has been said that action springs not from thought but from a readiness for responsibility. That is the difference between the current government and the opposition: they thought about changing the system; we now have the responsibility for doing it. I commend this bill to the House.",42
25,Ms ELLIS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"I say at the outset how pleased I am to hear the previous speaker, the honourable member for Bowman (Mrs West), praise public sector workers as much as she did. I look forward to If her perpetuating that view throughout the of those opposite. May that be reflected by their future comments on the public sector within the ACT. In most cases, it is derided these by those opposite around the country. As has been said previously in this debate and has been outlined by the previous speaker, stress is not an issue which is restricted to I the Public Service or to Canberra-nor is it with an Australian phenomenon. Overseas experience has shown that occupational stress is not to either of those areas. It is a new threat to occupational health, symptomatic of post-industrial society. I am told that in the USA stress claims, which have trebled since 1980 and are estimated to cost $150 billion annually, represent 15 per cent of all occupational disease claims. In the UK, for instance, the cost of stress accounts for 3.5 per cent of national product, GNP, and the loss of an 40 million working days a year. The cost of stress to the Commonwealth is assessed by measuring the frequency and the duration of the claims. Because stress claims take five years to mature on average, the actual compensation cost of stress claims are is best considered having regard to the 1989-90 which demonstrated that the cost of a stress claim averaged $17,517 compared with just under $5,000 for other claims. It should also be noted that this is the result of the expanded duration of those claims. In 1989the average incapacity duration was 28.22 weeks for stress claims and 7.47 weeks for others. The most recent figures show a decline in both the actual duration of stress it claims and the average duration of stress There is absolutely no doubt that the work that has been undertaken over recent years to address this has started to take effect. Much of the reduction can be attributed to the efforts of the SRC Commission and Comcare in prevention activities. This should not be ignored in this debate. It is very important to note that much attention and effort have been put into addressing the very real human cost, let alone the dollar cost, of stress claims. Present trends indicate a decline in the frequency of claims from 6.6 per hundred Commonwealth employees in 1995-96 to 6.07 claims per hundred in 1996-97, testimony to the hard work and attention which have been given to this matter. Research into the spread of workplace stress in the Commonwealth indicates that it is experienced as a response to work processes, workplace organisation and management practices. This outcome is reflected in an examination of the 1993-94 stress claims determined by Comcare, which showed that the following seemed to be the cause of stress claims: interpersonal conflict, workload and deadline, organisational change, physical and verbal abuse, performance counselling and other management processes and forced relocation and organisational restructuring. I find it interesting to refer to those particuand lar half dozen causes when I reflect on some of the comments made by the member for Bowman and other speakers and when we refer to and think about the exceptions that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) is attempting to bring into force with the changes to the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill. I am in a fairly unique position as a member of parliament representing a part of the ACT as over many years I have had a very close association with a wide range of people employed in the public sector. I said earlier this week in the adjournment debate on this subject that, when we talk about stress claims and proper recompense for workers compensation, we must not forget the human element. The previous speaker and others have made mention of the fact that workplace conditions are a very real contributing factor to stress related claims in the public sector work force. It is ironic that those opposite can stand here straight-faced and make that reference. I am very aware of the additional stress that is being created right now in the public sector workplace as a result of the dramatic cuts to the public sector work force. I know personally of a number of cases where the breadwinner of the family goes home after a 12to 16-hour day, their having now been put into the position-thank heavens-of retaining employment but doing the work of four, five or six people. To me, the implication of that is fairly straightforward. During the adjournment debate earlier this week, when I brought this up, a couple of members opposite made a point of saying that it does not sound much different from those who work in small business-that they have an equivalent number of hours to work and work under similar stress. But I make this point: the government stands here often claiming to be representative of, caring for and supporters of small business, and I endorse that. But I do not see the same level of concern in relation to those who work in the public sector and find themselves with no control whatsoever, doing everything they can to retain a position of employment having all of this additional stress put upon them, and I am talking of real human cases. You also have the alternative, where public servants-and I know of some of these people as well-who have worked in sections of the public sector that have been sold off, contracted out, to private enterprise are employed by the private sector. I know of one case in particular where the young family man concerned has been fortunate enough-he tells me how lucky he is; in the sell-off, he was paid out a very small amount; he had not been in the public sector for many years-to be re-employed through the new private sector contracting arrangement. But, as a result of that, even though he is very pleased to be in that position, he is now working a 10-, 12or 14-hour five-day week, plus a compulsory full day on the weekend in most cases. So his family life has taken a dramatic tum. He is not complaining, as I said, because he has maintained employment. But we all have to acknowledge the additional stress that has been put upon that person and that family unit as a result of that. A community service in my electorate is now putting regular columns in the local newspaper talking about how families need to address the additional levels of stress, given the economic conditions that apply in the ACT, particularly within the public sector, as a result of the changes this government has wrought. So, while we are examining legislation to change the circumstances under which stress related claims may be paid within the public sector, it would be remiss of us, and I think quite hypocritical of anybody in this place, to remove out of our thought processes these sorts of instances. We cannot have it both ways. The effects of the legislation are really quite simple. It changes from 'material degree' to 'significant degree' the connection required between the workplace and the injury. This means that liability will be denied where the cause of the injury is 'solely or predominantly' because of 'reasonable management or administrative action taken in a reasonable manner by the employer in connection with employment'. The Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith), in his second reading speech, said that the government had considered the basic principles of workers compensation, the current and future position and performance of the Comcare scheme and the interim heads of workers compensation authorities' report. However, there is no general principle of workers compensation that excludes injuries that were otherwise caused by workplace conditions. The second proposal seems to fundamentally conflict with the no-fault notion of workers compensation by introducing reasonableness as a criterion for compensation. Let us look briefly at the present approach to determining liability for stress. It is not sufficient currently to just claim stress. There has to be some proper medically diagnosable condition which is recognised as such by the medical profession. The onus of proof is on employees to establish contribution of a material degree. The second reading speech of the 1988 Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act is very clear on this. It states: It is intended that the test will require an employee to demonstrate that his or her employment was more than a mere contributing factor in the contraction of the disease. Accordingly, it will be necessary for an employee to show that there is a close connection between the disease and the employment in which he or she was engaged. Thirdly, and most importantly, there is a significant hurdle to overcome in establishing contribution. It states: In detennining material contribution of employment the Stress Claims Management Centre will examine the factors precipitating the stress and the various reports on the events in the workplace from parties involved including the claimant and the employing agency. The minister has argued that workers compensation has been awarded to Commonwealth employees for stress related conditions that have arisen as a result of counselling for poor work performance, counselling about failure to get a promotion and other actions taken by management as part of the normal day-today operations of the Australian Public Service. By providing an exclusion from liability in relation to injury or disease which takes place as a result of reasonable management action, the government is undertaking a wide-ranging and serious change in workers compensation entitlements. The effect is to deny compensation entitlements to all workers suffering stress related disease in circumstances other than where the employer has acted negligently or unreasonably. The reasonableness test will have all the shortcomings of common law processes that statutory workers compensation schemes attempted to avoid. Under this test, those workers who do not fully understand the new rules are likely not to be compensated, because the absence of knowledge would tend to show management action was reasonable. Rather than promoting a culture of cure, this test promotes a culture of excuse. In an environment of cost cutting, the provision of an out for liability on the basis of reasonableness will see the focus of management change to justifying an injury as reasonable rather than trying to prevent it. The vague and subjective notions of reasonableness will lead only to an explosion of litigation as employers and employees attempt to define the undefinable. When we think about how we could have a better approach to this whole subject, there are other things we need to keep in mind. There has always been a strong recognition by the industrial parties of the need to address the issues associated with stress. The stress management centre was established in 1985 to provide a holistic approach to incorporate prevention strategies, improved administrative arrangements and more effective rehabilitation into management practice. Over the past 18 months specifically, the SIC Commission has been committed to the development of a prevention program to deal specifically with stress. The program advocates the integration of prevention initiatives in mainstream management practice. This is fundamental to the effective reduction of stress claims which do not show up elsewhere. This holistic approach is the opposite of the piecemeal approach of drawing artificial lines in the sand, as the government's proposals do. I can only reiterate in the most strongest terms the human reality of trying to remain and retain fairness and equity in the workers compensation scheme in relation to stress. doing so, there is absolutely no way that I any of my colleagues, I am sure I am right in saying, endorse in any fashion any rorting this or any other government scheme. But there has to be a bottom line in terms of being able to understand, acknowledge and accept the individuals who work in the public sector. As previous speakers have said in relation to this bill-although they do not usually say it in relation to other bills-they have admiration for those who work in the public sector in their own electorates, therefore I assume also within the ACT, where the majority of them are. I wish to impress on the government as much as I possibly can that they should very carefully consider what they are actually changing here and that they remain cognisant of the fact that, under the current circumment stances, unfortunately we may see, at least within the ACT and I imagine in other places as well, an increase in stress related claims. That will not be because of some artificial measuring, because they have all become rorters or because they need two years off to look after children, as some speakers have suggested. The government placing more stress than we have ever seen on people within the public sector will be because of the current attitude of this government, because of their application of that to the Australian Public Service and because of their absolute mania for cutting numbers. Whilst that remains the case, whilst they have that attitude and that ideological approach, I think that they can fully expect an increase in stress claims at a time when they appear to be hell bent on reducing them, or at least reducing the bottom line dollar cost, without, unfortunately, considering the human cost. I implore the minister and his colleagues to think carefully about what they are creating by going down this path.",46
26,Mr SLIPPER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"At the outset I would want to say that I listened very carefully to the contribution made by the honourable member for Namadgi (Ms Ellis). of I do, however, want to point out to her that this government does not have a mania for cutting numbers. What we have, of course, is In a determination to restore the budget to or surplus. I do not want to go over the wellploughed ground that prior to the last election of we were notified by the Labor Party that the budget was in surplus but the reality was, as we found out on the Monday after the poll, that there was a $10.3 billion deficit. Thus, the government must rein in costs and expenditure. The government appreciates that one is not able to spend more than one earns. Regrettably, as a by-product of that need to cut costs it has been necessary to reduce and numbers in the Commonwealth Public Service. So while we do not have a mania for cutting numbers, as the honourable member for Namadgi would have us believe, we do have a determination to run this country in a very sound manner economically. The Industrial Relations Legislation AmendBill 1996, which is before the chamber today, is partly technical in nature and partly of greater substance. This legislation amends two acts. Some of the amendments are a matter not of controversy and others, as one heard when one listened to the honourable member for Namadgi, clearly are. A number of significant changes are included in the legislation, and amongst these is the amendment to the definition of 'disease' in the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 so that it must be established that employment contributed to a significant degree to an employee's disease. Currently, the test refers to the wider notion of material degree. Secondly, there is an amendment to the definition of 'injury' so that, in general, related stress claims cannot be pursued if they arise predominantly out of reasonable managerial or administrative action undertaken in a reasonable manner even if such action contributed in a significant degree to the disease. Thirdly, there is an amendment transferring responsibility from the commission for the safety, rehabilitation and compensation of Commonwealth employees to Comcare for determining contributions and premiums paid by each department and Commonwealth authority in relation to the workers compensation scheme. It ought to be noted that these reforms were brought forward in response to the budgetary situation inherited by the government when it attained office in March last year. The government was concerned by some very interesting statistics-statistics which indicated that up to one in three federal public servants are taking stress related leave amid warnings that the cost of stress claims is jeopardising the government's $1.4 billion workers compensation system. I am indebted to the Courier-Mail for that information. Consequently, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) has found it necessary to introduce this legislation in response to stress related claims rising in cost by more than 54 per cent, to $37 million, during the three years to 1994-95. Despite the speeches made by those opposite, I suspect that, had the election result been different in March last year, we would have seen the Labor Party bring in amendments similar to those currently before the chamber. The changes will also make sure that we as a Commonwealth payout claims only where there is a very real connection between the stress and the injury. I would be surprised if very many people would differ with the principle that there ought to be a very strong connection. Some of the cases which we have heard about where people have been successful in claiming against the Commonwealth I believe are totally unacceptable. It ought to be recognised that the amendments proposed in part 1 of schedule 2 to the bill, to clarify the circumstances in which Commonwealth employees are entitled to work receive compensation pursuant to the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act will achieve a number of things. They will restore the original intent of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act, which has been distorted by decisions of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Federal Court, and in doing so place direct responsibility on Commonwealth employers to manage occupational stress strategically and in a manner consistent with other public sector jurisdictions in Australia, noting that the reputation of the Australian Public Service has been damaged by a public perception that compensation for stress is too readily available. The amendments will also ensure the continued financial viability of the scheme by ensuring that it is not jeopardised by the payment of compensation for diseases which have little or no connection with employment or stress which arises solely from reasonable managerial or administrative action and reduce litigiousness in dealing with claims by Commonwealth public servants. It really ought to be recognised that there has been an enormous increase in the number of stress claims, with a great boost in cost to the Australian taxpayer. It also ought to be recognised that people have been able to claim for income support in circumstances where most people would see that that claim ought not be made. I have heard of instances where an employee was involved in an affair at work. When the affair ended, she found that she was unable to remain in the workplace and lodged a claim for stress. The cost to the Commonwealth to date is $80,000. In another case an employee was requested to attend a counselling session to discuss his work performance. Surely that is a very reasonable action by a manager within the Commonwealth Public Service. But this employee found that coming counselling session to be stressful. He went on sick leave, lodged a compensation claim for stress and this employee, would you believe it, has been absent from work since mid-1995. In another case an employee claimed a work-related stress condition due to disputes with his employer. The disputes related to the payment of higher duties and the fact that his agency refused to provide him with a permanent position. Obviously, he would be miffed over the fact that he could not get extra money and he was not promoted. A lot of people in politics might well be miffed over the fact that their talent has not always been recognised, but I do not think anyone believes that politicians should take stress leave. This Commonwealth public servant certainly did exactly that. The cost to the Commonwealth to date has been over $192,000. That really sets out very clearly the rationale for the substantive amendments currently before the chamber. Again, we find that the Labor Party is being hypocritical now that they are out of government. They have lost what little attitude towards financial responsibility they might have had. They feel able to come in here and say exactly the opposite of what they would have said had they been successful at the election in March last year. The honourable member for Namadgi obviously feels very strongly over the impact that the government's economic reforms have had on the Australian Capital Territory and on the area that she represents. Unfortunately, it is interesting that her views are not reflected in the views expressed by the Canberra Times. The honourable member for Namadgi suggests that the government ought not be taking the course of action that it is taking in this legislation. It would perhaps clarify the matter for those listening to indicate what the Canberra Times felt when it wrote an article on the complex environment surrounding workers compensation. The article pointed out the grave situation confronting Australia with respect to workers compensation. It points out the situation confronting the government and it points out that Comcare has a rather complicated duty. It includes evidence why the Commonwealth has had to take action through this particular bill. However, in an editorial dated Friday, 13 December 1996 the Canberra Times did come forward and support very strongly what the government was doing. In an editorial headed 'Government right to act on stress', the Canberra Times broadly endorsed the approach of the government: There seems little question that the Australian Public Service has been a stressful place in which to work since the Howard Government began implementing its changes and efficiencies in about April and May this year. Many jobs have gone and many remain in question. It highlights the fact that there is stress in relation to the economic changes which this government has found it necessary to make because of the economic circumstances we inherited upon attaining government. The editorial goes on to say: The Government is, indeed, changing the rules related to stress-related workers' compensation. It is not denying public servants access to such arrangements but it is placing a greater onus on Commonwealth employees to prove that their affliction was genuinely caused by problems in the workplace. I do not know what person who considers himself or herself to be a reasonable citizen could possibly differ from the determination of the government to place a greater onus on Commonwealth employees to prove that their affliction was genuinely caused by problems in the workplace. Going on, the editorial says: The Government felt itself compelled to act on the issue because Commonwealth employees had had to do no more than claim their work had contributed to their stress to be capable of mounting a successful claim. The problem with stress in the workplace is that it has become a catch-all complaint. If someone is experiencing problems at home, is not coping with their job, or is part of a turbulent emotional relationship. they can claim to be feeling ""stressed"". In circumstances in which those people have claimed workers' compensation it has been difficult for the Commonwealth to prove work had not also been a contributing factor. So the Canberra Times could well have written the minister's approach in this matter. The minister has argued forcefully the reasons that change is necessary. In the parliament, the honourable member for Namadgi condemns the government for what we are doing; yet we find that an editorial of her own local newspaper on Friday, 13 December 1996 is coming out and supporting the approach of the government.",49
27,Mr KERR,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,Less passion!,52
28,Mr SLIPPER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The shadow minister really ought to display more passion for the economic situation inherited by this government. He should be supporting what this government is doing because I believe that, had the Labor Party been returned in March last year, the former minister and his government could well have introduced this bill. These words sum up the editorial in the Canberra Times: In these circumstances the Government should not be unduly criticised for seeking to minimise exposure. So the Canberra Times-the home-town newspaper of the Australian Capital Territory where most of the cuts have taken place-is coming out and saying that in these circumstances it is entirely right, it is entirely proper and it is entirely appropriate that this bill is being brought into rein in the situation where people have simply been able to put their hand up and claim stress and then been able to take that stress leave at enormous cost to the Australian taxpayer. Again, I think the Labor Party will stand condemned. Now that they are out of office they have absolutely no sense of economic responsibility. In office, they showed precious little sense of economic responsibility. But they feel-now that they are so far away from government-that they can come into this parliament and say anything.",52
29,Mr KERR,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,Not so far.,52
30,Mr SLIPPER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"You are a long way away, my friend, from government. In fact, I suspect that you personally will never see government again during your political career. At the end of the day, while this government did not create the problem that we have to solve, we do not for one moment shirk our responsibility to fix it. We do not apologise for it because we believe that this bill is fair, it is equitable, and it is restoring the situation to what was the intention of the legislation. I would like to compliment the government on this bill. I believe that this bill has very widespread community support. I would urge the Labor Party to shred its cheapjack opportunism in this matter and to support the bill because this bill is fair, equitable, reasonable, sensible and much overdue.",52
31,Mr LAURIE FERGUSON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"As other contributors to this debate have indicated, the essential changes within the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill 1997 are as follows: an amendment to the definition of 'disease' so that there should be a 'significant degree' of contribution by the employee as opposed to a 'material degree'; an amendment to the definition of 'injury' so that, in general, work related stress its claims cannot be pursued if they arise predominantly out of reasonable managerial or administrative action; and the transfer of responsibility from the Commission for the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation of Commonwealth Employees to Comcare. The thrust of my contribution would be to say, in a similar manner to which the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) of this country has often commented about Sir Winston Churchill on comments that he might have made about racial matters decades ago, that everything should be seen in its context. Equally, this parliament was treated to debates between the previous member for Wills and the member for Werriwa (Mr Latham) about Frank Anstey, a former member of this House, and comments he had made about the Jewish population. The point I am trying to make is that everything should be seen in a wider context. The claim by this government that this is essentially about getting rid of a few shonks-I should not say 'a few'; the thrust of a few comments from those opposite today has been that we have a massive avalanche of problems in this area-has to be seen in a wider context. The government seem to be making the same allegation in the veterans' affairs area. They say here today that these changes are not about budgetary considerations; they have been brought about because of all the problems that have been detected. Yet we find simultaneously-in a totally different circumstance to that of Vietnam veterans-a similar attack upon people's rights. It is interesting to note that, in the last budget, the government has attempted to alter the guidelines and the rules on post-traumatic stress syndrome. This would not seem to be a genuine analysis of a problem and an attempt to tackle it; it would seem to be part of a wider agenda-an agenda which, when they first came into government, saw massive cuts to occupational health and safety; an agenda which sees them in a parallel department, the Department of Veterans' Affairs, not only severely cutting down on employment by 610 people out of 3,400 but also looking at cuts-if their statements are correct in estimates of 12 June-of 30 per cent over three years. In a broader context of what this government is doing we are seeing, firstly, attacks in a totally different area in regard to people's rights relating to injuries, and I am talking about veterans who have fought for this country; secondly, in a very big fashion, cuts to the Public Service work force, which understandably will have a tremendous impact on the stress people face in the work force; thirdly, a very swift and direct attack on the basic support structure of occupational health and safety; and, finally, on a broader scale and broader front, changes in the Australian work force which will substantially increase stress and injuries. The government is basically trying to undermine people's rights in the employment place and to erode the unions' say in the industrial relations process. One government member, the member for Bowman (Mrs West) from recollection, dared to get to a core problem. Many of these claims are a form of revolt against the problems in the workplace. People have substantially lost the use of the union movement to fight their cases, and their only form of revolt, their only form of resistance, of getting a point across to management, is by these kinds of reactions. I will briefly talk about a number of these parallel processes. In regard to Vietnam veterans, we have seen the government go around and start telling those organisationsnot just Vietnam veterans but other veteran groups as well; but they are the most prevalent because of their particular war circumstance-that there is going to be a five per cent cut in the people that receive pensions because of their injuries. Quite clearly, they are already detailing a percentage outcome, a monetary gain for this government and what they are essentially about. That is despite the fact that, over a period, the agent orange inquiry and a variety of other government instigated inquiries, not veteran instigated inquiries, have said that the level of posttraumatic stress syndrome that we are getting is about what you would expect. Despite the fact that all these government reports have said that this is what you are going to get, the government are now saying it is too high. As I say, we have seen an avalanche of personalised claims made by ministers opposite. The Herald-Sun of 23 June has an article headed '$80,000 for love tangle'. This is, of course, the instigated leaking process by this government to essentially identify a few people. Those people are going to be known where they work, they are going to be known by their families and they are going to be known by the people they live with. There has been no proper detailing of the more specific details of their circumstance, just broad generalities about their case. This is not peculiar to the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith). We have had the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop) in regard to the Black Hawk incident itemising one person's individual compensation situation-a very great abandonment of tradition. We have had a minimal number of, let us say, more scandalous-sounding instances of abuse in the system. From those few itemised cases-which are unexplained, undetailed and non-specific-we jump, as we have seen in many of the contributions today, to an allegation that it is widespread, that it is all over the place and that it is a massive problem. The member for Bowman, the member for Capricornia (Mr Marek) and a number of other speakers opposite have itemised statistics: the cost of stress claims compared with others and the average duration of claims, et cetera, without precise analysis of the reasons and the changes that are occurring in the Australian workplace. Very soon after the last election, we had a very thorough attack by this government on occupational health and safety matters in the country. It is interesting to note these leading questions asked of the minister in the journal called Australian Safety News: What is your position on the introduction of tougher penalties for industry in breach of tional health and safety laws and regulations? Do you think tougher fines would equal fewer workplace deaths and injuries? To paraphrase, his comment was not that there would be any great activity on this front and any great rushing of legislation into parliament to do something about penalties for employers and actually tackling the problem; his actual comment was: The Federal Government will give consideration to these issues in determining its response to the Industry Commission report. So that refusal to get on the ball game and do anything about the number of deaths in this country relating to OH&S issues-which from recollection are about 600 a year-has not been accompanied by any attempt to do anything about the broader question of policing the industry. Members of the Liberal and National parties come in here today and say their essential thrust is not about decreasing costs and not about essentially undermining workers compensation, they say that their thrust is supposedly about the fraud and the tricksters in the field. But let us look at their track record, let us look at their credentials and let us look at their honesty and their sincerity in this matter. Very soon after coming into government, one of their first actions-they were in the door for five minutes, and if they had a priority they certainly showed it on this onewas to seek to undermine progress in regard to uniform national standards and the collection of national occupational health and safety statistics. They did this despite the fact that an estimated 650,000 workers suffer from diseases and injuries in this country and an estimated 2,700 workers die each year from workrelated causes-500 of them in accidents and 2,200 from diseases. As I say, that was their great consideration five minutes after coming into government. Months later, they have done nothing to police the industry nor to do anything about penalties. Conservative estimates from a variety of sources, which are not necessarily from our side of politics, are that the cost of occupational health and safety problems in this country-the cost of a failure to police, occupa- a failure to have national standards and a failure to have proper statistics-is estimated to be about $20 billion without taking into consideration pain and suffering. It is also estimated that only a 10 per cent reduction in injuries would lead to an improvement in our gross domestic product of $340 million a year. It is interesting to note that the expenditure on trying to avoid this problem is some $2,000 per dead worker a year; that is, for each worker who dies in this country, we spend only $2,300 in trying to avoid that death occurring. It is also interesting to note what Fran Cavanagh said in the Bulletin of 3 September last year after she launched a group called Advocates for Workplace Safety. I had the pleasure of meeting her and discussing some of these issues with her last year. Her activity stemmed from her daughter's death at Sydney University when structural problems on a work activity led to her daughter, an innocent bystander, being killed. In the Bulletin she has also detailed the estimate that there are 84 deaths for every million workers in this country, compared with a US rate, believe it or not, of only 37 deaths per million workers, 24 in the UK and 22 in Sweden. So there is something fundamentally wrong in regard to occupational health and safety in this country and the lack of effort going into it. Very soon after coming into government, there was a very strong determination by this government to put into operation the commitment given by Peter Costello on 15 February 1996 in a document entitled Meeting our commitments. He noted: Outlays to NOHSC will be reduced by $5.9 million. Savings will be achieved from across the board reductions in corporate services, industry development, national uniformity standards and national co-ordination. Efficiencies were identified in a very critical report by the Industry Commission into Occupational Health and Safety. In a very selective list of quotations, Mr Costello said it found that more can be done to reduce the scope of administrative overlap by: '. clarifying and streamlining agency responsibilitIes; . combining service, research and advisory functions; and . rationalising legislation to simplify administration and compliance. Of course, that was a cover for the essential point which was a reduction by $6 million in the effort by the government, taxpayers and the people of this country to reduce the cost of our gross domestic product and productivity and, more particularly, in regard to the personal circumstances of the individuals who are affected and who die. That commitment by Mr Costello was one of the more prompt and efficient gestures in the first weeks of government. They had many things to accomplish after being out of office for 13 years, but they were not letting any grass grow under their feet when it came to slashing back occupational health and protection. Mr Costello said: Part of the $5.9 million in savings will be achieved by scaling back training grants which in 1995-96 amounted to $1.5 million. That was the thrust of this incoming govern-ent. For all of the attempts by those opposIte to decry and attack the performance of this side of politics on this matter, it is interesting to note the contrasting reality in New South Wales on the part of that government. The New South Wales industrial relations minister Mr Jeff Shaw, appeared in court earlier i1996 to argue for the nation's highest safety fine when Thiess Constructions was fined $175,000 over the deaths in 1991 and 1992 of two workers during the upgrade of the Burrinjuck Dam at Yass. Thiess had a record nine breaches on the site between July 1992 and April 1994, each incurring a $500 on the spot fine. . We do know of course that the government m New South Wales-in contrast to the regime here-has not attempted to go backwards .and. give industry free rein to stop collectmg mdustry specific statistics, which anyone with half a brain would realise have some value in this country. They have not been going in that direction. In contrast witl the federal government, in 1991 in Victoria and under Carr in New South Wales, the penalties for offences under the act have been increased. In New South Wales under the occupational health and safety provisions the fine has increased from $250,000 to $500,000 and the courts have been given the discretion to gaol negligent employers. I am inclined to disagree with the rhetoric that says that this is essentially about trying to get rid of the extreme cases that we have heard about. No-one disputes that there are people who are photographed-as one of the gov-rnment speakers said-playing golf, - nnmg around a football ground or gardening m the front yard. There is no doubt that happens. But to try to lift the requirement in order possibly to undermine the ability of a far broader range of workers to lay claims is not justified by the citation-as has occurred over the last few weeks-of a few individual cases that obviously, to the mass of Australians, sound very extreme. . T-at is the context in which they try to JustIfy these kinds of provisions. One of the members opposite said that the world is getting faster, stress is part of life and that is, - eally, - ust .bad luck. That would be all very mterestmg If there were not the very material contribution of the stress of the on-site, dayto-day working circumstances-and the stress outside of work-that is taken into the home. - s -.e have said, there has been a very slgmflcant change in the workplace in this country and in people's attitudes to their experiences at work. I will refer to a survey. Lo and behold, even in the period of the Labor government, in 1995, there was a survey of enterprise bargaining in Australia which covered a broad spectrum of workers. They were not trade union delegates from around the country: this was just an independent survey of people in the workplace in this country. It indicated that, in the case of 58 per cent of them, there had been a noticeable increase in effort in the workplace over the previous 12 months; only 36 per cent thought there had been no change. In regard to stress, 50 per cent of them estimated a noticeable increase in stress in their workplace. The pace of doing work had risen in the case of 46 per cent of them. There had been a similar intensification across all workplace types and it was said in that survey that there was a correlation between a high score on the index of work intensification and an employee reporting a decline in satisfaction wirh the balance between work and family life. There is no excuse for saying that many of those stress situations are independent, autonomous and not connected with work. are seeing in this country essential changes work practices, many of which are going the direction of causing increased occupationfully al health and safety problems, increased stress problems and increased difficulty in deciding what should be catered for by the workers compensation system. This change simultalink neously increases pressure on people, ensures that there is going to be more stress in the tion. workplace and erodes people's rights to compensation and it is indeed a national disgrace. I am aware that this bill deals, essentially, with the Public Service. Of course, what happening there is paralleled in different throughout industry in this country. We have a monumental change in the work is, the requirement that far fewer people in the Australian Public Service do the jobs were previously done by many. There are occupational constant claims by the government that it will reshuffle, alter people's industrial relations rights and put the clamps on the Public Service in this country, push them around and pull them into line. There are constant ges. There are threats of privatisation and outsourcing. People are trying to say that of this will not contribute to stress and that will have no effect. That is absolutely ridiculous. In the wider society there are developments such as the use of private contractors, people going on to sites which they are unaware of and people not knowing the equipment or the work practices on the site. All of these things are contributing to workers compensation problems.",52
32,Mr VAILE,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL,"The Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill contains amendments announced in the 1996 budget to clarify the circumstances in which compensation is payable through the Commonwealth workers compensation scheme. I would presume that it really is relevant to Commonwealth workers, rather than to the broader work force right across Australia. I will confine my comments to that area. The bill amends two acts, the Occupational We Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employin ment) Act 1991 and the Safety, Rehabilitation in and Compensation Act 1988. The government supports access to workers compensation where there is a genuine work related injury or disease. However, the intent of this bill is simply to ensure that there is a significant between work and the injury or disease before there is an entitlement to compensaI do not think that any Australian would argue with that. That is a reasonable concept. It is the concept of workers compensation that probably the majority of workers across Australia have; that an injury sustained at is work is compensable and injuries sustained ways not in a work related area should not be compensable by the employer or their comforce, that pensation company. As far as this legislation is concerned, the that government has a three-pronged strategy on stress in particular. First of all, prevention. Through various projects run by Comcare in conjunction with Commonwealth agencies, the government wants to actively promote better control or prevention of stress chanin the Public Service. Secondly, improved claims management and the establishment of all a separate stress claims management centre it have achieved positive results so far. That is an area that the government wants to pursue. Thirdly, there is the appropriate legislative framework, which is what we are debating today. The purpose of these amendments is to fix Labor's legislation. The legislation currently defines 'disease' as an ailment to which a person's employment contributed in a material degree. That is the point of discussion: 'material degree'. The onus is on the claimant to demonstrate that the employment was more than just a mere contributing factor to their disease. However, courts have ruled that the word 'material' does not require employment to be a significant contributing factor. There are any number of examples and I am not going to rattle off all of them. I have a couple that would be worthwhile relating to the House. For example, an employee claimed that work related stress aggravated a preexisting knee injury. He underwent rehabilitation and was given modified duties. These duties required him to travel so he claimed the cost of adding a side car to his motorbike to make it easier to ride. The cost to date over $166,000. A second example is of an employee who claimed for stress as the result of what she perceived to be an inappropriate comment made in the workplace. The comment was made to the whole work group, but the individual said she found it personally offensive. Strangely enough, she lodged her claim only when she was interviewed in relation to poor performance. The cost of this claim is approximately $190,000. Nobody would undermine the fact that there are very genuine claims in the workplace and very genuine stress related claims in the workplace. Anybody who views this legislation in a reasonable manner would realise that it will accommodate that. I go back to the simple ethic, that the work force in Australia perceive that, if an injury is sustained in workplace, it should be compensable. If it is not, it should not be compensable and the employer should not be liable for compensation as far as an injury that is sustained outside of the workplace is concerned. The opposition know full well that the scheme they set up when they were in government was never meant to compensate people for injuries which are not work related. Yet the ALP are prepared to allow the scheme to continue to blowout at taxpayers' expense, rather than get offside with their union mates . As to compensation costs, in a joint submission to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, the Department of Industrial Relations and Comcare stated that the Commonwealth's liabilities as at 30 June 1996 totalled $1.23 billion. That is an enormous amount of money in the current economic climate. That is a liability for the taxpayers of Australia. Despite a decrease in the number of claims, an increase in both the complexity and duration of claims is leading to higher program costs. Occupational stress claims are generally high cost claims. Current figures in relation to stress claims are very interesting. Occupational stress claims are generally high cost claims. While the number of accepted claims is dropping, the costs associated with these claims remain high. The annual cost of stress claims has risen from $24 million in 1991-92 is to an estimated $35.7 million for the 1996-97 financial year. To date in 1996-97 stress claims represent five per cent of the accepted claims, but account for 18 per cent of the costs. The average cost of a stress claim is $32,000-odd compared with $7,700 for other claims. In other words, stress claims cost the taxpayer more than four times as much as other types of claims. This comes back to the point I made earlier about the way the courts have ruled on the interpretation of the 'material' factor. Courts have ruled that the word 'material' does not require employment to be a significant contributing factor. We have to address the situation as far as stress claims are concerned. Stress claims are also of longer duration. After 12 months, 15 per cent of those with the stress claims are still off work, compared to four per cent of employees with other claims. I have had first hand experience with a couple of constituents in my electorate in this exact circumstance. It is an area that the government is very keen to address. We welcome the signs that stress claim rates are falling, but we do not know how sustainable this downward trend is without these amendments. We do not want to risk a blow-out in liability to the Commonwealth and the taxpayer by continuing to pay compensation in circumstances it was not intended for. It is an entirely reasonable argument to put that compensation claims should be directly related to an accident that has taken place in the workplace and not in a related area. That is a reasonable concept and that is all the government is arguing for. This amending legislation has a threepronged strategy for dealing with occupational stress. The first one is prevention, the second is improved claims management and the third is the appropriate legislative framework which we are debating today. The workers compensation scheme was never intended to be used as a grievance system. Lodging a claim is not a remedy if a person is aggrieved about a reasonable management action or not getting along with a colleague. The bulk of evidence presented to the committee related to proposed changes to the legal testing linking injury or disease with employment. These proposed changes to the definition of 'disease' are designed to strengthen the connection between work and compensatable injury. Debate (on motion by Mr Dargavel) adjourned NA Minister for Smali Business and Consumer Affairs  Small Business and Consumer Affairs) (1.31 p.m.)-by leave-During the past two weeks there have been numerous questions raised regarding the code of ministerial conduct, ministers' obligations under the code and my compliance with it. I have at all times endeavoured to provide you and the parliament with a precise and accurate account in answer to allegations raised that I have not complied with the code. The purpose of this statement is to set out in some detail my corporate, business and personal arrangements and my involvement with them. In particular, it is my intention to address the following requirements of the ministerial code: Ministers. . . must not engage in any professional practice or in the daily work of any business. Ministers are required to resign directorships in public companies and may retain directorships in private companies only if any such company operates, for example, a family farm, business or portfolio of investments and if retention of the directorship is not likely to conflict with the minister's public duty ... Ministers are required to divest themselves of all shares and similar interests in any company or business involved in the area of their portfolio responsibilities ... Ministers are required to make statements of interests in accordance with arrangements determined by the Prime Minister. Corporate structure I am currently a director and shareholder in the following companies: Prosser Automotive Engineers Pty Ltd, Prosser Management Pty Ltd, Hornell Nominees Pty Ltd; Regional Property Investments Pty Ltd, and Prosser Homes Pty Ltd, shareholder only. My business structure is made up of a number of companies and private interests. My brother is involved jointly with me in Prosser Automotive Engineers Pty Ltd, Prosser Management Pty Ltd and Hornell Nominees Pty Ltd. I hold a share in trust for my brother in Prosser Homes Pty Ltd and, likewise, he holds a share in trust for me in my company Regional Property Investments Pty Ltd. Regional Property Investments was previously known as Prosser Engineering Pty Ltd, the business that was my steel fabrication and construction business. The operating part of that business was sold in October 1993 when I made the decision to sell because it was apparent that it would be very difficult to run a construction business without my personal involvement. My brother owns his own building and joinery business, which he operates as R&M Prosser and Son. I own a number of properties in my own name in Bunbury, including three residential properties and a number of commercial and light industrial rental units. Operations of the firm The operating business now comprise Prosser Automotive Engineers Pty Ltd, involved in engine reconditioning and fuel retailing and property ownership and investment. It is Prosser Automotive Engineers that owns the substantial bulk of the group's property holdings. The company owns, among other sites, the Eaton lot, the Bunbury Homemaker Centre, the Minninup Forum shopping centre, a small neighbourhood style shopping centre, and Leschenault Quays. Since the early 1990s Mr Wood has been the manager of all of the above companies and also handles my personal affairs. I am a director of the above companies. The other director is my brother, Steven Prosser. Mr Wood, together with my brother, handles the daily affairs of all of the above companies. In addition, Mr Wood handles my personal affairs. My brother and Colin Wood have told me that a lot of general correspondence to the company is still, in fact, addressed to me personally, even though the matters are specifically dealt with by my brother and Mr Wood and I have no involvement at all. I have previously asked Mr Wood to have these addresses corrected. My involvement The company holds quarterly board meetings of the group, attended by Mr Wood, my brother, myself, and the company secretary, Mr Eastman. I would generally meet with my brother around once each fortnight when I am home on a Saturday morning at his company's joinery workshop, a business in which I have no involvement. These Saturday morning visits are normally in the company of my children because he often has his children with him, and we will discuss events of a general nature occurring in the previous fortnight. My brother occasionally calls at my home with his family. I would speak with my manager Colin Wood either by telephone or in person once weekly, not on a daily basis. The reason for the degree of frequency is that he also handles my personal affairs, including matters such as car and house insurance and other personal payment matters. The daily decisions of the group, including the daily decisions of my private holdings, are made by Mr Wood and my brother. In the town that I live in, being the City of Bunbury, there is no doubt that I have a very high profile. I have lived in the town all of my life, have run businesses in the town since a very young age, spent six years on the Bunbury City Council, stood for mayor in 1985 in a very high profile, hard fought mayoral campaign and now as the federal member. Both sides of my family were long term residents in Bunbury. In any political, community or social function within the greater Bunbury area business and local politics are discussed to a far greater degree than politics in general. Indeed, it would be fair to say that politics does not really rate highly in the area in which I live so naturally, at any function I attend, business and local political matters on a range of subjects are discussed. In the period since I became minister I have had a number of discussions at different times with councillors of the Bunbury City Council. These cover the full range of local government activities and occur primarily in my capacity as the federal member for Forrest. Specific meetings or contacts that I can recall since becoming minister are: in February or March of 1997 I contacted John MCCourt, a Bunbury city councillor. Mr MCCourt was a high profile Bunbury city councillor, generally thought to have Labor Party leanings. I called Mr MCCourt about the proposed council roadworks in the street in which I live which the council had been planning for a number of years. I asked him what progress council was making, expressing a concern that if council were expecting to commence the works in winter, given the high water table in the area, there was the potential to tum the street into a quagmire. Mr MCCourt said he would look into the matter and get back to me. My recollection is that I did raise with him the coming mayoral campaign. I asked Mr MCCourt in passing what sort of reaction there would be to any proposal to put a bulk goods, no frills style supermarket on the Homemaker Centre site. As I recall, he indicated that the company should put up a proposal and test the council's reaction. The company subsequently did submit a proposal to the council and the proposal was rejected by the council. I have had contacts with a number of Bunbury city councillors since becoming a minister. The councillors include Councillors Nicholson, Eglington, Jeffrey, Comito and on one occasion, at a social function, Councillor Major. I have on different occasions discussed with some of these councillors council's proposed drainage works behind a property in Denning Road that lawn in my own name. I have also at different times had discussions with councillors mentioned above in regard to potential parking and traffic problems relating to the proposed shopping centre development in the central business district. Two of the councillors, I recall, rang me asking what the scheme, planning scheme No. 6, parking requirements are in the central business district of Bunbury. It is widely known that I have a strong knowledge and understanding of the City of Bunbury town plan No.6. Indeed, the scheme was introduced when I was a city councillor and it should be noted that I spent my entire time on council on the planning committee. I am often asked my view in regard to planning matters. During the period I have been the federal member for Forrest, I have had business people seek my views on their own personal planning matters and at times seek a view as to what I think a particular property that they or their clients are interested in may be worth. On a wide range of issues that affect my constituents and may affect me personally and/or my companies in general I may have made representations to state and federal ministers on behalf of constituents. In my view, all of these contacts are consistent with me fulfilling my duties as a local member and do not in any way conflict with the guidelines for ministerial conduct. My other occasional contact with business people includes dealings with a local structural engineer relating to design matters, specifically the design of a small dam for a small farming property that I have recently acquired for my family on the outskirts of Bunbury, and discussions with a bulldozing contractor about putting that dam in. While a minister, I have made no formal presentations or submissions to the Dardanup Shire Council. The only planning approval applied for by the group was for the Eaton development and that was approved on 6 February 1996, prior to my becoming a minister. The only council staff or executives that I have met with since becoming a minister involved the odd call from the shire president, Councillor Bennett. I can recall Councillor Bennett called me two or three times over the last 14 months. In addition, I was present when Mr Wood, my brother, Councillor Bennett and Shire Clerk Sprague viewed the Eaton development proposal drawings in the architect's office- Mr Nicholson. This, I recall, was on a Saturday morning in late November or December 1996. At any time that I was contacted by Councillor Bennett I advised him that he should write to my brother on any matter raised. Since March last year there may have been an occasional telephone call from the then Shire Clerk, Mr Sprague. To my recollection I was introduced to Mr Chester, the new shire clerk for Dardanup, by Councillor Robert Nicholson in his office. This was not a formal meeting; however, the development proposal at Eaton, previously approved by his council in February 1996, was mentioned, but not in any great detail. Also mentioned at this meeting was council's desire to swap a portion of land belonging to the company, to which I responded that he should write to my brother in regard to this matter. I have received a deputation from the Harvey Shire Council. This deputation met in my electorate office and did not inform me prior to their meeting the purpose of the meeting. I learned at the meeting that the deputation was seeking company donations for a swimming pool project. I pointed out that at the time the company group had previously made a donation towards the Bunbury Entertainment Centre and that from the company's point of view the focus was in Bunbury, not Harvey. I told them they should submit a formal presentation to Mr Wood or Steve Prosser. In regard to business matters, I have not had any meeting with the current state minister for planning or any person from his department since becoming minister. I had one discussion with the previous planning minister, the Hon. Richard Lewis, at a social function in Busselton. I did not instigate the discussion. The then minister Lewis asked me if I was involved in a zoning presentation that he had received from my brother and other business colleagues, to which I replied: 'Yes.' There was no further discussion on this point. I have already advised the House in relation to the call I made to Mr Nick Greiner of Coles Myer Ltd. I again confirm that I had one discussion with Mr Greiner concerning the Eaton lot. In that call I requested a contact point for my brother relating to a proposed Target store. Mr Greiner advised me that I should get my brother to write to him. Mr Greiner and I did not discuss any detail nor any other matter, including car parking arrangements. I also confirm that I have had no further contact with Mr Greiner and there are no commercial arrangements between Coles Myer and any company with which I am associated. I specifically do recall that a local real estate agent, Mr Terry Coote, made an appointment to see me within the last two months. I was unaware of the reason for this appointment. Mr Coote offered for sale a property across the road to the company's Homemaker site. Mr Coote advised that the property carried the same zoning as the company's Homemaker site. I said to him that, as far as I was aware from the information distributed to every householder by the council area, the zoning under the council's new scheme would not be consistent with the company's Homemaker si te and that, in any event, the company would probably not be interested in purchasing the land. In regard to other contacts, I can recall in 1996 that I met on one or possibly two occasions with the planners who were drawing up a planning concept for the Eaton development and with planners with regard to land I own in my own name in King Road and I viewed the presentation they were making. In 1997, I held a discussion with planners Thompson MCRobert and Associates in regard to a planning proposal for a bulk goods, no frills style supermarket on vacant land on the Homemaker site. This was some time after I had spoken to Councillor John MCCourt. On two occasions, in company with Mr D. Van Noort, the civil engineer employed by the group for the Eaton development, I inspected the site works at the Eaton development. The first was some time in February 1997. The second was on a Saturday morning in March 1997 when he picked me up from my home to take me out. In setting out the detail that I have, I am convinced that I have not, in any way, engaged in the daily work of the family business. The outline of my corporate structure clearly shows that I am not involved in the daily work of the family business. Clearly, these investments and business interests are family business interests. None of these family businesses have ever conflicted or are likely to conflict with my public duty. I categorically reject any allegation that, at any time, I have used my ministerial position for personal gain and, clearly, there is not one shred of evidence to support such an allegation. I clearly do not have control of the daily activities of my companies and reject any attempt to distort or categorise any of the instances as constituting being involved in the daily work of the company. As a company director of my family companies, I do have a duty to have an overall view of the companies' activities and I do attend quarterly board meetings to fulfil those duties and obligations. The performance of that duty does not conflict with any element of the ministerial guidelines. I believe that the business arrangements that I had in place prior to becoming a minister and since becoming a minister are within the letter and the spirit of the ministerial guidelines.",56
33,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Mr Speaker, I would ask that the statement be tabled.",61
34,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,Has the minister been reading from documents? ,61
35,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"The document has been tabled. I call the Leader of the Opposition, on indulgence.",61
36,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"With your indulgence, Mr Speaker, I would like to speak on this matter. What we have heard here is a confession-and we lost count-of, I would say, at least 20 or 30 major points of business contact involving the detailed interests of his companies. I cannot see why the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) cannot be aware of this, because I presume he went back over things. Contrast what we have just heard about these weekly discussions-the defence of himself on daily work is that it is weekly work-and regular visits; contrast these discussions with planning authorities and persons engaged in planning authorities related to his work, the only defence of which, apparently, is that one or two of them involve mystery tours. Contrast that with the statement by one of the minister's colleagues, who now handles a substantial proportion of his ministerial affairs, the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) when he was asked by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to explain himself in relation to his business contacts and to disconnect himself from them. He tabled this in relation to Ralsten. This is what Mr Wilde-the equivalent, in the Ralsten outfit, of Mr Wood, who owns about the same proportion of Ralsten that you own of the companies which you have been talking about, Minister-had to say to the Prime Minister to establish the appropriate relationship between himself and the affairs of Ralsten. He said: I also confirm our agreement that I will not disclose or discuss with you the affairs or activities of the company during the period mentioned above, That is, the period of time that Mr Moore actually happens to be a minister. Compare and contrast your discussions about your business interests in day-today contact with councillors; your defence of yourself that you will go to the sites and inspect them; your involvement with different councillors-an involvement that you have brought to light only because you have had to sift through the newspapers, and sift your way through the legion of councillors who have marched in and said that they had been discussing your business affairs with you. It is no small wonder that most people correspond with you. You are obviously in day-today control of your affairs. Minister, you have already, unfortunately, had a statement made by your ministerial colleagues about the appropriate relationship. We know what the Prime Minister's old definition of the 'daily work of the company' meant. We know it from Mr Wilde. We know it from Mr Wilde when he says about Mr Moore, who now handles half your small business portfolio, very belatedly: I also confirm our agreement that I will not disclose or discuss with you the affairs or activities of the company during the period mentioned above, What you have just written out is a political suicide note. It is only because of the moral decrepitude and incompetence of your front-bench, and the fact that you clearly operate on a 24-hour memory in the government, that you are not remembering standards that we had in place which would have seen you out the door, as our ministers went when they were obliged to. You have your own standards now which you are supposed to conform to and those standards, in so far as you can interpret anything, had to have been set, at a minimum, by the last time your government's ministers got into serious trouble on this. You will have the opportunity to talk this through in question time, this sitting down every week with your brother to discuss the affairs of your company-which include a plethora of planning arrangements associated with Bunbury City Council-a series of affairs which include, of course, because you are in business, competition with your competitors. The reason you do not have a position with Coles Myer now is not due to your efforts in putting your brother in contact with Coles Myer at the highest level; nor is it due to your efforts in getting the city council to approve these things via your contacts with Councillor Nicholson and others. It is not due to those things. It is merely due to the fact that the council rejected your appeals and depredations except in one instance-which the council is now calling for investigations about-and that was your effort to use this process to disadvantage one of your competitors who was obliged to take it upon themselves, when they found themselves battling not only City Hall but the Australian government as well, to make alterations in their parking arrangements. That is not what you, Councillor Nicholson, or any of the other people who backed you, wanted. Nevertheless, that is what occurred; hence you do not have any ongoing arrangements with Coles Myer. That was nothing to do with your best efforts in that regard. You go from that point to talk about your range of social contacts. I think I detected throughout those particular discussions on-site inspections involving planning authorities related to your business interests. You have to be the ultimate weasel worder to take from the answers that you gave us that you had no relationship with any formal presentation. What definition of 'formal presentation' do we now have? Unless you appear in a dinner suit and bow tie, it is not a formal presentation? I would have thought that appearing on a site as you appeared on those sites with the people directly responsible for the planning authorities was exactly the sort of formal presentation to which we were referring. It is the ultimate in weasel wordery to try to claim that the sorts of answers that you have given in this place conformed with that. When you went through your lengthy exercise of the potential areas in which you may have stood in breach of the code of ministerial conduct, you neglected misleading this House and misleading the people of this  statement in here today of your business interests with that paltry set of declarations that appears in the parliamentary declarations. That 20-minute speech of yours appears as 'Bunbury-various lots'. Three words can describe, as far as you are concerned, that enormous layer of business interests-a description of what you were up to in that period of time. And then you go beyond that and speak to councillors who are actively engaged in committee processes that are associated with decisions at any point of time. You say that it is a sufficient defence that from time to time you speak with them socially. That is not in fact a sufficient defence in any standard of law. If you are actually thinking of this in another context-say, a minister having business relationships of a potentially corrupt variety, for argument's sake-if an exchange of views occurs at a particular cocktail party that this and that ought to be done, is the mere fact that it was not a formal sit-down notified by the secretary of your company somehow or other supposed to excuse it? Is that somehow or other supposed to clear you-that long, detailed discussions at so called social gatherings with people who are in your planning authorities, with people with whom you have very considerable influence, somehow do not involve the daily work of the process? You have to get back into the heart of this-which you have not denied in the various proposals that you have gone through: the activation, via your ministerial portfolio, with Coles interests centrally. What you 'are actually talking about, by and large, as you offend against the daily work provisions associated in that code of conduct, what you are actually dealing with in normal circumstances, is Coles region. Decisions about car parking arrangements and even the location of particular Target stores or other Coles stores is generally handled by Coles region. It is not a matter that would be normally handled by the central office of Coles. What you did as a minister, to bring into play for the advantage of your companies, was to take Coles centre out and stick it in the region to make absolutely certain that your views got across in that particular process. That is how ministerial influence is used. You do not actually have to come out and have a piece of paper saying, 'I, the minister for small business affairs, accordingly request you, Nick Greiner, to intervene formally in these decision making processes inside the affairs of the town of Bunbury to ensure that my position is advantaged and, therefore, at some point in time down the line, you can expect a quid pro quo.' Unless there is some sort of letter that is an open confession, you seem to think that nothing matters at all in any of this. And you expect sensible people who know a bit about the ways of the world to assume that, unless there is something like that, you are covered. There are no standards in this government while you survive. I conclude by drawing your attention again to the letter from Mr Wilde to Mr Moore: I also confirm our agreement that I will not disclose or discuss with you the affairs or activities of the company during the period mentioned above This is a standard that you should uphold.

37,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. It involves his responsibilities as they relate to retail tenancies. Minister, do you recall telling the House on Tuesday: Since becoming a minister, I have not made any formal presentations, contact or telephone calls ... in breach of the guidelines. Given, Minister, that you have now confirmed the telephone call lobbying Councillor MCCourt and other councillors, had contact with various people and attended an architectural planning meeting involving your own development, haven't you misled the parliament?

41,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Did you mislead?  parliament. There is certainly no conflict of interest. I have just outlined to the House a very comprehensive statement setting out my involvement in the companies and setting out very clearly that the day-today control of those companies is held by my brother and Mr Wood. It was a very comprehensive statement and I think, as I said, it proves beyond doubt that I have complied in every way with the guidelines. Mr Crean- Mr Speaker, it is clear that the minister ...",64
42,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Is this a point of order? Mr Crean-is going to refuse to answer the question as to whether he has misled the House. That is the specific question asked of him. I would ask as a supplementary question: why, against the background of his statement, does he believe he has not misled the House?",64
43,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have listened very carefully to the minister's response. The minister is sure in his own mind that the answer has been adequate, and the supplementary question is disallowed. Families",64
44,Mr HICKS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Has the Treasurer seen a report that the Howard government places too much emphasis on the family? Does the Treasurer agree with this claim? Will he inform the House of the major government initiatives to assist families and small businesses, which will come into effect on 1 July?",64
45,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have actually seen reports that the Howard government places too much emphasis on the family. This is one of the charges to which we plead guilty. The charge is made by the Australian Labor Party. What has been referred to me by one of our members is a letter to the Frankston Independent on 24 June 1997. It was a letter of complaint about the government and it finished off by saying this: It is time that the Howard Government, which placed too much emphasis on the family during the Federal election campaign, honoured its pre-election promises. The writer of this letter in the Frankston Independent was Greg Wilton, the MHR for Isaacs. So the coalition is accused by the Labor Party of putting too much emphasis on the family. We say 'guilty'. Yes, we are very guilty of putting too much emphasis on the family. Conversely, you are not guilty of putting emphasis on the family. We would like to clear you of any interest in Australian families at all, and we know why you are complaining-because of our interest. Let us go through how the Howard government places emphasis on the family. From 1 July 1997 families will be getting $450 to contribute to the cost of taking private health insurance. The Labor Party never placed an emphasis on the family like that. On 1 January the family tax initiative could give a qualifying family with two children a reduction of $34 per fortnight in their tax. The Labor Party never placed emphasis on the family like that. For self-funded retirees, from 1 July we will be giving them the s-me rebates on their taxation as applies to penSIOner couples. The Labor Party never placed an emphasis on families like that. On 1 July there will also be other very important initiatives for individuals in Australia. People will have the option to put money into retirement savings accounts rather than being forced into union operated superannuation funds. There will be an 18 per cent income tax rebate for contributions up to $3,000 to the superannuation fund or retirement savings account of a non-income earning spouse to allow people to make contributions on behalf of their spouse into the concession ally taxed superannuation regime. That is designed to help families. May I also remind the House that on 1 July this year those measures which will h-lp small businesses will come into effect WIth capital gains tax rollover relief to give small businesses the opportunity, without the penalty of the intervention of capital - ains tax,. to roll over business and assets to enJoy the kind of growth that small business in this country wants to see. The Labor Party levels many, many false charges at this coalition government, but that was one that was true. This is a government that places emphasis on the family and this is a government that is very proud to do so. Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs",64
46,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. Acting Prime Minister, are you aware of this letter from Mr Wilde to Mr Moore to be tabled to Mr Howard? This letter reads: While you remain a Minister you will not use your shareholding in the Company to (a) Remove me as a Director, (b) Appoint any other Director, (c) Overturn or interfere with any decision I make in relation to the affairs of the Company. I also confirm our agreement that I will not disclose, or discuss with you, the affairs or activities of the Company during the period mentioned above. Why have you not insisted on precisely the same standard from the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs? Why have you not insisted on this standard which was established by the Prime Minister in defending himself against an accusation that Mr Moore breached the code of conduct?",65
47,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition is off the pace on this issue today. I want to say this. Firstly, I am aware of that letter. Secondly, I refer you to page 10 of A guide on key elements of ministerial responsibility. It says: Ministers are required to resign directorships in public companies and may retain directorships in private companiesAnd in terms of that Mr Crean-Go on! Go on! Mr Martin-Keep going!",65
48,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am happy to. Just be quiet a minute. It continues: only if any such company operat-s, fo- example, a family, farm, business or portfolIo of lllvestments, and if retention of the directorship is not likely to conflict with the minister's public dutyI say very clearly that I own a farm. I also have a range of investment activities and I have declared all my interests to the registrar associated with this House, Mr Barlin, who is about to retire as registrar-and we wish you well during this, your last question time-and to the Prime Minister as required by the guidelines. The whole point is that there is another aspect which you touch on in your question and I am happy enough to address it. It partly comes up under the section on page 11 of the same guidelines, where it says: Mil.isters are required to divest themselves of all shares and similar interests in any company or business involved in the area of their portfolio responsibilities. Ministers are not precluded from making investments on the stock marketsInter alia it goes on. I have ascertained, as part of taking all reasonable actions, that the minister for small business has no public shares in any public company whatsoever. Work for the Dole Scheme",65
49,Mr BILSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. Given the enormous level of community interest in the government's work for the dole initiative, can the minister inform the House of requirements for potential projects to be selected? When will the government release the guidelines for the work for the dole submissions and is the minister aware of any lingering opposition to this much heralded government initiative?",66
50,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Dunkley for his question. I am pleased to inform the House that draft guidelines for work for the dole projects are being circulated this week to community groups, to peak welfare agencies and interested bodies inviting them to make comments. They will also be available on DEETY A's home page on the Internet. Public consultations will be conducted next week before finalising work for the dole project guidelines. The government will be doing everything possible to ensure that work for the dole projects will be quality projects. The guidelines will outline the quality requirements that proposed projects will need to satisfy and applicants must demonstrate, first of all, their experience and credentials in working with young unemployed people. They will need to demonstrate their ability to foster links with local community groups and to work with the government in attracting young unemployed people in their community. They will need to demonstrate how they will maintain contact with and support participants after the project is finished, how the project will not risk paid jobs in the community and how they will identify and match the skills of job seekers to the requirements of the projects. I am sure that members of this House will recognise that these are very significant quality guidelines for projects. The government has been inundated with literally hundreds of expressions of interest from community organisations around Australia. There has been enormous interest and support for work for the dole. One particularly powerful statement of support was made on WIN TV news on 24 June. This powerful statement of support went along these lines: it is clear that the overwhelming majority of Australians of all political persuasions want this scheme. Who was the author of this particularly clear-sighted comment? Mr MCMullan-Me! Me!",66
51,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Indeed, it was none other than the member for Canberra, the shadow minister for industrial relations. He felt that it is was absolutely crystal clear that people of all political persuasions wanted the work for the dole scheme. Perhaps this was an admission that he was the author of the backtlip, the great backtlip that was so appreciated. Perhaps it came from the member for Canberra. Mr Tim Fischer-He should be proud of that.",66
52,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Indeed, he probably is proud of that, Acting Prime Minister. It was probably he who has made the Leader of the Opposition see reason on this. Indeed, members of the press gallery are now beginning to raise the question just where the policies of the opposition are coming from. As a senior member of the press gallery said on ABC radio in Sydney on 25 June",66
53,Dr THEOPHANOUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I raise a point of order under relevance. This has got nothing to do with the minister's responsibilities and it has nothing to do with the question in relation to work for the dole. It is all about what the Labor Party mayor may not have been doing. It is his own opinion of the matter and it is out of order.,66
54,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. Resume your seat. The minister's response is wide ranging as was the question.,67
55,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As a senior member of the press gallery said on ABC radio in Sydney on 25 June, 'You get the feeling it is not always Beazley who is running these issues.' Mr Costello--Ah, yes. We know about that feeling.",67
56,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Indeed, we know that on the common youth allowance the member for Jagajaga is very keen to take the running. We have had Beazley's black hole. We have had Beazley's blunder on work for the dole. We have had Beazley's backflip. We have now had Beazley's boo-boo on the youth allowance and it makes you wonder what is coming next. Is it bye, bye, Beazley? Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs",67
57,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. Does the minister recall saying in his statement a few minutes ago that he made no formal presentations or submissions to the Dardanup Shire Council while a minister? Does he also recall saying a few minutes ago that he was present at an occasion in late November or December last year with his brother, his manager, Mr Wood, the Dardanup Shire President, Councillor Bennett and the Shire Clerk, Clerk Sprague, to view the Eaton development proposal drawings in the architect's office of Councillor Nicholson? Is it not the case that the viability of the minister's Eaton project was then hanging in the balance because of his inability to that point to attract the Target store away from his rival's site in central Bunbury? What else was that architect's office meeting but a formal presentation on a matter directly related to the system? minister's retail business activity?  that I read a very comprehensive statement to the parliament. My affairs are now on the public record more than those of any other member in this House or, probably, any other minister. Mr Crean-Only because we forced you to. You would have tried to hide them.",67
58,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The member for Hotham!  have complied in every respect with the ministerial guidelines. Mr Crean-You have the limp wrist out, have you?",67
59,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The member for Hotham!  that I have not breached the guidelines and I have not misled the House. It was a very clear and comprehensive statement. I would add, Mr Speaker, that I went on to say that the approvals the opposition is referring to were made and issued before I became a minister. Social Security: Fraud",67
60,Mr SLIPPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,People in my electorate are concerned that some people are cheating the social security system. Opposition members-Question to whom?,67
61,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,67
62,Mr SLIPPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will start again, Mr Speaker. People in my electorate of Fisher",67
63,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! To whom are you addressing the question?,67
64,Mr SLIPPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the minister representing the Minister for Social Security. I am very keen about this question, Mr Speaker, as you can see. People in my electorate of Fisher are concerned that some people are cheating the social security system and that this is making life harder for true Aussie battlers who pay their taxes. Has the coalition been able to save taxpayers money by the proper pursuit of fraud and incorrect payments from the social security",67
65,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have been relishing the opportunity to answer this question for some time. I note the smile on the face of the member for Sydney as I say that. I was just going back and reviewing some of the quotes that were offered by the honourable member for Sydney when he was the Minister for Social Security about the effectiveness of the system which we inherited as a government. He was fond of quoting a Professor Weatherley of the United States who was brought out here, as he said, as 'an ackrjcJwledged expert on social security systems.' On 30 August 1995, the minister, as he then was, said that Professor Weatherley's 'conclusion as of 1993 was that the integrity of the system had been, as a result of government actions, essentially repaired.' The member for Sydney was fond of rebuking me, because, after he had produced a report on one occasion about the government's performance, I had suggested that his comments failed to acknowledge that what was discovering through his efforts in relation to fraud was only touching the tip of an iceberg. He was quick to respond that I little idea about what the then government was doing. It is very interesting that after last election the Labor Party undertook a review of why they had lost. One of the there comments in that report was that it seemed everybody knew of a welfare cheat. That was offered as one of the reasons the Labor Party had lost so significantly. The fact is that, when the coalition came into government, it announced that it would report quarterly to parliament on the progress that had been achieved in dealing with these issues. In the last report to parliament, the minister was able to announce that our efforts in the previous six months had saved around $12 million each week and that over 90,000 people who should not have been on a benefit had been taken off. I can now inform the House that, as was disclosed yesterday in the latest report, we have further advances in the implementation of the government's measures dealing with fraud. After nine months, nearly 138,000 people have been removed from stituents. payments altogether and 65,500 have had their payments reduced.  order. The minister is misleading the House. He is just referring to the continuation of compliance regime put in place by the former government.",67
66,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There are other forms in the House to pursue questioning misrepresentation. I ask the member for son Sydney to withdraw the remark. ,68
67,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The remark is withdrawn.,68
68,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I can always detect when there is a touch of sensitivity about these matters. The fact is that the savings which have been achieved for Australian taxpayers as a result of these efforts amount to $19 million every week. Mr Tim Fischer-In total.,68
69,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The savings amount to $19 million in total every week. The cumulative effect in other areas is that we have saved he $264 million-almost a quarter of a billion dollars-in debts recovered from July last year to 31 March this year. That is an inhad crease of over 46 per cent over the same period. Overpayments raised from reviews the have totalled $163 million, compared with $114 million in 1995-96. For the nine months, were 1,794 convictions for fraud, resulting in savings of almost $18 million. Support from the public has also increased substantially. We now receive something in the order of 40,000 individual pieces of information from the public. That is in a period of nine months and is an increase of 22 per cent over the same period. That is because the public now believe that somebody is serious about dealing with these issues. We do have in place the data matching arrangements to identify people who are claiming benefits where they are not entitled. I want to assure the House that the government is determined to ensure that every effort is made to clean up the system for the benefit of taxpayers and honest customers alike. I am sure the honourable member for Fisher will be pleased to be able to report that to his conMinister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs",68
70,Mr MARTIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Small Business and Consumer a Affairs. Minister, your statement to this House referred to a Councillor Bob Nicholson. Are you aware that the Bunbury City Council wrote to the Western Australian government whether a Councillor Bob Nicholhad a conflict of interest in his vigorous support of the minister's business developments? Can you confinn that Councillor Nicholson is the architect to the minister's businesses? In light of your statement and previous answer, since becoming a minister have you continued to discuss matters, formally or informally, that come before the council that affect your businesses with Councillor Nicholson?  ship with Councillor Nicholson in my very comprehensive statement, but I would further go on to say that I am aware of the complaint made against Councillor Robert Nicholson. That complaint was dismissed. Employment: Job Vacancies",68
71,Mrs WEST,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer infonn the House of the results of the Australian Bureau of Statistics May survey of job vacancies and overtime released today? What do the figures indicate about the prospects for job growth and improving employment opportunities for young Australians?,69
72,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question in relation to employment and I note the interest that is shown in employment by members on this side of the House. You get questions on job vacancies, which you do not get from the Australian Labor Party. This side of the House is interested in the substantive issues of employtaxation. ment and families-even if it is said that we place too much emphasis on families. Members on this side of the House will be pleased to know that ABS job vacancies rose by 2.7 per cent in the June quarter in seasonally-adjusted terms and by 1.4 per cent in trend terms. Total job vacancies are now at their highest level since the December quarter of 1994. Private sector vacancies are at their second highest level ever-the highest level being recorded in the December quarter of 1994. Today's rise in the seasonally adjusted measure of vacancies was as a result of a 5.8 per cent increase in the number of private sector vacancies, offset in part by a 12.4 per cent fall in the smaller public sector job vacancy series. Private sector vacancies of around 54,900 are at their highest level since the December quarter of 1994, when they were 55,500. The level of private sector job vacancies in the June quarter of 1997 is the second highest reading in the history of the series which began in the June quarter of 1979. In relation to the reports for overtime, while overtime fell 1.4 per cent in seasonallyadjusted terms, it rose 1.5 per cent in trend terms, reflecting the strong growth in the March quarter. The ABS job vacancies data taken together with the ANZ job vacancies series is supportive of a strengthening in employment and employment prospects over the coming months. It is particularly good to see the strength of private sector vacancies, which are strong in historical tenns. I hope all members of the House-just like, I am sure, members on this side-will welcome the fact that job opportunities are growing, that vacancies are expanding and that there are good prospects in relation to employment over the forthcoming months. We will continue to take those policy measures which will be supportive of growing employment in the Australian economymeasures to take pressure off interest rates, measures to reduce Commonwealth debt, measures to put the budget into surplus, measures to improve industrial relations and measures to reduce the burden of capital gains They will be the measures which will create sustainable, real jobs in the private sector-a sector where vacancies are growing, as shown in today's figures. Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs",69
73,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question again is to the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. I refer again to the minister's meeting in Councillor Nicholson's office last November or December with the Dardanup Shire President and Clerk to view the Eaton development plans. If, as the minister said in his answer to me, all development approvals had been given before he became a minister and there were no substantive business issues remaining to be resolved, what was he doing participating in such a meeting at all? How can he explain his subsequent course of telephone conversations with Shire Clerk Sprague. What were the dates of those telephone conversations? What was their subject matter?  very comprehensive statement, and I would like to refer the member back to my statement. I will read it back to him so he has got it clear. I said: The only planning approval applied for by the group was for the Eaton development and that was approved on 6 February 1996, prior to me becoming a Minister. It was prior to me becoming the minister. I have clearly not breached the guidelines. I have no conflict of interest. The statement. I made today, without any doubt, is probably one of the most comprehensive statements made by any member of this House in regard to his personal and business affairs. Greenhouse Gas Emissions",69
74,Mr BROADBENT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Will the minister confirm to the House that the government has adequately considered the implications of various options regarding greenhouse gas emission targets on the Australian national interest?,70
75,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I know it is of great importance to him and to the people of his electorate, an area that sees a lot of economic activity centring on the use of such things as fossil fuel energy. The government's fundamental principle in this whole debate is one of balance, a balance between economic development and environmental sustainability. If you do not get that balance globally, you will get what we have had here nationally in Australia: gridlock, a gridlock of the sort that we saw under Labor's forest policy where noone benefits. In the greenhouse area, again, we are pursuing a balanced policy approach. We want to achieve effective, equitable and practical arrangements which ensure a balanced economic and environmental outcome. If we do not achieve that internationally, all our efforts will fail because rigid, undifferentiated targets where adjustment burdens are not equitable will simply not prove sustainable. To get down to some of the facts in this, Australia produces just 1.4 per cent of global emissions, relatively high, as it happens, per capita, but that is largely because we have in this country a comparative advantage in fossil fuels. That advantage has allowed us to specialise in internationally competitive, energy intensive export industries. Indeed, it could be said that higher use of clean Australian coal, for example, if it resulted in lower use of other people's dirtier coal, could produce more sensible global outcomes. We need an environmental policy environment which allows for that to happen. Nonetheless, our total contributions are so small. The fact is that, if we closed Australia down, it would not make any appreciable difference globally, but it would not do us much good here in Australia. In pre-CheapJack opportunistic days, those over there once agreed with that approach. The shadow Treasurer said not so terribly long ago when they were in government: Australia will play its part in reducing global greenhouse gas emissions, but it will not take action which would have net adverse economic impacts nationally or on Australia's trade competitiveness ... That is actually our position. We think that is a good and sensible position. That is the one the Prime Minister is defending as he meets with the Prime Minister of Britain and with the leader of America while Senator Hill does an admirable job in New York for us. But what is their position now? Let us see if we can establish which one of several it might be because yesterday the Leader of the Opposition sought to criticise the Prime Minister for the stand that he is taking in the interests of regional Australia and the jobs in regional Australia. Let us see what he said. He said: We have opposed the idea of mandatory targets but we have also tried to recognise a bit of reality. There is a bit of concern out there around the globe on this issue, and we have had in place a set of activities designed to bring ourselves as close as possible to the sorts of targets that people around the globe expect of global citizens. High-minded stuff. What that means is that he wants us to lock ourselves into a regime that would see Australians wear 20 times the impact per capita that the Europeans will wear and several times what the Americans will wear. That is what he wants. He wants us to adopt the globally accepted patterns. I will tell you what, while he is out there complaining about Newcastle jobs and while he is out sort of saying he wants to have a bet both ways, perhaps members like the member for Hunter would ask the real Mr Beazley to stand up because this is an important issue. If we go down the proposed road, you will see acti vity in the nonferrous metal industries probably cut by 50 per cent over the next 15 years, the coal industry by 20 per cent and the steel industry by another 20 per cent. So how about it? Member for Hunter, ask your leader to stand up. Will the real Mr Beazley please stand up? This government has no intention of closing Australian industries down. Equally, we do want to make a constructive contribution which will have a real and lasting effect on the environment. That is why we are advocating a differentiated approach which equitably shares the task among all nations-if I may say so, for exactly the same reasons the Europeans want a differentiated approach for themselves. NA",70
76,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"Before calling the next question, I inform the House that we have present in the gallery this afternoon members of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association Study Tour from Tonga and Tuvalu. On behalf of the House, I extend to you all a very warm welcome. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Customs: Importation of Drugs",71
77,Mr FILING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Did the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs, in response to my question on 18 June about the country being awash in cheap heroin, refer to X-ray equipment, closed circuit TV and successful seizures enhancing Customs' role in the war against drugs? Minister, is it a fact that there is insufficient staff to actually monitor closed circuit TV installations at border control and video tapes have to be reviewed at a later time, long after a suspected heroin courier has departed? Is it a fact that X-ray units are predominantly used on outgoing searches rather than incoming searches? Is it a fact that there are now fewer people or personnel involved in Customs intelligence work? Is it also a fact that, for drug seizures valued at $10,000 or above, no seizures have been initiated on the basis of Customs's own information but rather on outside agencies' initiatives or other sources of information?  work cooperatively with other border agencies-that is, Federal Police and, particularly, state police operations. A much greater focus is on the cooperative arrangements and, sure, intelligence plays a very vital part in that assessment to apprehend seizures at the border. The nature of seizures has changed quite considerably. In the airport area, there has been, numerically, a significant boost in the number of seizures. They are smaller, but they are coming in through people's baggage and personal effects. Likewise, a backscatter X-ray in that area is the most ideal way to examine anyone carrying drugs in that way. The member for Moore mentioned CCTV installations. He will be aware that part of this program is over four years. The ultimate program will be not only for the installation of X-ray equipment but also for CCTV scanning equipment. Ultimately, that equipment will be monitored centrally. Of course, the requirement for the backup tapes predominantly will be for prosecutions when they occur. Workplace Relations Act",71
78,Mr ANTHONY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Industrial Relations. Is the minister aware that some commentators have argued that the provisions of the Workplace Relations Act are not well understood? Has the government implemented an information strategy to inform employers and employees of the provisions and benefits of the Workplace Relations Act? Has the strategy been successful?,71
79,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Richmond for his question. It is very important that people understand the opportunities available to them under the Workplace Relations Act. We do have a strategy, which we have been working on, to get information out to people about their basic rights, and to do so as widely as we can. For example, we wrote to everybody in the Public Service, and 11,000-about 30 per cent-decided not to have their union dues deducted from the payroll. We are using the Internet, which has been a very useful medium for getting information out. The other day I launched a professional bargaining agency, which has some focus on the public sector, and it is getting information out. Employer organisations are doing a lot to inform their membership about what can be done to improve employee relations for the benefit of both business and their employees. Whilst obviously we always want more and we want people to be even more focused on the changes, I publicly recognise the tremendous effort a lot of people have made in ensuring that there is a greater understanding of what we are doing and of the benefits of creating jobs and improving living standards as a result. However, there are some who somehow do not get the point. I would have to say that the honourable member for Canberra presents a worrying sight in this regard in his attempt to persuade everybody that all work causes stress and all workers are stressed out. I think he himself has become the personification of insecurity. He has a real problem understanding what is going on. There are some contradictions in some of the things he says. He used to claim, for example, that the truly diabolical thing about Australian workplace agreements was that they were secret. Then he started to run an ostensibly detailed commentary on AW A, so obviously they were not as secret as he had claimed. But we found, unfortunately, that he got his facts wrong on one of them at Cafe Magnifico. His next attempt to discredit the AW A system was to criticise the AFC agreement, which was an agreement in Queensland. He described it as 'the worse I've ever seen'-so much for a secret agreement. He was wrong on that. What it really showed was him attacking an employer and employees who were getting together to get an abattoir going to create jobs and to boost income for this country. Then, yesterday, he jumped up on the Atlantis Removals agreement. I woke up to the radio this morning, as other members would have, rightly hearing the solicitor for the company affected not only denying the claims but also making the point that this shadow minister was basically running a line for the TWU-which I think gets you closer to the truth-and is misleading, is contradictory or is just a limp mouthpiece for the TWU. Is that the first time? No, it is not. In fact, he did not even understand what happened in Victoria with the transfers of the advisoryMr MCMullan-Yes, I did.",72
80,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, you did not; it is on the Main Committee Hansard. You did not understand about the unfair dismissal. You had your cases up here and you asked questions. We said, 'Give us the details,' and you never gave us the details. When you actually produced a couple of cases and we had them checked out, they were wrong. Then you ran an argument against the changes we were making for the benefit of young people under the Workplace Relations Act. Only in the last week or so, one of the unions has promoted the very principles to establish agreements which we put in the legislation. So you ran a scare campaign against the interests of young people getting jobs. Then-just to show the quality of this member and his misunderstanding and misrepresentation-when you finally got the Labor Party and dragged them off to marginalise enterprise bargaining, you did not even have the capacity and competence to put out your speech. What we are doing for workplace relations is important for a couple of simple reasons: we want to create jobs and give people higher wages to boost living standards. If we are going to have a debate about it, let us have an informed one. Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs",72
81,Mr MARTIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. I again refer to the minister's statement. I refer specifically to the minister's admission that he has spoken to two Bunbury city councillors about car parking requirements in the CBD of Bunbury. I ask the minister: will you now inform the House whether these conversations pertained to the development of a rival non-Prosser group shopping centre in Bunbury that would have made your Eaton proposal non-viable? Particularly, was the proposed Target development in that rival shopping centre mentioned in these two conversations about car parking requirements in the Bunbury CBD? Minister, isn't it the case that you personally had an interest in that Target development not proceeding?  a very comprehensive statement was to prove to the House and the opposition how I have complied completely with the Prime Minister's statement. Firstly I would like to-Mr Martin- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The question was specifically phrased to go to the issue of car parking in Bunbury; it went to the issue of the minister's interest in seeing that a particular shopping centre development not proceed because he would get some advantage for land that he owned. I ask that the minister be drawn to the substance of the question and respond accordingly.",73
82,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I implore the minister to address the substance of the question.  question is outlined in the statement.,73
83,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Come on. Answer the question.,73

87,Mr HARDGRAVE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Minister, will you outline to the House the progress the government is making to ensure that our health care system will continue to provide high quality services to all Australians as we enter the new millennium?",73
88,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. In the past 15 months, the government's approach to health has been based on two very strong philosophical commitments: first, a commitment to public health and the prevention of illness as well as the treatment of illness; and, second, a strong commitment to an evidence based approach to health. On the public health side, we have instituted new programs in diabetes, cancer control and immunisation. We have had a third national HIV-AIDS strategy. For the first time ever, we have all state and territory governments on board for one nationally coordinated anti-smoking campaign. On the side of evidence based medicine, we have instituted a requirement that new items going on the Medicare benefits schedule have to have undergone thorough research and evaluation before they do so. In this, Australia is leading the world. We have also had the capacity to work with some segments of the medical profession to make very significant savings to the budget and put those parts of the schedule on a cooperative basis much more strongly on evidence based. The radiologists, the nuclear medicine physicians and the optometrists have been fabulous in the way they have worked with the government in being prepared to reign in a rate of growth in a way that is to the benefit of the public as a whole. We have also made significant progress in the area of general practice. This morning, I went to South Australia and back to launch with the South Australian Minister for Health, Mike Armitage, the first of the coordinated care trials, Health Plus. This is starting to enrol patients from today. One of the people who attended that is Mr John Williams, a retired banker who has asthma. He has been one of the prototypes of this trial. Mr Williams was going into hospital three times a year with his asthma, but while he has been having his care much more closely monitored by his general practitioner, which takes extra time and money, he has been able to stay out of hospital for 12 months continuously. So by spending more money on his care and treatment we keep him out of hospital and save a substantial amount of money. In Aboriginal health, we have announced 35 new Aboriginal health services-over and above what was planned 12 months ago. We have framework agreements with every state and territory-with the exception of the Northern Territory and Tasmania, although Tasmania I hope to sign in the near future. We have had an Aboriginal sexual health strategy launched. We have also had, with the cooperation of the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, the successful deployment of the army in a number of infrastructure projects in northern Australia. In the area of private health have allowed a much wider diversity of products than was previously available, special products for couples, special products that are called bucket products and a much greater use of front end deductibles, which people are now taking up as they are cheaper products. As the Treasurer has already mentioned, rebate starts next Tuesday. These things together give an approach to health that is cost-effective. In that score, in the last two budgets, we are doing as well in containing the growth of cost as anywhere in the world-putting it on a strong evidence based approach and also putting as much effort into trying to stop illness as we do to treating it. Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs",73
89,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs and relates to responsibility for, amongst other things, retail tenancy. Minister, if, as you claim in your statement, you are not involved in the activities of your companies, why did you phone Councillor MCCourt concerning the Homemaker Centre development? Why did you tell Councillor MCCourt that you were: ... pleased he had not rejected the proposal out of hand. Minister, are you aware of a statutory declaration from former Councillor MCCourt today in which he says:  was using me as a sounding board as to the possible success or failure of an intended development. Minister, haven't you again misled this parliament?  shadow minister is trying to put is completely wrong. Firstly, on this particular matter, I comprehensively set out the contact, but, more importantly, I have gone to a great deal of effort to indicate how I am not involved in the daily work of the company. I have gone through in this statement the corporate structure of the company. I have looked at the operations of the firm. The next heading deals insurance, we with my involvement. That is completely in accordance with the ministerial code of conduct. But, more importantly, I reject the assertion that I have breached the guidelines. I have not misled this House, and there is no conflict of interest. Going to the point that the shadow minister is trying to make, I did note a transcript of the the Channel 9 interview this morning with exCouncillor John MCCourt. It states:  MCCourt: No, I don't think he should resign. Further down the tape: Journalist: Did you feel under pressure? MCCourt: No, not at all, absolutely not. It was a very amicable discussion.

96,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Leader of the Opposition well knows that I am not in a position to tell whether the minister is reading from transcripts or confidential information. The minister assures me he is reading from confidential information and it is therefore not to be tabled. However, the Acting Prime Minister has agreed to table a transcript of what appears to be the substance of the issue. As I understand it, it has been tabled. Mr Martin-On a point of order, Mr Speaker. As you said, you were not in a position to know what the minister had in his hand, and the Acting Prime Minister has leapt up and tabled a document.

Will the minister inform the House about the contract signed this morning to provide 11 helicopters for the Royal Australian Navy and of the benefits that will pass on to the Shoalhaven district, in particular the Nowra area?",75
101,Mrs BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Gilmore for her question because I know the concern she has for the people in her electorate who have unemployment problems. Unfortunately, the second largest contributor to the economy of the Shoalhaven area is social security. The third largest contributor is defence and so any announcement of economic activity and provision for new jobs in her area is most welcome. Signing this contract for the acquisition of 11 command helicopters will generate economic activity and will create new jobs-65 initially. Mr Latham-Will it help small business?",75
102,Mrs BISHOP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes, it will help small business. It will help them though contract work and it will, as I said, create greater economic activity. The purchase price is $660 million, the support contract is worth $125 million, the Australian industry component of the support contract is 72 per cent and of the acquisition contract it is 20 per cent. Most importantly, it will generate jobs and economic activity for an area which is desperately in need of that new activity and which this government is committed to see thrive and to see new activity created. Defence is very proud to be able to do our bit. Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs",75
103,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. Minister, we have just been able to tabulate, erring on the modest side and as a result of calculating the various meetings outlined in your statement, something like 119 meetings of different descriptions since you have been Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. Minister, how can you possibly claim that you are no longer involved in the day-today activities of those businesses when you have confessed to the fact of that huge number of meetings, that those meetings contained occasions on which you discussed your business interests with planning authorities and when you have discussed and lobbied councillors on your business interests, those business interests which place you in direct conflict with your obligations as Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs in the tenancy and consumer affairs area? Mr Crean-When do you get time to be a minister?",75
104,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The member for Hotham!  desperate question. What I have set out is, as I mentioned, probably the most comprehensive statement tabled by a minister. What the opposition is counting is the fortnightly Saturday meetings I have with my brother and likewise the once a week meeting because Colin Wood, the company manager, handles my personal affairs. What is important is complying with the code and what is important about the code is 'not to be engaged in the daily work of the business'. I have not breached these guidelines and I have not misled the House. In fact, I have put down a statement that clearly shows that I have complied with this guide. Constitutional Convention",76
105,Mr NUGENT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Acting Prime Minister. Has the Acting Prime Minister seen reports that the opposition is advocating a vote to gauge public support for changes to the very nature of our democratic system? Will the government's Constitutional Convention be able to be convened in December as planned?,76
106,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question and advise that the Senate has, for the second time, insisted that the Constitutional Convention (Election) Bill 1997 be amended so that a compulsory attendance, full Senate ballot be held for the election of half the delegates to attend the convention. In other words, the Labor Party has joined with the Democrats to sabotage the convention bill. This is exactly the opposite of what the Leader of the Opposition said in February. He said he would take no action to hamper the preparation and proceeding of the convention as announced by the Prime Minister. It is another backflip and pike, and something. I now have some information for which I thank the member for Moreton and others, which indicates exactly why this has happened. It has happened because a number of middle benches of the Labor Party have been wandering around this place saying, 'Better that we take the flak now to sabotage the convention because, if we allow the convention to go ahead, it might just happen to work and we cannot have the Prime Minister or the government having the benefit of that happening.' I have to say that this is a very shabby approach if the opposition is fair dinkum about constitutional matters and about the matter of a republic. What we proposed was a very fair and proper way to proceed with the creation of a convention, which was scheduled to meet in December. Now that deadline will not be able to be met. What the Labor Party has proposed is that there should be $20 million more spent on a ballot for half the delegates for a one-off convention-$20 million more of taxpayers' money-rather than a postal vote, which is cost effective, fair and practical. They forget that the method used by most trade unions to conduct elections is by postal vote. The method used by so many clubs to elect their committees and boards is by postal vote. Yet, no, no-big government, big spending, misuse of taxpayers' money-another $20 million you are insisting on. To top it all off, we had that nice little dance between the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Democrats overnight to produce yet another bill on the matter of the convention. I think the Minister for Industrial Relations got quite jealous about that. That is his role to dance with the Leader of the Democrats. Here you are, an interloper, coming along and doing a dance with the Leader of the Democrats. We defend our colleagues in these matters. It was the Minister for Industrial Relations who was first on the dance floor in that regard. It is like your hide to get out there and try to dance with the Leader of the Democrats.",76

We are getting on with the task. My colleagues know that we have got on with facilitating four rates of interest rate reductions in the first 15 months of government, we have got on with paying off $5 billion of Labor's debt, we have got on with revamping the EMDG scheme and providing for tourism, we have got on with record road construction programs and building the Pacific Highway, we have got on with abolishing the wool tax and building extra exports to Mexico and India, we have got on with a huge boost to the Austudy program, the provision of a regional telecommunications infrastructure fund of $250 million",77
112,Dr THEOPHANOUS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I take a point of order on relevance. The question was about the constitutional convention. It has nothing to do with the false claims of the Acting Prime Minister. He should address the real issues of the convention.",77
113,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the honourable member for Calwell. I uphold the point of order. I know that the Acting Prime Minister is following his natural enthusiasm at this time of the year to address the question. I encourage him to wind up.,77

115,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me now ask a question of the Acting Prime Minister about what his actual responsibilities are. Acting Prime Minister, have you seen the quote of your Prime Minister, on a debate not dissimilar to those that we have heard in the House, that the supreme test of the courage and probity of the Prime Minister is whether he insists on members observing the basic requirement of a minister-that is, they tell the parliament the truth? Have you also seen the quote by councillor Wayne Major in the Herald-Sun today? It states: Councillors have tried to wreck the city site, leaving the way open for Target to go to Mr Prosser's Eaton site north-east of the city. They have consistently brought up the issue of parking bays available to shoppers in Bunbury. Is the Acting Prime Minister aware of the issue raised in this parliament yesterday that the point of the small business minister's call to Mr Greiner was to initiate not only the location of a Target store at Eaton but also the imposition of a development requirement on the rival site, which would make it unviable and leave the way clear for the Eaton project to proceed? Do you accept that this allegation places the minister's behaviour in even more damaging light and have you investigated that matter and formed a conclusion about it? Mr Ross Cameron- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I merely note your advice to us on 26 May 1997 in relation to standing orders 142 to 144, in which you say that members should restrict themselves to one substantive question at a time. Multiple questions which, in your view, are in effect short speeches",77
116,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. Resume your seat.,77
117,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am more than happy to respond to the question of the Leader of the Opposition. When attack is wilting, in comes the Leader of the Opposition. They have been bouncing around between the member for Cunningham, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Hotham and now to the Leader of the Opposition. Let me say: following question time yesterday, I asked the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs for a response in relation to the additional matters arising and for a comprehensive written account of all matters relating to compliance with the relevant code. After careful consideration of the material brought forward and taking into account all aspects of the code, and after taking all reasonable steps which are available to me, I am of the view, and the government is of the view, that on the material available he has not been involved in the day-today running of his business and is not in conflict. This material of course has now been presented to the parliament by the minister. I might add that 'daily', as defined in Australian Dictionary of 1989, means 'produced or occurring every day or every weekday, from day to day, as defined in the Concise Oxford Dictionary' .",77
118,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,78
119,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! This is a question by the opposition leader directed to the Acting Prime Minister. I do expect the members on the Leader of the Opposition's front bench and back benches to support him. Opposition members-We do! We do!,78
120,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Without the noisy rancour that is beginning to develop.,78
121,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I further make the point that being a director of a private company is permitted under page 10 of the code. Mr Albanese--Answer the question! Come on!,78
122,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Grayndler would be well-advised to resume his proper place if he is going to interject.,78
123,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Further, as a consequence of being a director in a private company-I want you to think this through-there are company law requirements for a certain degree of activity and signature associated with the annual returns and the like. Being a director in a private company is in fact provided for under the code. So what we have had here is the opposition flip-flopping around in relation to this matter. They did produce two witnesses in their support. The first star witness was Nick Greiner, except Nick Greiner said that the minister did not seek to influence him and did not influence him. We have Nick Greiner's letter to testify to that. The second star witness was produced by the member for Cunningham. If you gave the member for Cunningham a go, you might have made some progress; but you kept on cutting him off. That star witness was Councillor John MCCourt, except John MCCourt said that the minister did not seek to pressure him. Further, when John MCCourt was asked, 'Should Mr Prosser resign? Do you think the minister should resign?' his reply was, 'No, I don't think he should resign.' So I want to say very clearly that you have failed",78

125,Mr TIM FISCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You have tried to put in a noisy finishing sprint to the post, but your attack has failed. NA NA Motion of Censure Motion (by Mr Beazley) proposed: That so much of the Standing and Sessional Orders be suspended as would prevent the Leader of the Opposition moving forthwith a motion of censure of the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. Mr Reith-We will take the suspension and then you can move the censure motion.",78
126,Mr SPEAKER,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"Is the motion seconded? Mr Martin-I second the motion and reserve the right to speak. Question resolved in the affirmative, with an absolute majority.",78
127,Mr BEAZLEY,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"I move: That this House censures the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs for: (1) his abuse of ministerial office; (2) having used his public office to secure private benefit in blatant breach of the requirements of the Prime Minister's code of conduct; (3) having phoned Mr Nick Greiner, Vice Chairman of Coles Myer to influence a decision to get Target as a lead tenant on the vacant Eaton lot owned by a company of which the Minister is an active Director; (4) having failed to disclose the full details of the telephone conversation between himself and Mr Nick Greiner in particular as it related to the Minister's attempts to thwart development on an opposing site; (5) his repeated failure to table the letter between his brother and Mr Nick Greiner, written following the telephone conversation between the Minister and Mr Greiner, which provides further evidence of collusion to advantage his private business interests in serious contravention of the Prime Minister's code of conduct; (6) having misled the House about his involvement in regard to the Eaton site; (7) having, as Minister responsible for retail tenancy policy, directly canvassed a Bunbury City Councillor, Mr John MCCourt, about another development or another site owned by him in Bunbury which would give his company a financial advantage in direct breach of the Prime Minister's code of conduct; (8) having failed to answer truthfully questions regarding that particular development despite being invited repeatedly to do so in this House this week; (9) having, in the words of Councillor Wayne Major, tried to wreck the Bunbury city site leaving the way for Target to go to the Minister's private company Eaton site north east of the city, thus constituting a further breach of the Prime Minister's code of conduct; and (to) having misled the Parliament and the public on a number of aspects of his inappropriate approaches to councillors in direct contravention of the Prime Minister's code of conduct which amounts to a contempt of the House; and calls on the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs to resign immediately or for the Acting Prime Minister to sack the Minister forthwith. Acting Prime Minister, members, Mr Speaker: it is exactly these circumstances which the ministers code of conduct is supposed to preclude from happening-exactly these circumstances. I am astounded, as I said earlier in the week, about the moral blindness of this government-that they can sit and listen to this 20-minute political suicide note from the Minister for Small Business and  unsurprised that it does not include at the bottom of it two extra words: 'I resign.' What the minister fessed up to was active, in effect, day-today involvement in the business activities of his operation. What the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) tried to do once or twice was to selectively quote from the code of conduct to defend himself. I never thought that I would use a piece of correspondence from the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), who we still feel regularly breaches the spirit at least of the matters relating to conflict of interest, to attack a fellow minister of his. But I have to say that Mr Moore, to our great surprise, looks like a knight in shining armour-a black knight, perhaps, being Black Jack-when you compare him with the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. The defence of the Acting Prime Minister was, 'This is not a public company, which would mean that you would have to get out of it. It is a private company.' Ralsten is also a private company. The Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs said, 'In my ministerial portfolio I'm likely to find myself, at different points in time, in conflict with my public duties.' So what does he do? He gets Mr Wilde, who is in the same position as Mr  write: I confirm your agreement with me that while you remain a minister you will not use your shareholding in the company to: (a) remove me as a director, (b) appoint any other director, (c) overturn or interfere with any decision I make in relation to the affairs of the company. I also confirm our agreement that I will not disclose or discuss with you the affairs or activities of the company during the period mentioned above. Is this a weekly meeting to discuss the interests of the company? Is this a visit to sites, along with your company secretary, to examine your various business interests around the town of Bunbury, or Mr Moore's equivalent in this case? Is this a document which, if it were to apply to you, indicates regular contact with. city councillors to influence their business mterests and their business concerns? Of course it is not. It is in fact, if it is adhered to, the appropriate arms-length relationship. We go back to the beginning here. Remember who you are. You may by now have forgotten, but what you actually are is the minister for small business in charge of, among other things, questions related to the operation of private tenancies. You have everybody who is associated with that now demanding at least your disappearance from the portfolio. That was added to today in the remarks by Lisa Michael in the performance that she put in at the Press Club, making it amply clear what people in the business community think about your fundamental conflict of interest. Let us go through that again today: Ministers are required to resign directorships public companies and may retain directorships in private companies only if any such company operates, for example, a family farm, business portfolio of investments and if retention of the directorship is not likely to conflict with the minister's public duty ... It is not without significance that the Acting Prime Minister, when he chose to read out these things, excluded 'is not likely with the minister's public duty' when we invited him to contemplate these matters. Among these 119 meetings that we can so far discern from what the member has had to say and from what I hear emanating from Western Australia there are going to be one or two councillors whom you did not list during your discourse, your supposedly allencompassing comprehensive discourse, who will over the next little while make amply clear to you that they have had similar discussions with you and similar approaches. So you, no doubt, will be back in this place on some subsequent occasion and presenting, no doubt, your particular views again about your discussions with them when that occurs. But let us get to the heart of what has been going on here, because not only do we have here a minister who does not understand his responsibilities in relation to the conflict between public duty and private interest. We do not have just that particular problem associated with it. We also have a substantial problemMr Martin-Come back and defend yourself, you wimp!",78
128,Mr BEAZLEY,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"This is amazing, Mr Speaker. The minister under censure has disappeared from the chamber, where he is being held accountable and we are of course advising him of new information in this regard. This government intend to sit on this scrofulous statement to defend themselves over the next two months. We have news for this government: this matter is now under active consideration for other reasons in Western Australia and it is not going to disappear over the next two months, because there are people who understand thoroughly that their personal business interests have been potentially damaged at least by the in efforts made by this minister to use his ministerial office to advance his personal interests. In that process, they have reason to or believe in the way in which they have been treated and so disadvantaged that the full weight of the state has been used to support their opponents in a manner that is completely inappropriate and they have new heart and, having new heart, they are going to deal with to conflict this problem themselves. The government cannot face it because the government knows it is canting hypocrisy. The government knows that its code of conduct is no longer worth the paper it is written on. Let me just quote, because I think it sums up exactly the situation of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) in relation to this, John Laws-I never thought I would often quote John Laws in this House-who said: In spite of an amazing array of worldwide communications, we seem, really, to have sort of lost our Prime Minister. He seems oblivious to the fact that one of his senior ministers has lied to the Parliament. That's the truth. The Minister for SmaIl Business, Geoff Prosser, has lied to the parliament. That was his biggest mistake. There are others. And he should be sacked. It's all fairly straightforward. Yet, our cricket-loving Prime Minister, obviously a bit miffed about the Test being rained out, appears more concerned with Mark Taylor's average than dealing with a rogue Minister. What a perfect description: a rogue minister. That is what the Prime Minister should be dealing with. That is the person whom we are dealing with in this censure motion here today. Haven't we got so much ice to skate on when it comes to the unctuousness of the Liberal Party in relation to these matters in times past! The particular quote of the Prime Minister I used in question time was the Prime Minister's quote in moving a censure on us when we were in government at one point in time about one of our ministers--one of our ministers, I might say, who resigned at the end of it. It stated: The supreme test of the courage and probity of the Prime Minister is whether he insists on Ministers observing the basic requirement of a minister, that is, that they tell the Parliament the truth. Do you actually think that this description of the minister's business interests for one second conforms with that paltry little declaration of 'Bunbury-various lots' in the minister's statement to this parliament about what his personal interests were? Do you think the descriptions that we now have of conversations with Greiner conform""one wit with those initial statements that, 'I've had no conversations with any members of the Coles Myer board about these matters'? Do you think that that very high standard conforms with this minister's statement, when pressed to it, that he had had no discussion with any of these councillors or planning authorities of any nature-formal or indeed, as he went over the top when he talked about telephone calls, informal? Do you think it conforms with that? Of course it does not. This is a minister now who has lied, I say advisedly, repeatedly to this chamber.",80
129,Mr SPEAKER,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,The Leader of the Opposition will withdraw that remark.,81
130,Mr BEAZLEY,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"I withdraw. He has deliberately misled this chamber on repeated occasions. He has deliberately misled the Australian people in numerous interviews as far as these things are concerned when he has been asked to explain himself to the press. The minister has not engaged in that process of misleading without understanding the fact that he confronts some degree of danger himself. When we see the panoply of what has been concealed here, we understand why he does not want to talk to us and we understand why he does not want this process to be thought through in this chamber and examined and analysed. Imagine yourself as a small business person out there in the community, particularly if you happen to be a tenant or a franchisee. Imagine yourself in their situation as they sit down and look at whether or not they think they are going to get fair dealing from this man. This is a man who is prepared to phone directors of Coles Myer so as to take out of the normal company planning processes a decision making process, which would have been essentially highly localised, probably to the level of the local Coles manager, or, if it went anywhere, to the state manager. He gets the most central and powerful section of that company actively engaged-to make sure that there is no backsliding-and turns it on another businessman, the sort of businessman who is not trying to mix his public and private duties and who is pursuing his affairs in the normal course of events as a private businessman. Having sooled Coles Myer national on, he goes back to all his mates on the Bunbury City Council and levers them to activate them and get them going. These mates on the Bunbury City Council also include the likes of the minister's architect. They are people actively engaged beyond just simple mateship; they are actively engaged in his business processes. He has been sooling them on to his business opponents. The Acting Prime Minister used as a defence, when I presented him with a question on this, that it did not succeed. That is the defence. The monopolisation of the power of the Australian government, combined with Coles central office, combined with all the mates on the council, actually hit a brick wall at the last point of the fence in the Bunbury City Council-where there are a few councillors with a bit of guts to stand up to him. This, of course, obviates any possible error or any possible sin as far as the Deputy Prime Minister is concerned. That is what we are supposed to look at and applaud. All I can say is that what we can applaud in that regard is the triumph of Australian democracy at the local level. What we cann?t applaud is the people who would subvert It, who happen to include the person who is not obeying the ministerial code as far as this exercise is concerned. It was interesting to see the minister stantly say, 'MCCourt's a Labor man.' Oddly enough, standing out there saying, 'MCCourt's a Labor man', they have already named a number of other councillors, who, I can assure them, are not Labor people, as people have engaged actively in conversation. As said before, there will be other councillors far as this matter is concerned because this by no means a complete piece of work, that, comprehensive though it may have seemed at first sight. There will be others and there much more to go as far as this issue is concerned for this particular minister. The simple fact of the matter is that, oddly enough, in Western Australian politics-I do not expect people on this side of the continent to comprehend this-there is not partisan party politics in local government in Western Australia. Not many people vote in Western Australia either-you get about 10 per cent of the council turnout-but there is no party politics in local government. There who are members of political parties who involve themselves but they tend to form wavering coalitions. As often as not, you groups of people who actually happen to members of the Labor Party and members of the Liberal Party in one coterie in a local authority opposed to people of a similar on the other side. That is what this minister is running slapbang into in Bunbury. That is why he keeps his active involvement in these companies. You have to understand that. His companies are 100 per cent dependent for their day-toning day operations on decisions of federal governproperty ments, state governments and local govern the ments, but particularly local governments. AlI three levels of government are constantly making decisions that advantage or disadvanwould tage his companies. He cannot afford, as businessman who has been actively engaged in some of the most bruising planning battles in Bunbury for years and years, to let go his connection. He cannot afford to do that because he fears his fortune would disappear. He fears his interests would not be fulIy protected. That is what his principal concern is about. That is why he cannot let it go. We have said before in this place that we conhave no problem with business people in parliament or people with business experience. But at different points in time they have to make choices. The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism made a choice: 'I will they remove myself from my private company, I Ralsten. I will have no discussions on any of as the business activities on a day-today basis is with my company secretary because I know were I to do that, that would place me in a conflict of interest situation. I will trust my is fortune to this man. I will take the risk.' The minister's junior minister finds himself in exactly the same position. He does not exit. He gets right into it. If daily work of a company is actually a timetable as opposed to an expression about close involvement, how could any minister be involved in the daily work unless he actually sets up his ministerial office as his registered business office? We have not yet checked that. If you are going to define 'daily' in that form, that is about the are people only way you could do it. If you are going to define 'daily' in the common sense way-as would everybody in see the gallery here, everybody on the Liberal  position, all of us here on this side of the House and anyone with a modicum of commix mon sense-then that would have to include a description that involves a weekly meeting with your partner, who happens to be your brother and also with your company secretary; a set of regular, or so it would seem from totting up the list, briefings with local planauthorities in relation to his multifarious developments, including the ones at heart of this; and an endless series of telephone calIs to others associated with the same business. The common sense approach tell you, Minister, that that is daily. a That is what is meant by daily activity. So this minister finds himself in this position of a conflict of interest. He is protected of by a weak, worthless Prime Minister, by a bumbling Acting Prime Minister who does not know what he is doing, a supine Liberal backbench and a morally blind Liberal front-bench. That is what is protecting him, and nothing else. No standards are protecting him, no reasonable interpretation of public duty is protecting him and no basic decency in our political life is protecting him. This government has the lowest standards in politics in living memory. They have demonstrated that here today by this fatuous performance in defence of the minister. (Time expired)",81
131,Mr SPEAKER,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"Is the motion seconded? Mr Martin-I second the motion, Mr Speaker, and reserve my right to speak.",83
132,Mr REITH,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"The government rejects the censure motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). The Leader of the Opposition has made many allegations and substantiated none of them. The Leader of the Opposition is on a political pursuit to his own political advantage, unrelated to the facts surrounding the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Prosser). Can I firstly cut to what I think is really the crux of the Labor Party's claim against this minister. The crux is not that he has a conflict of interest. The crux of it is not that he has used his official position. The crux of their claim is that he is in a position of managing on a daily basis the affairs of his business. That is the crux of the claim. The reason that they said during question time, 'We have now read the statement and we have counted up 119 contacts,' is that it is their political objective to create the perception that this minister has breached the ministerial code. If you do not have a substantial basis to actually put your case, you create a picture. This must be the fifth or sixth censure motion we have had on this. When the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin) started on his censure motion the other day, he said that they wanted to paint a picture of the minister. They were not actually interested in what the minister had done; that was the last of their interests. What they wanted to do was to paint a picture-an adverse picture-of the minister's conduct of his portfolio. The guidelines do contain some general requirements on ministers in respect of the manner in which they conduct their businesses. What the guidelines do not say is that if you have been successful in business you have got to sell your family and personal financial interests. What they say, however, is that you are not to be in the conduct on a daily basis of managing those affairs. So it is a fair thing to ask yourself what is actually meant by 'daily'. In our political lives we think of many things that are daily. If you are in the Labor Party on the front bench, you probably for years got the Daily Worker. The Daily Worker basically tells you what you are going to say today on behalf of the workers. That is the definition of daily. If you are young and restless, your definition of daily is that every day you get up and ask yourself, 'How am I going to make trouble for the Leader of the Opposition?' This is a daily occurrence. This is the ordinary meaning of the word 'daily'. I remember that Joh Bjelke-Petersen used to talk about his press conferences in Brisbane and he used to have a daily feeding of the chooks. That is something that happened every day. It was part of the day's work, part of his professional conduct of his business as a politician. That, of course, is a long way removed from the circumstances facing this particular minister. Mr Fitzgibbon-One hundred and nineteen meetings, wasn't it?",83
133,Mr REITH,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,You talk about 119 meetings. I do not know where you get the 119 meetingsMr Fitzgibbon-We added it up out of his statement.,83
134,Mr REITH,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"What you did, as you have just interjected, is read the statement. In the statement it says that he speaks to his brother once every couple of weeks. We have been in government for 60 or 70 weeks, so that makes 30 or 40 contacts, so that is 119 minus 40 or so. He speaks to his general manager, Colin Wood, weekly. So that is actually about 60 contacts since the election. Add 60 to 40 and you get about 100. So now what they are saying is that in 16 months he has had 19 contacts in relation to his personal affairs, somehow this is a daily management of his personal affairs. That is a complete nonsense, and I think it comes through in the statement. He has attempted to set out in the statement the basis on which and the regularity with which he has made contact with the people who are responsible for the day-today management of his business. Why shouldn'the be able to do that? Take the circumstances of a person who might have rural holdings. Let us say you are a member for a big rural or regional seat. It is pretty commonplace in the history of this country that from those rural seats we get people from the land. It is hardly an odd thing in a representative democracy that if you represent a rural seat the chances are you have some rural land-holdings. Let us say you have been elected as a rural member. You come down to Canberra, you spend the week here, you go back on Saturday and you walk out to the back paddock. You open the back paddock gate and you let the cows run from one paddock to another. On that basis, if this was Geoff Prosser, he would have got up a statement saying, 'On 70 occasions I was involved in closing the gate on the farm property once a week when I returned home.' Would that be the daily management, taking the cows from one paddock to another, which breaches the ministerial guidelines? As a matter of common sense, it clearly is not. Geoff Prosser's crime is that he is not a person from the land; he is a successful business person. We applaud people who have been successful in business. One of the problems of Canberra is that I think it is a fact that politicians have to be wary of getting out of touch. One of the great things about a representative democracy is that you get real people sitting in the parliament who really do know what is going on in business. That is very important to the future of this country. From the point of view of those who are following this debate, a lot of people would say, 'Why is the Labor Party running this smokescreen when I, as a constituent or as a voter, am concerned about the economy and the chances I have got of getting a job, of keeping the job that I have got or of my and children getting a job?' That is a pretty fair question for people to ask. The Labor Party have put up a baseless campaign against a minister when, in reality, what they ought to be doing is focusing on the big issues that really do concern this country, namely, unemployment, youth unemployment, foreign debt and all the other issues that are really important to us. The starting point is that the crux of this claim against the minister is that he has been engaged in the daily conduct of his business, and yet there are no facts to substantiate that. In fact, the statement he made this morning is quite clear that this minister is not so engaged in the daily affairs of his business. What he is involved in, as he makes clear, are some issues that, from time to time, are relevant to him personally. He rings up John MCCourt, a former councillor, and asks him when the council is going to make the road in front of his house. Is it a crime to ask a local councillor whether or not somebody is going to fix up the road and say that it would be a bit of a problem if they did it during winter and created a quagmire? According to the Labor Party, that is one of 119 cases about which he ought to be condemned-the fact that he made a phone call. Mr Ronaldson-It's a nonsense.",83
135,Mr REITH,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"I am glad that the member for Ballarat says it is a nonsense. John MCCourt says it is a nonsense as well. He was asked on Channel 9 television this morning: 'Did you consider it an unreasonable call or unethical for him to have made that comment to you?' MCCourt said: No, I did not actually. At the time. I was a councillor with the Bunbury City Council, he was a constituent of Bunbury seeking advice as to whether a proposed development would succeed or not. I recall telling him that it may have difficulty because of planning stipulations and that was that. And I advised him to run it up the flagpole and council would have a look at it. That is hardly an offensive phone call. When he was then further asked about the phone call, this is what he said. Firstly, the  should resign? Do you think the minister should resign?' He replied: No, I do not think he should resign. I think that the question of ministerial conduct is between the Prime Minister and Geoff. I think that it's a rather harsh code to adhere to in the context of all Geoff was doing was actually canvassing ideas as to whether I thought, as a councillor, that this proposal would get up or wouldn't. And, I mean, he didn't pressure me. He was just asking a general planning question. That is an important quotation that the Labor Party would never read out because it just puts things in a sort of common sense context and completely denies the claim that they have made. Let us look briefly at the censure motion that they have moved today. Firstly, they claim that he has abused his ministerial office, but I do not think even the second speaker would claim that there is any evidence for that. The second one says: having used his public office to secure private benefit in blatant breach of the requirements of the Prime Minister's code of conduct; The fact of the matter is that that is based on the claim that he had a conversation with Nick Greiner. That claim in the censure motion is, in fact, itself misleading, as are the other claims that they make in respect of the Greiner telephone conversation. For example, in No. (3), they say: having phoned Mr Nick Greiner, Vice Chairman of Coles Myer to influence a decision to get Target as a lead tenant on the vacant Eaton lot owned by a company of which the Minister is an active Director; That is misleading. I will come back to it and say why. Then: having failed to disclose the full details of the telephone conversation between himself and Mr Nick Greiner in particular as it related to the Minister's attempts to thwart development on an opposing site; That is also misleading. Point No. (5) is misleading because that also relates to the Eaton site. Why is it misleading? Because this minister rang Nick Greiner, as he said in statement. Let's get his statement out. What he said was that he rang Nick Greiner and he asked Nick Greiner for a telephone contact on behalf of his brother. He did not ring Nick Greiner to seek to influence any aspect or decision that Coles Myer might take. In fact, the bottom line of all this is that he has got no commercial arrangements with Coles Myer anyway. Talk about making a mountain out of a molehill. He has no commercial arrangements with Coles Myer-full stop. Absolutely none-full stop-has none. In fact, all these things attempt to do is to paint a picture about which the facts are in fact otherwise. He made it clear today in the statement that he gave, and what a very comprehensive statement he gave. He has really provided a very detailed set of circumstances to the House so as to completely clarify absolutely each and every issue that has been raised against him. In respect of the Greiner matter, he spelt that out in that statement today. He says that he has already advised the House in relation to the call that he made to Greiner. He confirmed that he had had one discussion with Greiner-he only had one telephone conversation with Greiner. He said: In that call I requested a contact point for my brother relating to a proposed Target store. Mr Greiner advised me that I should get my brother to write to him. Mr Greiner and I did not discuss any detail, nor any other matter, including car parking arrangements. And that is important, because that is another aspect of this censure motion which the Labor Party is pushing against the minister. He continued: I also confirm that I have had no further contact with Mr Greiner and there are no commercial arrangements between Coles Myer and any company with which I am associated. When you go through the censure motion, there are 10 points. Four or five of them relate to the Greiner matter. That has been before this House now ad nauseam. There is no other additional material in respect of that. Here is a classic misrepresentation: his repeated failure to table the letter between his brother and Mr Nick GreinerThe minister has answered that question. As the minister said, he was not involved in the drafting of that letter. He was not a signatory to that letter and he has advised the House that he has not got the letter. So it is a neat little implication to attempt to censure the minister for the failure to table a letter between a third party and Mr Nick Greiner. If you look at the other aspects, in No. (8) the claim is that the minister: having failed to answer truthfully questions regarding that particular development despite being invited repeatedly to do so in this House this week; That relates again to the Eaton site. Any objective observer would have to agree that this minister has in fact answered all of these issues. He has on every possible occasion come into the House and been absolutely open about it. Sure, he is a successful business person, but that also means that this minister is in touch with the business community. He does have an understanding of the solutions needed to improve Australia's economic performance. He is being unreasonably hounded, as I think I have shown when you analyse this document. On that basis, this government does not believe that he ought to resign. He ought to stay. This minister has acted reasonably. This opposition, beset by its own internal divisions and its own lack of policy alternatives, is running this as a political ploy against the minister. When you take aside the smoke and bubble, the fact of the matter is that this minister is able, and this motion is, therefore, rejected. (Time expired)",84
136,Mr MARTIN,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"Cunningham) (3.46 p.m.)When in the last several weeks the propriety of the Minister for Small Business and Con this place, what we have not endeavoured to do, as the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) has suggested, is tear down a successful businessman. In any interview I have given on this matter, I have said that the issue here is the standards of this parliament, the standards that the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has put in place through the code of ministerial conduct-and there was an expectation about integrity. It does somewhat pain to me to say that the blind acceptance by the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) of the statement delivered in this place by the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs as an appropriate excuse for guilt has, in my view, diminished his standing. I have had the utmost respect for Tim Fischer, but I have to say to you, Acting Prime Minister",86
137,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"Mr Nehl}--No, say it to me.",86
138,Mr MARTIN,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"I say to the Acting Prime Minister, through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you have surprised me by your acceptance of that statement. What that has done is open up many more questions than answers have been provided for. As the Leader of the Opposition has said, if you go through the information contained there, even on a most reasonable and conservative estimate of the number of meetings this minister has had with councillors, with planning authorities, with councillors who are employees designing his shopping centres and with state ministersand of the number of meetings he has had with and telephone calls he has made to different people-he is guilty of the daily activity of his business and of being involved with it as a minister of the Crown. In the last two weeks in this place, we have shown two things without a doubt. Firstly, we have shown there is a conflict of interest between this minister and his business interests and his ability to perform appropriate activities as a minister of the Crown. Secondly, we have demonstrated on no fewer than two occasions-so far-that he has misled this House. Much was made of the Nick Greiner phone call and letter. How many of the tenants of  and how many of those tenants who were at the National Press Club today to express their concern about this government and its response to the fair trading inquiry report could pick up the telephone and get through to Nick Greiner, the deputy chairman of the Coles Myer board, and say, 'I just want a contact number for a relative', or a friend, or somebody, 'so that they can get in touch with Target.' And why was it that a minister of the Crown needed to do that? If Steve Prosser, the minister's brother, is responsible for the day-today running of this minister's private companies, why didn't Steve Prosser make the phone call? Why could he not have telephoned the head office of Coles Myer down in Melbourne and asked for their property manager? There is evidence to suggest that somebody did-another Prosser, not Steve. We have tried to bring that out in this place, and we have asked for clarification of that, and this minister has refused to answer. He runs and he hides. So, in terms of the Greiner implication and the eleventh-hour production in this place of that faxed message that the Leader of the House had to stand up here and read out and rely on-and which the Acting Prime Minister is relying on-that faxed message conveniently left out the fact that they were talking about a Target store at the Eaton site that the minister for small business owned. The reliance on that as a defence was staggering. I am sorry that the Leader of the House is not here, because I am sure that he would now have wanted to have had a little bit more time to reflect on the defence that he might mount. As has been said, the simple act of picking up that telephone, as a minister of the Crown, and saying, 'Nick Greiner, please. G'day, Nick, it's Geoff here, mate. I happen to have a couple of worries about a shopping centre development I've got down in Bunbury in Western Australia', is compromising. Was this about getting Target into the Eaton site? In a roundabout way, it may well have been. But the simple fact of the matter is that there was a competing site in central Bunbury, and on that competing site, which developers who were not Prosser developers wanted to develop, permission was given by the council. At the eleventh hour, Coles Myer came along to the developer of this expansion and said, 'We have an increased requirement for car parking spaces.' That was aimed at making that development unviable. If it subsequently fell over, it would mean the opportunity could be taken again for another site to be looked at for a Coles Myer Target store. And who do you think may have owned at least two other sites for that?",86
139,Unknown,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,Opposition members interjecting-Who?,87
140,Mr MARTIN,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"The minister for small business. I know my colleagues find it hard to believe, but it is true. As far as the Eaton site and the Nick Greiner telephone call are concerned, we have categorically shown in this place on a number of occasions that this minister misled the House. He said he did not have any phone calls, he did not discuss anything, he just asked for contacts. Then he came in here with a fourparagraph statement. He was forced in, in the dead of night. He came scurrying in and elaborated, by putting in the key words: 'Yes, it was about the Eaton site, and it was about Target.' Our good friend the Leader of the House said, 'Game, set and match', that afternoon. That was a miscalculation on his part. The second bit of misleading was reinforced today by this extraordinary statement of 10 pages by the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs when he reiterated the number of people he had spoken to. But, alas, he expanded on the number. We asked questions about a former Councillor MCCourt. We were going to ask questions about another shire councillor, Councillor Major, but we did not need to necessarily because they were all laid out there, plus a few others for good measure. How many of these councillors, either in Bunbury or in the neighbouring shire, did this minister talk to about his private business ventures? Answer? I would suggest all of them. He claims there were never any formal approaches. He says, 'It's informal.' It is stubbies and thongs with a sanger and a beer. He said it was an informal approach to a councillor to talk about Eaton, to talk about the Homemaker site expansion and to talk about various lots in Bunbury. This minister says that is an acceptable defence. It looks as if the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr MCGauran) is going to speak second for the government in this debate for the government. I would like to know whether this minister is satisfied that this laughable and miserable set of excuses by the minister for smaIl business is adequate. Does he think the minister is clear of the charges that have been levelled by this side of the parliamentcharges that this minister for smaIl business has misled the place on at least two occasions that I have outlined today, and that this minister for smaIl business purports to have the small business community interest at heart, when in fact the only interest he has at heart is his own? Does this minister for science believe this statement is going to allow this minister for small business to sit back in the seven-week recess we are about to embark upon and say, 'Thank God there are no more question times for a while-and guess what, the Labor Party will drop off.' Minister for small business, if you are watching as I look at you down the lens of the camera, we are not dropping off, sport. We are going to pursue this. The Leader of the House said that this minister enjoyed the confidence of the government. This minister for small business regrettably, however, does not enjoy the confidence of: the editorial writer of the Sydney Morning Herald, the editorial writer of the Australian, the editorial writer of the Herald-Sun, the editorial writer of the Adelaide AdvertiserMr Griffin-What?",87
141,Mr MARTIN,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"But wait, there's more. The editorial writer of the Brisbane Courier-Mail, the Western Australian Retailers Association, Lisa MichaelMr Crean-Tell us what she said.",88
142,Mr MARTIN,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"That is very interesting, and I thank my good friend the member for Hotham for his prompting. Lisa Michael is a small businesswoman who is trying to get the right thing done for small businesses in this country. She is trying to mobilise small businesses, particularly in the Melbourne area but now right around Australia, to get them to get a voice so they will force this government to implement the recommendations of the small business inquiry report on fair trading. Lisa Michael was at the National Press Club today and made some interesting comments. But, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, do you know-and I think you may because of your extensive interest in and control of the Main Committee-that the government today withdrew its quorum in the Main Committee when that committee report was to be debated? This government stands up and says in this place that it stands for small business but, while the great prophet of small business and the high priest of small business-the Prime Minister (Mr Howard)-is away overseas, the government has collapsed the quorum in the Main Committee so that report could not be debated. But it gets worse. Did you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that a delegation of small business people who had stories to tell about their difficulties in shopping centres, their problems with unconscionable conduct, their problems associated with shopping centre owners and their problems with landlords-and for that read 'the minister for small business' - tried to see the minister for small business today? Do you know what happened? This minister who says, 'I know small business because I'm one of them and I'll stick up for them,' threw them out of the office. This small business minister had his staff throw those small business people who were there to complain and ask for that fair trading inquiry report to be put in place out of the office. They were summarily dismissed. What did Lisa Michael-who speaks on behalf of the Small Business Advisory Network, the Small Retailers Association of South Australia, the Western Australian Retailers Association, the National Federation of Independent Businesses and the Small Business Persons Association of New South Wales-say today at the National Press Club? She said:  a large landlord worth $50 million. There is a definite conflict of interest. How could we expect the government to implement these recommendationsand she was talking about the fair trading inquiry She said:  resign. Small business has had enough. She went on to say: If Geoff Prosser stays as minister, we have no confidence at all that this will be passed through. Again, she meant the small business report. In this censure motion today, we have again sought to make this minister accountable. We have sought to make him accountable for the fact that he has mixed his private business interests with his public duties as a minister. We have sought to censure him because he has not adequately disclosed those business interests. We have sought over the last several weeks to show to the people of Australia and, more importantly, to his colleagues on that side, that the Prime Minister, albeit away with Mark Taylor, and the Acting Prime Minister need to take some decisive action. We want to see this minister come back into this House and, as the Leader of the Opposition said, add the final two words to that extensive statement of his. Those words? Opposition members. I resign!",88
143,Mr MARTIN,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"When that happens, the faith in this chamber, the faith in the ministerial system of responsibility and the faith in the Prime Minister's code of conduct for ministers may be partially restored, but it will take a long time to do so. (Time expired)",89
144,Mr MCGAURAN,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"Over my parliamentary career, I have sat through more than 100 censure motions in this place, and this does not even rank with the worse of them. This is not even in the ballpark of a serious conviction of a censure of a minister. There has been no forensic examination of the issues. There has been no citing of the Hansard to compare words of some days ago with words current. There has been no proper examination by the opposition of the words of the Minister for Small Business and Con outside the parliament. All they have done for the entire censure motion is simply and repeatedly assert that the minister has misled the parliament, that there is a conflict of interest and that the minister has breached the ministerial guidelines. You have not made out your case-for the simple reason that you cannot make out your case. We have the full statement of the minister, as made in this parliament at 1.30 p.m. It threw you off, didn't it? You were not expecting it, and your questions in question time revealed that because your questions in question time were answered in the statement. You had no new questions in question time. All you do is keep repeating it by slur. There has been no examination of the issues as you would normally get in a censure motion. This is quite pathetic. The minister made full and proper disclosure to this parliament earlier on, at 1.30 p.m. today, and continually over the period the opposition, for their own internal political reasons, have targeted him. Where are your questions on youth allowance? Where are your questions on work for the dole? Where are your questions on the constitutional convention? You do not ask any questions on the issues of the day of immediate relevance to the Australian people because you are divided amongst yourselves, for a start. There are backflips on work for the dole, and humiliating defeats for the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). It is the same with the constitutional convention. You cannot muster enough consistency to ask us any of the immediate, pressing questions of the day. So, day after day, we have had questions wasted on the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs. We have had matters of public importance abandoned so we could have these senseless, worthless censures day after day-taxpayers' funds wasted. The issue of jobs has been put to one side by the opposition-but not by the government, for our questions in question time reflect our priorities, which are the priorities of the Australian people. The Leader of the Opposition employed all of the legendary bluff and bluster, hyperbole and exaggeration for which he is known-in startling contrast to the member for Cunningham (Mr Martin), who decided to take the high moral road, it seemed. He lowered his voice a few octaves and cloaked himself in sanctimonious hypocrisy. As best that I understand it-and I might be mistaken-I think they are making two allegations here. The first is that the minister is engaged in daily activity with his business interests and is, therefore, in breach of the ministerial code. The second is that he sought private gain by way of public office in relation to his phone call to Nick Greiner. Let us look at both of them and just see how baseless and cowardly these charges are. The first one is in relation to daily activities. The ministerial guidelines allow for directorships in private companies . .once you take on a directorship, you are requIred UDqe&' corporate law to take on certain obligations. You must protect the interests of the shareholders. It is quite impossible, legally and morally, for anyone to take on a private directorship without some oversight of that business. You cannot do that totally. The ministerial guidelines, as I read themMr Lee--Make sure you read them carefully.",89
145,Mr SPEAKER,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,Order! The member for Dobell!,90
146,Mr MCGAURAN,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"They do not require a total abandonment of your interests, but simply that you do not involve yourself in the daily activities. That is what we have seen from this minister. Of course, he wants to protect the interests of shareholders. He wants proper inquiry. He wants due diligence, and that will require a knowledge of, a degree of familiarity with, the businesses for which he is a director, as allowed for under the ministerial guidelines. What are you suggesting? Are you suggesting that he become a director of a private company and walk away and never ask the other directors or the company officers occasionally what is happening or never make some inquiries on his own part?",90
147,Dr NELSON,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,They want him to break the law.,90
148,Mr MCGAURAN,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"Do you want him to break the law, to totally abandon the interests of shareholders that have been entrusted to him? The simple point is that the relatively small number of meetings with relevant company officers, as shown in the minister's statement, prove that he is only meeting his obligations under the law. Let us look at the second charge-that is, that he rang the Deputy Chairman of Coles Myer to secure a private gain. The problem here is that Nick Greiner has said he was under no pressure and in his view the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs did not attempt to influence him. Mr Lee-When did he say that?",90
149,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"Order! Member for Dobell, take care!",90
150,Mr MCGAURAN,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"The proof of that is, of course, the minister has no connection whatever with Coles Myer. There is no Target store on any of his landholdings. So this conspiratorial gathering between Nick Greiner and the minister, as alleged by the opposition, is utterly false. But that is the whole problem. What they have done day after day, as the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) has made abundantly clear for us, is just paint a picture built on slurs and false charges. The fact is you simply do not have the substance for a censure motion. All you are doing is distracting from your own internal problems. You are an absolute rabble. You are not even a credible or halfcredible opposition. The simple fact is that the Australian people know it. They know you are a bunch of opportunists. It does not matter whether it is on economic policy, whether it is on parliamentary tacticsMr Lee-- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: when the honourable member says 'you are a bunch of opportunists' and he is not directing his remarks through the chair, I think it is a reflection on you, and he should be asked to direct his remarks through the chair.",90
151,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"I thank the honourable member for Dobell. Of course, the minister will address his remarks through the chair. I am confident he was not reflecting on the chair.",90
152,Mr MCGAURAN,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"As soon as the charges are tested against the minister for small business, those opposite collapse. Their first star witness was Nick Greiner. Of course, he said that the minister did not seek to influence him and, in actual fact, did not influence him. We have Nick Greiner's letter to attest to that. The second star witness is John MCCourt, who is one of yours; he is a Labor orientated councillor. There is nothing wrong with that; it is perfectly his choice. But just remember this: he is yours. On Channel 9 yesterday, he was asked:  you think the Minister should resign? MCCourt: No I don't think he should resign. I think that the question of Ministerial conduct is between the Prime Minister and Geoff. I think that it's a rather harsh code to adhere to in the context of all Geoff was doing was actually canvassing ideas as to whether I thought as a councillor that this proposal would get up or it wouldn't. And I mean he didn't pressure melet me repeat that: 'I mean he didn't pressure me'he was just asking a general planning question. So your second star witness has repudiated your charges. He says that the Minister for Small Business and Consumer Affairs was not seeking to influence him and was not pressuring him. John MCCourt attested to that. The two people who the opposition says the minister tried to influence say that he did not do that. They say categorically, unambiguously and without reservation that he did not seek to influence them. So how strong is your charge that the minister for small business used his public office for private gain? It is utterly baseless. It is non-existent. There is no perception of influence, and there was no attempt to influence-real or otherwise. So what is the minister for small business guilty of? Using the phone and discharging his responsibilities legally as a director of a company-that is the charge that the Labor Party has made against him. In doing so, its case collapses around its ears. The simple fact is that all Labor has shown so far-after hours, days and dozens of questions in this parliament-is that the minister for small business does not use his ministerial position for his own gain and that he does not have day-today involvement in his business. So what is he being censured for? You have made out the case for him. Mr Lee-He's been misleading the parliament.",90
153,Mr MCGAURAN,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"Oh! The member for Dobell raises it again: he alleges, by way of interjection, that the minister for small business is guilty of misleading the parliament. I have already dealt with that. But, if members on my side will be tolerant and bear with me, I will repeat it: where is your production of the Hansard to show his misleading of this House? You have no evidence to show it. In typical Labor fashion, if you repeat the lie often enough, it will take on an order of legitimacy. Mr Martin- Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: if the minister is, in fact, issuing a genuine challenge to produce that information, I am quite happy to do that right now for him and to seek leave to table it.",91
154,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,I think the honourable minister was speaking rhetorically.,91
155,Mr MCGAURAN,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"They had 40 minutes in the speeches of the Leader of the Opposition and the member for Cunningham to produce some evidence against the minister for small business. The simple fact is that the Labor Party are going through the motions. Their questions in question time were written yesterday and were just bowled up again in a very obvious fashion. Of course, the minister's statement had answered them before. We know what this is all about. It is a diversion. It is a lame attempt to explain your own backflips on policy and your own internal divisions. We on our side have canvassed those, but I suspect too briefly. We have been too soft on them. We really should have highlighted more. Mr Ronaldson-Tearing themselves apart.",91
156,Mr MCGAURAN,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"They are tearing themselves apart, as the member for Ballarat says. Whilst you carry on and allow yourselves to play these silly political games of no interest and no importance to the Australian public, we are getting on with the job for small business. One of the things I would like to address is the incident involving Lisa Michael, whom the member for Cunningham spoke of earlier on. The slur continues; it just goes down another path. The member for Cunningham alleged that the staff of the minister for small business had ejected-there were overtones or connotations of forcible ejection-Lisa Michael, a representative of small business, earlier this morning. Here is the story: Lisa Michael and the United Retailers Association had no appointment with Minister Prosser this morning. They turned up to the office unannounced, without warning, and demanded a meeting. They were politely told that the minister was not available. I know what; I will test this. I will roll up to the Leader of the Opposition's office one day with a group of my constituents-whether from the science portfolio or from Gippsland-and see how long we have to cool our heals in the waiting room or whether we will be asked to come back another time and make an appointment. If there is one thing you cannot accuse the minister for small business of it is not being available and accessible to small business. He has worked hard in the portfolio and with success. Let us look at some of the tangible benefits. What about the capital gains tax that has been so substantially dropped for small business. What about the reduction in the provisional tax uplift factor? What about industrial relations-reforming the unfair dismissal laws? Mr Kerr interjecting",91
157,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,The member for Denison has already been warned this afternoon.,92
158,Mr MCGAURAN,AND CONSUMER AFFAIRS,"What about red tape, with the report of the task force having been presented to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) on 1 November last year? There were 62 recommendations in that report, and in our first term there was a 50 per cent cut in paperwork in respect of the compliance burden. We are setting the future agenda for small business under the leadership of the minister for small business. The minister for small business, on behalf of the coalition parties-the governmentwishes to reduce the taxation burden on small business. We want to clarify the tax system and make it more simple, less compliant. We have already reformed areas of fringe benefits tax. The list goes on and on. These are trumped up charges against the minister and are without substantiation. Your censure motion today has been a complete farce. Question put: That the motion (Mr Beazley's) be agreed to.

160,Mr SLIPPER,SPEAKER,"Mr Deputy Speaker, this question was actually to be asked of the Speaker in his capacity as a presiding officer of the House and as a person who regularly receives accredited heads of mission in tralia. Is it a fact that His Governor General receives credentials from heads of mission on days approximately a Speakermonth apart but that it is possible for ambassadors and high commissioners to have to heard wait for up to three months prior to presentation of credentials? That, of course, means that the head of mission is unable to carry out his or her responsibilities during that period. NOES I understand that, for instance, the incoming Singaporean High CommissionerMr Lee-On a point of order: I cannot see how this issue can be of relevance to a question to the Speaker.",93
161,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPEAKER,Mr Nehl}-I thank the honourable member for Dobell. I am listening very carefully and I think I am PAIRS on the point of suggesting to the member for Fisher that his question might be more relevantly addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I will hear the question but no debate or expansion upon the question.,93

165,Mr SLIPPER,SPEAKER,I was actually there and I add thoroughly enjoyed the evening. The Singaporean High Commissioner was represented at the Speaker's dinner by a councillor or acting high commissioner because the high commissioner had not had the opportunity of presenting his credentials.,93
166,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPEAKER,Resume your seat. Mr Leo MCLeay-On a point of order,93
167,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPEAKER,I do not need your point of order. I thank the honourable member for the question. I will certainly refer it to the Speaker and will get an answer either Ausfrom the Speaker or from the Minister for Excellency the Foreign Affairs.,93

170,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,SPEAKER,"Mr Deputy Speaker, this is also a question which I was proposing to raise with the Speaker. Yesterday in the course of debate on the government's decision to abolish the sugar tariff, the honourable member for Dawson conducted herself in a disorderly fashion. Mr Reith interjecting",93
171,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,SPEAKER,"It is a question of the Speaker. Just keep in your box! I asked the Deputy Speaker who was in the chair at the time to refer that matter to the Speaker, which he undertook to do. I am wondering whether you might be able to inquire of the Speaker whether he is able to give me a reply before the House rises tomorrow.",94
172,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPEAKER,"I will certainly do as the honourable member for Perth requests, but I would point out to him and to the House that I was present in that division and observing very closely. While the occupant of the chair had said, 'Lock the doors,' and stated the question",94

174,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,SPEAKER,"Exactly 12 months ago to the day I placed a question on notice to the Minister for Health and Family Services concerning Medicare services in the electorate of Chisholm. Perhaps I should ask you to send him a birthday card, but, pursuant to standing order 150, I would ask that you write to him concerning this matter.",94

177,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPEAKER,Mr Nehl)Could you get to the question?,94
178,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,SPEAKER,This afternoon we had the situation where a minister stated he was quoting from a transcript and was then asked whether it was confidential. My question is: can a transcript of a public broadcast or of any kind also be confidential? Can the Speaker please advise the interpretation of that standing order? We badly need it to be clarified.,94
179,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPEAKER,"I thank the honourable member for Newcastle. I will certainly refer his question to the Speaker but, had the question been addressed to me in my own capacity, I would say that the occupant of this chair has no ability to know what personal notes may be written on any document, whether it is a transcript or not.

He should in fact be in protective custody.",95
185,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPEAKER,"You will withdraw that too. Mr LEO MCLEA Y-I will withdraw that too, because there are probably some decent people in protective custody around this country. The Speaker indicated that he would ascertain from Minister Jull whether he would give a briefing to the committee about what was happening. The Speaker said he would try to have that briefing arranged prior to the time the House got up. Could you ascertain from the Speaker when that meeting will be held?",95
186,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPEAKER,I certainly will. I thank the honourable member for Watson. I remind him and all members that there are many hours to go yet to arrange that meeting. Public Gallery: Wearing of Hats,95
187,Mr BEDDALL,SPEAKER,"My question is to the Speaker through you, Mr Deputy Speaker. It has been brought to my attention earlier in the week that a visitor to the public gallery was asked to remove a piece of head wear by an attendant. On many occasions at the opening of parliament I have observed many people wearing headwear. What is the ruling on members of the public vis-a-vis members' spouses?",95
188,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPEAKER,I am not quite clear what you are asking. Are you talking about a male,95
189,Mr BEDDALL,SPEAKER,One of the attendants asked a young lady to remove her hat up in the public gallery. Is there one standard for members of the public and one standard for guests at the opening of parliament?,95
190,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,SPEAKER,Mr Nehl)There is one law for everybody. It is certainly in order for women to wear hats in the gallery. That will be enforced. Questions on Notice,95
191,Mrs CROSIO,SPEAKER,"I too have a question through you to the Speaker. Under standing order 150, I require that the Speaker write to the Minister for Family Services. I have had question No. 1335 on the Notice Paper since February. Under the same standing order, I also request that he write to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs.

An appointment was made and, upon their arrival, my staff member Norm Haywood signed them in at the Reps door, although I was not aware of this action.

PUBLIC SERVICE BILL 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Reith, and read a first time. Second Reading",96
215,Mr REITH,ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. Seventy-five years ago the Commonwealth of Australia enacted a new Public Service Act. In spite of being amended on a piecemeal basis more than a hundred times, it has failed to keep up with changes in the character of public administration. It speaks to a bygone era in which employment powers were highly centralised; in which there was a preoccupation with process rather than results; in which every management action was prescribed and regulated; and in which enormous effort went into maintaining standard terms, conditions and classifications across the service, from telegraph boys to Treasury economists. The bill that I put before the parliament today proposes a modem act which speaks coherently to the future. In recent years public servants have sought to create a more flexible workplace environment and to devolve management responsibility. Unfortunately their creative efforts are all too frequently diverted into finding ways around the legislative restrictions that stymie them at every tum. The APS remains rulebound. The current act, for example, devotes about 30 pages to the processes of selection DIVISIONS and recruitment, 40 pages to dealing with misconduct and some 60 pages to addressing 'mobility' arrangements. This cascades down into a plethora of subordinate legislation. As a result of such prescriptive control, public servants and taxpayers both bear a heavy cost. Personnel decisions are slow, paper-driven and labour-intensive. Management is excessively legalistic and risk-averse. Innovation is stifled. Workplace flexibility is reduced. This cannot be allowed to continue. Reforming the Australian Public Service is a key element of our government's microeconomic reform agenda. The Australian people are entitled to see that the taxes they pay are used in the most efficient and effective manner and that the services they receive are of a high standard. This bill will make the service more efficient in its delivery both of policy advice to government and of programs to the public. It will promote higher performance in the APS by devolving management responsibility to individual agencies and, at the same time, ensure that public interest objectives are maintained through enhanced accountability. The previous government belatedly sought to address these issues. It set up a review of the Public Service Act (the MCLeod review), accepted most of its recommendations, undertook long negotiations with the public sector unions and, in the end, failed to act. No reforms were implemented before the government left office. Such inaction was not because the previous government failed to recognise the need for significant reform of the Australian Public Service. Indeed in a speech in July 1994 the then Minister for Finance, now Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Kim Beazley, foreshadowed that 'the Australian Public Service will be integrated into, and work in close alignment with the bre lder Australian community ... Commercialisation of government activities will continue. Competition will become a commonplace, in some cases through privatisation ... the Commonwealth public service will become a smaller ... elite service'. New legislation was seen as a key component of this change agenda. In speeches around Australia in October and November 1995 the then Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters, Gary Johns, emphasised that the 'introduction of a new Public Service Act provides us with an opportunity for the APS to be placed on a similar footing to the private sector.' His progress report on the new Public Service Act, tabled in this chamber in November 1995, argued that 'the parliament must establish a more contemporary employment framework for (the APS) to work within' and, to that end, 'proposed that secretaries and agency heads be given employment powers in their own right.' The bill I introduce today will complete that unfinished business. It builds on the good intentions of Mr Johns. But it will also do far more. It will guide the Commonwealth's system of public service into the next century. It provides a wholly new conceptual framework, a contemporary piece of legislation, which will enable the Australian Public Service to meet future challenges. However the bill is bolder than that proposed by the previous government in two key regards. First, it provides far greater freedom for public servants to manage their own workplaces. The system of industrial relations in this country has been transformed by the Workplace Relations Act 1996. While welike our predecessors-propose to put employment practices in the APS on a similar footing to the private sector, that footing is now set on a foundation of agreement-making between employers and employees at the enterprise level. It is an approach based on devolution and direct negotiation. In place of the old adversarial system both the private and public sectors are now encouraged to place emphasis on direct workplace relationships and mutual interest. Employers and employees are empowered to make decisions, including on wages and conditions, at the workplace. The half-hearted enterprise bargaining introduced to the APS by the previous government foundered on central control and third party negotiation. We will not allow that to happen. Heads of agencies and their staff will be able to sit down together and work out the systems, structures and conditions which are most appropriate to their own organisation and to set them down in Australian workplace agreements or certified agreements. Second, the bill I introduce has far more protection of the public interest. It is one thing to set down in legislation the values of public service; it is quite another to establish the mechanisms for review and evaluation which will ensure that they are upheld. This bill, unlike the proposals foreshadowed by the previous government, provides far greater power of review and investigation to the Public Service Commissioner, and far more scrutiny by the parliament. For the first time the Public Service Act will provide an effective legislative basis for public accountability. Let me emphasise that our government's approach to public service reform is not driven by ideology. It is a pragmatic response to getting better value from public funds. It is driven by the practical demands of modernising the service in the interests of the community. At present the costs of managing the APS are more than double that of best practice in the private sector. We seek to improve the relative performance of the Public Service by acknowledging the improvements that have already been made and addressing the manifest inefficiencies which remain. It is evolutionary change, although at a faster pace and on a broader front than the previous government was willing to countenance. Nor is reform the result of some deep seated antipathy to public servants. My personal experience is that Australian public servants are willing to work hard and conscientiously for the government of the day. It is the structure, systems and culture of the APS that need to be improved, not the commitment of individuals. Indeed, the bill I introduce is informed by the views of public servants themselves. Many thousands read the discussion paper Towards a best practice Australian Public Service, which I issued last November; over a thousand met in focus groups around the country to discuss it; some 250, mostly individual public servants, made submissions in response to it. I have personally conducted sessions in Melbourne, Adelaide, Sydney, Brisbane, Townsville and Canberra. I am pleased that Senators Cheryl Kernot and Lyn Allison were on occasion able to join me. Those we spoke with, mostly administrative service officers, were clear about the frustrations they felt in working within the present legislative framework. Most of them wanted change and they wanted it as soon as possible. It is my firm belief that the bill that I present will give them much of what they asked for. Certainly it will provide them with a far more rewarding environment in which to work. The bill has also been improved significantly by the contribution of union representatives. I have had more than 10 hours of meetings with the ACTU and public sector unions in the preparation of this bill. More than 30 changes have been made to the original draft as a consequence of their suggestions and our discussions. It has been a useful and constructive process of consultation which I intend to build upon in the months ahead. Although I have introduced the bill now in order to seek passage by the end of next sitting, I anticipate that the unions will tinue to playa positive role as we develop the subordinate legislation-the regulations and commissioner directions-before they are introduced to parliament. Both the regulations and directions will be disallowable instruments. One strong and recurrent message that has emerged in the discussions I have had both with groups of public servants and with the public sector unions is a wish to ensure that the traditional ethos, conduct and values of public service are preserved. This bill does this-and more. It sets out the public interest, and reinforces the values of the public service, in a way that has never been done before. To achieve maximum workplace flexibility while maintaining a high level of public accountability, the Public Service bill establishes an interlocking framework of powers and responsibilities, integrated within a genuinely devolved managerial environment. The bill articulates the distinctive character of Australia's public service and parliament's expectation of it in a way that is entirely absent from the present act. It sets out the core features of the APS and enshrines and protects them through legislation. They can be modified in the future only through the parliamentary process. The bill explicitly acknowledges that the APS is to be apolitical, fulfilling its functions in an impartial, non-partisan and professional manner. For the first time, legislation will prevent ministers interfering in individual staffing decisions. Secretaries of departments will be required to uphold 11 key values of public service. They will be held accountable for the manner in which they exercise administrative power. Merit will remain a cornerstone of public service. The employment decisions for which secretaries are responsible must be made without nepotism, patronage, administrative favouritism or political influence. Merit, of course, is difficult to define. In discussions with me, the Women's Electoral Lobby has suggested that the most appropriate definition to adopt is that of the CCH Australian & New Zealand Equal Opportunity Law con- and Practice; namely, 'the relationship between a person's job-related qualities and those genuinely required for performance in particular positions'. I agree that this needs to be reflected as the standard agency heads employ when seeking the person most suitable for a position, and it is being considered in the context of the definition to be set out in the commissioner's direction. As the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has made clear on a number of occasions, ogovernment wants to provide a. wo!kpllU;e m.:r which public servants offer adVIce I.n a fra--i:I fearless and honest manner-and, having done so, implement the decisions of the government of the day in a professional mannel To ensure the independence of its most senior advisers, secretaries, the traditional methods of selection will continue. The Prime Minister will make appointments only after receiving advice from the head of his own department or, with respect to that position, from the Public Service Commissioner. The bill also requires secretaries to ensure that they maintain a workplace free of discrimination. Indeed, it goes considerably further. Each department will be required to have in place a workplace diversity program. This is intended to ensure that there is equal employment opportunity and that workplace practices are flexible enough to enable staff to balance their work and family responsibilities. We want to ensure that the APS reflects the face of the Australian community it serves, but, equally, we want to provide a better working environment to those who provide the service. It is not only secretaries who will be held accountable for maintaining the highest standards of honesty. Unlike the 1922 act, the bill I present today includes a code of conduct for all public servants. This will ensure that the code is legally enforceable and strengthens its value as a public statement of the standards of behaviour expected of those who work in the public service. While you cannot legislate for integrity you can establish a legislative environment in which it is nurtured. The bill will set out the public interest. will also provide new mechanisms for its protection. To this end the powers and independence of the Public Service Commissioner are to be considerably enhanced. The commissioner will be required to uphold the traditional ethos of public service, ensure appropriate standards of behaviour for public servants and maintain public confidence in the way they do their business. The bill provides the commissioner with considerable powers to review, evaluate and make recommendations on APS employment policies or practices, either at the minister's request or at her or his own instigation. Under the bill, the commissioner will issue directions to secretaries to ensure that employment decisions are based on merit and fairness. Agency heads and APS employees will be required to comply with these directions, as well as with the APS values and code of conduct. The commissioner will also be required to report to parliament each year on the state of the Australian Public Service. She or he will be able to report at any other time on particular matters that are deemed to warrant it, and have the same strong inquiry powers proposed by our government for the Auditor-General. This enhancement of the commissioner's ability to protect the public interest is something which the previous government was unwilling to embrace. In a recent letter to the Canberra Times (6 June 1997), the former Public Service Commissioner under the previous government, Mr Denis Ives, noted how welcome was our government's intention to strengthen the role and powers of that office. According to Mr Ives, an 'expansion of the powers of the Public Service Commissioner was canvassed at the time of the MCLeod committee but was generally opposed within government at that time'. He recognises that the reforms introduced by our government, unlike those previously contemplated, 'will go a long way towards ensuring a more satisfactory and balanced framework of accountability and integrity for the future'. The importance of the role of parliament in scrutinising the administration of the APS is acknowledged in this bill. It requires the It independence of parliament and those who work for it. The operations of the parliamentary departments are presently covered by the Public Service Act. This is not appropriate. Staff in the parliamentary departments owe their allegiance to parliament rather than to the government. There is a need to protect the independence of the presiding officers, singly and jointly, as employing authorities. This can best be done by establishing a separate statutory regime for those who work in the parliamentary departments. The bill makes provision for the creation of bodies to be known as executive agencies. This will provide a more satisfactory arrangement than the present use of section 67 of the constitution where the government wishes to establish an organisation with a degree of separateness from a minister's department and where no statutory powers are required to be exercised. The bill will enable public servants to seek a review of employment decisions. By regulation, all agencies will be required to have in place review mechanisms which afford due process and procedural fairness to those who complain that they have been treated unfairly. To the greatest extent possible, it is intended that these workplace grievances will be resolved at the workplace level. That is the basis of good employee relations in a devolved environment. However, the regulations will also establish a process of external review for those occasions on which grievances cannot be satisfactorily settled within agencies. An APS employee is entitled to seek review of actions that relate to his or her employment. The commissioner who upholds Public Service values and conduct, and who sets the standards expected of employers, will now have the power to investigate breaches of them and to make recommendations on how they should be addressed. Instead of the present complicated and convoluted processes, which have made decision-making legalistic and time-consuming, streamlined arrangements will be set in place. There is no longer a need for a separate statutory office holder nor, indeed, for additional legislation. The bill I put before honourable members replaces not only the Public Service Act 1922 but the Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act 1984. That latter act will now be repealed. I am pleased that the President of the Administrative Review Council, Professor Marcia Neave, has supported access to external review as a mechanism for upholding the merit principle. 'In particular,' she notes letter to the Public Service Commissioner on 30 May 1997, 'the Council supports the proposal that the Public Service Commissioner will be able to report to the minister or parliament on a grievance matter that has not been satisfactorily resolved or an investigation carried out either on the Commissioner's own motion or at the request of a minister or Secretary. ' The powers of review are to be extended in one crucial regard. Until now public interest whistleblowers in the APS have not had an established mechanism to hear allegations of misconduct within the service. To remedy that defect, our government will ensure that where whistIeblowers are dissatisfied with the response of their own agencies, they may ask the commissioner to investigate. Equally important, the bill provides whistleblowers with legislative protection against victimisation or discrimination. This bill considerably enhances accountability. It acknowledges and protects the public interest as never before. It considerably improves parliamentary scrutiny of the way the Australian Public Service undertakes its delegated responsibilities on behalf of government. It recognises and protects the distinctive ethos of public administration. It provides a foundation for a service in which actions and decisions are open and transparent. At the same time, it encourages the APS to take on the best practices of contemporary management, public or private, Australian or overseas. It provides the legislative underpinning for continuous improvement in the way the Public Service manages public funds. Greater devolution is crucial to success. The bill places employment powers with secretaries. Part 4 of the bill makes it clear that agency heads, on behalf of the Commonwealth, wield all the rights, duties and powers of an employer. Agency heads will be given the power, on behalf of the Commonwealth, to engage persons as employees. Within the law, it is they who will determine many of the conditions which attach to employment. It is they who will determine the remuneration and other terms of employment. It is they who in a will assign duties or terminate employment. The vast majority of provisions in the current Public Service Act will no longer be required. Detailed control over matters such as transfer, promotion, advancement, suspension leave of absence, mobility and re-integration will be removed. So, too, will most of the provisions relating to the management of misconduct, discipline and performance. These are matters that are best resolved at the workplace level. In exercising their employment powers, agency heads will continue to be supported by a senior executive service able to provide high level policy advice and professional leadership both within and across agencies. Responsibility for the appointment of these executives will now be devolved to agency heads although, in order to ensure that decisions are made on the basis of merit, the commissioner will issue directions on appropriate selection processes. There will be those who seek to characterise these changes as diminishing the fairness with which employees are treated in the APS. This is, of course, a nonsense. The new act will not erode the position of employees in terms of dealing with their employer. They will have access to the same protections in dealing with their employer as apply to the rest of the Australian work force under the Workplace Relations Act. In addition, they will be managed under an umbrella of APS values which guard their rights. Indeed, the devolution of employment powers will provide public servants with far greater freedom than they have ever enjoyed before. The conditions of their employment will be tailored to the particular circumstances of their own workplace without unnecessary legislative restriction or central regulation. Devolution will ensure that the rhetoric of public service values becomes reality. Employers and employees will be required to work together to establish a fair, flexible, and rewarding workplace. Devolving employment decisions will provide a firm foundation for cooperative workplace relations based on genuine consultation and direct communication. Each individual agency-indeed, each distinct workplace-will have the opportunity and incentive to become a model employer. The Prime Minister and public service minister will continue to have appropriate powers to ensure that the interests of the service as a whole are protected. The public service minister, for example, may, subject to the application of awards and agreements, determine the remuneration and other conditions of service where it is desirable because of special circumstances. The minister may also make rules about the classification of APS employees. These powers will ensure that an effective balance can be struck between devolution to agencies and service-wide cohesion. Similarly, the Public Service Commissioner will retain the power to compulsorily transfer employees between agencies where they are excess or where it is required in order to give effect to machinery of government changes. The bill that I put before the parliament today is distinguished by its brevity. In length it represents only about five per cent of the legislation which it replaces. Equally important, it is written in a clear and easy style. In my view, it should be required reading for all those who seek a career in the Australian Public Service. It sets out for them their rights and obligations, the values to which they should aspire and the conduct which parliament expects of them. The bill is also distinguished by its balance. It balances enhanced accountability for the public interest with devolved responsibility for the private interests of employees. The framework within which the conditions of employment in the APS are set will be similar to that in the private sector, but accountability for the conduct of that employment will recognise the distinctive character and ethos of the public sector. The new Public Service Bill provides a succinct message about the expectations of a public service within a democratic system of safe governance in a form appropriate to the twenty-first century. It articulates the essential qualities that are necessary to maintain public confidence in the integrity of the public service; recognises the need for an employment framework which is likely to provide best value for public funds; and establishes the means to ensure that the conduct of public servants is open to scrutiny. In short, for the first time we have a Public Service bill which explicitly focuses on public accountability for the public interest. I inform the House that the bill, together with the Public Employment (Consequential and Transitional) Amendment Bill, will be referred to the Joint Committee on Public Accounts for review. I envisage that the committee may report on both bills on or before Thursday, 4 September 1997. In concluding, I also wish to pay tribute to the many people who have contributed to the preparation, drafting and the like of this particular important piece of legislation. Whilst many have been involved, I particularly note and thank for their contributions Mr Peter Richards, the chief of staff in my office, who has worked tirelessly to bring this legislation to the parliament, and also Dr Peter Shergold, the Public Service Commissioner, and all who work with him, on the good work that they have done to date in bringing this bill to fruition. I commend the bill to the House, and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Lee) adjourned.

216,Mr REITH,PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT,"Flinders-Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service) (5.03 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The Public Employment (Consequential and Transitional) Amendment Bill 1997 deals with the consequential and transitional matters arising from the proposed repeal of the Public Service Act 1922 and its replacement by the legislation set out in the Public Service Bill 1997. With the establishment of the new legal framework for APS employees set out in the Public Service Bill, certain provisions will be necessary: - to enable the transition from the old to the new employment framework; - to validate actions and decisions taken under the former legislation; and - to make consequential amendments to the extensive range of legislation which incorporates references to the Public Service Act 1922. The transitional provisions fall into three broad areas. First, it is necessary to set in place conversion arrangements for those who work in the APS. With the removal of the concept of office for APS staff and the creation of a single employment category, officers and employees covered by the existing act are converted to employees in their corresponding agencies with their corresponding classifications. Fixed-term secretaries to departments under the old act will become secretaries of their corresponding departments under the new act. Similarly, the person holding office as the Public Service Commissioner under the existing act will become the Public Service Commissioner under the new act as if he had been appointed under the new act. Second, as the Public Service Bill 1997 is primarily principles based, there are some conditions covered by the Public Service Act 1997 1922 that require transitional arrangements because they will no longer be regulated in the same way. The most important of these are the arrangements governing the rights of return of staff who have left the APS to take up nonAPS public employment. The current, very complex, legislative conditions represent a considerable liability for APS agencies. They will be replaced, subject to appropriate transitional arrangements, with a simpler model under which agency heads will agree to extend unpaid leave to employees to take up such employment where this is in the interest of the APS. There will also be appropriate arrangements for the parliamentary departments pending the development of their own legislation. Third, there is a need to provide for the continuation of processes already set in train. Action may have commenced under the Public Service Act 1922 or the Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) !""--ct 1984 that will not be completed by the tlme the new Public Service Act is proclaitnediJ-. I refer to matters such as appointments, promotions, suspensions, transfers and advancements, as well as to appeals, grievances and other reviews of employment decisions. To enable action to be completed, regulations will be made to ensure the continuation of those processes after the new act is proclaimed. The validation of actions and decisions taken under the former legislation will be largely dealt with in regulations. With respect to the consequential amendments, the acts specified in schedule 1 to this bill will be amended or repealed as set out in that schedule. The amendments can be divided into the following categories: - changes in the current provisions relating to staffing to reflect the new employment framework; - removal of obsolete references to the Public Service Board; - consequential amendments to the superannuation legislation, but without any changes in the operation of the schemes; - changes to the role of the Remuneration Tribunal in relation to the remuneration and allowances for secretaries; - removal of cross-references to reciprocal mobility, which will now be dealt with by directions by the Public Service Commissioner; - Iemoval of references to the old mobility arrangements set out in part IV of the Public Service Act 1922; - standard translations for common terms in the old act; and - other miscellaneous amendments to ensure appropriate links to the new APS employment framework. The bill also deals with the consequences of devolving the arrangements for setting the salaries of the Senior Executive Service (SES). The link of the remuneration of members of parliament with the SES band 2 minimum salary will be replaced by a link to the classification structure created by the Remuneration Tribunal for certain statutory offices. It is not intendl!d to increase the level of remuneration. Subject to any special requirements in relation to particular consequential amendments, this bill will commence on the same day as the Public Service Act 1997. Where this bill amends an act which has not yet commenced, the amending provision in the schedule"" to this bill will commence immediately after the commencement of that other act. Where this bill amends a section in another act and the section has not yet commenced, the amending provision in the schedule to this bill will commence immediately after the commencement of that amended section. The proposed amendments have no financial impact. Collectively, the arrangements proposed in this bill will provide the necessary certainty and continuity of administrative and management arrangements for the Australian Public Service. They will enable an orderly devolution of employment powers in the APS and a transition to a less regulated workplace. I commend the bill to the House, and present the explanatory memorandum.

217,Mr REITH,WORKPLACE RELATIONS,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill is intended to ensure that small businesses are exempted from the federal unfair dismissal provisions, in respect of new employees. This exemption is necessary and appropriate, given the special features of small business-and it is necessary, to ensure continuing growth in employment in small business. Members will be aware that the government's commitment to an unfair dismissal exemption for small business was announced on 24 March 1997, as part of the government's small business statement. Members will also be aware that a regulation was made under the Workplace Relations Act 1996 to give effect to such an exemption which was to take effect from 1 July 1997. This bill is introduced today to give effect to the government's intentions because that regulation was disallowed this morning by the Senate. As the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said in launching the government's small business statement, helping small business to grow, employ, export and invest in Australia's future has been a top priority for the government since its first day in office. The government's economic and industrial relations policies are central to its agenda for the growth and development of the small business sector-and the government is also committed to tackling the impediments to small business imposed by unnecessary government regulation and paperwork, as set out in the small business statement. The government has, of course, already made substantial progress in labour market reform, which is and will be of particular benefit to small business. The Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Act 1996 has changed the federal industrial relations system, and the relationship between federal and state industrial relations systems, providing small business with greater opportunities to develop industrial relations arrangeyear's ments best suited to their individual circumstances. In particular, small business employers have new opportumtIes to make direct agreements with their employees. Small businesses that choose to remain in the award system are benefiting from a simplified and more flexible system; small businesses now have greater certainty with respect to industrial action within their business; the Employment Advocate has been given a specific charter to assist small business. Of course, unfair dismissal was one of the most important industrial relations issues for small business, prior to the last election. Our commitment, in Better pay for better work, was to introduce a new unfair dismissal scheme, which would recognise the circumstances facing small business: and we have done this. The new system is more balanced and fair to both employers and employees. It is less legalistic and costly, with an emphasis on conciliation. Employers are protected from frivolous and malicious claims by the requirement for a filing fee and access to costs where a claim is vexatious. In considering unfair dismissal claims, the Australian Industrial Relations Commission has to consider a range of factors, including the possible effect of any order on the viability of the employer's business. These changes are important-but they have not gone far enough, for small business. It is an unavoidable fact that the defence of an unfair dismissal claim, however groundless, is especially burdensome for small businesses. In many larger businesses, expertise and resources can be put into recruitment and termination procedures. Small businesses have no such resources. Even attendance of witnesses at a hearing can bring a small business to a standstill. The government has been listening to the concerns of small businesses, their experiences of the impact of unfair dismissal claimsparticularly under the previous government's provisions-and their fears that the simple fact of employing someone makes them vulnerable to unfair dismissal claims. The government was mindful of all of these concerns and fears in the development of last legislation: the issu- wa- amo-gst th-se raised in the government S dISCUSSIons - Ith the Australian Democrats, and the scope for additional exemptions, by the regulations, was always there, as part and parcel of the act's provisions on termination of employment. Section 170CC of the act allows for exclusion of 'employees in relation to whom the operation of the provisions causes or would cause substantial problems because of ... the size or nature of the undertakings in which they are employed'. And this language is drawn directly from the International Labour Organisation's Termination of Employment Convention, 1982, which expressly allows exclusions of this type. Our announcement of the small business exclusion on 24 March 1997 was welcomed by small business. Rob Bastion of the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia said: That's obviously the jewel in the crown ... the one which will actually create jobs ... I'm certain of it' . And this is the crucial point-this exemption is not just about removing a burden from small business, it is about the positive employment benefits of the expanded job opportunities that will surely result from the removal of that burden. I tum now to the terms of the bill itself. The exemption is to commence on royal assent. However, it will not affect existing employees. As it is intended to encourage new employment, the exclusion will only apply to employees who are first engaged by the relevant employer after the commencement of the amendment. The exemption is from the federal unfair dismissal provisions, only. Employees will still be protected by the Workplace Relations Act. Section 170CK protects employees against dismissal because of any discriminatory reason. Sections 170MU and 170WE prohibit dismissal of an employee because the employee engages in protected industrial action, seeking a certified agreement or in AW A industrial action. Section 298K in the freedom of association part of the act prohibits dismissal which involves victimisation or is otherwise contrary to freedom of association. Section 170CM prohibits dismissal without 1-5 weeks notice (depending on the employee's length of service and age), or pay in lieu, except in cases of serious misconduct. The exemption also does not affect the rights of apprentices in small businesses, who have a particular need for protection, given the additional impact that any break in the continuity of their employment may have in terms of attainment of qualifications. This bill will not affect existing rights in this regard. The exemption applies only to businesses employing 15 or fewer employees. This size of small business was chosen because of the precedent provided by the Employment Protection Act 1982 (NSW), which was introduced by the Wran Government and followed by the then Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in the 1984 Termination, Change and Redundancy Test Case. An exemption for businesses of this size will benefit a substantial proportion of all businesses in the federal jurisdiction but will not that is cover too many businesses of such size and complexity that they are likely to have a separate management structure, which would facilitate defence of unfair dismissal claims. The bill provides that, in counting the number of employees in a business, casual employees are only to be counted if they have been engaged on a regular and systematic basis for at least 12 months. The intention of this exclusion is to reflect the fact that a business which occasionally engages additional casual employees is not necessarily a large business. This bill will have no significant impact on Commonwealth expenditure. I commend the government's proposals to the House and I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill. Debate (on motion by Mr Lee) adjourned. NA NA NA First Reading Bill presented by Mr Reith, and read a first time. Second Reading",105
218,Mr REITH,BILL,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill makes a number of technical amendments to the Workplace Relations Act 1996 (the WR Act) and other legislation. The amendments are aimed at clarifying existing provisions and ensuring that they operate in the manner originally intended by the legislation. The bill also corrects some minor drafting anomalies and oversights. These minor changes will give appropriate effect to the major reforms which have been achieved through the enactment of the Workplace Relations Act. The act is delivering genuine flexibility and choice at the workplace level. Over 1600 new agreements have been certified, including 47 agreements made directly between employers and employees, and over 500 Australian workplace agreements have been approved. The act is better balanced than its predecessors and reinforces a stronger sense of the rights and responsibilities of participants in the system. Section 127 of the act is providing an effective remedy to prevent and stop illegitimate industrial action, with over 100 applications for section 127 orders being dealt with by the commission to date. Substantial progress has been made towards harmonisation of federal and state systems through complementary legislation and a cooperative approach to administrative arrangements and service delivery. The scope for our reforms to continue to bring about the productivity improvements which are necessary to underpin sustainable economic growth will be further enhanced by the technical amendments proposed in this bill. Awards and arbitration-Part VI of the WRAct The bill clarifies the limitation on the commission's capacity to exercise its arbitral powers during a bargaining period for a proposed certified agreement. The legislation limits the commission's power to arbitrate during a bargaining period in relation to matters at issue between bargaining parties. The fundamental objective is for the parties to reach agreement without arbitration. The commission should not arbitrate, for example, in relation to a claim for a new allowance to be paid if that is at issue during bargaining. However, a possible unintended consequence of limiting access to arbitration is that it may prevent the commission from varying an award to include a ""safety net wage adjustment"" to give effect to the national wage case safety net decisions where bargaining periods have been initiated and wages are an issue between the parties. The bill therefore amends the Workplace Relations Act 1996 to make clear that the limitation on arbitration during a bargaining period does not prevent the commission from exercising its arbitral powers to deal with an application to vary an award to include a safety net wage adjustment. The bill also clarifies the status of awards made under section 170MX of the act, making clear that they are enforceable in the same manner as other awards. It also makes clear that, where awards are simplified by the commission during the award simplification process, any provision which has been included in a simplified award because it is incidental and necessary for the effective operation of the award does not cease to have effect at the end of the simplification interim period. Certified Agreements-Part vm of the WR Act The bill addresses two issues which have emerged during the operation of the certified agreement provisions of the act. Firstly, the bill clarifies the time limit allowed for applications to be lodged for the certification of an agreement. Secondly, it makes clear that the 14 day period provided to employees to consider a certified agreement does not have to start again if an employer takes on new staff during the approval period. Any new starters will, of course, have to have the effect of agreement explained to them and be provided with a copy of the agreement, but the amendment will avoid the delays and unnecessary expense which would result if the approval period were to start again from scratch. The Employment Advocate and Australian Workplace Agreements-Parts IVA & VID of the WR Act Also included in the bill are some procedural amendments aimed at facilitating the smooth operation of the Australian workplace agreement (AW A) provisions. - ese - h-ges include an extension to the tIme lImit for lodging AW As and empowering the EmplOyment Advocate to waive strict compliance with the technical requirements relating to the filing of AWAs. The time limit for lodging AW As with the Employment Advocate is to be extended from 14 to 21 days, recognising that a 14 day limit might be difficult to meet, especially where the parties are in rural centres. Provision will also be made for the Employment Advocate to waive strict compliance with the technical filing requirements for AW As and ancillary documents. The advocate will have to be satisfied that the waiver would not disadvantage a party to the AW A. In the absence of such a waiver, the Employment Advocate has had to return a number of AWAs lodged to date because the applications failed in some minor way to meet the filing requirements. The amendment will not affect the substantive requirements to be met by an AW A. There will still need to be a strict compliance with the substantive requirements, such as the provisions relating to the no-disadvantage test and genuine consent. The amendment provides only for defects of a technical nature to be waived. This will avoid the waste of time and resources involved in correcting minor defects whilst ensuring that the interests of AW A parties are protected. The bill also corrects some anomalies in the provision dealing with the right of entry and powers of authorised officers of the Employment Advocate. At present, authorised officers who are investigating possible freedom of association breaches can only enter premises where they believe relevant documents may be located. By contrast, authorised officers investigating AW A breaches and Department of Industrial Relations inspectors investigating breaches of awards or certified agreements may enter premises where relevant work is being performed and interview employees without being limited to premises where documents may be held. The bill corrects this anomaly by providing for authorised officers to enter places of business for the purpose of interviewing persons in connection with possible breaches of the freedom of association provisions of the act. As is the case with the existing rights of entry, the new provision does not allow access to premises used for residential purposes, and the right to interview does not empower an authorised officer to compel a person to answer questions. No-Disadvantage Test-Part VIE of the WRAct The bill also amends the process by which the designated awards can be determined by the commission and the employment advocate for the purpose of applying the no-disadvantage test to agreements. The act presently provides that where there is no award covering the work of employees who are to be covered by a certified agreement or AWA, the commission or the advocate, as the case requires, is to 'designate' an appropriate federal award for the purpose of applying the no-disadvantage test to the agreement. The bill will allow the commission or the advocate to designate a state award as the benchmark for the no-disadvantage test where there is no federal award covering work of the same kind as that performed by the employees whose work is to be subject to an agreement. Termination of Employment-Part VIA of the WR Act The bill clarifies the application of state laws in relation to termination of employment of an employee covered by a federal award or agreement. It also ensures that there is consistency in the time limits for making applications in respect of termination of employment, and makes it clear that each of the various types of application relating to termination of employment may be discontinued. Provision is also made for the maximum amount of compensation which may be awarded in respect of an unfair dismissal or unlawful termination of employment to be calculated by reference to the amount of remuneration to which the applicant was entitled for the previous six months. At present the act provides for the compensation limit to be calculated by reference to the amount received by the employee during the preceding six months with the employer. The proposed amendment will benefit employees by ensuring that the compensation limit is calculated by reference to the amount which an employee was entitled to receive, if that amount would be higher than the amount actually received. Freedom of Association-Part XA of the WRAct The bill ensures that an agreement may not be certified when it includes a provision inconsistent with the freedom of association provisions of the Workplace Relations Act. This provision is required primarily because some unions are seeking to include preference clauses in agreements. The freedom of association provisions of the act prohibit discrimination based on membership or non-membership of a union, and render preference clauses void and of no effect. However, some unions still cling to the past and want such clauses included in certified agreements. Leaving aside the futility of such an exercise, there is a real risk that some employers and employees may mistakenly take these void clauses at face value, disadvantaging employees and breaching the act in the process. It is therefore essential that agreements containing preference clauses are not certified and, for the same reasons, provisions in existing awards and agreements which breach the freedom of association provisions should be removed. Provision is therefore also made for awards and agreements to be varied, on application, to remove void preference clauses. Registered Organisations-Part IX of the WRAct The bill also amends the provisions of the Workplace Relations Act dealing with dis amalgamation of organisations. As presently drafted, the definitions provision relating to dum. withdrawal from an amalgamated organisation refers to only one of the two methods by which organisations could amalgamate under the act and, as a consequence, it has unintentionally excluded some organisations and branches from access to disamalgamation. The bill corrects this defect to ensure that the dis amalgamation scheme will be able to operate as it was intended. The bill also makes provision to allow an application for a disamalgamation ballot made before the amendments take effect to proceed without the need to reapply to the Federal Court. Matters referred by Victoria-Part XV of the WR Act The bilI clarifies the provision dealing with access to AW As for Victorian employees, and clarifies the successor provisions for certified agreements and AW As binding on Victorian employers. Other legislation Minor technical amendments to the Navigation Act 1912, the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988, the Seafarers Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1992, the Superannuation Act 1976 and the Superannuation Act 1990 are also proposed. These amendments arise as a consequence of the removal of agreements from the definition of 'award' in the Workplace Relations Act. Consultation The proposed amendments have been discussed with the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry through the National Labour Consultative Council's committee on industrial legislation, and the bilI includes amendments suggested by the ACTU and ACC!. The ACCI has indicated its support for the amendments and, for the most part, the amendments are not opposed by the ACTU. This bill is technical in nature. Its purpose is to make some minor clarifications and corrections to make sure that the act operates as intended. The changes will assist employers, employees and their organisations by making some minor procedural improvements and providing greater certainty about the operation of the act.

219,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,WHEAT MARKETING AMENDMENT,"I mo.-!, That the bill be now read a second tilJlO':., The restructure of the Australian Wheat Board brings to fruition a process dating back to 1989 aimed at putting ownership and control of wheat marketing firmly in growers' hands. This will enable industry to control its own future without the restrictions of government control and regulation. I am pleased to acknowledge that the restructure of the Australian Wheat Board has been driven by the grains industry.The push for change started in 1989, when industry commenced building up funds for a capital base for a future growerowned Australian Wheat Board via a levy on wheat sales, paid into the wheat industry fund. In 1991 at the Grains 2000 conference, industry, through the Grains Council of Australia, recognised that the Australian Wheat Board needed greater flexibility to be best able to respond to changes in internationment al marketing in order to compete successfully and maximise returns to growers. Further, the industry acknowledged that a marketing structure that is fully commercially driven is best achieved if it is owned and controlled by industry rather than by government. In 1992, the wheat industry entered into a compact with the then government for change. Specifically, the industry agreed that government underwriting of Australian Wheat Board borrowings should cease in 1999 and for the wheat industry fund to continue to be built up over that period towards a target figure of between $500 million and $550 million. It was decided that $500 million to $550 million would provide sufficient backing for the Australian Wheat Board to borrow the funds it requires to make harvest payments to growers without a government guarantee. It would also fund other Australian Wheat Board activities such as domestic grain trading and value adding activities in grain storage and processing overseas. At Grains Week in April 1996, industry and government agreed that wheat marketing arrangements post-1999 should be based on the objectives of grower ownership and control, self-reliance and a fully commercial approach to marketing. At that same time, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) asked industry to develop a plan which would ensure that this goal would be met. To assist in this, a Grains Council of Australia, Australian Wheat Board and Department of Primary Industries and Energy working group was formed to facilitate industry consideration of possible restructuring. The membership of the group included representatives from all Grains Council of Australia state affiliate organisations so that growers would have the opportunity to put forward their views. Further, to provide stability throughout the restructuring process, the government reiterated its commitment to retain the export monopoly and for the national competition policy review to be delayed until 1999-2000. After much consultation and deliberation, in March 1997 the working group put to governan agreed framework for a new structure. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy is pleased that the government has readily been able to accept this framework, which he announced at Grains Week in April 1997. From 1 July 1999, wheat marketing will be undertaken not by the current statutory Australian Wheat Board but by a grower owned and controlled company operating under Corporations Law. The company will assume responsibility for all commercial aspects of wheat marketing, including financing and operation of wheat pools. The new organisation will comprise a holding company with two subsidiaries: a pooling subsidiary and a domestic trading subsidiary. Shares in the holding company will be issued in two classes: one A-class share will be issued to each grower and the wheat industry fund will be converted to Bclass shares and B-class shares will be issued to wheat industry fund equity holders on the basis of one share for every unit in the wheat industry fund and will provide the company's capital base. A-class shares will be issued only to wheat growers. They will be non-transferable and redeemed as holders leave the industry or fail to qualify as a wheat grower. A-class shares will confer voting rights to elect the majority of directors of the holding company, and hence control of the holding company. They will not attract dividends or other returns. As the providers of equity, B-class shareholders will have the right to elect a minority of directors. B-class shareholders will receive a commercial rate of return and B-class shares will only be tradeable amongst growers until the outcome of the national competition policy review of the export monopoly. To achieve this structure by 1 July 1999, the restructuring of the Australian Wheat Board will require legislative change in two stages, now and in 1998. This bill represents stage 1. Before outlining in detail the key elements of the bill, so that there can be no doubt, let me make clear that the amendments contained in this bill in no way threaten the security of the export monopoly-it will continue to be enshrined in the legislation. The export monopoly is a fundamental part of both National Party policy and coalition policy. Until 30 June 1999, responsibility for the export monopoly will rest with the Australian Wheat Board. Thereafter, the export monopoly will continue to be provided for in legislation. An independent regulatory mechanism will also be established to manage and monitor the performance of the export monopoly. Turning now to the bill itself, it addresses the following key areas: the transitional provisions to apply until 30 June 1999; the cessation of the wheat industry fund levy in 1999; and, the composition of the board of the Australian Wheat Board. Transitional Provisions to Apply Until 30 June 1999 In broad terms, the transitional provisions of the bill provide for the redistribution of current Australian Wheat Board functions between the Australian Wheat Board, a new holding company, and two subsidiaries-a pooling and domestic trading subsidiary. In the bill, the companies are referred to as 'Company A', 'Company B' and 'Company 'C' respectively. The holding company will be a wholly owned subsidiary of the Australian Wheat Board. It will be this company which in 1999 will become the grower owned and controlled company, with a capital base provided by the wheat industry fund and distributed as shares to growers. The purpose of the new company structure is to allow the holding company, as the future grower owned company, to develop an operational and financial track record over the next two years. It will be able to develop its own identity in international capital markets so that it can be competitive in the marketplace for borrowing in its own right for its activities from 1 July 1999. The structure also addresses a key concern of growers by providing for a distinct separation of wheat pooling activities from other trading activities. The objective is for the holding company and its associated subsidiaries to be operational by 1 October 1997 to allow the future grower owned company the maximum amount of time possible to develop a track record. From 1 October 1997, the operating functions of the Australian Wheat Board will be reduced. In essence, the primary functions of the Australian Wheat Board will be management of the export monopoly, management of the wheat industry fund, and overseeing the activities of its subsidiary, the holding company. The Australian Wheat Board will be accountable to both industry and parliament for performance of these functions. The holding company will be a commercial company operating under Corporations Law. It will assume the overarching responsibility for the pooling and commercial operations of the current Australian Wheat Board, including trade in wheat and grain and value adding activities. The pooling operations will be carried out by company B. The bill provides for the holding company to undertake borrowings, on behalf of its pools subsidiary, for the purpose of pool related payments, with such borrowings to be guaranteed by the Commonwealth until 1999. The holding company will also establish a domestic trading subsidiary, company C, to carry out the grain trading functions currently undertaken by the Australian Wheat Board. A number of other details relating to the holding company and its subs-diaries, incl-d­ ing their memorandum and articles of assoclation, are yet to be settled by industry, the future owners of the companies. To meet the expected 1 October 1997 commencement date, industry is working to a strict timetable. Government, however, as the guarantor of the pool related borrowings until 1999, must also be satisfied with the fine detail. To ensure that the wheat industry fund reaches its target of $550 million in 1999 and provides a sound capital base for the new company, the tax provisions of the Wheat Marketing Act 1989 will continue to apply. Specifically, the operations of the Australian Wheat Board, the wheat industry fund and the pooling subsidiary will continue to be free from income tax until 30 June 1999. However, consistent with the government's competitive neutrality policy, normal income tax arrangements will apply to non-pooling activities. Cessation of the wheat industry fund levy The bill provides for the cessation of the wheat industry fund component of the levy on 30 June 1999. The wheat industry fund now stands at around $430 million, and there is a possibility it could exceed $550 million in mid 1999 if current strong prices and production levels continue. The financial consultants advise that the wheat industry fund of $550 million would allow the new company to fund the current range and level of services provided by the Australian Wheat Board. The second phase of legislati ve change, to be introduced in 1998, will provide that on 1 July 1999, ten years after the commencement of the wheat industry fund, equity in the fund will be transferred to growers, the rightful owners, in the form of B class shares in the holding company. Composition of the Board of the Australian Wheat Board The bill provides for amendment to various sections of the Wheat Marketing Act 1989 relating to the Board of the Australian Wheat Board. Specifically, current members will continue to serve on the board until November 1998, when their present term of appointment expires. Thereafter, the bill provides for the appointment of not more than 11 members to the board. In light of the reduced functions of the Australian Wheat Board from 1 October 1997, and to provide maximum flexibility in the appointments process in November 1998, the bill does not specify the actual size of the board, only a maximum. Further, given that there will be only a seven-month period during which new members will need to be appointed, a selection committee process will not be required. The rationale behind this is simply to minimise the costs, ultimately borne by growers, associated with appointments. However, in making appointments to the board, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy must consult with industry, through the President of the Grains Council of Australia. In keeping with the current legislation, the minister must also ensure that among the members there is a balance of skills in the areas of production, marketing and finance. Conclusion The final step towards a Corporations Law company under grower ownership and control will be taken in 1998 by way of a second package of legislation. The primary focus of the legislation will be the transfer of the wheat industry fund into growers' hands, its rightful owners. It will also provide for the stripping away of all the commercial provisions for wheat marketing which will not be needed after an independent, grower owned company assumes these functions in 1999. Thereafter, the restrictive, paternalistic role of government will cease and the destiny of the industry will be placed firmly in growers' hands. From 1 July 1999, the industry will stand on its own two feet. The only government involvement will be in relation to the export monopoly. The amendments contained in this bill, and those to be introduced next year, finalise the restructure of wheat marketing and will stand industry in good stead for the future as an internationally competitive industry which continues to make a significant contribution to the Australian and rural economies. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Lee) adjourned. NA First Reading Bill presented by Mr Bruce Scott, for Mr Anderson, and read a first time. Second Reading",109
220,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,SNOWY HYDRO CORPORA TISA TION,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. There are two bills in the legislation package which will corporatise the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority: the Snowy Hydro Corporatisation Bill 1997; and the Snowy Hydro Corporatisation (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1997. The Snowy Hydro Corporatisation Bill 1997 gives effect to an agreement between the Commonwealth, New South Wales and Victorian governments to establish a new company to operate and maintain the Snowy Mountains scheme-Snowy Hydro Limited. The Snowy Hydro Corporatisation (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1997 repeals and amends various acts of parliament arising from the termination of the existing legislation. This legislation complements corporatisation legislation introduced into the New South Wales parliament on 29 May 1997 and legislation expected to be introduced into the Victorian parliament in September 1997. The Snowy Mountains authority cannot be corporatised until all three pieces of legislation have been proclaimed. Most Australians would be aware that the Snowy scheme is an integrated water and hydro-electric power project situated in the Kosciusko National Park. Through a unique and complex example of engineering technology water is diverted west to the Murray and Murrumbidgee river systems for irrigation, producing renewable electricity through a complex integrated infrastructure which includes 16 major dams, seven power stations, 145 kilometres of interconnected tunnels and 80 kilometres of aqueducts. The Snowy scheme is the largest supplier of renewable energy in mainland Australia. Hydro power is truly 'green power', which does not produce the emissions associated with coal or gas, and there are strong indications that renewable BILL 1997 power may attract a premium in the future. There has been consistent support for corporatisation of the Snowy scheme by successive Commonwealth and state governments for a number of very good reasons. The most significant is to ensure that the benefits of competition reform in Australia's electricity industry can be accessed by the Snowy scheme. The electricity industry is a very large and important sector, with assets of well over $50 billion and some 45,000 employees. Its annual sales to 7.8 million customers raised $12 billion in revenue. Electricity is a key input for all Australian industries, accounting for between five and 30 per cent of input costs. Over the past two decades, electricity use has increased by some five per cent a year. Structural and competition reforms in the electricity supply industry have the potential to reduce electricity prices to industrial users by over 25 per cent and thereby enhance Australia's international competitiveness. Given the importance of improving efficiencies in this industry, governments have worked co-operatively to introduce a competitive electricity market in southern and eastern Australia. The Snowy scheme is already important in the overall electricity market. Although the scheme provides only five per cent of New South Wales, Victorian and South Australian energy output, it has a number of unique strengths. It is a rapid response electricity generator which can specialise in providing peak power to the market. It has an important reserve capacity role which provides insurance to the whole industry, because the Snowy can respond instantly to cover the sudden loss of large coal and gas fired generating units. In particular, in the event of a complete or partial grid blackout, the Snowy provides a 'black start' service of restarting the electrical system. The national market has recently commenced. Competitive trading arrangements will evolve progressively as the market develops, with the transition to a fully competitive national market expected to be completed by the year 2000. The commencement of the market has served to highlight that:an important contribution to the development of the national market will be the creation of a competitive Snowy generator, which will provide a greater depth of competition to other generators, and the separation of the Snowy's current transmission business. Under its current legislation, the Snowy scheme is precluded from operating commercially in the national market. While New South Wales and Victoria have responded to the introduction of the competitive market by establishing a company to trade electricity entitlements from the Snowy scheme, this does not allow the pricing arrangements enshrined in the current legislation to be varied. Presently, the operating costs of the authority are met by the electricity authorities of New South Wales, Victoria and the ACT, with no retained earnings. The current legislation requires that electricity is charged for at net cost of production, regardless of the prevailing market price. This does not allow the Snowy to maximise its output of high priced peak power. Corporatisation will allow the scheme to change from cost based to profit based operations. There are other important reasons to reform the scheme. The dual management system which currently governs the operations of the Snowy scheme has become outdated and inefficient. The Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority, a Commonwealth Statutory Authority, has responsibility for the day-today management of operations. The Snowy Mountains Council, which directs the operations of the Snowy scheme's electricity generation, as well as water storage and release operations, comprises representatives from New South Wales and Victorian electricity and water bodies, and the Commonwealth. This two-tier decision making process does not provide the single management focus necessary to take Snowy forward as a competitive and efficient trader of energy services in the national electricity market. When this legislation is proclaimed, governance of the scheme will transfer to a chairman and chief executive officer and a board of directors operating under corporations law and as set down in its memorandum and articles of the company. As well, corporatisation will enable the accelerated repayment to the Commonwealth of advances provided to fund the construction of the scheme. This debt to the Commonwealth has a face value of $820 million and a current value of around $740 million. Without reform the debt would not be fully repaid until the year 2027. Mr Speaker, some public concern has been expressed that corporatisation of the Snowy scheme will establish a corporate entity which is then capable of being privatised. It is acknowledged that the Victorian government-which has largely privatised its electricity supply industry-has publicly indicated its intention to privatise its Snowy entitlement as soon as possible. The NSW government has recently also stated its intention to privatise its electricity industry undertakings, including its 58 per cent share of the Snowy scheme. The Commonwealth government supports the corporatisation and privatisation of publicly owned electricity generators, distributors and transmission systems. We are investigating options to sell the Commonwealth's 13 per cent equity in the Snowy to Victoria or NSW to simplify the governance arrangements when the scheme is corporatised. Whether or not the Commonwealth sells its equity, the future ownership of the scheme will be finally determined by the major equity shareholders-NSW and Victoria. The Commonwealth has therefore placed a high priority on ensuring that the arrangements to corporatise the scheme recognise the community interests in the future of the Snowy scheme. This interest is many faceted, reflecting the scheme's location in a national park, its significance as part of Australia's multicultural heritage; as well as its role as a significant source of the irrigation water on which our agricultural sector is so dependent. Regardless of the future ownership arrangements for the scheme these interests must be properly acknowledged. A key element of the legislation package is the schedule to the explanatory memorandum, which contains the corporatisation principles agreed between the Commonwealth, New South Wales and Victorian governments. These principles, which provide the framework for corporatisation, deal with the critical areas agreed between governments before legislation could be developed. These include: the formation, equity holdings, corporate governance and staffing arrangements for the company; water arrangements for the company; the establishment of a water inquiry to examine environmental flows in rivers in the scheme's catchments; the regulatory arrangements which will be imposed on the company by the New South Wales government; and the company's liability for taxation and state tax compensation arrangements. Under the corporatisation principles Snowy Hydro Limited will assume the authority's debt to the Commonwealth. The three governments are committed to the refinancing of the Commonwealth's debt in the Snowy scheme shortly after corporatisation. The Commonwealth, New South Wales and Victorian governments have agreed that Snowy Hydro Limited will be incorporated in New South Wales, as this is where the Snowy scheme is geographically situated. The principle purposes of Snowy Hydro Limited will be to: generate electrical energy and market that energy and related services on a strictly commercial basis in the national electricity market; operate on a financially viable basis and in accordance with corporate plans approved by its members; and to undertake any future developments and operations that are commercially viable and that are agreed by the board. Snowy Hydro Limited will be the sole employer for the scheme and all Snowy Mountains Authority staff will be offered the opportunity to transfer to the company. Those who do transfer to the company will carry over their Commonwealth superannuation schemes and various other accrued entitlements. Access to Commonwealth superannuation schemes will continue until such time as government ownership ceases. At that stage Commonwealth superannuation benefits may be preserved. Wages and conditions of service will also be carried over to the new corporation. Future changes to future wages and conditions can be subsequently negotiated under the government's new industrial relation arrangements. Mr Speaker, I have already alluded to the Snowy scheme's importance as a water supplier to inland Australia. By diverting water west of the great dividing range, the Snowy scheme plays an important role in agricultural production and river management, including flood mitigation, flow augmentation during drought and the control of salinity in the Murray and Murrumbidgee rivers. To achieve this, water has been diverted from other river systems, such as the Snowy River. The community is now questioning whether the development of the Snowy scheme adequately acknowledged the impact of reduced flows in other rivers. At the broader level, the Council of Australian Governments agreed to a process for water industry reform in Australia at its meeting on 11 April 1995. Of particular relevance to the corporatisation of the Snowy scheme is the agreement by governments that the environment is a legitimate user of water. Governments have taken these concepts seriously. A water inquiry is to be held before the scheme is corporatised. The inquiry will examine issues arising from the current pattern of water flows in the rivers and streams within and flowing from the Snowy Mountains area, resulting from the operation of the scheme. The Commonwealth has agreed that New South Wales and Victoria, as the two states which have principal responsibility for Snowy scheme water management, will jointly sponsor the public inquiry. The inquiry will be conducted by a single commissioner, appointed by NSW and Victoria and will report within six months, followed by a two month period to agree to a final outcome. Corporatisation legislation will be finalised in all three parliaments following the states' agreement on the outcome. Any outcome on environmental flows can only be determined in light of the finding of the water inquiry. The inquiry will allow the views of all interested parties to be considered-irrigators, environmental interests and other downstream users of water. Until then, there is no valid basis on which governments can take any action to alter water allocations from the scheme. Governments have been unfairly accused of taking no notice of calls for increased environmental flows for the Snowy River. To respond only to the views of one interested group in advance of a public water inquiryparticularly by legislating for environmental flows in the Snowy River-would clearly disenfranchise other legitimate interests in the inquiry from the decision making process. Governments have not been prepared to do this. It is also important that the potential financial impacts of any changed water arrangements impacting on Snowy Hydro Limited be identified before the corporatisation legislation is proclaimed. This will ensure that the company is established on a sound commercial basis and can operate in the competitive national electricity market. Mr Speaker, there are other environmental aspects to the scheme's location in Kosciuszko National Park. Following corporatisation, Snowy Hydro Limited will be subject to New South Wales environmental and planning law. To comply with the existing New South Wales regulatory regime, the company will be required to prepare a corporate environmental management plan, which establishes minimum environmental standards, remediation programs, performance targets, management controls and compliance checks and timetables. Within the KNP, the sensitivity of the alpine environment and conservation status of the park means that it will not be sufficient for Snowy Hydro Limited to simply operate in accordance with the normal New South Wales environmental regulatory regime. After Corporatisation, Snowy Hydro Limited's continued operation of the national park will be through a New South Wales lease and licence, which will contain enforcement provisions in respect of a KNP environmental management plan. Snowy Hydro Limited also has significant incentive to ensure that its environmental performance is impeccable, as it will be entering the market as a provider of 'clean, green energy'. This package of measures is designed to formally take the Snowy Mountains scheme into the competitive national electricity market. It is essential that this step be taken to provide important and necessary competition and to reform the corporate governance of the scheme. In so doing, the government is confident that the new arrangements safeguard the important environment and conservation status of the KNP and can address any potential impact that may have occurred regarding the Snowy River. I commend the bill to the honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Ms Macklin) adjourned. NA (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1997 First Reading BiII presented by Mr Bruce Scott, for Mr Anderson, and read a first time. Second Reading",113
221,Mr ANDERSON,SNOWY HYDRO CORPORA TISA TION,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This is the second of two bills in the legislation package which will corporatise the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority: the Snowy Hydro Corporatisation Bill 1997; and the Snowy Hydro Corporatisation (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1997. As outlined in the second reading speech for the Snowy Hydro Corporatisation Bill 1997, the Snowy Hydro Corporatisation (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1997 repeals and amends various acts of parliament arising from the termination of the existing legislation. The bill repeals the Blowering Water Storage Works Agreement Act 1963; the Loan (International Bank for Reconstruction and Development) Act 1962; and the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority Act 1960 as part of consequential action arising from the repeal of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Power Act 1949 by the Snowy Hydro Corporatisation Bill 1997. In addition, the bill provides for consequential amendments to the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977; the Commonwealth Borrowing Levy Act 1987; the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employment) Act 1991; the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988; the Seat of Government (Administration) Act 1910; and the Superannuation Act 1976. I commend the bill to the honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Ms Macklin) adjourned. CHILD CARE PAYMENTS BILL 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mrs Moylan, and read first time. Second Reading",116
222,Mrs MOYLAN,SNOWY HYDRO CORPORA TISA TION,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. Mr Deputy Speaker, this bill represents a major step forward for the provision of childcare care services. The government announced in the 1996-97 budget significant changes in delivery of child-care payments. While predecisions paring the legislation for this budget initiative, I have carried out a wide-ranging review of the whole legislative framework for the children's services program. The bill brings under one legislative brella the different types of child-care services--centre based long day care, family day care, occasional care and outside school hours care. The bill streamlines the administration of child care by enabling application and payment through one agency, the Commontoo wealth Services Delivery Agency. Although not detailed in the explanatory memorandum, consequential amendments to other legislation, such as the Data-matching Program (Assisttwo ance and Tax) Act 1990, will be required. The bill embodies the government's comdemand mitment to assist families with dependent children to participate in the work force to assist the community by ensuring that child children. care is affordable for low and middle income families and by improving access to quality child care. Mr Deputy Speaker, the bill enables the Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency to pay child-care assistance and the child-care rebate from January 1998. Families will benefit from the new payment arrangements in two major ways. The co-location of child-care assistance and the child-care rebate with other family payments will mean that families deal with one agency for all of their child-care and family payments and queries. Entitlement to both child-care assistance and the child-care rebate will be calculated at the same time; families who are eligible for both types of payments will only need to lodge a single claim to receive both payments. The agency will make a child-care assistance payments fortnightly in advance to service operators based on family entitlements. The child-care rebate will be paid fortnightly in arrears to the family. Secondly, these new arrangements strengthen parents' right to choose the care they want for their children by giving families more control and responsibility. The value of childsubsidies will be more readily apparent. The bill provides families with access to the review and appeals mechanisms concerning about their eligibility for child-care payments, a right they have not previ-usly enjoyed. This initiative assists smal! - usm-ss by reducing the amount of admmlstratJ ve paperwork required from service providers to umclaim child-care assistance. Mr Deputy Speaker, the government's child-care initiatives announced in the 199798 budget are the result of extensive family research and consultations with the community and industry. Many areas of Australia have many child-care centres while families in other areas have little or no access. This bill introduces a measure to limit the provision of new places to 7,000 per year over the next years to ensure that all new long day care centre places are located in areas where for work related care is highest. This limit is consistent with the growth in work and force participation of parents with young The bill introduces a 20-hour a week limit on access to child-care assistance for each child in care for non-work related purposes. This measure ensures Commonwealth funds are more efficiently targeted to the primary objective of the program, that is, work related care. Work related care is defined as care required by families where both parents are or the single parent is working, looking for work, studying or training. It includes families where one parent is working and the other, because of a disability, is unable to have work related commitments or care for their child or children. There will also be exemptions for children at risk of neglect or abuse, for operators where they are the sole provider of care in an area and for certain service types including occasional care services and rural multifunctional services. There are serious disparities in financial assistance for the care of school aged children. Major reforms in school aged care will dramatically improve equity and affordability for an estimated 70,000 low and middle income families using outside school hours care services by providing higher levels of child-care assistance to eligible families. This will increase the capacity of families to make choices about their care arrangements based on preference rather than on the level of subsidies available. In summary, this bill provides the framework for refocusing the provision of child care so that its primary objective can be achieved: to facilitate the participation of parents with young children in the work force. It strikes a balance between the needs of parents and service providers and the need to ensure that subsidies are provided in the most efficient and effective way possible. It streamlines the administration and delivery of childcare payments for both parents and service providers by providing one point of contact, the new Commonwealth Services Delivery Agency. I commend the bill to the House and I present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Ms Macklin) adjourned. STATES GRANTS (GENERAL PURPOSES) AMENDMENT BILL 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Miles, and read a first time. Second Reading",117
223,Mr MILES,SNOWY HYDRO CORPORA TISA TION,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (6.14 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the bill is to put in place arrangements for the provision of general revenue assistance to the states and territories in 1997-98. The bill also includes provisions relating to the payment by states and territories of their share of the agreed 1997-98 fiscal contributions to the Commonwealth, and national competition payments by the Commonwealth in 1997-98. The contents of the bill are consistent with decisions taken at the 1997 Premiers Conference and related agreements with the states and territories. The bill will amend the States Grants (General Purposes) Act 1994. The existing act covers the provision of financial assistance grants and special rev-nue assistance for 1996-97 only, with interim arrangements for the continuation of payments for a maximum of six months. The bill extends for a further 12 months the provisions of the existing act relating to the payment of financial assistance grants and special revenue assistance. The general revenue assistance to be appropriated by this bill is about $16.8 billion, or around 12 per cent of estimated Commonwealth outlays in 1997-98. Accordingly, these payments constitute a significant element of the Commonwealth budget and have an important bearing on the spending and borrowing of the public sector as a whole. The states and territories are able to allocate the funds provided by the Commonwealth under this act according to their own budgetary priorities. The 1997 Premiers Conference agreed that the states and territories will be provided with real per capita growth in financial assistance grants in 1997-98 and that the real per capita guarantee for financial assistance grants will be extended to 1999-2000. Amendments to the act are consistent with the per capita element of the real per capita guarantee being conditional on states meeting the terms of the agreement to implement the national competition policy and related reforms. This agreement also provides for the commencement of $214.7 million in competition payments to the states and territories in 1997-98. The Commonwealth will consider the views of the National Competition Council when determining if a state should receive the payments provided under the agreement. At the 1997 Premiers Conference it was decided that the states and territories would make fiscal contribution payments of $626.5 million in 1997-98 and $313.5 million in 1998-99. It was also agreed that half of the scheduled 1997-98 fiscal contributions of Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory will be deferred until 1998-99 in recognition of their difficult economic circumstances. The need for the 1998-99 fiscal contribution will be reviewed at the 1998 Premiers Conference in light· of developments in the Commonwealth's fiscal position. The Commonwealth will continue to provide states and territories with maximum flexibility concerning the method of payment of the state fiscal contributions. A state's share can be paid by way of deductions from general revenue assistance, direct payments to the Commonwealth or a reduction in funding provided under a specific purpose grant. Provisions have been included in the bill for states' 1997-98 fiscal contributions to be deducted from general revenue assistance. The major part of the assistance provided under this bill is the provision to each state and territory of a share of the pool of financial assistance grants which is estimated to about $16.1 billion in 1997-98. In accordance with the agreement at the 1996 Premiers Conference, this amount includes the grants that were previously paid to the states as arterial road grants. The 1997 Premiers Conference agreed that the distribution of financial assistance grants should be in accordance with the per capita relativities recommended by the Commonwealth Grants Commission. The bill updates the per capita relativities in the act accordingly. The bill authorises the payment of special revenue assistance to New South Wales and Victoria of $435.5 million in 1997-98 as payments under the guarantee arrangements associated with the medicare agreements. The Commonwealth will ft $62.2 million (these payments and the residual will b funded from the financial assistance grants pool. The Australian Capital Territory will also receive $34.5 million from the Commonwealth in 1997-98 in the form of transitional allowances and special fiscal needs. This payment is outside the scope of this bill and has been included in the appropriation bills. Mr Deputy Speaker, I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill and I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Ms Macklin) adjourned. NA BILL (No.4) 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Miles, and read a first time. Second Reading",118
224,Mr MILES,TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (6.20 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. Thin capitalisation The bill will amend the tax law to improve the effectiveness of the thin capitalisation rules in order to ensure that an appropriate be amount of profit is derived in Australia in respect of foreign controlled Australian enterprises. The thin capitalisation foreign debt to foreign equity gearing ratio will be reduced from 3: 1 to 2: 1 for taxpayers who are not financial institutions. The gearing ratio for financial institutions will remain unchanged at 6: 1. To complement the new gearing ratio, the definition of foreign debt for companies that are not financial institutions will be extended to borrowings from overseas lenders for which a guarantee has been provided by a foreign controller or their non-resident associates or such debt secured against the assets of a foreign controller or their non-resident associates. This extension of foreign debt will not apply where a resident company can establish to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of Taxation that the loan could have been obtained without the guarantee or security. The definition of foreign equity for fixed trusts will be calculated on the basis of their foreign controllers' fixed interests in the capital and net income of the trust. Discretionary trusts will be denied an income tax deduction for interest paid to foreign controllers or their non-resident associates. For partnerships the foreign equity will be based on the interest that the foreign partners have in the capital and income of the partnership. The bill also contains measures to counter avoidance arrangements. Asset revaluations for partnerships and trusts will be limited to market value changes. The provisions dealing with back to back arrangements will be repealed as it is considered that the general anti-avoidance provisions of the income tax law will be more effective in countering such arrangements. A foreign controller of a partnership or trust will be denied a deduction for loans from a non-resident associate which is invested as either debt or equity in the partnership or trust respectively. Finance shares The bill will amend the income tax law to address tax avoidance arrangements involving eligible finance shares and widely distributed finance shares. In February the government announced measures denying non-portfolio dividend status and eligibility for an underlying foreign tax credit on dividends paid on eligible finance shares and widely distributed finance shares. These provisions give effect to that announcement. Group certificates for employees ceasing employment The Prime Minister, in his statement dated 24 March 1997 and contained in the report More time for business, announced a proposal designed to reduce employers' compliance costs by removing the requirement on employers to always issue group certificates within seven days for employees who cease working. The bill amends the law relating to group certificates to generally allow employers to issue group certificates by 14 July after the end of the relevant year of income unless an employee who leaves employment during the year makes a written request for their group certificate at an earlier date. The amendment will not, however, affect the obligation of an employer to issue a certificate within seven days when making an eligible termination payment. Tax exempt entities that become taxable The bill also proposes amendments to overcome deficiencies identified in the existing law. The proposed amendments will ensure that where a tax exempt entity becomes taxable: the entity is allowed a deduction for any surplus in its defined benefit superannuation scheme; the entity is allowed a deduction for contributions made in arrears after the transition time where the defined benefit superannuation scheme was in surplus at the transition time; and the doubtful debt provision for debts existing immediately before the transition time, for which no deduction is allowable, is reduced where such a debt is sold at or after the transition time. Measures to address tax avoidance through tax exempt entities distributing funds offshore As part of the 1996-97 budget, the Treasurer announced that the government intended to introduce legislation to counter tax avoidance through the use of tax-exempt bodies distributing funds offshore. As part of this government's commitment to undertake consultation before introducing legislation into parliament, an exposure draft of this legislation together with explanatory notes were released on 20 February 1997. At the outset, it should be emphasised that under both the exposure draft and the legislation now before the parliament, any distribution of funds received from donations, gifts, offerings, 'plate money' and the like will not affect an organisation'S tax exempt status. Although the charitable trust provisions are of an anti-avoidance nature, the government has, where possible, adopted a number of suggestions made by interested parties to ensure as far as possible that bona fide organisations will not lose their tax exemption. With respect to other tax exempt organisations covered by provisions in the bill, the government has also amended the wording of the proposed legislation to make it perfectly clear that organisations based in Australia will not be affected by these measures as long as they incur their expenditure and pursue their objects principally in Australia. This amendment specifically addresses the concerns of a large number of representations received by the government on the draft legislation, including from many religious, missionary and sporting organisations. Consistent with the announcement by the previous government, the charitable trust measures will take effect after the commencement of charitable trusts' 1996-97 year of income. The measures affecting other exempt organisations will apply from the 1996-97 budget announcement as previously announced. Quasi-ownership of flXtures/leases of luxury cars There are two measures in the bill which relate to the tax law improvement project. The first measure ensures that luxury car leasing rules in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 continue to have application to the 1997-98 and later income years. The second incorporates into the rewritten 1997 assessment act rules which treat a lessor of depreciable plant under a chattel lease as the owner for taxation depreciation purposes where the plant has become a fixture on another person's land. Electronic lodgement and electronic funds transfers The bill will amend the income tax law and fringe benefits tax law to provide for electronic lodgement of returns, applications for amendment and other documents provided to the commissioner. These amendments give legislative effect to what is a current administrative practice for taxpayers who lodge through tax agents. The amendments will also enable other taxpayers to lodge these documents by electronic transmission to the commissioner. Amendments will be made to allow the commissioner to pay refunds by electronic funds transfer to any account nominated by the taxpayer. The account may be an account of another person. Rate of tax for friendly societies In the 1997-98 budget the government announced that, in keeping with the competition objectives of the financial system inquiry that reported in March 1997, it would recommence the review of the taxation treatment of life insurance that was initiated in the 199596 budget, but not completed by the former government prior to the election. To ensure that the present taxation treatment of friendly societies is undisturbed for the duration of the review, the rate of tax imposed on the life insurance business of friendly societies will be retained at 33 per cent for the 1997-98 and 1998-99 income years. Similarly, the rebate available to policyholders who receive assessable bonuses on life insurance policies issued by friendly societies will be retained at 33 per cent for the 1997-98, 1998-99 and 1999-2000 income years. The trustee rate will be increased to 39 per cent from 1999-2000 and the rebate rate will be increased to 39 per cent from 2000-01 unless other relevant amendments to the taxation treatment of friendly societies are made prior to that time. Full details of the measures in the bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum circulated to honourable members. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Ms Macklin) adjourned.

226,Mr LEO MCLEAY,FISHERIES LEGISLATION,"Watson) (6.29 p.m.)On this matter, maybe it would assist the House if we could seek advice from the Leader of the House (Mr Reith), who is in the House with us now, as to whether the government intends dealing with just this matter or with the rest of the matters from the Main Committee. I think there are some reasonable solutions we can come to for most of those. If you like, I could outline that reasonable solution.",122

230,Mr REITH,ADJOURNMENT,"I move: That the House do now adjourn. To provide advice to members, the intention now is to have an adjournment debate, as has been previously discussed. There are further reports from the Main Committee which can be reported on in the course of events tomorrow.",122
231,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,I hope that satisfies the member for Watson. Main Committee,122
232,Mr LEO MCLEAY,ADJOURNMENT,"Watson) (6.31 p.m.)There is a way we can resolve all of these things rather quickly. It is probably not terrifically good for the House to have a dissent from the Chairman's ruling hanging over the House for a day or so, particularly when I think the last time the government used its numbers to have a government member dissent from a chainnan's ruling was in 1953. We could relive the life of Jeff Bate if we want to, but there is probably a middle way with this, which is that the dissent motion is probably not in order and, if the matter was called on and a point of order was taken of you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to ask you to make a ruling as to whether that dissent motion is in order or not and you properly ruled in accordance with what the standing orders are, as you know and others would know that you cannot take a dissent from a call-that is not a ruling-that would dispose of this matter and dispose of it now. That would be a way for honour to be preserved all round. We would not be dividing on that. We would be happy to assist the government with that if the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) wanted to do that.",122
233,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"I apologise to the House. We are technically in the adjournment, but I did give an undertaking to the member for Watson that I would allow him to pursue this matter with the Leader of the House. Main Committee",122
234,Mr REITH,ADJOURNMENT,"Obviously we are now in the adjournment debate, and the intention is to negative that at seven 0' clock so that we can have the adjournment debate in the usual way, but noting that we will suspend the sitting at 7 o'clock. I appreciate that there are matters outstanding from the Main Committee, including the dissent matter. I must say I have not had an opportunity yet to briefed on it. I do not expect the ghost of Jeff Bate to disturb our sleep overnight, and it would do due honour to him that we properly investigate this matter anyway. By all means, whatever the matters that people want to talk about when that report comes before the House, there will be ample opportunity tomorrow. I think that is the sensible and easiest way to handle it. Heroin Importation",122
235,Mrs CROSIO,ADJOURNMENT,"It has been a bad couple of weeks for the Minister for Small Business and Consumer  that the pressure is starting to affect the standard of his work as well. Late last week the minister responded to a question I had on the Notice Paper regarding the amount of heroin being imported into Australia. I asked the minister if it was possible for him to provide an estimate of the amount of heroin being seized by the authorities as a percentage of the total amount entering the country. To my complete and utter surprise, the minister said he was not able to provide such an estimate. The minister must have been too preoccupied with his business matters and his meetings with Bunbury City councillors not to be able to come up with such figures. I was not asking for precise details, just an estimate. The only worthwhile information the minister for small business was able to provide me was the following. I quote from his answer to me: The Australian Customs Service is responsible for the detection and seizure action in relation to detected at the border. From 1 July 1996 to 3 June 1997, the Australian Customs Service has made 60 heroin seizures totalling 153.1 kilograms. I thank the minister for that tidbit of data, but I would like to draw his attention to two quite well-known pieces of information regarding the estimated amount of heroin being detected coming into Australia as a percentage of the total amount. The Joint Committee on the National Crime Authority, while investigating the link between drugs and crime in 1989, estimated that only about 17 per cent of heroin imported for consumption into Australia is seized. That is one well-known estimate the minister could have referred had he been doing his job properly. Now let me refer to the second figure the minister should have realised, because it was certainly at his fingertips. Just last year, in December, the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence released the 1995-96 Australian Illicit Drug Report-and a very informative, albeit depressing, report it is. It says on page 62 that only 10 per cent of the heroin entering Australia is being seized. So that is another figure to which the minister could have referred in his answer to me, but he chose not to. The minister, hunkered down in his office, with calls for his resignation on the left of him and calls for his resignation on the right, quite clearly has not got his mind on the job. However, one positive did spring from the answer given to me by the minister. If we are to believe the accuracy of the estimates provided by the Joint Standing Committee on the NCA and the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence, that only 10 or 17 per cent of all the heroin entering Australia is actually being seized, and if, as the Minister says, 153 kilograms of heroin was picked up by Australian Customs over the last 11 months, that means the other 83 to 90 per cent-roughly between 747 and 1,377 kilograms of heroinis still out there; that is, if it hasn't already gone into the bruised arms of addicts in my electorate and heaven knows where else around the country. That is an enormous amount of heroin drugs which has slipped past the authorities. That is an enormous amount of heroin being sold on the streets of Cabramatta, Footscray, Inala, Northbridge and elsewhere. That is an enormous amount of heroin that we as a society will remain powerless to stop until we tum our 'war' on heroin away from simply focusing on supply and concentrate on the demand that brings the drug into the country. The member for Moore (Mr Filing) has quite vividly described the holes that have developed in the Customs Service because of the government's budget cuts-videotape from closed circuit cameras being watched days after shipments of goods have arrived and X-ray equipment only being used on cargo leaving the country, not entering it. However, I think it must be said that we could have the largest, most efficient customs service in the world and heroin would still be finding its way onto our shores undetected. It is all very well fighting the supply of heroin but, as long as demand for it exists in our communities, our young people will continue crucifying themselves on the ends of syringes across the country, from Moore in Western Australia to Prospect in my electorate of New South Wales and back again. We need to focus our attention on the demand for heroin that now exists in our country. Only when this is done will we start to see any positive effects. We will start to need less of the billions of dollars a year we spend incarcerating criminals for committing burglaries to feed their heroin habits; less for providing emergency health services for addicts overdosing in the streets of our suburbs; less for law enforcement and the judicial system fighting a war on drugs that they can never win as long as we follow the present strategies. The minister for small business has shown, with his answer to my question on notice, that he is out of touch when it comes to the heroin problem facing Australia. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Fischer) have not got much of an idea either. The Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) supports the national drug strategy in public but we all know that behind closed doors he is convinced that we need change-if only he were not hamstrung by his desert-dry, reactionary cabinet colleagues. I hope the minister for health takes his colleagues aside, especiaIly the minister for small business, and has a word to them regarding the failings of the national drug strategy. With over a tonne of heroin coming into the country undetected in the last eleven months, it is pretty obvious that we are going nowhere fast. Taylor, Vice Admiral Rod",123
236,Mr TAYLOR,ADJOURNMENT,"Groom) (6.39 p.m.)Tonight, with a mixture of sadness and pride, I rise to pay tribute to an outstanding senior naval officer and a great Australian, before his formal retirement from the Royal Australian Navy next Monday, 30 June. I speak of my brother Rod who retires at that time as Chief of the Navy after 43 years of dedicated, professional service in all ranks from cadet midshipman to Vice Admiral. He is, I think, along with the present Chief of the Defence Force, General John Baker, at this time among the longest serving members of the Australian Defence Force. I was privileged to serve with Rod for over 30 years before I resigned, when we were both one star commodores, to enter the political field early in 1988. I feel sure that, if the Speaker were here-having known brother Rod for many years while he was serving in the RAAF, and as graduates of the same Joint Services Staff College course here in Canberra in 1979-he would join with me in wishing brother Rod weIl at this auspicious time.",124
237,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,I'm sure he would.,124
238,Mr TAYLOR,ADJOURNMENT,"Without being too parochial, as indeed I will not, and without undue family bias, can I say that Rod's career has been a series of firsts, always dominated by strong leadership, keen intellect, by his respect for others and the respect he earned from them, by unparalleled professionalism, a deep sense of loyalty and, in his senior ranks, an unswerving apolitical line in the best traditions of his service and the ADF. Monday sees the end of an era in Australian naval history, as he is the last serving 13year-old entry cadet. Together with my Royal Australian Naval College team mates, he was part of the last graduating class from Flinders Naval Depot in Victoria before the coIlege's transfer to Jervis Bay in 1958. I can stiIl recall my parents' pride when brother Rod was awarded the Queen's medal in that graduating class by the Governor General, Sir William Slim. As was acknowledged at a reunion dinner here in Parliament House a couple of weeks ago, he was, even at that early stage, identified by his classmates as the one most likely to succeed. He did not disappoint them. As one of the nation's foremost maritime navigational experts, he navigated worldwide everything from minesweepers to aircraft carriers during his sea service. Highlights of his career were many and varied, from Household Flag Lieutenant to the Queen Mother in the royal Yacht Britannia in 1963-64 to later operational commands at sea in HMAS Vampire and Torrens, the latter as Commander of the third Australian destroyer squadron and as Commodore Afloat. He was a graduate of the prestigious national defence college of Canada in 1985-86 and was awarded a mention-in-despatches for service in HMAS Brisbane during the Vietnam conflict for 'meritorious service as bombardment navigation officer and operations officer'. He was awarded the AM in 1989 for service to the RAN as Deputy Fleet Commander and the AO in 1992 for service to the ADF as Assistant Chief of Operations during the Gulf War--once again, further formal acknowledgment of his dedication and professionalism in the national interest. My major disappointment this evening is that our late parents are not with us to hear this formal acknowledgment of Rod's immense national contribution. I recall my mother's reaction when he and I, as youngsters, were fighting in the kitchen one evening. Her retort to Rod was 'If you don't behave, I'll put you into the navy.' How right she was for all the wrong reasons. My other disappointment is that he has not been able to serve on. He is a very young 57. Perhaps he suffers from a family trait in that, on occasions, we both call a spade a big shovel. On behalf of my wife Jan-both of us will attend his farewell parade at HMAS Harman on Monday-sisters Wendy and Elizabeth and their families, I wish Rod and his wife Judy a productive and happy retirement at the Ponderosa out on the Sutton road. I hope that the alpacas are as good for him as he has been for the navy. In naval terms, he deserves a smooth sea and a fair wind. Bon voyage! Blacktown-Mt Druitt Learning Difficulties Group",124
239,Mr MOSSFIELD,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise in this adjournment debate to bring to the attention of honourable members the activities of an incredibly committed and talented group of parents in the BlacktownMount Druitt area. These parents are led by Ms Terry Driscoll and an enthusiastic man-· agement committee team. The organisation is the Blacktown-Mount Druitt learning difficulties group. It provides a vital service to parents in this huge area with children who have a variety of learning difficulties. The group provides a marvellous library to assist parents as a resource. It provides monthly guest speakers to also give added help to parents. The coordinator, Terry Driscoll, is employed and paid for only 12 hours per week but in fact puts in many hours of unpaid time to the program. Terry travels to schools all over the area, speaking to parents and teachers, explaining the problems of children with learning difficulties and exposing the various symptoms of such children. Many children are not simply slow or naughty; they have real and genuine learning difficulties that are only now becoming exposed and identified to parents and teachers. The group I am referring to in this contribution is an example of foresightedness and dedication under great difficulties, and their success needs to be rewarded and broadcast widely. The members pay a small membership fee and pay a low rent in a community centre provided by the Blacktown City Council, which is a marvellous help. The New South Wales state government provides $22,000 per annum to cover salaries, running costs and other expenses. The expertise within this group is now widely recognised, and many local paediatricians are referring parents to the group for advice and assistance. The group has an enormous struggle to keep up with the demands being made on it and desperately needs more funds to try to service those demands. Not only paediatricians refer parents to the group. Local community centres are also becoming aware of the expertise available and are referring clients. Schools are now sending parents to the group for assistance. All these things are putting great strain on the physical resources and stamina of Terry Driscoll, who is the only employee. The management committee is an enthusiastic group of interested parents. They give great support to Terry Driscoll and the many other parents who come to the group for help and advice. I have already noted that this group receives financial help from the state government and pays a reduced rent to the local city council. Following representations and discussions between the group and my office, I have been pleased to refer their issues to the federal Minister for Health and Family Services (Mrs Moylan). If a local regional officer can speak with this group, I am sure there will be a way to assist this worthwhile organisation somehow. Thus, we will achieve the support of the three tiers of Australian government in an area of need which, through a lack of knowledge that help should be given, has been neglected for far too long. Children are Australia's most valuable commodity and asset. They far outstrip minerals and other assets that might be regarded as important for us in the future. Children are our future, and we need to ensure that everything possible is done to achieve maximum participation in our nation's future by all children. The Mount Druitt-Blacktown learning difficulties group is doing its best through its work to try to meet the needs of all our children, who are valuable assets for the future of our country. With the help of the three tiers of government, groups such as this will succeed in their endeavours. But they do need our help, and we must help them now.",125
240,Mr ZAMMIT,ADJOURNMENT,"In about three weeks time--on 20 July, to be exact-the world will witness the 23rd anniversary of Turkey's illegal and bloody invasion and occupation of 37 per cent of Cyprus, with no sign from the Ankara government of any contriteness or willingness to discuss the withdrawal of their 40,000-strong military force. The world must not forget this illegal act by Turkey. It is an illegal act which has been denounced by all freedom loving nations of the world. That denouncement extends to the government of Turkey which, as an independent and sovereign state member of the United Nations, seeks to create an image of moderation and peacefulness towards its neighbours. Whilst Turkey continues to occupy Cyprus, their credentials as a nation dedicated to peace, freedom and democracy are not to be believed. Thousands of Greek Cypriots remain refugees in their own country, prevented by military might from living in their homes and villages. Thousands more are still waiting for word on the fate of 1,619 loved ones missing since the summer of 1974. I visited Cyprus in August of last year and met many Greek Cypriots whose homes and possessions are gone-through Turki sh confiscation. They were able to point out to me where their homes were prior to the bloody invasion by Turkish troops. In many instances, their homes could be seen-by the naked eye or, in some instances, through binoculars-in Turkish occupied territory. Cyprus remains forcibly divided, and a major concern of governments throughout the years has been to achieve its reunification in a way that will guarantee territorial integrity and security. It is important to note that the question of security has three aspects. The first is the complete demilitarisation of Cyprus, that is, the immediate withdrawal of an estimated 40,000 Turkish troops stationed in the occupied area. The second aspect is the creation of an international force-with a UN Security Council mandate-which will be able to intervene if the territorial integrity or independence of the country or the security of either community is threatened. The third Cyprus aspect is the right of unilateral intervention of any of the guarantor powers, should that occur. It is time that human rights for all Cypriots be restored, because it is clear that time works against Cyprus. The demographic composition of the island is continually changing, due to the deliberate influx of settlers or colonists from Turkey. The younger generations of the two communities are growing up without knowing one another and the fait accompli of the division is becoming further entrenched. It is also time that all illegal Turkish settlers withdraw from Cyprus. I draw the attention of the parliament to the fact that the new UN Secretary General, Mr Kofi Annan, has invited Cyprus President {Jeri des and Turkish Cypriot leader Denktash, to hOld face-to-face negotiations in New York from 9-13 July. The Cyprus government has responded positively to the invitations, even though it would have preferred the negotia- "".'I1S to have been better prepared in advance :iJld some common ground in narrowing the gclp between the positions of the two sides to have been established. Unfortunately, the Cyprus government has already reported that the Turkish Cypriot leader remained inflexible during the latest talks, sticking to the position he has held for the past 22 years. However, this round of negotiations should not end in failure as has happened repeatedly in the past because of the lack of political will from the Turkish side-a fact that has been documented by the United Nations. Failure would only increase the people's frustration. Australia could also play a role in making this round of talks a success. As a UN and Commonwealth member, the Australian government should propose concrete measures te be taken against Turkey's intransigence. Tp:l..:y should not be allowed to continue its hlatant violation of human rights in Cyprus :.lnd, as a first step, Australia should demand the immediate withdrawal of the Turkish twops and settlers. Australia should also help the UN in convincing Turkey that it is in her best interests to solve the protracted Cyprus problem. - am absolutely convinced, following my visit to Cyprus, that the Greek Cypriots' aim is not to dominate. The aim of the Cyprus WlVcrnment is a united sovereign bi-zonal bic!Jmmunal federation in accordance with the principle of political equality as defined by the UN Secretary-General and endorsed by the Security Council. This, of course, means effective participation in the different organs of the federal government and not equal numerical participation. I call on the Commonwealth government to do all that possibly can be done to grasp this opportunity to arrive at a just and lasting peaceful settlement in the interests of all legitimate Cypriots of Greek and Turkish origin, who lived together in peace and harmony for thousands of years and want to return to that harmony. Cyprus Shopping Centre Tenants  p.m.)-This Australian of Greek origin wholeheartedly supports the comments that hu Ie just been made by the member for Lowe (Mr Zammit). When the occasion arises, I will be making a similar contribution to that issue and will be offering support for the resolution of the situation in Cyprus. Cyprus regrettably has been the pawn of the superpowers since the invasion by Turkey in 1974. I say that as one who had dear family friends who, on a return visit to Cyprus, were captured by the Turks in the invasion. They were Australian nationals, but that did not matter. They were still captured and, after some long negotiation by the Whitlam government, we were able to get them released-but their properties in Kyrenia and all that area of Cyprus have just become so degraded since then. I hope to have the opportunity to come back to speak some more on this matter. Some months prior to the last election, I was approached by a number of small business people in my electorate, who had tenancies in large shopping centres, about the inequities, the intimidation and the hardships that they were suffering as tenants within those centres. Many of the tenants had become captives, and I commend the chairman of the committee that brought the fair trading report into the chamber, the member for Bendigo (Mr Reid). I compliment him and his colleagues on the fine report that they have brought back to this parliament. What brings merit to that report is that it is a unanimous report. I am a great believer in the committee structure of this parliament, and I hope that unanimous report of that committee will result in effective action in the implementation of the recommendations. This is what the parliament can do. Parliament is not simply about the executive. Parliament is very much about the committee system, and if ever there was a report that merited this support of the executive and its carriage into law it is the report of this committee. I have said to my constituents-those who are in business in large shopping centres such as Charlestown Square, Belmont City Centre, Lake Macquarie Fair and Garden City-that anyone, and I have issued this public warning on a number of occasions, who is contemplating tenancy in a large shopping centre should first seek independent legal and accounting advice on every aspect of what that tenancy may entail. I have seen the sorry state of people who actually have taken their redundancy package and have unwittingly lost not only their redundancy package but also their home on top of it-verything they have got; the whole of their life savings and life assets. These were people who should never have been in business, but we have people desperate for employment on the one side and on the other all the professional advisers of the Property Council of Australia. I did not wake up till a few months ago to the fact that the Property Council of Australia actually was the major shopping centre proprietors of Australia. I read all those glossies and that was great, and it was only a few months ago that I came to realise whom they represented. Today I had here in the House Susanne Pinkney, Bill Roberts, Peter Frost, who is the president of the Small Business Persons Association of the Hunter, David Vickery, Wayne Brown and Rocky Gallucci. They are all small business people. I come from a small business background myself, albeit some time ago, but I very much empathise with them. I understand what they are going through. I have seen some of the tragedies and the family breakups that have arisen out of the disasters in which people have found themselves. I do not have time to get through the recommendations of the committee's report. I am one of the persons who did not get an opportunity to speak in the Main Committee. I was scheduled to speak after the Deputy Speaker this morning. I hope that opportunity raises its head again, because that report must be discussed. Those people I have just mentioned are down here to see the report's recommendations being discussed and debated. It is a bipartisan report that affects hundreds of thousands of small business people in this country, and we owe them the implementation of those recommendations. Let me comment on the reference in the report to the renewal of leases or rather, firstly, to the uniform retail tenancy code. It is a must. We are an increasingly mobile society in business. There should be uniformity across Australia in legislation governing leases-the renewal of leases, the five-year period and the option to renew for five years, and the recognition of goodwill. People go in and put in $250,000 of their money-as in a case that I have had put to me-sell up their premises, build up the business, and at the end of five years they are told, 'Out, we have got somebody else.' I know of cases where some tenants have been forced out for nought and lost the lot, with a new tenant coming in at a considerably reduced rental because the management thinks they can be an attraction. (Time expired) Motion (by Mr Thomson) agreed to: That the question be now put. Question resolved in the negative. NA Members' Interests Committee Report",126

242,Mr LIEBERMAN,COMMITTEES,I present the 11 th report from the Publications Committee sitting in conference with the Publications Committee of the Senate. Report-by leave-agreed to.,128
243,Mr LIEBERMAN,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The Joint Committee on Publications is conducting an inquiry into the possible discontinuance of the parliamentary papers series. The inquiry has been initiated in response to a request by the Presiding Officers, who wrote to the committee on 27 June 1996 seeking its advice on a proposal to discontinue the series. In order properly to consider the proposal, the committee sought information and views from interested parties and has received 58 submissions and has conducted two public hearings. The committee received a useful submission from the Australian Government Publishing Service and took oral evidence from that organisation on 10 February 1997. Before the committee finalises its report, however, it will need to take additional evidence from AGPS at a further public hearing. This evidence could cover matters such as the restructuring of AGPS, its future role, its community service obligations and the revised charter of printing and publishing responsibilities. The committee had arranged to take this evidence last Thursday, 19 June, but an injunction was granted by the Federal Court in relation to the tender process for the sale of AGPS. Given the resulting uncertainty about the future of AGPS, the committee decided not to proceed with that hearing. It is understood that court hearings on the matter are to commence on 30 June 1997. The outcome of the case will, therefore, not be known before the parliament has adjourned for the winter. A significant issue to be considered by the committee is the administrative arrangements that will be established after the sale of AGPS to ensure the distribution of parliamentary and executive government documents. Without the additional evidence from AGPS, the committee is not now able to conclude its inquiry into the proposed discontinuation of the parliamentary papers series, but will do so early in the spring sittings.",128
