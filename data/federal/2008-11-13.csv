2,The SPEAKER,Unknown,"Now that the member for Blair has allowed me to recognise the Chief Government Whip, with great expectation I call the Chief Government Whip. AGED CARE AMENDMENT (2008 MEASURES No. 2) BILL 2008 Referred to Main Committee  That the bill be referred to the Main Committee for further consideration. This motion enjoys the support of the Chief Opposition Whip, the honourable member for Fairfax. Question agreed to. NATION-BUILDING FUNDS BILL 2008 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Tanner. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",17
3,Mr TANNER,Unknown,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Nation-building Funds Bill 2008 (the bill) is part of a package of bills giving to the government's 2008-09 budget announcement to establish three new nationbuilding funds that will provide significant investment in transport, communications, water, energy, education, research and health infrastructure to strengthen our economy. These new funds build Australia's infrastructure needs for the future and will assist in addressing Australia's immediate challenges in response to the global financial crisis, as well as its longer term challenges over the next decade and beyond. To help shield Australians from the global financial crisis, the government has announced it will fast-track its nation-building agenda. To facilitate this acceleration, this bill and a consequential amendments bill allow for interim arrangements to begin as early as possible, as investment in critical infrastructure can help secure economic activity in the short term and extend growth potential in the medium to long term. The government believes that the Commonwealth has a central role in meeting the nation's infrastructure needs. The opposition has taken various positions on the importance of a nation-building agenda, appearing to be for it one day only to come out strongly against it the next. For the sake of our economy both in the short and long term, it is of critical importance that the opposition stops playing politics with nation building and facilitates the passage of this legislation by the end of the year. This is required for the funds to be established by 1 January 2009 and for the fast-tracking of infrastructure projects which are a pivotal part of the government's Economic Security Strategy. Contribution to the funds The government is committed to implementing an infrastructure investment program, allocating funds for transport commueffect nications, energy, water, education and health. This year, the government will contribute: - a total of $12.6 billion to the Building Australia Fund for transport, communications, energy and water, infrastructure, including proceeds from the T3 sale and the balance of the Communications Fund; - a total of $8.7 billion to the Education Investment Fund for education infrastructure, including the balance of the Higher Education Endowment Fund; and - $5 billion to the Health and Hospitals Fund, for health infrastructure. This is an infrastructure program of historical proportions. The government has committed to making future allocations to the funds as budget circumstances permit. Where the funds are used to finance capital projects in the states and territories, funding will be distributed through a new Council of Australian Government (COAG) Reform Fund, which the Treasurer is establishing through the COAG Reform Fund Bill 2008, another component of this package of bills. Investment of the funds The nation-building funds will utilise the investment framework that has been established for the Future Fund. The Future Fund Board of Guardians will manage the investments of the funds. Rigorous evaluation of projects Spending from the funds on specific projects will be subject to rigorous evaluation by independent advisory bodies. In view of the government's commitment to strengthen the Australian economy in the face of the global financial crisis, this bill and a consequential amendments bill allow for interim advisory bodies for the Education Investment Fund and the Health and Hospitals Fund to be established as soon as possible. These interim bodies will provide a report to government in December. For the Building Australia Fund, the government has previously indicated that Infrastructure Australia, the independent statutory council headed by Sir Rod Eddington, will produce an interim report in December on a National Infrastructure Priority List. The advisory bodies will assess projects against evaluation criteria which are being developed by portfolio ministers. Interim evaluation criteria are also being developed to allow work to commence as soon as possible. Budget consideration Consistent with the government's Economic Security Strategy to strengthen the Australian economy in the face of the global financial crisis, the bill permits me, as finance minister, to determine a drawing rights limit for spending from the funds covering the period up to 30 June 2009. This will enable work in key infrastructure areas to commence before 1 July 2009. To apply rigour and transparency to spending from the funds prior to the 2009-10 financial year, the determination will be made in writing and tabled in the parliament. The funds will be established as ‘special accounts' in the Consolidated Revenue Fund, meaning that any amounts credited to the funds represent amounts that have been appropriated and clearly committed for future expenditure on infrastructure. From 2009-10, the government will consider proposals as part of the budget process. Transparency and scrutiny for payments from the 2009-10 financial year onwards is provided by the government including a general drawing rights limit in the appropriation acts. The general drawing rights limit will restrict the total amount that may be paid out in a financial year to support relevant infrastructure expenditure. This is intended to provide the parliament with a mechanism by which it may oversight the rate at which the amounts are being expended for investment in infrastructure. Payments from the funds Portfolio ministers will be responsible and accountable for payments made from the funds in relation to projects brought forward within their portfolio responsibilities, which is consistent with the usual Commonwealth financial management arrangements. Importantly, it will allow for portfolio ministers to be responsible for the delivery of projects, including the meeting of project milestones. Conclusion With this bill, we begin a new era of investing in Australia's short-, mediumand long-term needs. These funds are important to address the challenges Australia faces. The funds demonstrate the government's commitment to building the nation's capabilities. The funds provide a crucial financing source for investment in critical nationbuilding infrastructure needs. This is a government that responds quickly at a time of global financial crisis. We intend to invest and build for the future. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Lindsay) adjourned. NATION-BUILDING FUNDS (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2008 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Tanner. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",17
4,Mr TANNER,Unknown,"I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Nation-building Funds (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2008 supports the establishment of the new nation-building funds: the Building Australia Fund, the Education Investment Fund and the Health and Hospitals Fund. As detailed in my earlier speech, the nation-building funds build Australia's infrastructure needs for the future. This consequential amendments bill will allow for interim arrangements to begin as soon as possible to implement the government's nation-building funds agenda in response to the global financial crisis. The investments of all three nationbuilding funds will be managed by the Future Fund Board of Guardians. The government will close the Communications Fund and transfer its balance to the Building Australia Fund. The government will also close the Higher Education Endowment Fund and transfer its balance to the Education Investment Fund. I will now discuss the material changes in the bill. The bill repeals part 9C of the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999, which establishes the Communications Fund, and repeals the Higher Education Endowment Fund Act 2007. The bill also makes the necessary amendments to the Future Fund Act 2006, the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 and the Telstra Corporation Act 1991 reflecting the closure of the Communications Fund and Higher Education Endowment Fund. Consequential amendments extend the Future Fund Act's operation to deal with the Future Fund Board of Guardians' duties in relation to the Building Australia Fund, Education Investment Fund, and Health and Hospitals Fund. I commend this bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Lindsay) adjourned. NA Rearrangement",19
5,Mr BOWEN,BUSINESS,"Prospect-Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs, and Assistant Treasurer) (9.11 am)-I move: That consideration of government business der of the day No. 3, Corporations Amendment (Short Selling) Bill 2008, be postponed until a later hour this day. Question agreed to. TAX AGENT SERVICES BILL 2008 First Reading Bill and explanatory memorandum presented by Mr Bowen. Bill read a first time. Second Reading",20
6,Mr BOWEN,BUSINESS,"Prospect-Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs, and Assistant Treasurer) (9.12 am)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. This bill will improve the regulatory environment for the provision of tax agent services. The bill has three main objectives. Firstly, it aims to improve consistency in the registration of tax agents and other intermediaries in the tax field and to regulate the provision of tax agent services in an appropriate but flexible way. Secondly, the bill aims to enhance the protection of consumers of tax agent services, thereby reducing the level of uncertainty for taxpayers and the risks associated with the self-assessment tax system. The third objective is to strengthen the integrity of the tax system and the tax industry. This bill will replace the existing law regulating tax agents in part VIIA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. This part was introduced in 1943 and is now out of date and out of step with the current tax and commercial environment. Indeed, Australia's tax environment has changed significantly since 1943. For example, the self-assessment tax system was introduced during the 1980s. In addition, the tax base has expanded significantly over the past 20 years or so, with an associated inorcrease in the volume of the tax laws and the number of interactions within them. These changes in the tax environment correspond with significant growth in the number of taxpayers seeking professional assistance from tax agents to prepare and lodge their tax returns. In 1980, for example, only around 20 per cent of individuals used tax agents to lodge their tax returns. This figure has now grown to 74 per cent. Given the number of taxpayers who use agents to comply with their tax obligations, it is important that such agents are appropriately and adequately regulated, that there are mechanisms in place to ensure they are adequately supported, and that there are incentives for new agents to enter the market. The Tax Agent Services Bill aims to deliver this balance through a number of key elements that I would like to outline. The bill will establish an independent national Tax Practitioners Board to replace the existing state based tax agents boards. The board's key functions will be to register agents and to regulate the provision of tax agent services. The establishment of a single, national board will make the registration process consistent and standardise the way in which entities providing tax agent services are regulated across the country. It will also enable greater efficiency in the allocation and use of the board's resources. The bill proposes to establish the board as a statutory authority within the Australian Taxation Office. The board's funding will be quarantined from the tax office's annual appropriation and its functions and powers under the bill will be vested independently from the Commissioner of Taxation, thus providing all possible practical independence. A formal post-implementation review of the proposed governance arrangements for the board will be conducted in three years time to assess whether the independence of the board is impaired in any way because of its continued connection with the tax office, and whether an alternative arrangement should be considered. The second key element is the requirement for certain entities that provide tax agent services for a fee to be registered. In addition to requiring tax agents to be registered, the bill introduces a registration requirement for entities providing BAS services. This ensures that a level playing field across industry exists, by broadening the scope and application of the regulatory framework to reflect the broader scope of services provided, given the expansion in the tax base. The definition of ‘tax agent service' in the bill and the relevant paragraphs in the explanatory memorandum clarify the intention that financial services licensees can provide tax advice that is incidental to financial services, provided that service would not be relied upon in satisfying a tax obligation or claiming an entitlement under the taxation laws. Thirdly, the bill will introduce a legislated code of professional conduct which will govern the provision of tax agent services by tax agents and BAS agents. The code will define the professional and ethical standards required of agents, and their roles and responsibilities. It will therefore provide clarity and certainty around the standards expected of agents. It will also provide a benchmark against which the board and taxpayers can evaluate the tax agent services being provided. The fourth key element is the establishment of a wider and more flexible range of administrative sanctions than those existing under the present arrangement. In cases of non-compliance with the code, the board will be able to impose a sanction that is commensurate with the severity of the misconduct, ranging from a written caution or an order to undergo training or work under supervision, through to termination of registration. The introduction of a range of constructive and educative sanctions for non-compliance will improve the standard of services provided to the public. The fifth and final element is the introduction of a specific civil penalties regime for certain specified misconduct by registered agents and unregistered entities, which will replace the criminal penalties in the current law. For example, civil penalties will apply where an unregistered entity provides tax agent services for a fee, and where an agent knowingly or recklessly makes false or misleading statements. Reform of the regulatory framework for tax agent services was first contemplated during the mid-1990s and was first announced by the previous government in 1998. The framework has been developed and refined over the course of many years. The key elements of the bill have been supported unanimously by the key players in the tax industry, including tax agents, bookkeepers, representatives of the tax and accounting professional associations as well as the legal professional associations, taxpayers and the tax office. Introduction of this bill therefore represents a positive outcome, following a long journey for many stakeholders, particularly those individuals and entities practising in the field, providing tax agent services to the community. The full details of the provisions in the Tax Agent Services Bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Lindsay) adjourned. NA Public Works Committee",20
7,Dr KELLY,COMMITTEES,"Eden-MonaroParliamentary Secretary for Defence Support) (9.18 am)-I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Enhanced Land Force Stage 1 Facilities Project, Lavarack Barracks, Townsville, Queensland and other Defence bases around Australia. The Department of Defence proposes to undertake the Enhanced Land Force stage 1 facilities project at Lavarack Barracks, Queensland and other Defence bases around Australia, at an estimated out-turned cost of $793.1 million, plus GST. Lavarack Barracks is currently the home base for the Army's 3rd Brigade. The Enhanced Land Force Stage 1 Facilities project will relocate the 3rd Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment from Holsworthy Barracks in Sydney to Lavarack Barracks to co-locate with the remainder of the 3rd Brigade that is already based in Townsville. To support Army capabilities, there are significant existing facilities at Lavarack Barracks and other Defence bases around Australia. Since 2007, the Army has been increasing in size to implement the government's Enhanced Land Force initiative, and the existing facilities require modification, extension or new construction to support the increased capabilities effectively. This project will provide new and refurbished accommodation and training facilities, as well as common-use facilities and site infrastructure upgrades at Townsville and other Defence sites across five states. Facilities at Kapooka, Singleton, Holsworthy and Puckapunyal will provide modern accommodation and supporting infrastructure for increased Army training, whilst at RAAF bases Amberley, Edinburgh and Richmond, new facilities will be provided for joint enaReference bling elements supporting the Enhanced Land Force capabilities. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction will commence in mid-2009 and be completed by late 2011. I commend the motion to the House.",22
8,Mr LINDSAY,COMMITTEES,"I rise to support this motion. This is very significant for Townsville, but the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Support left out a word in his speech to the parliament. He indicated to us all that Lavarack Barracks is the home of the 3rd Brigade. He did not inform the parliament that that is the ‘premier' brigade in Australia today. Defence presence in Australia's only garrison city, Townsville, is one of the reasons Townsville is doing so well in the current downturn in the economy. We love our soldiers and we love the men and women of the Royal Australian Air Force. The 3rd Battalion coming to Townsville is a very significant change in the way the battalions are located. This will be welcomed by the Townsville community, and it will ensure that Defence continue to be a very significant presence in Australia's largest tropical city. I thank the parliamentary secretary for his referral today. Question agreed to. Publications Committee Report",22

NA NA (ECONOMIC SECURITY STRATEGY) BILL 2008 Cognate bills: APPROPRIATION (ECONOMIC SECURITY STRATEGY) BILL (No. 1) 2008-2009 APPROPRIATION (ECONOMIC SECURITY STRATEGY) BILL (No. 2) 2008-2009 Second Reading Debate resumed from 12 November, on motion by Ms Macklin: That this bill be now read a second time.",22
10,Mr RANDALL,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I rise to speak on the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Economic Security Strategy) Bill 2008 and cognate Appropriation (Economic Security Strategy) bills Nos 1 and 2. As we know, these are part of the package of spending measures totalling $10.4 billion, with $9.65 billion to be spent in 2008-09, designated to stimulate the economy and known as the Economic Security Strategy. We also know this package is worth half of the current forecast budget surplus. This government is clearly out of its depth, having had to admit that this package was announced without any economic analysis by Treasury. Kevin Rudd and Wayne Swan have spent half the forecast surplus without any modelling to show it will have the desired impact. That is a concern. They are making policy on the run, as it has been described over this period of time. When they come into this place and claim that it is their budget surplus, we know that that is not accurate. This surplus was put in place before the last election by the very able then Treasurer, Peter Costello, the member for Higgins. It is the coalition's $20 billion budget surplus that was built up through careful management of the Australian economy that has been helping to secure Australia's future. We know that Labor inherited no government debt; a budget surplus, as I have said, of $22 billion; and a Future Fund of more than $66 billion in reserves. In addition, unemployment was at record lows, mortgage rates were low, inflation was under three per cent and growth was high. For a government who claimed accountability credentials time and time again, we are now seeing time and time again that this is a government who hides public information in the shadows. Mr Rudd and Mr Swan must explain",23
11,The SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,Order! The honourable member will refer to members by their titles.,23
12,Mr RANDALL,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"The Prime Minister and the Treasurer must explain the government's decision and provide the required detailed analysis of how those decisions were actually reached. It is little wonder that they have been described as bungling the management of the Australian economy-and they are trying to hide this bungled management. When the government took office the economic indicators were heading in the right direction; now they are heading in absolutely the wrong direction. The continued mishandling of the economic crisis has damaged the Australian economy, and the worse thing is that it is now affecting jobs. The unemployment rate is expected to rise to 5.75 per cent by June 2010, but there is a suggestion that this figure is probably an underestimate. Unemployment is expected to reach five per cent by next June. I digress for a moment to say that in Western Australia last week it was announced that the unemployment level in that state is 2.2 per cent, a marvellous achievement. So, to those who are in New South Wales, in that rust belt state, and doing it hard, I suggest that if you really do want a better future you might want to go to Western Australia, where 2.2 per cent is probably under full employment at this stage. We are a state that really looking for skilled workers to fill a whole range of jobs. For example, we are still having trouble getting cleaners for offices and commercial premises in Perth. So that describes the unemployment level in Western Australia. In fact, by providing over 30 per cent of the nation's income, you could really say that in Western Australia we are carrying the rest of Australia on our back, and that needs to be acknowledged when funds are handed out through government initiativesfor example, the upcoming infrastructure fund. Since we are producing so much of the nation's wealth, we would like a little bit of it back in moneys for infrastructure such as roads, ports and schools, and additional hospital expenditure. It is the golden state in Australia at the moment, and it needs to be acknowledged for that. We know that the government are into the blame game and that they will blame the global financial crisis for every event that occurs hereafter. However incompetent and however bungled the government's management of the economy, they will be blaming the global crisis. You can hear it every question time, when the Prime Minister when asked about economic data stands up and says, ‘Oh, yes, but it is the global crisis.' As I have already said, if they had inherited the debt and the economic conditions that John Howard did when he came to office in 1996, just imagine what the state of the Australian economy would be now. This package includes $4.8 billion for pensioners, carers, senior health card holders and veterans. On 8 December, not only pensioners and other people across Australia but also Canning pensioners will finally get some relief from sky-high housing costs, grocery bills and petrol prices. Those eligible will include age pensioners, disability support pensioners, wife pensioners, widow B pensioners and service pensioners; those on is income support supplement, carer's payment, partner's allowance, widow allowance, bereavement allowance, parenting payment if a person is of age, special benefit if a person is of age, Austudy if a person is of age and ABSTUDY if a person is of age; and Commonwealth seniors health card holders. I will look at the Canning figures at a glance because I would like to provide this information to the electorate. There are 5,000 single age pensioners and almost 9,000 partnered pensioners in Canning. There are 4,500 disability support pensioners, 600 people receiving carer payments, 2,000 Commonwealth seniors health card holders and almost 1,000 service pensioners. That demonstrates how many people in an electorate of something like 95,000 people are going to be beneficiaries and are going to rely on this support. The bonus will provide a one-off $1,400 lump sum payment for single pensioners and $2,100 for coupled pensioners as long as both partners hold an eligible card. Alternatively, a payment of $1,050 will be made if only one member of a couple has an eligible card. I know Canning pensioners have welcomed these one-off payments, given rising grocery prices, rising fuel prices and the current climate of global economic instability, but the bonus for pensioners is long overdue. Now the Prime Minister and Mr Swan must address raising the base rate of pensions. It is not good enough to give a one-off bonus, because this will be chewed up preChristmas and post-Christmas. The underlying problem of pensions keeping pace needs to be addressed in structural reform for pensions and we are asking this government to do that, as we did when we were the government under the Howard coalition. As people know, instead of doing what Keating did-just giving a throwaway before an election-we actually put the pension on a sound footing of twice-yearly increases based on the CPI or the MTAWE, whichever was higher. So it was very transparent. People knew when it was going to be delivered, they knew the reasons for any increase and they received the higher of the two increases. was a genuine reform in the Howard years. Now the Rudd government must make similar reforms to put pensions and entitlements on a sound footing so that people know exactly when they are getting it, how they are getting it and why they are getting it. People on entitlements are the most vulnerable in our communities and they deserve the consideration and the respect of being told how and when they will be given such a considered increase. We know that the Henry review will not report until mid next year. That will be the next federal budget in May, which means that there will be little opportunity in the May budget. You can rest assured that the Rudd government will be saying, ‘We cannot do anything until the Henry review is delivered because we will be pre-empting anything from the Henry review'. So that will put pensioners and all other people expecting entitlements further back in being considered. The expected relief will be a longer time coming, so the response to increasing cost-of-living pressures will not flow in any sort of timely way. Once this one-off bonus has been spent pre-Christmas and postChristmas, pensioners and other entitlement holders will be back to the same problem of not having enough to live on, with increasing rents and increasing grocery prices. Petrol prices are coming down, but we know that they are not coming down to the extent that they should be. Crude oil prices have come down by 40 per cent since July last year, yet petrol prices have only come down by 27 per cent. Fuelwatch has not gotten up and the Fuel Commissioner should be doing his job. Where is the 17 per cent that should be delivered to the Australian people, particularly those most vulnerable: pensioners and other people receiving an entitlement? It would be of real benefit to them if they got the full flow-on of the 40 per cent This reduction in world oil prices. The Prime Minister, Mr Rudd, campaigned on this issue leading up to the 2007 election, and he must address this structural reform as a matter of urgency-not after the budget next year; not after waiting for Mr Henry of the Treasury to deliver his report and using that as a later measure. Let us not forget that this one-off measure was designed to stimulate the economy. It is not a compassionate response by the Rudd government to the ongoing plight of pensioners struggling to meet the increasing after costs of living. We know that they were dragged kicking and screaming into this response. They even voted down the opposition's opportunity to address this with a $30 increase months and months ago. This is part of a stimulus package, not a compassionate consideration of the plight of pensioners. The coalition has long called for a rise in the base rate of the pension and, after months of posturing and refusing to even look at it, the majority of the government front bench admitted that they could not even live on $273 per week so they have tried to be a saviour with this payment. The government did not even blink an eye before shelving the coalition's Urgent Relief for Single Age Pensioners Bill 2008 before it hit the floor of the House of Representatives. It was almost pilloried and ridiculed. But now I do believe that the pressure that the opposition and other minor parties put on the government did have some targeted effect benefiting pensioners. This bill also provides for $3.9 billion in bonus payments to families with dependent children. Payments of $1,000 will be made for each child who attracts family tax benefit A or, alternatively, for children who attract youth allowance, ABSTUDY living allowance or an education allowance under veterans' entitlements. These bonuses will be a great help to many Canning families. There are 15,000 recipients of family tax benefit A in the Canning electorate. However, I have received a lot of calls from families in the area who are doing it tough and were again overlooked. The Prime Minister's working families-the focus group tag that he usesare the ones that are actually being left Middle Australia has been sidelined by this issue. Many local families work hard, pay taxes and do not receive any family tax benefits and do not qualify for any lump sum payments. People say to me all the time: ‘Low income people get the support and those on high incomes have an opportunity to minimise their obligations, but how about the good, honest, working, middle-class Australians who pay their taxes and work hard? They get little or no relief from this government.' These are the families struggling with rising household costs, petrol bills, school fees, health insurance and day-today expenses that just keep mounting. As I have said, general structural reform is needed, not lip service. The Prime Minister announced an uncapped guarantee for all deposits in Australian banks, building societies and credit ions, Australian subsidiaries of foreign banks and wholesale term funding. Once again the policy-on-the-run decision was made without any direct advice from the regulator-in other words, the Governor of the Reserve Bank. The resulting mayhem means that Australians have had billions of dollars in savings frozen in investment funds. These are Australians who have saved hard for their future. It is estimated that over one-quarter of a million people have had their savings and their entitlements in these funds frozen. Westpac CEO Gail Kelly has called on the government to place a cap of $100,000 on the deposit guarantee, which is, coincidently, the same as initially suggested by the Leader of the Opposition. Regarding superannuants, the unintended consequence of the government's haphazard reaction to the global financial meltdown and the unlimited bank guarantee has been the freezing of funds. This has put people who rely on this superannuation drawdown in a predicament and under increasing financial out. strain. Those with superannuation arrangements face a challenging future, with financial institutions being forced to freeze payments. This was ill considered. Superannuation funds are being severely curtailed in their dividend payment, as asset values collapse. And what was the government's reaction to those thousands of Australians relying on their superannuation incomes? The Treasurer said, ‘Go and get some help from Centrelink.' What a terse and insulting thing to say, to tell these people to go and get help from Centrelink. These are their life savings and they cannot access them. It is slightly more complicated and distressing than joining the Centrelink line and in most cases people are not eligible for benefits because they have savings-they just cannot access them. The Combined Pensioners and Superannuants un- Association said that the government pointing superannuants in the direction of Centrelink was of little comfort and only caused additional distress. Centrelink staff are under immense pressure. In fact, I am aware that the head of Centrelink said that, should these people come to Centrelink, it would not have a mechanism to pay them. They would have to wait 28 days to even consider it. The Treasurer continues to show that he is out of touch with the Australian people and cannot be trusted to manage the Australian economy. Changes to the deeming rate will come into effect on 17 November 2008. The rate will be reduced from four per cent to three per cent for the first $41,000 sioner's financial investment and the first $68,200 for couples and then fall from six per cent to five per cent for the balance of the investment. Simply, the deeming rate reduction is designed to reflect the fall in investment returns. This one per cent reduction in the deeming rate is aimed at helping people on means tested pensions-such as the age pension, the disability support pension and carer payments-and income support allowances and supplements, such as the parenting payment and Newstart paid by Centrelink. This is just another cynical move by a cynical government. Actually the rate is only 2.4 per cent, which makes the deeming rate changes just another photo-opportunity policy from the government with little practical comfort for those people who need it most. In other words, bringing the rate down by one per cent does not reflect the actual fall in that period of time. The actual fall 2.4 per cent. So the full relief from the pain is not being passed on. In the time. I have left I would like to talk about grandparent carers, another group that has been long neglected. Grandparent carers are those Australians who give up their time and retirement to care for their grandchildren because of the circumstances of their own children. Grandparent carers have long been fighting for the same recognition, support and status as foster carers but it continues be an uphill battle. Last year was a small win, with the coalition leading changes to social security legislation and extending participation requirement exemptions to principal carers who are relatives but not parents of the children. That is, they extended to grandparent carers the same status as foster parents. This is what over 50,000 grandparent carers in Australia have been calling for for a long time-that as a minimum they receive the same consideration and entitlement as foster parents when they look after of a single pentheir grandchildren. The case of Margaret Saunders in my electorate, who I have spoken about before, is just another unintended consequence of the government's assistance package. Margaret was forced to leave her full-time job in her 50s when, because of a severe drug habit, her daughter became unable to look after her children. Margaret now cares full time for her two grandchildren, taking them to school and to activities after school and generally taking on the role of a full-time parent. I mentioned this case in the parliament recently; however, I thought it important to raise it again in reference to this bill. Margaret emailed me following the government's announcement of the bonuses. She said: What really hurts is that Grandparents looking after grandchildren were overlooked again. Yes some of us will receive the bonus for the kids but a lot won't. is Regarding the bonuses, Margaret makes an extremely valid point. The mother of her grandchildren will receive a bonus as a disability pensioner. In other words, the mother who cannot look after the children is actually going to get a bonus because she is on a disability pension, being a hopeless drug addict-(Time expired)",23
13,Ms GRIERSON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I rise today to speak on the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment to (Economic Security Strategy) Bill 2008 and the two Economic Security Strategy appropriation bills. These bills implement key aspects of the government's $10.4 billion Economic Security Strategy-a strategy that will maintain confidence, strengthen the national economy and help those most in need in our local community. The Prime Minister's decisive action to strengthen the economy and support Australian households is good news for the people of Newcastle. Working families, pensioners and carers in Newcastle have been doing it tough, and the global economic uncertainty has added to their worries. The significant relief being provided to pensioners, self-funded retirees, lowand middleincome families and first home buyers is a big investment in our community and one which will strengthen the economy in these tough economic times. With payments starting on 8 December this year, the timing is particularly good. This is practical assistance for these and other low-income members of our community and it is a down payment ahead of the full pension review, which is underway. The payments will provide additional support in the nine months between now and when long-term pension reform can be considered in the context of the 2009-10 budget. In Newcastle, where over the past few years people have been telling me they have been struggling to meet the increased cost of living, more than 40,000 people are expected to directly benefit from the provision of the Economic Security Strategy. This is a significant relief. It shows a government that has struck on a decisive course will strengthen the economy by giving much-needed assistance to those who need it most. As Minister Tanner, the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, noted when introducing the appropriation bills, the global financial crisis has significantly changed economic outlook since the budget in May this year. As the Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, said, ‘The world has changed.' We certainly know that, and I think we should all reflect on just what it has been like over the last few months. We have seen banks fail. We have seen banks being bailed out around the world, stock markets free-falling and the global economy stalling. Fortunately, of the top 14 of the OECD highest rated AA banks in the world, four are in our country. We are not immune, of course, but our economic fundamentals remain sound, and our financial institutions give us great hope that we will ride this one out much better than most. But these are extraordinary economic times. I draw attention to an article by Anne Davies in the Sydney Morning Herald from 4 October, where she points out that ‘Wall Street pain reaches down to those who have lost the American dream'. I think we all watched it play out in America first, with a huge $1 trillion share market crash. In that article, she quotes Bernie Sanders, an Independent senator from Vermont, and I think it is important to note some of the things he said, because the middle-class dream has perhaps not been as sound as people thought. He said: The middle class has really been under assault. Since President Bush has been in office, nearly 6 million Americans have slipped into poverty, median family income for working Americans has declined by more than $2000, more than 7 million Americans have lost their health insurance, over 4 million have lost their pensions, foreclosures are at an all-time high, total consumer debt has more than doubled, and we have a national debt of over of action that $9.7 trillion. I remember, as part of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, asking Governor Stevens how long we could expect the world to shore up America's debt. His response was that it was in noone's interest to withdraw credit to America. the I think the debt just got too big. Senator Sanders went on to say: The top 0.1 per cent now earn more money than the bottom 50 per cent of Americans, and the top 1 per cent owns more wealth than the bottom 90 per cent. The wealthiest 400 people in our country saw their wealth increase by $670 billion while Bush has been president … These are astounding figures, and I suppose it reminds us all of capitalism gone a little crazy. Certainly people's expectations and aspirations were unrealistic. They exceeded the norm and moved into the greed sector at an extreme rate. Fortunately, in Australia we have had the Reserve Bank and our other Australian financial regulatory institutions, who have given us warnings over many years. I remember Ian Macfarlane, then Governor of the Reserve Bank, at our hearings of the Standing Committee on Economics urging the then Howard government to take on the supply constraints in our economy. I remember Governor Macfarlane suggesting that house prices were overinflated and required some policy settings. I remember Governor Stevens drawing attention to our imbalance of trade and the ongoing consumption of cheap imported goods that were putting our economy in a parlous state, with inflation running rampant. It is a new global economy. It is a time for strengthened regulators, not diminished regulators, and I urge the opposition to desist from their attack on our regulators. We are a fortunate country. We are certainly now seeing that we are indeed the lucky country. These are astounding times: you turn on the ABC news in the evening and you see Alan Kohler from the business program telling you that 42 per cent of international GDP wealth has just disappeared in one day. That is some write-down to the wealth of the globe, and certainly it has been felt in Australia. What has that meant and what will it mean to Australians? I think we need to be reminded that for most Australians the only asset they have is their home. We have now seen home values decrease. Their home is the only asset most Australians have, and they prize it. They work hard for it. It is an acquisition they strive for. And certainly we need to make sure that the housing sector, including housing construction, is strong. We bit have done that through our bank guarantee. We have done that through supporting our second-tier mortgage lenders with our $8 billion of assistance and through the first home owners grants. For most Australians their only savings are in their superannuation fund. (Quorum formed) The savings of most Australians reside in their superannuation. The policy of the previous government that saw over $4 billion rushed into superannuation at the end of the financial year in 2007 is not perhaps one that stacks up very well now. It is always important that people contribute to the economy of Australia. It is always important that people pay their taxes. That is the way that wealth is distributed. I know that many people in my electorate are particularly concerned about the loss of value of their superannuation. For most Australians the only security they have is their job or the Centrelink safety net-which I just heard the member for Canning say was an embarrassment. Well, no, going to Centrelink is never an embarrassment-we are fortunate in this country that there is a safety net. Making sure that people's security is shored up by employment is one thing that this package particularly tries to address. We do expect the strategy to boost the level of real GDP growth by between a half and one percentage point over the next several quarters. In Newcastle I was pleased to see that the Newcastle Herald had a headline ‘Manna from Kevin'. This legislation, and this $10.4 billion package, is a significant result. It has a particularly good outcome for Newcastle and the Hunter. The Newcastle Herald said, ‘Rudd's $250 million Christmas bonus for the Hunter is just the boost into our economy that we need'. In my electorate of Newcastle alone there will be an injection of at least $55 million for recipients of age pension single and age pension partnered; carer allowances, carer allowance single and carer allowance coupled; carer payments; our family support packages for people on family tax benefit A; and DSP partnered and single. Overall there are at least 40,000 people in my electorate who will be receiving a dividend from this economic security package. In Newcastle we are blessed to have the Hunter Valley Research Foundation, an independent and autonomous body that find their own funding and do what I think in our country is some of the best collective learning and training in economic management for a city that I have ever seen. At their recent economic indicator breakfast they pointed out that our economy, having diversified and having fundamentally strong foundations, is in a better position than most. They said: Together with a structurally sound and diverse economy we are better placed than a lot of regions to weather the storm They also said: Economic conditions in the Region have deteriorated but not to critical levels There is some relief from the mess - Accelerated government spending - Lower $A–improving our international competitivenessand for our knowledge based manufacturers, our very diversified manufacturing sector, that is good news-Lower interest rates, fuel prices and (soon) inflation So they point out that lower interest rates, lower fuel prices and lower inflation-soon, we hope-are also going to mean greater success for our economy. I would also say that the economy of Newcastle and the Hunter still has its roots in the coal industry. I would urge the New South Wales government to sign off on the port agreement put forward under the Greiner plan. I know it is one supported by industry. When you get total support by industry, and you know that the ACCC are looking favourably at an agreement such as that, it would be in the best interests of the region to have that agreement signed off on by the New South Wales government now. Our package, though, as pointed out, has great dividends for the people of Newcastle not only in the payments alone but also in the training packages and in the investment in infrastructure. The fast-tracking of infrastructure is something that is particularly important in the region and I look forward to Infrastructure Australia supporting the people and the economy of the Hunter by rolling out some freight and logistics related infrastructure as soon as it possibly can. We are already seeing that sort of growth and investment from the private sector. In Newcastle and the Hunter the key is confidence. It is this package that will help to deliver that confidence. The Hunter Valley Research Foundation also point out that the housing sector remains vital to a recovery. The first home owners boost that gives an extra $7,000 to people purchasing an existing dwelling and an extra $14,000 to people purchasing a new dwelling, raising those grants to $14,000 and $21,000 respectively, is an excellent initiative and one that is very much needed. Indeed, the Newcastle chapter of the Master Builders Association said that the first home owners boost would, ‘Give the region's building industry a much needed shot in the arm.' I also note that we are investing over $117 million to create 56,000 additional productivity job seeker places in 2008-09. These places are to develop the skills that Australians need and that Australian businesses and industry need. It doubles the number of productivity places to 113,000 and hopefully will be a huge boon for young people, often the first people on the edge during financial downturns. The nation-building funds, too, will be extremely important investments in the productive future of our nation. We have established an independent authority, Infrastructure Australia. In my region, I am particularly looking forward to some support from the Health and Hospital Fund for the Hunter Medical Research Institute. I also think particularly of the port and the coal chain work being done by ARTC. In conclusion, I would like to commend the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, and the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs for bringing this Economic Security Strategy forward. It is an extraordinary response to the extraordinary economic times that we are now living through. It will go a long way to immediately stimulating the consumer economy and the housing market and to investment in long term skills and therefore productivity. It ognises the tough times being faced by pensioners and lowand middle-income families and responds to those pressures with immediate financial relief. I am confident that this package will both keep the economy strong and help those people in our community most in need. I commend the bills to the House.",27
14,Mr BALDWIN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I rise today to speak on the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Economic Security Strategy) Bill 2008, the Appropriation (Economic Security Strategy) Bill (No. 1) 2008-2009 and the Appropriation (Economic Security Strategy) Bill (No. 2) 2008-2009. The Rudd government released its Economic Security Strategy last month, including spending measures totalling $10.4 billion, with $9.6 billion to be spent in 2008-09. That represents half the forecast budget surplus. The social security bill provides $4.8 billion in a one-off payment to pensioners, carers, senior health care card holders and veterans and $3.8 billion in payments to families, with payments scheduled to be made from 8 December 2008. Other measures include $1.5 billion for first home buyers and $187 million for training. I welcome some relief for the most vulnerable members of my community, who have suffered under the strain of rapidly rising cost-of-living pressures over the last 12 months and the underlying rate of inflation, now at a 17-year high under the Rudd Labor government. This is well overdue. Only now are pensioners being given relief, after being denied a fair deal for far too long. I must make it clear that this one-off pension bonus in Labor's $10.4 billion package does not include an increase in the base rate. So, while pensioners will undoubtedly welcome the money, it does not come with a commitment from the Rudd Labor government to raise the base rate. Pensioners are not asrec- sured that under the Rudd government they will receive any more money in the future. A future without financial certainty does not inspire hope for our pensioners. After much oscillating from the Rudd government's three wise men on addressing the survival gap for pensioners, the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance and Deregulation have spun their way to this decision. One said that there would be no increase to pensions and one said that they will wait for the outcome of yet another review, but they all said that they could not live on the current pension rate of $273.40 per week. Finally, a decision was made when the Prime Minister consulted his crystal ball and got a hunch that the economy was going to worsen. Since coming to office, the ‘Rudd review fest' has established a massive 165 committees. This style of government does not come cheap and I have to ask these questions: how much money has been spent on these reviews? How much has been paid to consultants? How much red tape has been created by the government, which spun the line to Australians prior to the election that they would cut red tape? On 21 February 2008, in my address in reply to the Governor General's speech, I made what is becoming an increasingly significant observation. If you recall, I observed: With an economic crisis evolving in various parts of the world, let me say that managing a trillion-dollar economy is not a game. We need keep vigilant. In unsteady and inexperienced hands, with outside interference from the unions, all that we have achieved as a nation could be jeopardy. This great nation could be set back 20 years in terms of both the economy and employment. Isn't it infuriating that my forecast for Australia's economic and unemployment climate under the Rudd Labor government is now begrudgingly accurate? Labor governments both past and present have made a mess of the Australian economy and have driven unemployment figures sky high. During the Hawke-Keating Labor government era, Australians endured an average inflation rate of 5.2 per cent, while in stark comparison under the former Howard government inflation averaged only 2.5 per cent. During the Hawke-Keating government period the maximum standard variable home loan rate rose to 17 per cent, while under the former Howard government it dropped drastically to 6.05 per cent. And I do not need to remind this House that government debt under the previous Labor government rose to $96 billion. Labor governments have a long history of driving the Australian economy into the ground, and the Rudd Labor government has proved in only 12 months that it is no exception. The economic mismanagement of the country by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer since coming to office in November last year has severely damaged Australia's economy and is seriously threatening Australian jobs. The coalition left to the Rudd Labor government unemployment at its lowest level since 1974. Under the former Howard government, more young Australians took up apprenticeships than ever before, which is vitally important when there is a skills shortage in our nation. The coalition remains committed to creating long-term solutions, unlike the Rudd Labor government, which is to all about quick, bandaid fixes that are ultimately all spin and no substance. The Rudd Labor government are using the in global financial crisis as an excuse for their utter incompetence and mismanagement. After all, from day one they talked down our economy. They said they would end the blame game, but all they have been masters of is finding someone to blame for everything. I demand that the government release the current economic forecasts. Is it that the Treasurer does not understand these figures or is it simply that he cannot find them? I fear that the Treasurer will sit on these statistics until he can understand them himself, and at that rate they may never be released. If it takes the Treasurer three minutes and 20 seconds to find a piece of paper detailing the inflation figures from notes actually in front of him, then we could be waiting years for these figures and even longer for a solution. The Rudd Labor government must deliver on what they promised to the Australian people. Working families know what they heard and they know what they were promised, and it was not 165 reviews, commissions and talkfests. The Rudd Labor government are hypocritical in the highest degree. Prior to the election, Labor said they were economic conservatives, but their management of the economy proves that Labor are really economic vandals. Here we see history repeat itself yet again. The coalition, the real economic conservatives, build the nation's wealth, keep unemployment low and work on keeping the national purse in the black. By contrast, after only 12 months Labor are already projecting a rise in unemployment and the budget going into deficit and are spending our savings. I first entered politics to build a better ture for my children-indeed, all children. Under this Labor government, I am now very nervous for the future of the children of our nation and the legacy Labor's policies will leave for them. In opposition the Labor Party were vehemently against one-off payments. The current Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs said in 2004 that her ‘No. 1 concern' about the baby bonus was that it was ‘being paid in a lump sum'. The current Minister for the Status of Women said in 2007 that the baby bonus should have been paid fortnightly to remove the ‘jackpot effect'. Furthermore, in an interview conducted by the ABC Insiders program as recently as 27 June 2007, the current Treasurer said that lump sum payments were ‘dishonest and irresponsible'. So, could the three wise men-and I use that term lightly-the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, please explain why it is that they are resorting to bandaid measures in an attempt to rescue the economy when they have repeatedly condemned lump sum payments? Perhaps they will not have an answer. Is it that the Rudd Labor government are in the game of saying one thing and doing something entirely different? While these questions remain unanswered, I fear the Australian economy will continue to sink faster than the Titanic. The government will blame the global financial crisis for every event that occurs hereafter. However incompetent and however bungled the government's management of the economy, they will blame the global financial crisis. In talking about the financial climate, let me assure you that the Australian economy is, metaphorically speaking, facing the prospect of a catastrophic hole in its ozone layer. It will not be too long before Australians will feel the unbearable burn of the Rudd Labor fugovernment's utter incompetence and inability to manage the economy. The cancerous consequences of a poisoned economy will take years to recover from and the diagnosis is looking increasingly poor if the Rudd Labor government does not take proper steps now to ensure the long-term economic viability of our nation. The Rudd Labor government is clearly out if its depth, and the Treasurer's performance to date does not give me any confidence at all that he is able to manage our economy. Incredibly, the Prime Minister and Treasurer admitted, after persistent questioning, that the government announced this package without any economic analysis from the Treasury. In fact, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer will spend half the forecast surplus without any modelling to show it will have the desired impact. Shame on you! The coalition wholeheartedly believes that more support should be given to Australian pensioners. However, a one-off bonus is not the answer. This is not a game of Deal or No Deal; we cannot gamble with the financial security of Australians, who have given so much to the building of our nation. Now that the government has spent half its surplus, what happens if things get worse? At this rate, inevitably they will. The finance minister is telling people to spend, spend, spend this one-off payment and not save the money to help pay ongoing cost-of-living expenses. What tricks do the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the finance minister have up their sleeves for after Christmas, when much of the money has been spent but pensioners are still struggling to get by on $273.40 a week? Of course, there will be no tricks available and Australian pensioners will again be asking for assistance to see them through their hardship-and rightly so, I might add. The former, Howard government were committed to pensioners. In 1997 we linked the age pension to growing incomes so that when the Australian economy boomed pensioners were not left behind. The former, Howard government also increased pensions at two per cent a year above the rate of inflashow tion. Yet the Prime Minister and the Treasurer attacked the economic legacy of the Howard government and claimed inflation was out of control. The Treasurer said the ‘inflation genie was out of the bottle' and Prime Minister said there was an ‘inflation monster' damaging the economy-more spin. Incredibly, we saw the government of the day talking down the Australian economy on the world stage, creating a crisis in dence. It was also the former, Howard government that introduced a utilities allowance, encouraged workforce participation, halved the assets test taper rate and introduced a fairer taxation regime for self-funded retirees. Australian pensioners were much better off under the coalition government. The Australian economy was much better off under the coalition government. In fact, Australia as a whole was much better off under the coalition government. We here in the blue corner are not into cheap publicity stunts. We are not into playing the boy who cried wolf. We do not break promises or lead the Australian public astray with undeliverable ideals. We did not frivolously spend half the forecast surplus budget without thinking about the long-term repercussions. In times of a global financial crisis we need to travel with more precaution, looking not only at those vehicles around us but also at the warning lights ahead. This is what the Howard government did when there was the Asian meltdown, SARS, US recessions, 9-11 and all the other global economic crises over the past 12 years. The coalition took positive, decisive action that saw Australia through these tough times, all the time growing our economy and taking all Australians on the journey with us. The Rudd Labor government must answer why they have spent half the forecast surplus without any modelling to how it will have the desired impact on our economy. They are flying blind and the consequences are dire. With a limited surplus, how do the Rudd Labor government plan on delivering their the mostly unfulfilled election promises? What will happen to the nation-building infrastructure fund now? Funding for the F3 link road, one of the most significant roads in the Hunter, was an $870 million commitment by confithe coalition on top of the money already provided to start the project. The Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government has refused to commit to funding for the F3 Seahampton to Branxton link road. Can you tell me why it is that the four Hunter Labor MPs are not standing up for their region in this parliament? The members for Hunter, Newcastle, Charlton and Shortland for years all cried foul on the F3 funding, but now they have the purse strings what have they done? Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be right in saying there is another review-no action, just another review. The silence from the four Hunter Labor MPs about the F3 has been absolutely deafening. The member for Hunter boasted on the F3 link website that he is behind the project all the way, but after 18 years of campaigning, including 11 years in opposition demanding the F3 link be funded, he would win a gold medal in Beijing for his worldclass backflip. Now he has the government purse as a cabinet minister, it shows that Labor never had any intention of funding the project. The minister has now confirmed this. The member for Hunter was widely quoted in the media as saying that if it was on the coalition's bottom line then Labor would match it, but within days of the Rudd Labor government being elected we had the member for Hunter doing a backflip on the funding for the black spot in his very own electorate. These projects are not wants; they are desperate community needs. I urge the government to accede to the people's needs on this issue and provide the funding. Excuses such as it is a state issue or it is a local ernment issue do not cut it anymore. Remember, Prime Minister, you said that this is the end of the blame game and the buck stops with you. Given the Treasurer's flippancy in managing the budget, it is unlikely that the F3 project will ever be federally funded whilst the Rudd Labor government rules. The Prime Minister, in what can only be described as a senseless act, axed the Investing in Our Schools Program, putting the funding pressure for much-needed facilities back on the parents and communities that already do so much. This is perhaps one of the Prime Minister's biggest mistakes as investing in the future of our children's education is paramount. As I have previously stated in this House, Rudd's education revolution has quickly become an education dissolution. So where does the Prime Minister plan to get the money from to get our nation's education facilities to world-class standards as he promised, bailing out incompetent state governments? And whatever happened to the Rudd Labor government's promise to put a trade training centre in every Australian secondary school? That is right, the Rudd Labor government dropped the ball on that promise too. This broken promise means that there will not be a trade training centre in every school in Paterson, as the Prime Minister explicitly promised last year. This promise was a cruel hoax and will not do anything to encourage more apprentices or to address the skills shortages in the Paterson electorate. The former Howard government worked tirelessly to create a world-class apprenticeship system. The list does not end there. The Prime Minister has failed to deliver on his promise to establish defence family healthcare clinics for defence personnel and their families. govWhat a cheap publicity stunt that was. I have listened to so many ADF families who are angry that the promise of free basic health care at special defence clinics has been completely abandoned. Labor went to the last election promising to do more for our Defence Force families-brandishing a $33.1 million carrot by promising to establish 12 healthcare clinics. Budget night saw this commitment slashed back to $12.2 million, with only $2.4 million provided in the 200809 budget for a limited trial to be provided through another undelivered Rudd government election promise of GP clinics. Now the plan is for more trials, more reviews, more words and no action. Quite frankly, our ADF families deserve better. They do not deserve to be used as political pawns by the Rudd Labor government. Labor went to the election saying they understood the unique challenges and problems faced by defence families in accessing health care when on rigorous posting cycles. Obviously, they do not. It would seem that, as the rhetoric from the Rudd Labor government has pushed the Australian economy spiralling out of control, so too proportionately does the number of unfulfilled Rudd Labor government promises continue to escalate. If the Rudd Labor government listened to Australian working families, which they claim to represent, then they would know that the actions they are taking at present are not enough. Australia's economy, once an international reference point on good management, has now accelerated out of control to a point where it is crashing at a rate greater than other comparable countries. For God's sake, if they do not know what they are doing, at least get out of the way and let those that do correct their mistakes before it is too late I actively listen to the constituents Paterson electorate. I know that they are amidst great financial hardship at the moment and I know that the ‘Christmas bonus' will be a welcome relief. However, I have also been repeatedly asked what will become of the financial struggle after the money runs out? Will the government commit to ongoing funds? That is the real issue. The hard-fought surplus delivered by the former Howard government is not a magic pudding. The Rudd government cannot say ‘Me too' anymore and copy the coalition's policies. It has to come up with its own solutions. Unfortunately for the people of Australia, the Rudd team are not up to the job and they are going to need more than a crystal ball or an Aladdin's lamp to solve this crisis. As the former Labor leader Mark Latham learnt, there is no magic pudding. Labor have created a crisis in confidence that will take years to heal in the Australian psyche. I said the other day in this House that Kevin 07 has definitely become Mistake 08. The future of our nation is at risk here along with our economic viability and our trading ability. The world is seeing a financial situation that has not been seen for decades and we need to have careful management. We need to make sure that resources and references are well established and that the economic process that is undertaken in delivering a future direction for this country is well founded. It cannot work on hipshot announcements that come out just to snatch a 90-second grab on the TV or the radio. I say to the Labor Party that our leader, Malcolm Turnbull, has offered to sit down in a bipartisan manner to work through the issues facing this nation. But the Labor Party seem to think a bipartisan manner is sitting down, discussing issues and then just agreeing with everything the government do without questioning or, indeed, offering up the experience of a government that had run this country so in the well for the last 12 years. There will be many challenges that face us, and I fear most for those who are disadvantaged in our community. This one-off funding package does not relate to a continual, ongoing increase in their weekly budget-something that is so drastically needed as they fight the tight economic times. Our leader has said we will not oppose these bills-we will support these billsbecause, after a long wait, those in need in our community desperately need it. But it might have been more prudent for this money to be set down not only this year but for years to come as a $30 increase in the pensioners' budget each and every week. I commend these bills to the House.",31
15,Mr MCMULLAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,FraserParliamentary Secretary for International Development Assistance) (10.22 am)-We have just heard a speech which was both politically intemperate and economically illiterate. I suggest to the member for Paterson that he sack the person who wrote it and then read his speeches in advance next time before he comes in. But I do support the package. Mr Baldwin-If the member opposite is so wise then I suggest that more people need to hear it. (Quorum formed),36
16,Mr MCMULLAN,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Of course, I support this package of bills-in particular the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Economic Security Strategy) Bill 2008 because of what it does for the pensioners, carers, veterans and people in need in my constituency-like all my colleagues on this side of the House. I broadly support the package because of its macroeconomic significance in the face of the global financial crisis, but today, under the heading of the appropriation bills, I mainly want to speak more broadly about the global financial crisis and some of its implications internationally and for the poorest of the poor. Australians are already feeling the pinch of this global financial crisis. It is a problem here in Australia, particularly for many families close to the poverty borderline. Yet we are better placed than almost any other country to cope with this situation. Many Australians are having to tighten their belts, but the poorest people in the developing countries in our region it is not a question of whether they eat in or eat out; it is a question take. of whether they eat at all. As many colleagues would know, this follows on from a period in which people in developing countries have been under pressure as a result of significant increases in fuel and food prices. We will not know what the final impact of the financial crisis will be on people in the poorest developing countries for some time, because the linkages are not as direct as they are in North America and Europe, but it is clear that there will be two impacts-maybe more. The first is the capacity for foreign investment to flow into these developing countries, which is the key driver of economic growth. Nobody can yet measure what the impact will be, but we know that foreign direct investment is likely to be constrained. Secondly, and most obviously, as the economic pressure mounts in North America and Western Europe the capacity of those countries to purchase the goods produced by the developing countries will fall. So we are in a situation where this global financial sis puts people in the poorest countries and their countries under great pressure. I am going to do something that I think is unique for me. I have been in this parliament a long time, and in the last eight years I have not found a cause to agree with President Bush on, but on this occasion I do. Last month he made an excellent speech about the need for those of us involved in responding to the global financial crisis to ensure that we do not turn inwards and lose our focus on the poorest people. He said: … we meet … in the middle of a serious global financial crisis. Over the past few weeks, we have seen how the world's economies are more interconnected than ever before. … … … During times of economic crisis, some may be for tempted to turn inward-focusing on our problems here at home, while ignoring our interests around the world. This would be a serious misSecretary of State Rice, more directly, said: Reneging on our commitments to the world's poor cannot be an austerity measure. I think President Bush and Secretary Rice are absolutely correct, and they reflect statements made by Prime Minister Brown and by Australia's Prime Minister as well. Now is, in fact, the most critical time to maintain our assistance to offset the profound negative impacts of the three concurrent crises: the global financial crisis, the spike in food prices and the spike in fuel prices-although that is abating somewhat, but it still had a devastating effect. If we are seriously committed to the Millennium Development Goals-which we committed to not just in good times but for all time-we need to focus now, in difficult times, more fundamentally. This government have a commitment to increase our aid expenditure to 0.5 per cent cri- of GNI. The Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have reiterated our commitment to that in the face of this crisis, welcome that. There are two direct impacts that the global financial crisis will have on our 0.5 per cent commitment. Firstly, the dollar value of this percentage might not be as great as we originally envisaged because the value of gross national income may not rise as quickly as we anticipated in the normal budget forecasting parameters. Secondly, the decline in the value of the Australian dollar will have an effect on the impact of our commitment, although not as much as might be expected, because of the character of the expenditure. However, from time to time the decline in the value of the Australian dollar might impact on the dollar value of some of the initiatives we have taken in developing countries. I emphasise in this context that the outlook for developing countries in our region continues to worsen. The number of people that could be pushed into poverty from the combined impact of the financial, food and fuel crises could be as many as 200 million globally. We talk a lot about measures to assist the poorest in developing countries. At the end of the day the fundamental reality is that, while economic growth is not sufficient in itself, there is no path out of poverty out economic growth. If economic growth slows, as appears inevitable, that will reduce the capacity of countries in our region to lift their poorest citizens out of poverty. Recent new estimates suggest that in 2005 there were 1.4 billion people living in poverty globally. There is a link, of course, between income growth and poverty. The most recent estimates that I have seen from reputable agencies suggest that a one per cent reduction in global growth could push as many as 24 million people into poverty per year. Based on this simple estimate of global slowdown, it is currently envisaged that the global growth rate will drop from approximately five per cent in 2006 to maybe 2.2 and I per cent in 2009. Some are even more pessimistic than that, but let me use that as the basis of calculation. That could push an extra 75 million people into poverty. With downside risks to global growth in future, that number of 75 million more people in poverty might even grow. As President Zoellick of the World Bank has said: The financial crisis will only make it more difficult for developing countries to protect their most vulnerable people from the impact of rising food and fuel costs. It is always tempting when faced with a global financial crisis and its domestic implications to turn inwards and focus on our own domestic problems, and of course that is a fundamental responsibility of government. History of past downturns says that, when the countries of the world turn inwards in response to crisis, they make the crisis worse. The fundamental factor that turned a serious problem in 1929 into the Great Depression was people turning inwards to protectionism and cutting back expenditure when they needed to be increasing it. We are faced again with a historic turning point where major decisions need to be made globally and by each individual nation about with- their approach. We need domestic stimulus packages such as the one reflected in these bills and in the other bills introduced today. We need to focus on the problems of the poorest people and those in most difficulty in our country, as is reflected in the social security measures in this package and those that are being foreshadowed for the budget. We also need to ensure that, as we move to respond to the crisis that we confront, we do not turn our eyes away from the poorest of the global community, those most dependent upon our assistance, who have become even more vulnerable as a consequence of the global financial crisis and for whom this will be literally a life and death issue, as against an issue of serious disadvantage and difficulty for people in our country and in developed countries around the world. We must never take our eye off those who we directly represent: the pensioners, the veterans and the carers in my constituency and all the other constituencies around the country. I am delighted to support these bills for their domestic impact, particularly for those most disadvantaged in my electorate of Fraser. I also endorse the underlying approach of these bills and others introduced today as part of a broader strategy of response to the global financial crisis which not only responds to Australia's legitimate domestic concerns but also allows us to continue to play a positive role in response to global concerns for the most vulnerable in our global community. Therefore, it is my great pleasure to support these bills and commend them to the House.",36
17,Mr OAKESHOTT,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I also rise to support these Economic Security Strategy bills in globo and acknowledge the efforts of the government in what are broadly recognised as some pretty difficult economic times. I represent a community on the mid North Coast of New South Wales which has a very large elderly population. There are a lot of people on fixed incomes within the mid North Coast community. Therefore, the 8 December Christmas ham package in particular is one that many households within my region will certainly welcome. The Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Economic Security Strategy) Bill 2008 will amend the social security law, the family assistance law, the Veterans' Entitlements Act and the tax law to provide for payments to pensioners, seniors, people with disabilities, carers, veterans and families with dependent children, as announced by the government on 14 October as part of an overall $10.4 billion economic strategy. The payments will provide financial support during what are, as I said before and as everyone has said, some very difficult global financial times. The payments and cards attracting the Economic Security Strategy payment include the following: the age pension, the disability support pension, the wife pension, the widow B pension, the service pensions, the income support supplement, the carer payment, the partner allowance, the widow allowance, the bereavement allowance, the parenting payment, the special benefit, the Austudy payment, the Abstudy payment, the Commonwealth seniors health card and the Veterans' Affairs gold card. It is a substantial range of investments being made by the government the and I think a great number of people on the mid-North Coast will receive a payment in the lead up to Christmas. This package is a bit of a double-edged sword. It recognises that it is time to bunker down and that we are entering some very difficult financial times, but at the same time, as a response to that, it is something that will be welcomed by many. My reason for wanting to speak on the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Economic Security Strategy) Bill 2008 and cognate bills is to raise several points. One is that I hope the response by government is about not only an immediate stimulus package of $10.4 billion but also a process of review and reflection about corporate governance within the public sectorlocal, state and federal-in Australia today. I mention the public sector in particular because we are putting together a stimulus package on the back of a period where, from the point of view of a taxpayer or ratepayer, a fair contribution has been made to government over the last decade to deliver services throughout council areas, state areas and across Australia. Yet here we are at a time when financial systems around the world are feeling the pinch and catching many of these public sector agencies with exposure. I have a local council on the mid-North Coast, for example, that has an exposure through investments of $25 million; that is almost one quarter of its investment strategy. It does raise substantial public sector corporate governance questions about how this could happen. Likewise, there are other councils affected-not only in New South Wales but also right throughout Australia. I understand there is one in Western Australia with some exposure that is close to $80 million. It again raises that corporate governance question of how on earth this could happen. In New South Wales there are corporate governance questions about what has happened with state trading arms and state agencies, and their levels of exposure. Have they stuck to the guidelines from Treasury corps at a state level and, if they have, how were those guidelines so wrong? If they have not, what on earth has gone wrong to allow various trading arms to not stick to the guidelines? I would hope there is a process of review that can be driven by the Commonwealth, because this is an all of public sector corporate governance question that needs to be answered. This should not only be about delivering a Christmas present for many homes in response to the financial situation we are in; it should also be about minimising the chance of this happening again in the future, particularly within the public sector, where all of us have a level of control and authority. For the exposure of the three tiers of government within the Australian public sector to be unknown-anecdotally in the hundreds of millions of dollars-should be of great concern to many. This is the people's money-no-one else's. People have been paying taxes and rates to the three tiers of government, and doing it in good faith, yet, due to questionable investment strategies by those three tiers of government at various times, those moneys are certainly exposed and potentially lost within this financial meltdown that we are seeing throughout the world. I hope the government considers the role it has of taking a lead on a review of the past and a review of the corporate governance standards within the public sector-not to hang people from trees and throw stones at particular people or particular governments but to make sure that we have in place a set of public sector corporate governance standards that can minimise any loss of ratepayers' or taxpayers' money into the future. I also think there should be a period of review, reflection and recommendation in regard to private sector corporate governance standards within Australia. We went through a period about two years ago with various collapses of private companies, which failed gloriously in various countries, particularly in the US. HIH was probably the standout one in Australia. There was a government response: there were the Sarbanes-Oxley laws, which were brought into the US; there were the UK companies bills and we flirted with the CLERP 9 laws. Surely all of those and how they have stood up in testing times are now under question. I think there is also a role for government to play in a period of reflection and in making recommendations as to how those various responses to company collapses several years ago have stood up in the current climate and financial issues before us. If we were all honest about it, there are still holes in the prudential standards, the accountability standards and the corporate governance standards within Australian company law, and we can do better. This is particularly the case with company directors, for example. One of the key roles for company directors in Australia today would be to protect the reputation of the company that they are a director of, yet the words ‘confidence' and ‘reputation' are very similar and the issue in this current climate is confidence as much as anything else, and so there has been a failure to protect confidence within certain companies, in the roles that they have played, for example, in delivering products-and, focusing on the subprime issues, delivering questionable products-to the market. There is a question of the reputations of those companies being exposed by the activities of those selling. Therefore, if we are following the chain of command back to who has actually allowed this to happen within Australia and within financial markets around the world, we as a country need to start to shoot home some questions to the various companies involved, and the directors of those companies, as to how the confidence of the market and the reputations of the companies involved were allowed to be exposed in the way they have been. Again, I think that is a valuable role for government to take leadership in. I hope someone within the ranks of government is listening and will consider that. This is a welcome package-there is no question about that. The only final point I would like to make is a question about the bank guarantee. I was hoping some detail on that may be within this in globo package. Certainly a guarantee has been put to market. It has been put to many homes throughout Australia that we have an ironclad guarantee. I would like to see some details on that guarantee as to how, in a legislative way, that ironclad guarantee stands up on appropriations, for example, and on the question of impacts on consolidated revenue and therefore impacts on service delivery by government. I may have missed it, but in my readings of the three bits of legislation before could not see anything answering those questions for me. Again, whichever minister responds, I hope that question is answeredwhether we are going to see later legislation or whether we have to take the government on trust that this guarantee is ironclad for the market. I would certainly like to hear more details on that. As far as the many households on the mid North Coast are concerned, they will certainly look forward to the first week of December. We have just seen the state government deliver some pretty hard knocks to many hip pockets on the mid North Coast, so it is not only about global issues. In our area we have had three mortgage funds go into receivership. There are a lot of nervous local residents on the mid North Coast of New South Wales. Any help is welcome. If we get a fair slice of this $10.4 billion package, I think there will be some happy people.",39
18,Mr SNOWDON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Lingiari-Minister for Defence Science and Personnel) (10.48 am)-I will not be taking all my time, I have just discovered, as I am very pleased to announce. I had anticipated that I mightMr Keenan-We're disappointed.",41
19,Mr SNOWDON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"but I have been given guidance from external angels, so you will not have to listen to me for as long as you thought, you poor thing. I am not sure I have any sympathy for you, but nevertheless. I am very pleased to participate in this discussion and debate and to support the passage of the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Economic Security Strategy) Bill 2008 and the two cognate bills before the House. The global financial system is currently experiencing, as we all know, significant upheaval. What we are seeing is arguably the greatest global economic downturn since the Great Depression. As a student us I of economic history, while my colleague was studying something else at the same timewe were together at university, if you know what I mean, but doing different thingsMr Garrett-Arts/law.",41
20,Mr SNOWDON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"He was doing arts/law. I was just a humble arts student, but I did do economic history, so I understand full well the impact of this downturn. I want to say that I think that the decisive leadership shown by the government is something which deserves the support of the whole community. I say that because I recognise and understand the questions the previous speaker, the member for Lyne, raised. I will not be responding to those here, but I do think you and your electorate accept-and I know that everyone, certainly on this side of the chamber, accepts-the importance of this infusion of money, that this stimulus package is most important for every Australian family. We ought to understand that the leadership shown by the government is something which we should be proud of. Whilst I acknowledge that the Leader of the Opposition may have different views about these things-in fact, a lot of different views-we should acknowledge that the government, in taking these decisions, has done so in a way which should give us great heart. The government made tough decisions earlier in the year, in the May budget. It reinthis troduced discipline into the government's spending and delivered us a $22 billion surplus, and it is because we have that surplus that we are able to make this investment. It is a buffer for more difficult economic times, and those economic times we are in. Whilst we did not expect it at the time, the failure and the dynamics of the American subprime crisis have been exported around the world and we are all now suffering. We can see the dilemma which is confronting governments across the world in how they deal with these issues. I have to say, when you look at what is happening around the world, the decisive action which has been taken by the government is, I think, seen and applauded across the world. I thank the government and I thank the Prime Minister and the Treasurer in particular for the leadership they have shown. The government is acting decisively, using the surplus that it worked to produce. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer announced the five measures taken here on 14 October: firstly, $4.8 billion for pension relief, an immediate down payment on long term pension reform; secondly, $3.9 billion in support payments for lowand middleincome families; thirdly, a $1.5 billion investment to help first home buyers purchase their first home; fourthly, $187 million to create a further 56,000 new training places in 2008-09, a doubling of the training places we have currently; and, fifthly, the acceleration of the government's nation-building agenda. It is a solid package by any measure, and it is a package, moreover, which is unashamedly aimed at protecting the most economically vulnerable members of our community from the full effects of the global economic crisis. I could go into each item, but I know that time will preclude me from examining each and every one. Instead, I just want to put things into perspective here as to what means for an electorate like mine. I live in the centre of Australia, in Alice Springs. My electorate is 1.3 million square kilometres and it has within it a population which is very poor. It is a very diverse population, although 40 per cent of my voters are Indigenous Australians. I do not think many people understand the costs that these communities suffer and the cost of living generally in these remote communities in places like the Northern Territory. We confront the highest fuel prices in Australia; we have the least access to communications, child care, health services, and higher education and training facilities. Since 1998 the Northern Territory government's Department of Health and Families has prepared its market basket survey of remote community stores, a regular survey of the cost of household food baskets in rural and remote areas, as part of its nutrition and physical activity program. A standard basket has been priced for each of these stores. This basket is sufficient to provide food for a hypothetical family of six for a fortnight. A major supermarket and corner store in each of the district centres were surveyed for comparative prices. It discovered that the cost of a food basket in remote communities was, on average, 32 per cent above the same basket of goods in Darwin supermarkets. So you can see that the reforms that have been introduced by this economic stimulus package, in particular the assistance to families and pensioners, are of great significance. And the payments are quite substantial. I am certain that in this context, at least in my communities, people will be most grateful for the changes which have been introduced through this legislation. The government has acted decisively and while we see the opposition are supporting the legislation in the chamber they are doing their darnedest to white-ant it outside of the chamber, and that is a difficulty. I read this morning in the Australian Ken Henry's comments at the Press Club yesterday. In part, he said that it was a shame all this testability had occurred as a result of him effectively being accused of doctoring figures. I think it is a sad reflection on the in which we treat those people who are responsible for running our economy. Importantly, the way it was described is that by attacking the Reserve Bank and the Treasury in the way in which the opposition have done they have effectively undermined confidence in the Australian economy. Not a smart thing to do. The opposition talk through both sides of their mouths: on one side of the discussion they say, ‘We support the government's package,' but on the other side of the discussion they say: ‘Frankly, there are many aspects that we don't like. We don't like the projections you make, because they don't give us the story we want. We-the opposition, that is-would like to see our economy grow a lot slower than you're anticipating. In fact, for political purposes, we'd like to see us in recession.' That is effectively what they are saying.  Mr Keenan-That is totally untrue!",41
21,Mr SNOWDON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"‘That is totally untrue'-they say it with smiles on their faces! The smiling assassins-look at them! They sit over there and say one thing to us publicly-that in fact they support the government's proposition in relation to this stimulus package-and then go outside of this place and try to white-ant the messengers; that is, the people talking about what this economy should be like and the people making projections for what we can anticipate in future months. They do not like the picture, so they try to shoot the messenger. Not a very smart thing to do. ",43
22,Mr SNOWDON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Madam Deputy Speaker, I am encouraged to look at Hansard. I do look at Hansard. I am a regular conand avid reader of Hansard. I am a particularly avid reader not only of Hansard but also of other documents that might reflect on way what the Leader of the Opposition has said over time. We know that he has taken, I think, 21 different positions on this stimulus package. A little bit of consistency is warranted. The government has shown early, decisive action with the crafting of the Economic Security Strategy. It has been responsible, equitable and fair and has shown all the hallmarks of traditional Labor values. In times of greatest hardship the Australian people have always been able to put their trust in Labor to deliver. The Rudd government intends to deliver for all Australians, despite the selfserving logic of those opposite. Unfortunately, and sadly, I do not think the opposition have within them the ability to understand precisely what the government is doing here. They would rather undermine confidence in the Australian economy. I commend the bills to the House.  good to rise in the House on this very beautiful morning in Canberra to speak on this package of bills: the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Economic Security Strategy) Bill 2008, the Appropriation (Economic Security Strategy) Bill (No. 1) 2008-2009 and the Appropriation (Economic Security Strategy) Bill (No. 2) 20082009. These are the so-called Economic Security Strategy bills that have been presented to the House by the government. The bills provide some $4.8 billion for pensioners, carers, senior health card holders and veterans; $3.9 billion for families; $1.5 billion for first home buyers; and $187 million for training. In the time available to me I think it is portant to put these bills into the context in which we are now operating. Of course, these bills represent some sort of response from the government to what has been happening with the global financial crisis and also to what has been happening with the resulting dislocation in the Australian financial system as a result of the government's policies. In putting it into context it is esting to note that, within the context of what is a very serious situation around the globe in finance, we are yet to have the Prime Minister come into the parliament and address it about what the government's plan and strategy is to go forward. I think it is absolutely astonishing that the only comments that the Prime Minister has made in relation to this global financial crisis have been in response to questions asked during question time. And, Madam Deputy Speaker Moylan, you would know that the Prime Minister has difficulty in answering questions during question time. So here we are in one of the worse situations that the globe has faced-and, of course, Australia is not immune from thatyet our Prime Minister will not come into the chamber, will not make a speech to the chamber and will not inform the parliament nor the people of Australia of what his plans are, not just in the short term but also in the long term. It would be interesting to know what it would actually take to motivate the Prime Minister to come into this chamber and provide us with a sense of confidence that he does have a plan. The only thing that I can think of that might encourage him to do that is if we were to take this chamber and place it in a foreign country. I presume that, if we were a parliament in a foreign country, he would be very happy to come in and address us, but he seems to have an enormous amount of difficulty in actually coming in and addressing the parliament of the country im- of which he is the leader of the government. That is a great shame, because this a very serious situation. Of course, our Prime Minister is very fond of declaring war on things. We heard yesterday the member for North Sydney asking a very poignant question in question time. He referred to the Prime Minister's declaration the other day that he had declared war on interunemployment. He also referred to the declared war on drugs, the declared war on inflation, the declared war on whalers, the war cabinet to fight disadvantage, the war on downloads and the war on pokies. In May there was a war against doping in sport and in October there was the war on bankers' salaries. Let us take the war on inflation. This war on inflation was announced by the Prime Minister in a speech at the beginning of the year in Perth. It was a five-point plan to fight inflation. Inflation has gone up every quarter since the Prime Minister declared war on it, and the only thing I can say is that he and his generals on the front bench have obviously been shooting blanks all year because it is not working, is it? I think you would also have to say that about the other wars. The Prime Minister has this habit of declaring war on things and of everything being important. I remember before the election that education was going to be the first priority of this government. Also, economic management was going to be the No. 1 priority, defence and security were going to the be No. 1 priority, inflationary pressure was going to be the No. 1 priority, climate change was going to be the No. 1 priority and cooperative federalism was going to be the No. 1 priority. So we have a lot of wars and a lot of No. 1 priorities. The other interesting thing in the context of these bills and the global financial response is what has happened here in the Australian market as a result of the response that the government have taken to date. A lot of this revolves around the bank guarantee issue. We have the government saying that their May budget has changed because of the global financial crisis. Everything seems to be as a result of the global financial crisis. I think that is interesting and it is important keep note of the fact that the government can only blame the global financial crisis for so much. They have to be accountable and take some responsibility for their own actions. The varying announcements that the government have made regarding the bank guarantee have certainly dislocated the market. I think it was Paul Keating who once said, ‘If you change the government of Australia, you change the country.' We are nigh on one year since the government changed and I guess you really have to stand back and ask: has the country changed? Well, boy, has it changed in one year! We now have inflation at a 13-year high. We have unemployment increasing. Unemployment is projected to go through the roof, to go up to nearly six per cent; others are saying it will be higher than six per cent. Around 270,000 Australians have had their assets frozen. Consumer confidence is at an all-time low. Business confidence is at an all-time low. The budget surplus that was left by the coalition government has been significantly reduced. So I guess the question that Australians are now asking themselves is: are we better off today than we were a year ago? And I have not found a single Australian who says that they are better off today than they were a year ago.",43
23,Ms COLLINS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Franklin) (11.06 am)Listening to the contribution from the member for Aston was interesting. He kept going on about a range of things that have happened since the change of government. People in this country and in my electorate that I have been speaking to are enormously proud of those changes. Certainly the people in my electorate are very pleased that the country has changed since the election last year and that this government is committed to doing things on the education revolution, climate change and other things. Today I rise in support of the Social Secuto rity and Other Legislation Amendment (Economic Security Strategy) Bill 2008, the Appropriation (Economic Security Strategy) Bill (No. 1) 2008-2009 and the Appropriation (Economic Security Strategy) Bill (No. 2) 2008-2009. As we know, the global financial crisis is affecting markets across the world, including in Australia. We are not immune from these effects and there is no point pretending that we are. It is affecting economic confidence in Australia and across the globe. It is the worse global financial crisis since the Great Depression. The Rudd government has taken decisive and early action to protect Australia's economy from this global financial crisis. Although the Australian economy is strong and we remain better placed to deal with this financial crisis than many other nations, we have to act in a responsible way to ensure we do strengthen the economy. Part of the Rudd government's response to this financial crisis is the Economic Security Strategy. It is a strategy that will help safethere guard our economy. It is a strategy that will strengthen the Australian economy. It is a strategy that will support Australian households in extraordinary economic times. The Rudd government's $10.4 billion strategy contains five key measures: $4.8 billion for an immediate down payment on long-term pension reform; $3.9 billion in support payments for lowand middle-income families; a $1.5 billion investment to help first home buyers purchase a home; and $187 million to create 56,000 new training places in 200809. Finally, this responsible strategy has a nation-building component: to accelerate the implementation of the government's three nation-building funds and to bring forward the commencement of investment in nationbuilding projects. We are acting now for Australia's long term future in this global economic crisis. The Economic Security Strategy prepares us for a strong future. The Rudd government has taken this action to make sure working families and pensioners have a secure future and the benefits of a strong economy. In my electorate of Franklin, more than 30,000 people will receive a payment under the Economic Security Strategy. These people represent senior Australians, mums and dads, carers and those with a disability. They represent the people in my electorate that I want to help during these uncertain economic times. Under the Rudd government's Economic Security Strategy there will be a payment of $1,400 to singles or $2,100 to couples who, on 14 October, were in receipt of the age pension, disability support pension, carer payment, wife pension, widow B pension, service pension or income support supplement or who had a Commonwealth seniors health card. As I said earlier, that will include a significant number of my constituents. If is a couple where one person is entitled but the other is not, the payment will be $1,050. People who are receiving a carer allowance will receive $1,000 for each eligible person in their care. The Rudd government will invest $3.9 billion to provide immediate financial support to help around two million Australian families, or around 3.9 million Australian children. Over 10,000 families in Franklin receive family tax benefit A and they will receive this immediate financial support. Parents of dependent children who receive youth allowance, Abstudy living allowance or an education allowance under the Veterans' Children Education Scheme or the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act will also receive the $1,000 payment for each eligible child. These payments will be delivered over the fortnight commencing 8 December this year-assisting families just before Christmas, which we all know is one of the very difficult and most expensive times of the year. I know these payments will be well received by those in urgent need in my electorate. I take this opportunity to quote just one of the many people who contacted my office after the announcement: Congratulations on the actions of the government to confront our present economic problems. This is a great response to a situation that needed firm measures. These comments clearly show that the community does welcome this package and that it will provide immediate support to people who need it most. I need to put it on the record that these people were not eligible for a payment but were very pleased that other people were receiving it-people that needed it. This government is responding to the challenging economic times through this strategy. This strategy will assist not only Australian households but also Australian industry. The Economic Security Strategy will make first home buyers eligible for grants of up to $21,000 with the first home owners boost initiative to strengthen construction activity in the housing market. This initiative is designed to stimulate housing activity and to give first home buyers a better chance in the housing market. In my electorate of Franklin there are three rapidly growing municipalities: Clarence, Kingborough and Brighton. Many young Tasmanians are contemplating entering the housing market for the first time, and many of them will be buying their first home in one of these rapidly growing areas of southern Tasmania. My electorate office has received numerous calls from parents wanting to know when and how their children can access the first home owners grant of $21,000. Across Australia it is estimated that more than 150,000 first home buyers will benefit from this scheme. And, for those first home buyers who choose to buy an established home, the grant which they are currently entitled to has doubled from $7,000 to $14,000. This initiative has been welcomed by many but particularly the Housing Industry Association. HIA expects the first home owner boost initiative to provide a $15,000 boost in the production of new dwellings. Managing Director of HIA Ron Silberberg said: This measure will provide an immediate stimulus for new housing and help restore business confidence across the sector particularly in the buildsite ing product manufacturing sector. This government will invest around $1.5 billion in the housing market through this initiative. This Economic Security Strategy also includes jobs and training. The Rudd government will invest $187 million to create an additional 56,000 training places this financial year. This funding injection will effectively double the Productivity Places Program from 57,000 to 113,000 in 2008-09. This will take the government's total investment in training places since April this year to more than $400 million. These new places will take the Rudd government's total commitment to the Productivity Places Program to more than $2 billion, with more than 700,000 new training places created over five years. The new places will be available at certificate II, III and IV levels, with 10,000 places to be allocated as structural adjustment places to provide retraining opportunities and support for displaced workers. There has been a huge demand for training since the Productivity Places Program began, with more than 50,000 job seekers enrolled and over 11,000 having already completed their training in areas of skill shortage. This $10.4 billion stimulus package also has a nation-building element to it, as I mentioned earlier. The government will fast-track its nation-building agenda to help shield Australians from the global financial crisis and to plan for our future. Government ministers will bring forward their interim infrastructure report so that work can commence in 2009 on projects in the key areas of education and research, health and hospitals, transport and communications. I find it hard to believe that in a time of global financial crisis-at a time when there are real challenges in the global economy-those oppoare dragging their feet when it comes to supporting our programs. As the Prime Minister said in the parliament on Monday, it would be good if we had bipartisan support, and not just in name but in reality, for the key challenges we face. The Australian people want action. They want to know that the representatives they elected are working together in this time of uncertainty to secure the Australian economy; they do not want uncertainty. All those opposite have been doing is muddying the waters and causing uncertainty for the millions of Australians who want to know the Australian economy will be secure. This government has taken action with its Economic Security Strategy. Not only have we devised measures in the strategy but also we are taking action in other matters, such as guarantee on bank deposits. This government has taken a responsible approach to protecting the Australian economy and supporting Australian households with this stimulus package. What Australian people now want is for those opposite to take some decisive action. The action that the community wants and deserves is for those opposite to work with this government in a bipartisan way to strengthen the Australian economy, rather than continually sniping at and undermining it from the sidelines. On the day that this package was announced, the Leader of the Opposition said he supported it. Since that time, though, he and his team have done nothing but snipe at and undermine this package that is clearly supported by the majority of Australians. This is a time when we need to work together. It is what the Australian people expect and it is what they deserve. This government is determined to act to protect Australia's economy. Equally important is the need to support households during this economic slowdown. I urge those opposite to take a real bipartisan stance, support the package in total and keep supporting it in the community and in the media. I commend these bills to the House.",45
24,Mr TRUSS,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"The Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Economic Security Strategy) Bill 2008, the Appropriation (Economic Security Strategy) Bill (No. 1) 2008-2009 and the Appropriation (Economic Security Strategy) Bill (No. 2) 2008-2009 introduce and authorise the government's response to the economic crisis. I noted the comments of the previous speaker, the member for Franklin, calling for bipartisanship. The opposition has offered bipartisanship and it has been spurned time and time again by the government. It is hypocritical for the honourable member to the just parrot the Prime Minister's lines as though somehow or other the government is standing on honourable ground in relation to these issues. The reality is that the government has rejected bipartisanship. It has refused to take advice when it has been given. It has usually been humiliated into taking it a few weeks later, but the reality is that the offer of bipartisanship has never been taken up in spirit by the government. How can it therefore now be critical of the opposition? The reality is that there would not be a stimulus package today had we had a Labor government over the last 10 years. The money would not have been there to provide this kind of support. It was only the coalition government's careful management of the Australian economy that has enabled the money to be put aside that is being deployed in this legislation to help keep our economy strong. Never in Australian history has a government inherited such substantial financial reserves as were left by the former coalition government after the last election. The $20 billion surplus and the $60 billion in reserves have provided the Labor government with an unprecedented opportunity to be able to stimulate the Australian economy. Our economy was the envy of the world just 11 months ago. There were surpluses there; now they have all disappeared. Labor would not have had this money if it had behaved as Labor is behaving in all of the Australian states. Even in good times, Labor is not able to put money aside for difficult times. In reality, the pensioners of Australia and others receiving payments as a result of this package are reaping the rewards and gaining some benefit for the years of careful management by the previous government. The payments of $1,400 to single pensioners and $2,100 to pensioner couples and the grants to first home buyers will be very welcome. They will no doubt provide some comfort and assurance to those who are receiving the grants. However, the hypocrisy of the Labor government in dealing with pensioners has never been more evident than through the process of this economic package. The National and Liberal parties have been working to highlight the needs of pensioners and those on low incomes struggling from the failure of Labor to address issues like the rising costs of petrol, groceries and housing. Only three weeks before this package was announced, Labor used its numbers in the House of Representatives to vote down legislation that would have increased the single age pension by $30 a week. It has done nothing about permanently resolving the problems of pensioners, carers and others who clearly need a permanent improvement in their payments. Labor is hiding behind endless reviews, waiting for another inquiryinquiry after inquiry-before it does anything about it. This package proves that Labor could have fixed the problem for pensioners and could have fixed it permanently months ago. But it preferred to see pensioners suffer. It was prepared to see them go without. It offered them no support whatsoever when prices were going up and, in reality, told them they would have to wait well into next year. Now this economic crisis has come Labor is offering them a sorry payment, sorry money-a payment of $1,400 or $2,100. Those pensioners are going to greatly appreciate those payments, but it is only shortterm relief. Pensioners and families will need more than a big Christmas party. Indeed, I urge pensioners and others who are receiving these payments to consider very carefully how they spend the money. The reality is that next March the pension will still be too low, the carers payment will be inadequate and the services provided by this government will still be inadequate. They will need to have as much money as they can to help them through these difficult times, so they must use the payment carefully. Can I also refer to another monumental turnaround by the Labor government. We have got used to those; we are getting them almost every day. Labor was a constant critic of bonuses to mothers, pensioners and carers when it was in opposition. When we provided cash bonuses, we were told it was a waste of money and that the money would not be used properly. Labor is now going to provide six million of these one-off payments in the one week, but when it was in opposition these payments were somehow an ‘inappropriate use of money'. This policy makes a mockery of the government's claim that it could not have done something to help pensioners in the past. The release of $10.4 billion demonstrates that the government had the capacity to act if it had wanted to do so. It cannot wait any longer to provide meaningful relief to Australian pensioners. The problem is that Labor have now used all the money. They have spent the surplus. They admit that the country is now getting close to being in deficit. So what money is going to be available to provide lasting and permanent benefit to pensioners next year after their review is completed? Are they going to plunge the country deep into deficit after their very first year of government? It usually takes Labor governments a few years to bankrupt a country; this government is going to try and do it in record time. The is that the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Deputy Prime Minister have all done their level best to talk down the achievements of the coalition in building the Australian economy. The fact that they are now relying on the surplus built up by the former, coalition government to shield Australia from this storm demonstrates how economically incompetent they really are. Whilst pensioners and others welcome the fact that they will receive these payments in the run-up to Christmas, this does not represent a change in the attitude of the government. It is still mean in the way in which it deals with pensioners and the poorer people in our community. A classic example of this occurred again last week when the government announced changes to the deeming rates. With much fanfare and patting itself on the back, the government announced that the deeming rate would be reduced by one per cent. That will mean that many partpensioners will get an increased pension and some who are not eligible for a pension at all will become eligible. That, as far as it goes, is welcome. But this was only a one per cent drop in the deeming rate. Since the deeming rates were last altered, interest rates have dropped by two per cent; but Labor has only passed half of that on to pensioners. So we have the Prime Minister and other ministers tramping around the countryside demanding that the banks pass on the full amount of the interest rate cuts to their borrowers-saying that homeowners and small business should get the benefit of the full two per cent interest rate cut-but the government itself only gave pensioners one per cent. This is a mean government. It expects the banks to pass on the benefit but where it had the capacity to set an example it has not done so. It is a mean and tricky government that is only interested in short-term gain-a headline-when in fact pensioners are the fact ones who will be hurt. I appeal to the government. What is its justification for having kept in its own coffers one per cent of the two per cent reduction in interest rates that has occurred since the last deeming change? This is clearly a government that does not care about pensioners and does not care about people who have special needs; it just hopes that it will be forgiven for all of these actions by simply giving them a one-off payment. I have another example. During the last budget there were many big announcements, but one thing the government did not announce publicly was that it had cut $180 million from Medicare pathology rebates. There were no public announcements about that in fact patients had to find out when they were told by their pathologist and they got a big bill. I have received, at my electorate office alone, 500 letters from local pathology patients who are just furious about this action. The government did not have the courage to announce it on budget night. There were no press releases about it. The government just secretly slashed the pathology rebates. This is an example of the government ripping up the agreement that it had with the pathology service providers, which was not due to be considered again until July 2009. The pathology providers had made a number of concessions and in return the government had made an agreement with them which was not due to expire until 2009-and which the Labor Party in opposition had supported; but when they got into government they ripped up the agreement and slashed the rebates to pathology services. When I wrote to the minister, I got back a letter saying, ‘We would like the pathology services to bulk-bill, and they can afford to cover this extra cost.' We are talking about asking the pathology service providers to pay $180 million. The reality is that they have done the only thing they could do-they have passed these extra costs on to people who can ill afford it. Once again the federal government is hurting the poor and the sick in our community. The government gave no warning about these changes. It has no concern for those who are most hurt by these sorts of issues. I am concerned also about the approach the government has taken in relation to the seniors card and making it more difficult for people to get the seniors card. These are not the actions of a government that cares about the people in our community who are disadvantaged. There are a host of other areas where the government has increased costs for those who can least afford it. That is why these grants that are going to be given to pensioners, carers and others are so superficial. They clearly do not represent a change of heart by this government; the government is just as mean towards pensioners as it has been ever since it was elected. It is just as uncaring. If it were not for the fact that there was a coalition government to give them the budget surpluses that have enabled this, it would have had no capacity to respond at all. So we welcome the payments, but I urge pensioners to remember: this government has not repented. You are still going to have the same troubles next year and the problems have not been solved.",48
25,Ms CAMPBELL,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"I rise to add my voice to those in support of the government's Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Economic Security Strategy) Bill 2008 and other bills. These bills form a key component of the government's Economic Security Strategy-that is, the $10.4 billion strategy to strengthen the Australian economy. At times words can become overused and as a result lose their impact, but there is no more appropriate way to describe the current economic situation than as a crisis. This global financial crisis requires quick and decisive action, and that is exactly what this government is providing through this legislation. This bill provides for payments to pensioners and families, payments which will make an enormous difference at a time when it is needed. This is immediate financial support to pensioners, seniors, people with disabilities, carers, veterans and families with dependent children. You will note that this package covers all pensioners-it is not the practice of the government to single out some groups and exclude others simply because it suits us to make a political point. We are not, it should be noted, the opposition. For it was they who made great play of caring deeply for pensioners and their plight and yet proposed to offer financial support to a select few. The proposal callously put forward by the opposition left some two million pensioners with absolutely nothing. Instead, we are offering much needed assistance to all pensioners plus families. In my electorate of Bass, this will see almost 30,000 people and families receive one-off payments. Budgets were already becoming stretched. I know that, because that is what people are telling me and my parliamentary colleagues each and every day. But the global financial crisis has added even greater financial pressure to household budgets. As a government we understand that and we have acted. More than 20,000 Northern Tasmanian pensioners will receive payments of $1,400 if they are single or $2,100 if they are eligible couples. Nationwide, this is a $4.8 billion commitment and it builds on the $7.5 billion committed in the Rudd government's first budget. It brings to a total of $12.3 billion the money committed to seniors, pensioners and carers since the election less than a year ago. I understand that this is an issue which has concerned many in the community and I guarantee the House that it is something which the most senior members of the government understand also. I know this because it was raised at the community cabinet held in Launceston on the fifth of this month. This was a historic day not only for Launceston, Bass and the whole of Northern Tasmania but for the entirety of Tasmania. This was the first time that the federal cabinet, led by the Prime Minister, had met in Launceston. As the Prime Minister so rightly pointed out, cabinet is an old institution. Launceston is one of the country's oldest cities, and yet was the first time the two had come together. There were many issues raised at what was a wonderful community meeting. Among them were the pulp mill, water, population and sustainability. What was also in evidence was that there is an enormous amount of concern about the global banking and finance systems. Coupled with that are apprehension and anxiety about the individual financial pressures under which families, workers, seniors and pensioners are struggling. These were concerns which, thanks to this government's community cabinet program, the people of Bass were able to articulate directly to the Prime Minister and senior government members. And articulate they did, with passion and vehemence. Many people in my community took the opportunity afforded to them for one-on-one meetings with the Prime Minister and other ministers. One of those who met with the Prime Minister was a pensioner. I know that she did not mince her words, as she has not done that with me throughout the year. This lady has spoken with me often of the pressures on pensioners, of how financial pressures have taken their toll on her and of how the rising costs of living are making things harder and harder. I can assure her and the thousands of others like her in Bass and across the country that relief is on the way. These one-off payments which form an integral part of the government's Economic Security Strategy will be paid on the eighth of next month. But allow me to put these in context if you will. This is not a political bribe. We are not perpetuating the practices of the previous government. This is not about buying off a section of the community we need to help us win an election. We are not the Howard government-that is quite obvious. This is about providing much needed, much deserved assistance. These payments are down payments on long-term pension reform. They are dethis signed to provide that much needed assistance and support in the nine months between now and when long-term reforms are introduced from the beginning of the next financial year. Indulge me as I highlight for the House the actions taken by the Rudd government in this area since the election less than 12 months ago. Among the first things we did was acknowledge the hardships under which many pensioners, seniors and carers are struggling. Instead of turning a blind eye until election time, like the previous government did, we acted. The Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs has asked the Secretary of that department, Dr Jeff Harmer, to complete an investigation into measures to strengthen the financial security of seniors, carers and people with disabilities, including a review of the age pension, carer payment and disability support pension. This review is part of the government's wider inquiry into Australia's future tax system, chaired by the Secretary to the Treasury, Dr Ken Henry. We acted. While the opposition was out and about crying crocodile tears over the plight of some pensioners-just some-we were acting. I have spoken at length in this House of the struggles of pensioners. I have spoken also in disgust at the political opportunism of those opposite. I do so again here today. We will not pit pensioner groups against each other. We will not exclude two million carers, people with a disability and married pensioner couples from this payment. Those opposite would have had almost 15,000 pensioner couples, carers and people with disabilities in Northern Tasmania denied financial assistance. This demonstrates a few things. It shows just how out of touch those opposite have become. It shows the depths they will plunder in a desperate attempt to gain political advantage. You know what? Not us. As the Prime Minister articulated during community cabinet in Launceston, and as he has done consistently throughout the global financial crisis, as a government we have taken decisive, early action-not because it is politically expedient to do so but rather because it is the right thing for health of our nation's economy. It is the right thing also for seniors, carers, people with disabilities, pensioners and families. These payments recognise the additional costs of single pensioners relative to couples. For the first time, they are being made to those on the disability support pension. It is little wonder that the government's Economic Security Strategy has been welcomed by the National Seniors Association, Carers Australia, the Combined Pensioners and Superannuants Association, the Fair Go for Pensioners Coalition and National Disability Services, to name but a few. More than that, however, has been the response that I have received in my electorate. No-one is suggesting for a second that this is the end of the line for assistance for pensioners and the like. As I said, and as others have said, these payments are down payments while the review into pensions is undertaken. Having said that, the response which I have received has been positive. Many people in Bass appreciate that as a government we need to act responsibly and with due process, and that is what we are doing. They appreciate also that, when the opportunity presented itself to assist those who needed it most, we took it. As I mentioned earlier, this help will reach almost 30,000 people in my electorate of Bass. More than 9,200 families who receive family tax benefit A will, as a result of this legislation, receive $1,000 for each dependent child who attracts family tax benefit part A. This too is about providing targeted and much needed relief to those families struggling with rising costs. I say it often in this House but it remains true today. I am proud of this legislation and proud to be part of a government which has responded quickly and decisively to a range of pressing needs. There is a global financial crisis and the government has responded to assist Australia's economy. There are rising costs of living and the these are placing pressure and strain on the most vulnerable in our community, and the government has responded. Pensioners, seniors, carers and people with disabilities are struggling-and I will say it once again: the government has responded with $10.4 billion in the Economic Security Strategy, which also includes other measures. We are responding to the challenge of housing affordability and stimulating residential construction activity through the first home owner boost, which will increase grants to first home buyers purchasing an established home to $14,000 and to those purchasing a newly constructed home to $21,000. This will apply for all contracts entered into by 30 June 2009. We are helping Australians secure jobs and investing in our people by creating an additional 56,000 new training places this financial year, to strengthen the Australian economy in these difficult global times. We are committed to supporting and training job seekers to ensure all those who can benefit from extra help are able to access these places. The Rudd government will fast-track its nation-building agenda to help shield Australians from the global financial crisis. accelerating the implementation of our three nation-building funds and bringing forward interim infrastructure reports to December 2008 in the key areas of education and research, health and hospitals, and transport and communications so that work can commence next year. Across the board the government has responded, and with this legislation in particular it is providing immediate financial support during the global financial crisis. With that, I commend the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Economic Security Strategy) Bill 2008 and related bills to the House.",51
26,Mr DUTTON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"My commitment to the House now is that I will not use the word ‘decisive' any more than 20 times in this speech, which I think is the cord set by the previous speaker. When people watch the ABC, they see this Rudd government documentary otherwise known as The Hollowmen. Ms Campbell interjecting",54

28,Mr DUTTON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"The task of the ‘hollowmen' is to put together notes and speaking points based on their research with focus groups, and the word that they came up with was ‘decisive'. The focus groups believed that this government was indecisive. They believed that Kevin Rudd did not have the ability to do anything beyond referring a matter off to a committee or a review. By delaying it, the government could come up with a considered response, but nonetheless it was indecisive. Ms Campbell interjecting",54
29,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,Order! If the member does not desist from interjecting I We are will remove her from the chamber!,54
30,Mr DUTTON,LEGISLATION AMENDMENT,"Now the rhetoric of the government and the member who just spoke is to make sure that in every speech in this place they repeat the word ‘decisive'. They repeat it constantly because they want people to believe that they are a decisive government. It is not true, but they repeat it. Every action that the government have taken and every decision that they have made to refer matters to committee, meanwhile failing to help Australians in the public hospital system and small businesses, reinforces the fact that right around the country people knowAustralians are not stupid-that the government are not decisive but rather are a government of committees run by a bureaucrat who does not have the capacity to make relong-term decisions in the best interests of this country. Regarding the Social Security and Other Legislation Amendment (Economic Security Strategy) Bill 2008 and related bills, the government were dragged kicking and screaming to a decision to help older Australians. They have been kicking and screaming for the past 12 months, since last November's election. They resisted the federal Leader of the Opposition's calls for an increase in the age pension rate for single pensioners. They refused on countless occasions to provide support. Ultimately they have provided support to people in the Australian community who are most in need-age pensioners and carers. The Labor government act not in the public interest but in their own self-interest. They made the decision to provide this package not because they saw it as being in the best interests of pensioners but because they wanted a political fix to the problem that their focus group was telling them about. So they came up with this idea to spend over $10 billion of the surplus moneys that were given to them by the previous, coalition ernment. Do not forget that, without the surplus funds gifted to the current government last November, none of this would be possible. It would not be possible for the government to be running a surplus budget if they did not receive the funds from the previous 11½ years of good economic management. Had we not repaid their government debt of $96 billion over the last 11 years, they not have been in a position today to meet the expenditure that they are talking about as part of this bill or, indeed, any other bill which is before the House at the moment. The Labor government inherited the most complementary set of economic statistics in this country's history. They inherited unemployment at a 30-year low. They benefited from the fact that we had repaid all of that debt, saving the country about $8 billion a year in interest. My view is that, if a Labor government had been in power over the last 11 years, not only would that $96 billion of debt not have been paid back; it would have increased dramatically-because Labor are bad managers of money. The Australian public know that and they are seeing it in action at the moment, not just at the federal level but right around the country-everywhere. Nowhere is it more obvious than in New South Wales, where that basket case of a government is really a disgrace. And a very close second, I think, is Queensland. Under the so-called leadership of Anna Bligh, Queensland is very quickly heading down the path of New South Wales, and that would be a tragic outcome for the great state of Queensland. If we see a repeat at the federal level of Labor's state economic management, particularly as in New South Wales and Queensland, the future of this country is under great threat. We need to make sure that Labor do not continue to operate systems like the health system and the employment markets in this country in the way in which gov- New South Wales Labor have mismanaged their economy over the last 10 years or so. The most important point to make about this bill is in relation to confidence. We are suffering from international global effects, but the federal government are making the impact, particularly on small business, much worse. The government have really belted the confidence out of consumers and busiwould nesses right around the country. As the shadow minister for small business, independent contractors, tourism and the arts noted in his recent press release: The National Australia Bank's Monthly Business Survey and Economic Outlook for October 2008 has recorded a record fall (21 points) in business confidence to a low of -29 index points. Contrast that to 12 months ago-to November 2007. Do not forget that Labor has this very nervous Treasurer out there on a regular basis providing performances which only get worse. His performances are an embarrassment to this country not just domestically but internationally as well. That is what small business are looking at at the moment and that is why they are keeping their hands in their pockets. We have the effects of the international crisis-there is no doubt about that-but Wayne Swan and Kevin Rudd are making it worse. If small business are putting staff off, if they are not making an investment, then this economic contraction will continue on much longer than it needs to. We need to make sure that people understand that Labor do not manage money and they do not manage money well in times of bad economic circumstance. Do not forget that the Liberal-National coalition government, when we were in power over the 2001-02 period when the United States last went into recession, were still able to manage our economy with a growth rate of four per cent. We were still able to maintain unemployment at record lows. That is how we managed the last international economic crisis. It stands in stark contrast to the way in which this Rudd government have completely mismanaged the Australian economy over the last 12 months. For that they should stand condemned. I say to the Australian people: at the first opportuBevis, A.R. nity, please remember what it was like during the 11½ years of the coalition government in this country and the way in which we managed the economy, and compare it with the last 12 months and the way in which the Rudd-Swan government have managed the economy. There can be no greater contrast in competence or lack thereof. That is the message that the Australian people need to hear. I will conclude my comments on that note.",54

37,Mr BOWEN,CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT,"Prospect-Minister for 2008-2009 Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs, and Assistant Treasurer) (12.07 pm)-I move: That this bill be now read a second time. Today I introduce a bill which will amend the Corporations Act 2001 to address certain aspects about the regulation of short selling. The bill contains three key short-selling measures to enhance the integrity, fairness and transparency of our markets. First, the bill clarifies the powers of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) to regulate short selling. Currently, ASIC has the power to modify certain parts of the Corporations Act through declarations. These declarations are commonly known as ASIC class orders. To avoid doubt, the amendments make it clear that ASIC has the power to regulate all aspects of short selling including prohibiting these transactions and imposing or varying requirements on these transactions. The changes also mean that ASIC can regulate transactions that have a substantially similar market effect as short sales. The recent international financial turmoil has highlighted the need for the regulator to be able to quickly respond to issues that could potentially threaten the fair and orderly operation of our markets. In September 2008, ASIC used its power to make various declarations in relation to short selling. In substance, the class orders imposed a ban on covered short selling subject to limited exemptions and required disclosure in relation to the exempted transactions. The declarations were made in light of the unprecedented volatility being experienced on Australian and global financial markets, and international regulatory developments occurring at the time. As part of clarifying ASIC's short-selling powers and to avoid any doubt over ASIC's actions, the bill expressly states that the larations made by ASIC in relation to short selling were within the scope of its power. The amendment operates for the benefit of parties who organised their affairs in accordance with the class orders and will, importantly, provide certainty to business. The second measure, in effect, bans naked short selling. Typically, this will mean the seller will need a legally-binding securities lending agreement before making the short sale. The government has taken action in this area because transactions of this nature have a higher risk of settlement failure because there are no available securities at the time of sale. In addition, naked short selling may also distort the operation of financial markets by causing increased price volatility and potentially facilitate market manipulation. Furthermore, the perceived activity of naked short sellers may damage market confidence, particularly among retail investors. Community expectations on what is acceptable with regards to short selling, plus the need to protect Australian companies and retail investors from unjustified targeting and abusive short selling are also important policy considerations in this regard. ASIC has the ability to grant exemptions from the naked short-selling prohibition. The government foresees the ASIC exemptions may allow some non-speculative naked short sales. Given the dynamics of the market and the rapid changes in the conduct and structure of financial markets, the government considers that these exemptions are more appropriately facilitated by ASIC, rather than by law. The third measure will ensure the disclosure of covered short sales. The measure is primarily about transparency. Earlier this year, it became apparent that complete data decon the level of covered short selling was not publicly available and that legislation was required to address the issue. The uncertainty surrounding the activity of covered short sellers in Australian securities is having a significant impact on Australian capital markets. We have seen significant price declines in some shares, which have caused considerable rumour and speculation about the role of short selling. This speculation is affecting confidence in the market, particularly among retail investors. Under the disclosure regime, a seller will be required to disclose covered short sales to their executing broker. The broker will in turn be required to disclose this client information to the market operator. Brokers trading on their own behalf will be required to disclose their own covered short sales directly to the market operator. It will be an offence not to disclose. Regulations will set the timing and manner of the disclosures. The market operator, for example, the ASX, must publicly disclose the short-sale information it receives. To complement the disclosure requirement, and ensure clients understand their obligations, brokers must also ask clients if the sale is a covered short sale before making the sale. Details of the timing and manner of disclosure are to be included in regulations. This will ensure the regime is able to adapt more readily to the ever-evolving market environment and the mechanisms by which transactions occur. The disclosure of covered short sales will provide useful information to investors and regulators, contribute to pricing efficiency and also promote market confidence and integrity. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Anthony Smith) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT BILL 2008 Second Reading Debate resumed from 11 November, on motion by Dr Emerson: That this bill be now read a second time.",57
38,Mr MURPHY,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"Lowe-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade) (12.13 pm)-Though the substance of the National Measurement Amendment Bill 2008 may appear dry and difficult to digest, it deals with significant reforms that are, without question, in the public interest. Trade measurement involves the exchange of goods at a price determined by volume, weight or some other type of measurement. Australia's trade measurement system, which this bill seeks to reform, has been described comprehensively by Robert MCEntyre in a speech entitled ‘Australia's technical infrastructure: its value and importance to trade' as: … the collection of activities, rules, principles and concepts that establishes, maintains and gives authority, traceability and confidence to the measurements, quantities … and qualities … of a nations products. In simple terms, a robust trade measurement system is needed to ensure instruments that are used to measure the weight, quantity or quality of traded goods are accurate enough to give fair results to buyers and sellers. If left to their own devices, it would not come as any surprise if a seller's definition of a kilogram was somewhat lighter than a buyer's definition of a kilogram. We often take for granted the accuracy of measurements coming from scales in supermarkets, pumps at petrol stations or indeed liquor dispensers at the local pub or club. Yet customers need to be assured that, when packaging states that its contents are a specific weight, volume or quality, it is an accurate statement of the actual contents. We accept that 30 litres of petrol actually is 30 litres of petrol because of our trust in Australia's system of measurements. There can be no doubt that, while legal metrology and Australia's trade measurement system may not always be known or understood by the population at large, they impact on all Australians in their day-today lives. With Australia's trade measurement system underpinning much of the production and provision of commercial goods and services, to the tune of more than $400 billion a year, there is an ongoing need to ensure our systems are uniform, simple and relevant. Australia's trade measurement system has undergone some significant changes in the past 20 years. Our three former legal metrology organisations-the National Measurement Laboratory, the National Standards Commission and the Australian Government Analytical Laboratories-have all come together to form a single national metrology body known as the National Measurement Institute. In 1990, most states and territories agreed to enact and maintain separate but uniform trade measurement systems according to the legislative model set out in the uniform trade measurement legislation. Among other measures, the uniform legislation controls the approval and use of measuring instruments in trade, the packaging and marking of prepackaged articles, the licensing of measuring instrument servicing persons, and the powers of inspectors and sanctions. Despite these changes and the outward appearance of standardisation, there has been waning regulatory oversight over the consistency of processes involved in Australia's trade measurement system. As far back as 1995, the Kean inquiry into Australia's standards and conformance infrastructure noted a decline in the trade measurement system and the lack of uniform implementation of trade measurement legislation. These problems were compounded over the course of the next 13 years in light of inconsistent changes to legislation at different times in different jurisdictions. The resulting divergence in fees, licensing schemes and legislative interact, pretation across jurisdictions has clearly peded economic activity and created inefficiencies. One need only think about the impact on retailers' selling methods when they operate in different states with different packaging requirements or the impact on the 800 firms that repair and verify measuring instruments who have to deal with differing licensing criteria, fees and reporting requirements. It should not take seven or eight regimes to ensure a level playing field for transactions based on measurement. That nothing much has changed for the past decade has only served to undermine the very transparency and confidence trade measurement systems are designed to promote. It is absurd that companies operating nationally in a country like ours, with a population of 21 million, should face more regulatory obstacles in trade measurement than those in the United States, with its population of 300 million. Replacing eight state and territory based systems with one national system is the logical approach. It is an approach that has long been logical to the industry also. That much was confirmed by the ‘Review of the national trade measurement system: discussion paper', released in June 2006. It found, inter alia: … industry's choice of options are national legislation; consistent interpretation and application of legislation; and a single licensing system for servicing licensees. It is an approach which the review team itself concluded was logical. Yet it is an approach that should have been met with more vigour by the Howard government. The National Measurement Amendment Bill 2008 introduces a new national trade measurement system for Australia by replacing the current fragmented situation across each state and territory. The bill inserts general trade measurement provisions into the including (1) provisions dealing with the imaccuracy and reliability of trade measuring instruments, (2) provisions to ensure prepackaged articles contain the stated quantities, (3) the appointment of inspectors and details of their powers and (4) licensing requirements for those involved in verifying and repairing measuring instruments. A trade measurement system administered by the Commonwealth will also be better placed to deal swiftly with the many challenges presented by new measurement technologies. Technology has been advancing rapidly in many areas, including automation, software and measurement instrumentation. Measuring instruments are also changing in this new age of technology with, for example, smart electricity meters being rolled out in many countries. I have no doubt there will be future changes and corresponding regulatory impacts in physical, chemical and biological measurements. The benefits of the eradication of unnecessary costs are clear for businesses that operate across borders. The Productivity Commission has estimated the cost of complying with Australia's disparate business regulations, such as trade measurement systems, to be in the order of $40 billion. It further estirangements mates that reforming business regulation could add up to $16 billion a year to our gross domestic product. So there can be no doubt that the crippling regulatory burden faced by many Australian businesses is a dead weight on our economy. It should come as no surprise that the Council of Australian Governments, COAG, has on more than one occasion sought to harmonise business laws across each state or create a single layer of Commonwealth regulation. Yet regulatory reform through COAG under the previous government was sporadic at best. On countless occasions we read of reforms being talked about, but nothing happened. We read of reforms stalling or being delayed. Countless concerns were raised during the Howard government's tenure that there was a gap between reform rhetoric and reform implementation in the context of regulatory hot spots. Trade measurement was identified in 2006 by COAG as one of the regulatory hot spots in need of urgent regulatory reform. The reformist zeal of the pre-2008 COAG is perhaps best described by Mike Steketee in an article published in the Australian on 28 October 2006 when he said: … the co-operation that is supposed to be the hallmark of COAG is looking more and more like coagulation. In stark contrast, the Rudd government has rolled up its sleeves on this and has already achieved real outcomes on cooperative federalism. Take, for example, the Council of Australian Governments' meeting communique dated 26 March 2008, which finally delivered the breakthrough on trade measurement-of which this bill is a direct product. That same communique stated: The COAG reform agenda is underpinned by a common commitment to clear goals, genuine partnership and the governance and funding arneeded to deliver real reform. A fresh spirit of goodwill has delivered breakthrough agreements in areas unresolved by COAG for too long. Rather than turbocharging the COAG process to turn reform rhetoric into outcomes, the Howard government became complacent and chose to rely on the commodities boom to steer it through trouble while playing the blame game with the states. This bill is a step in the right direction not only for national economic growth but for the creation of a seamless economy in which companies can operate across jurisdictions without facing inconsistent laws and regulations. The more we do to create a seamless economy, the more it will help our companies compete domestically and internationally. An efficient trade measurement system is also essential for the international competitiveness of our exporters. Accurate, reliable and consistent measurements can boost international consumer confidence in our goods and, in turn, international trade and commerce. A national system may, for example, make it easier for Australia to enter into mutual recognition arrangements with other nations on trade measurement matters. These arrangements allow Australian exporters to have their products tested, measured or certified in Australia for compliance with the requirements of importing countries. Such arrangements are effective in reducing the time and cost involved in getting goods to international markets. The importance of legal metrology to exporters cannot be overstated. I again quote from Robert MCEntyre's address to the Queensland Studies Authority Asia Pacific Forum. He stated: Desired outcomes of an effective Australian technical infrastructure include: … … … - Increased competitiveness, market share, innovation and lower operating costs for Australian industries and companies, through optimising trading environments as a result of removing technical barriers to trade. An example is the food sector, where the measurement of pesticide residues and chemical and microbiological contaminants can be technical barriers to trade. Ongoing progress in implementing efficient measurement systems will only assist the Australian food export industry. The importance of quality measurements in trade can also be evident in assessments of the protein content of grain or the sugar content of cane sugar. As we work towards reducing global tariffs and opening international markets, ongoing reforms to technical measures and procedures will assume even greater importance. Market access is simply not enough. Our exporters must be afforded every opportunity to export their products quickly and costeffectively. At the heart of this bill lies another significant change which will ensure this is the case. The bill introduces an option for manufacturers to use, voluntarily, an average quantity system rather than the current minimum quantity system. Under the minimum quantity system, an offence is committed where a tested product shows a shortfall of the product in the package. With most filling and packaging processes automated, it is almost impossible to meet this standard in a production run-forcing packers to overfill packages to avoid an offence. The average quantity system allows packers to use a statistical measure that a batch of goods would be, on average, within statistical normal distribution. This measure increases the efficiency of production while protecting consumers. It is important to note, for the sake of our exporters, that the average quantity system has been adopted by our major trading partners, including Canada, China, the European Union, Japan, the United States and New Zealand. I also note that the International Organisation of Legal Metrology-an intergovernmental treaty organisation established to promote the global harmonisation of legal metrology-has recommended the adoption of the average quantity system for international trade in prepacked goods. Given prepacked goods form the bulk of international trade and the importance of the International Organisation of Legal Metrology's recommendations to underpinning international trade, the amendments in this bill are both prudent and timely. The adoption of the average quantity system will enable our exporters to compete on a more equitable basis with international traders now and in the future. I note that in his contribution to this debate the member for Groom, who is the shadow minister for industry and resources and also has an abiding interest in trade matters, raised concerns that it is still not clear that the national trade measurement system will have a significant net positive value. It is prudent for me to quote a section of the final report into the review of national arrangements for administering trade measurement in Australia which deals adequately with such concerns as raised by my friend the member for Groom. It states: Direct financial benefits to industry have proved difficult to quantify, but productivity benefits have been clearly identified and would justify the additional investment on the part of the Australian Government … The cost of implementing national legislation and administration of the trade measurement system is insignificant in comparison with its importance to the Australian economy. I conclude on that salient point and commend this bill to the House.",59
39,Mr RIPOLL,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"It is a pleasure to speak on the National Measurement Amendment Bill 2008. From time to time in this House, bills come before us that are truly of national significance-bills that are truly important, bills that truly make monumental changes to the way that we deal with life, business and a whole range of other areas, and bills that people line up to speak on. Some people would say that this is not one of them. I would say that they are wrong. This is actually a very important bill. Mr Murphy-Hear, hear!",63
40,Mr RIPOLL,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"Absolutely-hear, hear! The member for Lowe, who just spoke on this bill, agrees with me. This is an important bill because it makes some very important changes in some very important areas of trade law and practice. I have to say that, while a number of Labor members have been very keen to not only speak on this but also be active and participate in this regulatory area, we have not seen that enthusiasm from members of the opposition. I think that is a sad reflection of their view, not just on what this bill is about-trade measurement and measurement in Australia-but on the more global impact on our national economy, the way we do business, business practices in Australia, consumer affairs, the confidence that people have in our systems in AustraliaMr Murphy-Trade.",63
41,Mr RIPOLL,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"and of course trade. There is no way that we can have an effective trade regime in this country without an effective and efficient trade measurement system, and that is at the core of what this bill is about. Like on many bills that I have spoken about in this House over a long period of time, but particularly in the last 11½ months or so, I am very proud to speak on this issue. The Rudd Labor government is picking up on the leftover issues, the unfinished business, of the previous government. This area is important, as people will understand once they hear from the speakers about what it involves and how it can impact on their daily lives, their hip pocket and their family budgetsall the things that matter on a daily basis. We need to start by at least getting one thing right: what is trade measurement? On first inspection, a lot of people might consider this bill to just be about how long a piece of string is or how much something weighs. It is much more than that. In fact, I have often been asked that very question: how long is a piece of string? I have an answer for that: it is twice as long as it is from the middle to the end. Perhaps that should be contained somewhere as well! Trade measurement is a term that refers to the use of measurement as the basis for price in a transaction. It is very important in business. For example, there is the volume of petrol when you go to the petrol station and fill up at the bowser. We have heard that example; it is a very important one. When you put in, say, 50 litres, you know that you are getting 50 litres of fuel. You are not getting 45 litres and, more than likely, you would not be getting 55 litres. The idea is that you get what you pay for, and that is the essence of it. After cursory examination, people might think that is important in terms of the consumer aspect, but it actually goes much further; it is imporacross tant to our national economy, the efficiency of our economy, our productivity and our trade with trading partners. However, while we have some very good standards in Australia, there has been over several decades a desirability right across board to have some uniformity-a bit of harmonisation and a bit of national consistency in the way we apply rules, the way we license and the way we approach these things. That is a hallmark of the Rudd Labor government. We are determined that in Australia there is a better way to do a whole range of things. We believe that you can have productivity growth and efficiency gains in a whole range of areas. Trade measurement in itself can become more efficient and can help with productivity. You can apply the same principles-national consistency, licensing, efficiency and productivity-across a whole range of sectors. We have seen that in the way we have approached the issue of health provision in Australia-that we need to have a more consistent approach. National consistency is important in removing regulatory burdens and unproductive red tape across the board. That goes not just to health but also education. We see that in the areas in which Labor have pursued an agenda. It is not just about saying, ‘We will put more money on the table,' because we are doing that-we have made that financial commitment-but we are saying that we need to look for efficiencies and productivity gains. We do that across a whole range of areas, and education is one area. In the area of business-and this pertains more closely to trade, but when you dig deeper it pertains to the little things in all of our lives every day and it reflects the confia dence that we all have as consumers in the systems that we have in place-it is exceptionally important that we get this right all jurisdictions in Australia and, in the end, across one jurisdiction: the national economy of the Commonwealth. That is where we need to get this right. That is not a statement critical of the way that the states have operated, because it is certainly true the that over a number of years the states and territories have put in place a number of consistent regimes across the board. In fact, in 1983 the Scott review recommended a national approach to the administration of trade measurement. They did that for good reason. The recommendation resulted in the drafting of uniform trade measurement legislation. Unfortunately for all of us, it took more than 20 years for all jurisdictions to enact that legislation. That is lost time, lost productivity gains and lost efficiency. We cannot regain that, but we can move forward. So, despite the fact that we had uniform format legislation, practical problems persisted. That was largely because all states and territory regulations were not implemented at the same time, causing difficulties in timing issues, with different jurisdictions across different states. There were also differences in the way the regulations were apto plied, administered and interpreted, with varying nuances between jurisdictions. That led, very importantly in the progress of getting this right at a national level, to the Business Regulation and Competition Working Group of COAG being directed to deliver some early action on regulatory reform, in particular in relation to some hot spots. It was identified that there were a number of areas, called hot spots, where this was actually having an efficiency impact, a productivity impact. COAG identified that back in 2006 and again in 2007. The area of trade measurement had become one of the top 10 identified regulatory hot spots for COAG. So this is an important issue. This is in that ket of goods which, on the surface, some might think is inconsequential-an inconsequential bill and inconsequential changesbut in effect it has some real impact. Following on from that, the Ministerial Council on Consumer Affairs also commissioned a review of trade measurement arrangements. They identified a number of problems and costs associated with businesses that operate across borders, that have different cost-recovery procedures in different jurisdictions, different processes for licensing, different costs involved in what those licences are, inconsistent advice and basically the mishmash that you typically end up with in a system such as ours, where you have a federation of states, which in principle works well but has areas of difficulty, inefficiency and bureaucracy-layer upon layer of ineffectiveness. This is just another tranche for us, the Rudd government, where, as a new government coming in, we can start paring away at the red tape burdens and inefficiencies and start stripping back the bureaucracy that prevents national efficiency, that prevents us being competitive not only on a national platform but also on a global platform. This review concluded that the adoption of a national trade measurement system would deliver a net economic benefit to Australian industry, to business, to government and to consumers alike. In April 2007 COAG accepted this recommendation. The National Measurement Amendment Bill, which is now before us, will give effect to that COAG decision. As I said at the outset, I am very pleased to be able to speak on this legislation. I think it is an important part of our national trade system. Just as importantly to me, it is about consumer confidence and consumer affairs. This has certainly been an issue for a lot of constituents of mine. I know that right across Australia there are from time to time circumbasstances that arise where people's confidence in measurement is undermined. It quickly becomes apparent to members of parliament that it is one of those areas where consumers can really be dealt a harsh blow. There is an expectation from the Australian consumer that, when they go to a trader and buy an article that says ‘100 grams', that is what they will be purchasing-100 grams of whatever that article is; that if they go to a service station and buy 50 litres of fuel, it will be 50 litres of fuel; and that, if they buy something by length, they know exactly that that is the length that they are receiving. It is a base standard and an expectation that we have in this country that we can have confidence in our systems, and largely speaking we do have that. From time to time there are issues and problems about packet weights. We have already passed legislation in this place to make sure there is some clarity not only in the way items are measured and recorded but in the way they are promoted so that people can have confidence in that and there is no trickery involved-by duping or conning people into buying something they thought was something else. We have seen examples of that over the years. It is important to note how that system works and why it is so important: to make sure that we give confidence to buyers and sellers in the marketplace, to make sure that we have accuracy and to reduce the transaction costs of each trade. As we heard from the previous speaker, this is not a small area of concern. Trade measurement and trade based on measurement is worth something in the order of around $400 billion per year, so it is a significant amount. If we were to allow that system to deteriorate that could jeopardise not only consumer confidence but trade confidence. It could also jeopardise the confidence that our trading partners have in usthat what we do is of the highest standard, that when we say something is of a particular measurement that is actually the case. Again I acknowledge the presence at the table of the member for Lowe, who is the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Trade; he would understand very well just how important it is in our global relationship with our trading partners that they have confidence in our system, not just that we have confidence in it. Unfortunately, while Australia's current trade measurement infrastructure is good and is sound, it is not as efficient and certainly not as effective as it could be. That is just one more reason why this change is so necessary and why we have this measurement legislation-to remove some of the confusion. Significantly, every state and territory will be brought into line by agreement and through partnership so that we have a nationally consistent, efficient and effective trade measurement system. COAG has identified this as a major area of reform and we are following through on the commitment that we have made in that area. The Rudd Labor government made some big commitments pre the election that we want to see through-commitments in the area of supporting business, small business, contractors and trade, making sure that we remove for them the impediments to business and to trade. In our view, government should be there to assist their business, not hamper it. The role of government should be to provide an effective system of standards, licensing and regulations to ensure that the most efficient and effective trading platforms are in place. That is not the case yet; that not the case today. The system we have inherited from the previous government is overly burdened by red tape and regulatory regimes, and represents inaction and lost opportunities in what could have been done in those 12 years. The Howard government did not really pay attention-which is probably the kindest way I can put it-to what they claimed was one of their core constituencies, and that is the small business sector. Apart from perhaps dealing with a couple of the more populist issues within the business sector, the real issues of efficiency, red tape and other burdens-real, practical, everyday cost burdens-on small business were not addressed. What we saw was a growing mountain of red tape, a growing mountain of regulation, a growing mountain of requirements placed on small business and other businesses to comply with the ever more complicated systems and regimes put in place by the previous government-let alone the system of taxation in this country. It is so complicated, so complex, so inefficient that we have been placed in a position today where we need to look at how we measure all of that. If you brought our tax system in here and measured it from the floor, it would be the height of a tall child. The reality is that there is a lot of work to be done. This is one more step in that process that we have put in place to harmonise regulation across this country, to bring into line the ability of the states and territories of the Commonwealth to work together at all tiers of government, truly, I would say, for the first time in Australian history. That is the great opportunity that is provided by this bill before us. At its core are productivity gains by reducing red tape and reducing the costs and burdens for small business. We as a government are committed to that sector through this bill but we also believe that it will flow is on to other areas of the economy. In effect, that will give us greater quality and a greater capacity to grow and better link with our trading partners. I want to mention briefly the global systems of trade measurement and how important it is for us to be on the same platform as our trading partners. Currently, ours is a minimum quantity system, which means that you are basically guaranteed that within a particular measurement you will get a minimum amount. While on the surface that seems like quite a reasonable approach to take, what it means is that business tend to overfill or give a little bit extra just to tain they do not breach any regulation or more. The bigger picture is that it means massive inefficiency for business. There are good data and statistics and evidence to show that moving to an average quantity system will mean that you get roughly 98 per cent accuracy on average weight, on average length, on average quantity, and that is a satisfactory amount in terms of tolerances that are acceptable not only to consumers but also by regulations, law and government. I think that by moving across to that system and joining with our major trading partners which have the same systems in placecountries such as Canada, China, those in the European Union, Japan, the United States and New Zealand-we will ensure that we maintain a competitive advantage not just in the quality of our trade and all that is associated with that but also in the quantity of it. We will maintain the confidence that people have in our systems and that competitive advantage that we always need to ensure that we have. The bill before us contains an array of systems that will give us a range of things. The bill will ensure the accuracy and reliability of our trade measuring instruments, such as scales, fuel dispensers and weighbridges. It will also mean that prepacked articles contain the stated quantities. It means the appointment of trade measurement inspectors and proper licensing provisions for the verifiers of measuring instruments. It means that private sector firms or individuals will be licensed to verify trade measuring instruments, while transitional provisions will ensure a seamless transfer from the states and territories to a national system. This is good public policy, this is in the national interest, this is a very important bill, and I commend it to the House. (Time expired)",63
42,Mr RAGUSE,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"I rise to speak on the National Measurement be cerAmendment Bill 2008 and I would like to commend the two previous speakers, the member for Lowe and the member for Oxley, for their contributions. The importance of this national measurement system is due to the fact that it concerns industry, small business and, generally, our total economy, which is very dependent on having a surety of certain standards. In discussing this bill, I would like to give an understanding of some of the history that has brought us to this point. People often take it for granted that our measurements are just there. We quote capacity and length and we have a whole range of different understandings by measurement. But there have been thousands of years of history in the development of measurements to get to the point where we can say that standards can be put in place and confirmed-certainly in this country of Australia, a federation of states. On this side of the House we have spoken many times about the notion of cooperative federalism, and, certainly, red tape reduction is a major part of ensuring that we can provide to industry some definitive measurements. I will take you back to the era of the ancient Greeks and Romans. History shows they were great builders of cities. Because the Romans advanced through so many countries-and the wars and battles involved in taking on these great lands-there are significant remnants and remains of them. Their legacy is essentially in the built environment. You can see all the ruins if you travel to some of those countries. Rome is a very good example of the input that the Romans have had in that area in the built environment. It comes back to an understanding of measurement and the standards that were established many thousands of years ago. Today the symmetry of this chamber is very much based on an understanding of those early measurements. If you pick up a piece of paper, for instance, and look at the symmetry of that piece of paper and consider the fact that most pieces of paper are rectangular in shape, you will see it is no accident. This comes back to some determination many thousands of years ago about what the perfect rectangle might be. If this decision had not been made some thousands of years ago, we might be writing on square pieces of paper and the symmetry might be quite different. Again, on the notion of construction, if you look at the building of a house or a large facade or at some of those ancient Roman buildings, you will see they were not just put together based on the available material or the masonry that they had available to them; the symmetry had some significance in the way that they were built. That was highly dependent on a standard of measurement. If you look at the so-called perfect rectangle-otherwise known as the ‘golden rectangle'-or any rectangular shape or one that is most pleasing to the eye, you will see it is based on ratios. It is taking a square measure and then applying a ratio of one to one to two. Again, if you look at a humble sheet of paper, that is representative of that golden rectangle. If you look at the way they designed the ancient Greek and Roman buildings, you immediately see what I am suggesting. That comes down to the proscenium arches that we have in our theatres. Even the way that we have determined that we need to watch TV on the flat screens that have been developed has a bearing on some very basic measurements. The reason I am raising this is to point to the significance of this bill and the need to standardise our measurements. The subtleties of this understanding have huge ramifications and, as I mentioned earlier, we could well be writing on square pieces of paper rather than rectangular pieces had decisions not been made about standardisation. I can probably give a better demonstration of that if we look at the introduction of the metric system into my state of Queensland back in 1974. The metric system goes back a long time. There have been variations of it and different languages explain the notion of the base of 10. Square roots and a whole range of tables that were developed probably 500 or 600 years ago all were based on the notion of the decimal or the point of 10. If you look as far back as 1586, the interesting thing is that the English-in consideration with the French and with the emerging Americas through the War of Independence-had a large role to play in the determination of weights, measures and those very things that I am talking about. The irony is that today the US still has major confusion over the way that they deal with their weights and measures. In Australia there is not so much confusion anymore because the introduction of the metric system into this country helped a lot of that; but, if anyone has ever been confronted with the notion of using foolscap or quarto paper against an A4 or, dare I say, an A3 sheet, they all have relevance in the need for standardisation. Only a few years ago you could quite easily accidentally purchase a writing pad that might not actually fit a certain folder or fit into a particular printer simply because the standards of measurement were not determined very well. The US, as an early industrial nation, played a major part in developing the whole notion of print, and these ratios and measurements were somewhat ad hoc. The irony is that decimal currency entered the US just after the time of the American War of Independence simply because there was a need to have a standardisation of their currency and the introduction of paper currency. Yet even at that stage it was probably too difficult for the Americans to introduce the notion of a metric system or a standardisation of a system of measurement. Back in 1974 in the state of Queensland it was certainly a mandate and a dictate. I was, at that stage, in grade 9. I had spent all my earlier years learning the notion of feet, inches, yards, fathoms-what we call imperial measurements. I will not say it was belted into us, because that is not what happened, but we felt under a lot of pressure to be able to roll off those tables of measurement.",67
43,Dr EMERSON,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"1,760 yards to a mile.",69
44,Mr RAGUSE,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"That is right, Member for Rankin. There are 1,760 yards in a mile, 5,280 feet-and it goes on and on. Dr Emerson interjecting Mr Raguse-That is right, and it had relevance to the length of a cricket pitch.",69
45,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,Order! I know the minister is erudite but he need not demonstrate it so obviously.,69
46,Mr RAGUSE,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"The member for Rankin understands where I am coming from. The reality is that those measurements did not work together, and I should give an understanding of why we adopted them under the British system. Even with those earlier influences of the British, with the French King Louis XV and as part of the War of Independence, there were a number of stand-offs. Measurement became very much a part of the deliberations about war and about a range of standards. I can probably suggest that, politically, there were reasons why the Americans, once they gained independence, took on decimal currency but decided the overall decimal system was not going to suit. In talking about the imperial system, the terminology itself has some bearing on the whole notion of the system. The imperial system brings up the notion of royalty. This is probably well depicted in the Vitruvian Man that Leonardo da Vinci drew, and many people will know that figure with the symmetry of the human body. It has a major role to play in the notion of measurements. Imperial measurement was very much the introduction of a system usually by the principality, by the leader at the time or by the royal family if it was a monarchy. If we look at the Vitruvian Man, it explains the fact that a foot had a particular measure-it was the size of the ruler's foot. That was fine if there was an average and it was a dynasty of leaders who may have had similar features, but you can immediately see that, if there were a child king, the whole system of measurement would be turned on its head. The Vitruvian Man is a way of looking at the standard of feet, but it was clear that having a system that would change every time a ruler changed would be a concern. I should mention the term ‘ruler'. We understood at school when we had 12 inches, which is a measurement that was related to the thumb, that 12 inches would make a foot, and that was on a ruler denoting the ruler at the time, or the king or the leader. So it was very much based on some sort of ad hoc approach to measurement. So standards were established. The Romans had their own system of measurement but it was very much based on ratios. The development of the decimal system was a major step forward for this country. We had decimal currency introduced in 1966, followed within eight years by the introduction of the metric system generally. I remember asking a group of young people many years ago whether they understood where the metre actually came from. It was an established measurement but over time there have been changes to the way it is determined. Essentially, it was decided in the mid-1700s that there should be a way of establishing a standard-something that will not change. We understand today that we keep the standard in a different way-usually in a beam of light or through some atomic measurement, certainly in the case of weight, length, volume et cetera-but back in the mid-1700s there was a major step forward in astronomy in terms of understanding the global theory rather than the flat-earth ries that existed before those early explorers. I wonder whether anyone in the House knows where the metre comes from?",69
47,Dr EMERSON,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,Sir! Sir!,70
48,Mr RAGUSE,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,It is a question and answer session. Member for Rankin: do you know where it comes from?,70
49,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"Order! Through the chair is where remarks should be directed. The minister does not need to assist the honourable member, who is doing quite well on his own.",70
50,Mr RAGUSE,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for your indulgence. I will tell you where that measurement comes from: it is actually one ten-millionth of the distance between the North Pole and the equator. That was a standard that was established at that particular time. That standard has changed because there are now more reliable ways of standardising the measurement. If you have ever wondered where we came up with this notion of the metre, it is very closely related to the yard-three feet-which goes back to the Vitruvian Man. Dr Emerson interjecting",70
51,Mr RAGUSE,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"That is right. There are 39.37 inches in a metre, in fact. The reality of establishing a standard that was based on a notion of 10 meant that you could divide the standard of a metre. I will use the linear measurement to start with, although measurements of volume and mass come into it too. The metre's divisibility by 10 was a very important part of what the establishment of that measure was about. I relate to my earlier statements about industry the development of the printing industry. Certainly Gutenberg did not have a lot to do with the notion of a standard paper size. He essentially cobbled together whatever he could in terms of rags and other things to print on. But with the industrial revolution theo- and the Americas moving aheadparticularly what became the US-there was the creation of the printing industry as we understand it today. The standard of paper was something that people worked very closely on. All of us who read newspapers in the days when we travelled by train would remember having large newspapers that we would have to fold and twist. The development of the metric system allowed the introduction of the tabloid paper. The tabloid is essentially an A3 sheet of paper. Even though there are variations of that now that are called tabloids, usually a tabloid is something smaller than the old, large newspapers. The difficulty for industry in this country before we established the metric system was the inconsistency between the US and us. We had always had that inconsistency, even when we had the imperial system in this country. We had the pint and the gallon, but the US gallon happened to be a lesser amount than the Australian gallon. Those inconsistencies have, to some degree, moved on because of our adoption of the metric system and because other countries, when making international trading arrangements, talk in terms of metrics. But in the printing industry and the metal industry, when measurements were still in the old imperial system-feet and inchessquare measures were certainly worked out in that way. I will use the example of the printing industry because it comes down to the notion of a sheet of paper. I talked about the golden rectangle and why we have rectangular sheets of paper-because they are in the shape of the perfect rectangle. People may understand that the notion of A3 and A4 sheets of paper-I have an A4 sheet here in front of me-is based on the standard of a square metre. You start with the calculation of an A0. An A0 sheet is one square metre of paper, but in the golden rectangle ratio to one to two. It is from cutting up that A0 sheet of paper that we get the other sizes of paper. The most common size of paper used is A4. Essentially that is an A0 sheet of paper halved to make A1, A2, A3 and then A4. It goes on to A5, A6, A7, A8 and A9, which is the size of a business card. They are all related to each other. Those sizes also had some bearing on the way that paper could be folded. Coming back to these measurements you can see the need for standards. We have established quite well in our country our understanding and use of the metric system. This legislation will ensure that, right across the board-right across the federation of our states-we will have consistency. Many members in this House would have lots to do with printers and people providing printed material. It is always interesting to look at the calculation of folding. Again, it comes down to a standard. If you take a piece of paper-it does not matter what size it is-you can fold it in half only seven times. You cannot fold a sheet of paper more than seven times. People might want to challenge that but the reality is that you cannot physically fold",70
52,Dr EMERSON,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,Did Pythagoras come up with that?,71
53,Mr RAGUSE,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"Pythagoras did not, but it is a simple rule of physics. I will get back to the notion of the A0 and the standard square metre. If you look at a ream of paper-500 sheets in the metric system-it will often have a GSM measure on it. It may be 80 GSM, 120 GSM or 200 GSM. Essentially that means, for example, that the paper is 80 grams per square metre. That means that every A0 sheet in the shape of the golden rectangle is that weight. From that you can then calculate the weight of a printed item. It certainly adds to our efficiency in transport of one when we have standards of measurement. Dr Emerson interjecting",71
54,Mr RAGUSE,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,That is right: you cannot fold your sheet of paper any more than seven times. If you had the right sort of device,71
55,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,I think Mr Speaker has ruled that props in the chamber are not appropriate.,71
56,Mr RAGUSE,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"However, it does prove my point. The serious side of this, of course, is that we have established in certain industries over time the real need to have standards. These days we do not get foiled by the notion of having foolscap or quarto paper. Essentially, it is all based on the metric system of paper. In fact if you go further into that, there is every size of paper for every particular need and you can go from an A size to a B size to a C size. It has all sorts of connotations but the reality is that it is built on a standard. The metric system is very important. It flows through everything that we do in this country. The reality of this legislation is that we are going to be able to tidy up those last remaining pieces to have consistency across all of our systems of measurement. You need only look to history to understand that there have been thousands of years of development to get to this point. This country has taken 107 years to get to a point where we can standardise most of our measurements. We have tried at different timescertainly in 1960, with a major event for this country; in 1966, with decimal currency; and in 1974, certainly in Queensland and related to the rest of the country. The system of measurement is very, very important for the efficiencies of what we do in industry every day. Those examples I have given from the printing industry are typical. You will find those same systems used in the metal industry and in the service industries for understanding and determining weight and measurement. The ISO standards were established at an international level in an attempt to maintain some consistency. But, as a global community, we have a long way to go with standardisation. The US are way behind us. The inefficiencies in lots of their systems come down to the fact that they have not at earlier times taken on the need to do what this country is doing right now. I certainly commend this bill to the House.",71
57,The DEPUTY SPEAKER,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,I thank the honourable member for his interesting contribution. Maybe he has missed his true vocation.,72
58,Mr TREVOR,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"I commend to the House the member for Forde's contribution to this debate. I rise to speak on the National Measurement Amendment Bill 2008 and hope to deliver a brief and well-measured speech. I am sure all would appreciate that. The National Measurement Amendment Bill 2008 amends the National Measurement Act 1960 to introduce an Australia-wide system of trade measurement based on the current measurement systems found in each state and territory. This bill will introduce a national system. I mend my government's approach on this matter. It is long overdue. This amendment bill is in response to trade measurement being one of the 10 regulatory issues identified by COAG in 2006 and 2007. Australia currently has eight different jurisdictions, one in each state and territory. This has created increases in compliance costs for those businesses operating across state boundaries-in effect, a red tape nightmare. The bill inserts general trade measurement provisions into the act which will provide the legislative framework for the national trade measurement system. These include provisions to ensure the accuracy and reliability of trade measuring instruments, provisions to ensure pre-packed articles contain the stated quantities, the appointment of trade measurement inspectors and their powers, licensing provisions for the verifiers of measuring instruments and the operation of public weighbridges, provision for private sector firms or individuals to be licensed to verify trade measuring instruments, and transitional provisions to ensure a seamless transfer from the states and territories to a national system. A trade measurement framework provides confidence to buyers and sellers that measurements which support our trading system are consistent and accurate anywhere in Australia. The bill will create the legislative framework for a national system of trade measurement. Currently, trade measurement is regulated by the states and territories, but they each regulate trade measurement slightly differently. This bill will address the issues surrounding businesses operating across state and territory boundaries, which will be welcome news. As mentioned earlier, creating a national trade measurement system was identified by COAG in 2006 as a regulatory reform hot spot, an area where overlapping and inconcom- sistent regulatory regimes were impeding economic activity. The bill gives effect to the COAG decision. A national trade measurement system will reduce the regulatory burden for business, particularly for those firms that currently have to comply with different requirements when operating across state and territory borders. The new system will be administered by the Commonwealth from 1 July 2010. The bill has provisions which will ensure the accuracy and reliability of trade measuring instruments like scales, fuel dispensers and weighbridges; ensure pre-packaged articles contain the stated quantities; allow private sector firms or individuals to be licensed to verify trade measuring instruments; create powers for the Commonwealth to appoint trade measurement inspectors; create all the necessary elements of a national trade measurement system with the technical and administrative detail to be specified in regulations; and provide traditional arrangements to ensure a smooth transfer from the operation of state and territory legislation to tional system. The bill also introduces the voluntary option of using the average quantity system, AQS. AQS is an internationally recognised system for sampling and testing groups of packages to determine whether, on average, they contain the quantities with which they are marked. The offence provision in the bill will apply to a wide range of companies, from large to small, in a wide variety of circumstances. This makes it desirable to have a range of enforcement options appropriate to the different circumstances to which the bill might apply. Consequently, the bill provides for different categories of offences in relation to particular conduct for a range of responses depending on the circumstances of a particular suspected offence and for a variety of penalties. The availability of AQS will meet long standing requests from major packers and wine producers and will improve their international competitiveness. The system also provides flexibility to introduce new technologies or approaches. For example, the protein content of grain now determines the price paid to growers, rather than weight. The new national system will have the flexibility to take up these new ways of doing business. This is groundbreaking legislation. This is fantastic legislation for Australia. I commend the member for Rankin and I commend this bill to the House and congratulate the Rudd Labor government for its outstanding leadership on this issue.",72
59,Dr EMERSON,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"Rankin-Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy and Minister Assisting the Finance Minister on Deregulation) (1.15 pm)-in reply-I believe that the speakers list on the debate on the second reading of the National Measurement Amendment Bill 2008 is now exhausted. I have a copy of it a nahere in my hand, after having attempted to fold the piece of paper seven times. I got it to six and that is small enough. I think it is time to bring this debate to a close. I was fascinated with the contributions of our various speakers, including the member for Forde, who gave us a very good exposition of some of the benefits of the bill. He mentioned such weights and measures as kilograms. I had the honour, recently, of going to the National Measurement Institute to witness the handing over of what we call the perfect kilogram. It was grown from a single silicon crystal into a perfect spherical object weighing exactly one kilogram. It was important that this was done because the measure of the kilogram is in France and it has degraded. It is a piece of metal and it has degraded slightly over time. I suppose that does not matter too much when it comes to how many cornflakes you have in a packet but it does in matters such as space travel. Similarly, they are very important for caesium clocks and so on. A small error can have a spacecraft missing a planet or a solar system by a very large amount. So this is actually all very important, not only to the past but to the present and to the future. I want to thank a gazillion-which is a very large number of millions-people: everyone who has spoken on this. The National Measurement Institute, which will have responsibility for administering the new system of trade measurement, has pointed out to me that the desire for an orderly system of trade measurement reaches back to very early times. I am sure that the member for Forde would be fascinated to know that this was all anticipated in the Bible, where Leviticus, chapter 19, commands: ‘You shall not pervert justice in measurement of weight, length or quantity. You shall have true scales, true weights, true measures; dry and liquid'. So, there you go, a command from on high that we have the National Trade Measurement Amendment Bill! I will now move to another religion. The Koran actually warns: ‘Woe to those who stint the measure'-so get your measures right because the Koran says that is a very good idea. Fast-forward now to the Magna Carta, which set out that there would be one weight and one measure in the realm. These are the sorts of measures that the member for Forde was talking about. Indeed, I remember from primary school-and the member for Forde said that it was not belted into him, but it was close to belted into me-that there are 12 inches in one foot, three feet in one yard, 1,760 yards in a mile, 5,280 feet in a mile, 100 links in one chain, and 80 chain to one mile but also that one chain is a cricket pitch. I do not know if the chain came from cricket or that cricket got it from the chain, but if ever a fast bowler is wondering exactly why the length of the pitch is as it is and is thinking maybe should be a bit shorter or a bit longer, the answer is that it is exactly one chain. And, of course, there are 16 ounces in a pound and, I think, 2,240 pounds in a ton? Mr Raguse-That's right.",73
60,Dr EMERSON,NATIONAL MEASUREMENT,"Yes, 2,240 pounds in a ton-and that is about as much as I know about that, so I should move on. The National Measurement Amendment Bill 2008 will set the framework for a national system of trade measurement. It will replace all of the current state and territory based systems. In a seamless national economy it makes no sense at all for our trade measurement system, a system which underpins commercial transactions across Australia and into our export markets, to be regulated by nine different jurisdictions. Yet that is the situation that has applied up until this point. It is what I call rail gauge economics, reflecting on the different rail gauges that were in the Federation of Australia that took a very, very long time to remedy. Former Prime Minister Andrew Fisher lamented in 1916 that in order to travel from Perth to the east coast you had to change trains many times. He thought that was absurd in 1916. Finally it was fixed up, and there is a celebration today. We have these sorts of absurdities still in so many areas of regulation-27 areas of regulation-that we are pursuing through the Council of Australian Governments to put an end to rail gauge economics. This measure today, pardon the pun, is designed to do that in relation to trade measurement. It is what we have been working so hard to change through the business regulation and competition working group, which I have the privilege of co-chairing with the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. The system that we have been debating today and yesterday builds on the experience of state and territory administrations. They themselves have reait sonably good systems in place. There is no doubt about that. But the advantage of this, like fixing up the rail gauge problem, is that it will remove current inconsistencies and, importantly, help reduce business costs. It will allow Australia to adopt new technologies and processes, which will help our industries compete better internationally. A number of our speakers have made that point. The member for Lowe and other speakers pointed to those sorts of benefits. The National Measurement Institute will be responsible for administering the new national trade measurement system and will offer employment to inspectors and others who are currently working in trade measurement in the states and territories. This bill is the product of a decision of the Council of Australian Governments in February 2006. COAG identified trade measurement as a priority hot spot reform area, where overlapping and inconsistent regulatory regimes were impeding economic activity. I acknowledge here the contribution of the member for Groom, who at that time was the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources and is now the shadow minister for energy and resources. He did initiate good work on this. He spoke on the importance of this bill and he was involved at the ground floor. I pay tribute to the work that he did and we are very pleased to have been able to bring this forward into the parliament. The bill has been developed through industry consultation and supported by a legislative working group with state and territory officials convened by the National Measurement Institute. The member for Paterson raised one issue that I want to comment on regarding the role of the National Measurement Institute in administering the national trade measurement system. The National Measurement Institute will be responsible for policy and standards as well as enforcement. It is true that policy development and enforcement activities are often given to separate organisations to avoid undue influence on policy development by the enforcement activity. However, in the case of trade measurement, the policy is very straightforward; it is simply to ensure confidence in measurement through the use of verified measuring instruments. There are no Commonwealth agencies with the necessary expertise in this area other than the National Measurement Institute. Separating these functions would also create unnecessary complexity and add to costs, which we do not want to do, and that is obviously another area of concern that has been raised by opposition members in this debate. So we really do not want to go to a more costly exercise just for the sake of separation in this case. Because of these factors the decision was taken that the National Measurement Institute would undertake both of those roles. In closing the debate I want to share with the House the reaction from industry to the bill following its introduction into parliament. The Winemakers Federation of Australia welcomed the introduction of the bill, with its chief executive stating: This is a very important measure and one which will save the Australian wine industry approximately $19 million per year … The Australian wine sector relies heavily on its export industry with 60% of its product being exported overseas. This measure will put Australia in line with other countries and increase our international competitiveness. This is something that the wine industry has been advocating for some time and we applaud the Minister for Small Business, Independent Contractors and the Service Economy … for taking this important step. I reiterate, therefore, my thanks to the former minister for industry for the work he has done. In a statement issued by Accord Australasia, the peak industry group for the consumer, cosmetic and hygiene products sector, Executive Director Bronwyn Capanna welcomed the bill. She stated: Industry greatly welcomes this new legislation. It addresses the long standing problem business has faced with having to deal with separate and often inconsistent requirements of state and territory legislation. … … By introducing an Average Quantity System the new legislation will bring Australia's trade measurement regulations into line with our major trading partners … … … … Australian export firms will benefit from greater harmonisation with the rules of their export markets. It is pleasing to see the government commitments to introducing reforms of COAG regulatory ‘hot spots' like trade measurement. Indeed, it was one of the 10 regulatory hot spots identified by the Council of Australian Governments. The National Measurement Amendment Bill 2008 lays the basis for the new national system of trade measurement, which will provide a level playing field across Australia for all transactions which are based on measurement. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Third Reading",74

TAX LAWS AMENDMENT (2008 MEASURES No. 5) BILL 2008 Second Reading Debate resumed from 25 September, on motion by Mr Bowen: That this bill be now read a second time.",76
62,Mr ANTHONY SMITH,TREATMENT IN COMMONWEALTH,"The Tax Laws Amendment (2008 Measures No. 5) Bill 2008 contains fiveessentially unrelated-schedules. The opposition will be supporting this bill. I will go through each of those schedules in some detail. Schedule 1 of the bill, as we know from the explanatory memorandum, amends the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 and the object of the schedule is to ensure that the goods and services tax is applied to the value added to real property after 1 July 2000, where there is an interaction between the margin scheme and going concern farmland and associated provisions. Schedule 2 of this bill makes changes to the thin capitalisation regime provisions in division 820 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. The object of this schedule is to make changes to the thin cap position of BILL 2008 complying entities for certain specific impacts due to the adoption of the Australian equivalents to the International Financial Reporting Standards in 2005. We also know from this bill that schedule 3 of this bill amends section 128F of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. The object of this schedule is to provide an exemption from interest withholding tax for bonds issued by state and territory central borrowing authorities in Australia. Schedule 4 amends the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 to ensure the correct operation of the ‘otherwise deductible' rule in relation to investments held by an employee with a third party. The final schedule, schedule 5, amends division 6C of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 in order to make changes to the eligible investment business rules for managed funds. I will begin with schedule 1. Schedule 1 deals with the GST margin scheme. This is quite a substantive and technical set of amendments. It is designed to prevent entities manipulating their affairs relating to property so they can reduce their GST liability. The schedule essentially corrects the uses of the GST margin scheme that were not intended in the original purpose of that provision. The first aspect of the schedule ensures that, where the margin scheme is applied to real property that was previously acquired on a GST-free basis, the value added by the entity that made the GST-free sale is included in calculating the GST payable under the margin scheme. This is consistent with the intent of the goods and services tax to apply to value that is added to real property. The explanatory memorandum, I might point out, explains this in great detail and has a number of examples about the use of the margin scheme, how it operates or can operate presently and how it would operate in the future as a result of these changes. The second aspect ensures that where the eligibility to use the margin scheme is removed, the eligibility cannot then be reinstated by interposing a GST-free or nontaxable sale.G This is a significant change to the current law and how it has been operating.G Currently, the eligibility to supply real property under the scheme can possibly be reinstated by interposing a GST-free or nontaxable supply. The third aspect of the schedule strengthens the general GST antiavoidance provisions to apply to schemes that are entered into with the sole or dominant purpose of gaining a GST benefit. There is some history, as is often the case, with schedules in these tax laws amendments bills. The development of the approach that has been taken commenced some years ago and builds on the previous, coalition government's demonstrated commitment to maintaining the integrity, base and operation of the goods and services tax-a very important, reforming tax introduced just over eight years ago. The essence of these measures addressing the GST margin scheme was inireal tially announced in 2005. While parliament was considering the Tax Laws Amendment (2005 Measures No. 2) Bill 2005, it proposed amendments to the GST margin scheme and the former Treasurer, the member for Higgins, announced some intended changes on budget night in May 2005, in Budget Paper No. 3, which said: The Government will prevent entities manipulating certain elements of the GST law (such as the margin scheme, the grouping, associates, joint venture, going concerns or farm land provisions) to reduce the GST liability on supplies of real property.G In recognition of the significant impact on a range of stakeholders, including the property industry, the then coalition government undertook extensive and widespread consultation to ensure that any changes would not have any unintended effects. The measures announced by the previous coalition government were intended to restrict the property owners from incorrectly reducing their GST liability when selling their property under the margin scheme. On 7 June 2005 the then Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, the Hon. Mal Brough MP, announced that, following some consultation, amendments had been made to the bill and the government would undertake further consultation on the proposed rules in the future. Due to the complexity of the measure and in the interests of ensuring the integrity of the recently introduced GST, the former Treasurer, the member for Higgins, announced in the 2006-07 Budget Paper No. 3: The Government has deferred the tax integrity measure concerning the interaction of the margin scheme with the GST-free going concern and the GST-free farm land provisions. He also announced that consultations would continue on this matter, which they did, with the aim of ensuring that there would not be any unintended or adverse effects. It is the case that prior to the last federal election then coalition government and Treasury were in the process of further consultations. As a result of that long-running consultation process, the new government this year announced its intention to introduce these measures on budget night. Since budget night the measures have undergone further consultation under the new government's watch. There have been some changes to what was initially announced on budget night, and those changes have occurred as a result of the consultation. We on this side of the House think that that consultation and some of the changes that have occurred are good, and it has improved the measures that will operate. Most notably, it has removed any retrospective elements that would have applied from budget night. The measures will be entirely prospective from the date of royal assent and will not apply to real property that has already been purchased or to real property that is subject to an option to purchase at the moment. This area of GST law, as I said, was in contemplation for a number of years. It is a technical area and there has been a long period of consultation. The intent, as I have said, is to sure the correct operation of the goods and services tax, which of course the former coalition government strongly supported and introduced and which we now presume the current government also supports as strongly as we did back in the year 2000. Schedule 2, as I said before, modifies the accounting standards treatment of specified assets and liabilities by amending standards relating to the thin capitalisation regime. The measure was initiated by the adoption of the Australian equivalents to International Financial Reporting Standards in 2005. The current form of this schedule is, we are told, the result of extensive consultation with industry stakeholders. There have been some the improvements made through that consultation process-for instance, it provides subject to specific conditions that for thin capitalisation purposes certain entities: will not be allowed to recognise deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities or assets or liabilities from defined benefit plans; will be allowed to revalue intangible assets that cannot currently be revalued because they do not satisfy the intangible assets accounting standard in AASB No. 138 for the only reason that there is no active market for valuation; and will be allowed to recognise internally generated intangible assets if they do not satisfy the intangible assets accounting standard for the only reason that they cannot be reliably costed. Schedule 3 extends the exemption, under section 128F of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, from interest withholding tax for state central borrowing authorities when they issue bonds. Schedule 4 deals with FBT. The necessity, the requirement or the need for this schedule and for action in this area was brought about by the Federal Court decision in National Australia Bank Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation. The court ruled enthat an employer could reduce the entire taxable value of a fringe benefit provided jointly to an employee and third party-typically their partner-in relation to an incomegenerating asset. This was clearly inconsistent with the general principles of income and deductions. The measures, once they take effect when this bill is passed and given royal assent, will require an employer to adjust the taxable value of the fringe benefit according to the proportion of the jointly held asset that the employee owns.G Finally, the last schedule, schedule 5, makes changes to the eligible investment business rules contained in division 6C as they apply to managed investment funds. The measures in this schedule, subject to certain conditions, include a definition of the term ‘investing in land' to include fixtures, chattels and movable property. The schedule also expands the range of financial instruments in which a managed investment trust can invest from the current specified instruments that are listed in division 6C. The schedule introduces the following safe harbours: a two per cent safe harbour for nontrading income set at a whole-of-trust level and a 25 per cent safe harbour for non-rental, non-trading income from investments in land for public unit trusts investing in land for purpose of deriving rent. We note that the Board of Taxation is currently conducting a review of tax arrangements applying to managed funds that operate as managed investment trusts. We look forward to reading that report, which is due to be delivered some time early next year or by the middle of next year. We also, on a broader level, look forward to the Henry review of tax over that same time frame. In conclusion, I note that the bill was referred the Senate Standing Committee on Economics on 25 September 2008 by Senator the Hon. Helen Coonan. The Senate Standing Committee on Economics was well placed to examine the effect of these measures. The Senate committee held a hearing in Canberra on 28 October, received several submissions and reported just recently-in fact last Monday, 10 November. Having dealt with all of the issues and having noted some issues and some concerns, their recommendation is that the bill be passed by the Senate. I commend the bill to the House.",76
63,Mr NEUMANN,TREATMENT IN COMMONWEALTH,"Blair) (1.43 pm)When I was writing this speech on the Tax Laws Amendment (2008 Measures No. 5) Bill 2008 it was quite late in the evening and I was considering the Australian economy. I was thinking about Simon and Garfunkel, strange though it may be. The words to one of their songs were, ‘I am a rock; I am an island,' or something along those lines. I cannot be as entertaining as the member for Forde, and I certainly cannot sing anywhere near as well as the member for Forde, but those words reminded me of the Australian economy-because Australia might be an island geographically but it is not financially. We have seen the impact of the global financial crisis nationally and domestically. We would love to be able to isolate our economy and not worry about the fact that the subprime market in America might have the collapsed and about its impacts on our economy. We would love to be able to isolate ourselves, but we cannot. That is a Hansonite approach that does not face the economic reality that we confront. Maintaining the integrity of our taxation system in this sort of climate is crucial. Every day, constituents or friends of mine have spoken to me about the impact of the global financial crisis upon their personal lives-their superannuation entitlements, the value of their real estate and to their personal financial security. The bill before us today is about maintaining the financial security of our markets, of our economy and of our taxation system. We cannot deliver for our people, we cannot deliver hospitals, we cannot deliver schools and we could not deliver the Economic Security Strategy that we have announced, without our taxation system being viable, consistent and just and fair to everyone-that is, individuals and companies. We have announced a huge package of $10.4 billion in our Economic Security Strategy, which will help constituents across the country but also in my electorate of Blair, around Ipswich, the Lockyer Valley and the old Boonah Shire. They would think it a great strategy, and certainly that has been the feedback. But I also think that they would think that this bill-this omnibus bill, which like so many of its predecessors introduced earlier this year amends our taxation lawsis a fair and just measure. It has used the device, as the member for Casey said, of a schedule to improve the integrity of the scheme. It is important to note that our taxation scheme is one which has bipartisan support. If we have at this time confrontation and conflict in our economy, with it facing the global financial crisis, then we are going to go backwards as a country. The measure of us as a country and a community is in this time of challenge and controversy. This is not a time of comfort and convenience for us as a country. This is a time of real difficulty. So we have to make sure that government internal revenues can provide for the Economic Security Strategy and can provide for roads, schools and hospitals. We have to make sure that it is viable. We have to get sufficient money to do this. This is what this is all about. We have to do it in a fair and way. The Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs, the Assistant Treasurer, said concerning the first schedule in his second reading speech on 25 September 2008 that this bill is about ‘maintaining the integrity of the GST tax base'. It is about overcoming deficiencies with respect to the GST system as it applies to real property-that is, ‘land' in common parlance. Budget Paper No. 2 talked about the scope of the proposed changes. I will quote it because I think it is worth quoting: The GST provisions dealing with real property are intended to ensure that GST is payable on the value added to land once it enters the GST system. The margin scheme achieves this outcome by applying GST to the ‘margin', that is, the difference between the purchase price paid by the seller and the price paid by the buyer. This measure provides that, where the margin scheme is used after a GST free or non-taxable supply, the value added by the registered entity which made that supply is included in determining the GST subsequently payable under the margin scheme. The measure will also strengthen the GST antiavoidance provisions to ensure that they can apply to contrived arrangements entered into to avoid GST. Schedule 1 ensures that the margin scheme provisions and associated provisions to do with farm land are not to be used by developers to structure their sales of real estate to limit GST on or after 1 July. The supply of subdivided farm land and land for farming is GST-free. Presently, an entity which acquires real estate and then sells it under the margin scheme pays the GST on the value added by itself. The value added by the supplying registered entity is not included for GST purposes. This anomaly will be overcome. It will be made plain that the GST is payable only on the incremental value. It is only on an increase that it is payable, and it is only paid when there is a connected series of just transactions. The GST is only paid on the increase. It is only paid on the increase of the value of a property sold after 1 July 2000. The bill overcomes that problem by preventing the application of the margin scheme and by ensuring that land is treated as a taxable supply for GST purposes. There are further amendments to ensure that if the margin scheme is used following a GST-free sale of a going concern-for example, an artificial or a contrived scheme to enable registered entities to avoid GSTthen the Commissioner of Taxation can negative any benefit for GST purposes. This is not about denying legitimate concessions. This schedule is concerned with schemes which are designed to avoid the payment of GST. The current law is unfair because some property developers can take advantage of the margin scheme to avoid GST while others cannot. I do not anticipate that there will be any significant increase in the price of housing and land as a result of these changes. The explanatory memorandum makes that clear. Where I live, there is property development everywhere, and I cannot imagine that the Ripley Valley, Springfield, Walloon, Rosewood or Flinders View are going to see a major increase in the value of land and housing as a result of these changes. Schedule 2 reforms what is called thin capitalisation. That is about where debt exceeds the prescribed level under the Income Tax Assessment Act. The entity is then said to be thinly capitalised-that is what it really is about. This schedule reforms the thin capitalisation regime in relation to the Income Tax Assessment Act concerning accounting standards for identifying and valuing a registered entity's assets, liability and equity tal. The intention is to adjust for certain impacts the adoption in 2005 of the Australian equivalents to the International Financial Reporting Standards. The thin capitalisation regime is basic to our tax system. It ensures companies, Australian and foreign, do not set about reducing their tax liabilities under the Income Tax Assessment Act by setting aside an excessive amount of their debts to their business dealings in Australia-in other words, that they do not say, ‘This debt is in Australia; therefore I can reduce the tax which I pay in Australia.' This will ensure that those companies pay their fair share of tax in Australia, which is good for our economy and our capacity as a government to provide for the people of Australia. Schedule 3 ensures that defined bonds issued by our state and territory governments are eligible for exemption from interest withholding tax. This measure was first announced by the Treasurer on 20 May 2008 in the context of reforms to assist our financial markets. What we have seen overseas in the last few months indicates how crucial the viability of our financial markets is to the continuing prosperity of our economy and our people. Our state government bond issuance is crucial to the integrity of our financial markets in the global financial crisis. If our state bond markets work better, with enhanced interest in these types of securities, this will add to our economic security and viability, and it is likely to result in a greater pool of funds available to state and territory governments. Improved liquidity of the market and getting more people-individuals and companies-involved in these types of investments improves the financial capacity of our states to provide for law and order, hospitals, schools and other essential services in our states and territories. It is crucial that we capienhance confidence in our markets, financial and otherwise, to ensure that our economy, our companies-both large and small-and our individuals have confidence not just in the government but in the future prosperity of our country. Improving the financial security of our state and territory governments, and therefore their capacity to spend money on essential infrastructure, is important both nationally and particularly in South-East Queensland, where I live and where one in seven people in Australia reside. Schedule 4 relates to arrangements where an employer gives a fringe benefit to its employee and associate-almost invariably a spouse in the circumstances-when the two of them are, for example, engaged in jointly acquiring an income-producing asset, for example a rental home, a rental unit or some shares. It is very common today for people to own rental units, rental properties generally and shares. We are a country that really is interested in these types of things. When I was a boy, these were not the things that the average Australian was particularly interested in, but nowadays this type of investment is crucial to our long-term security. The days when we could rely on or guarantee the pension are well and truly gone. We really need to provide for those who are disadvantaged in old age through the provision of pensions, but we also need to provide for old age through our superannuation and other investments. The reform in schedule 4 relates to what is commonly called the otherwise deductible rule. The member for Casey talked about a very curious court decision in a matter involving the National Australia Bank and the federal Commissioner of Taxation in what has become known colloquially as the NAB case. In that case, the employer provided some low-interest loans jointly to an employee husband and his wife. That is a pretty common occurrence. Those joint low-interest loans were invested in a jointly held investment property. In other words, it was a loan fringe benefit. Very strangely, the Federal Court held that the employee was the sole recipient of the loan fringe held that, as the sole recipient of the loan and the sole investor of the proceeds, if the employee husband had incurred and paid unreimbursed interest on the loan, he would be entitled to a deduction for the expense. In other words, the otherwise deductible rule under section 19 of the legislation meant that the taxable value of the loan fringe benefit was reduced to nil so that the employee had no fringe benefit tax liability arising from loan fringe benefit provided to both the employee and his spouse. This outcome is really a legal nonsense and it is entirely inconsistent with the operation of the otherwise deductible rule. The amendments in the legislation before the House overcome this very bizarre decision of the Federal Court, and I commend that particular part of the legislation which overcomes the very weird decision of the Federal Court in relation to taxation. For agreements between employer and employee entered into before 13 May 2008, they will still be able to use the current law, but we are giving until 31 March 2009 to allow employers and employees",79

68,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. I refer to the statement of the member for Dawson this morning when he said ‘There is no question that Kevin Rudd was indiscreet' when false and damaging details of a private and confithe dential conversation with the United States President were leaked to the media. I ask the Acting Prime Minister: if the Prime Minister has not already apologised for this appalling indiscretion, will he apologise to the US President during his G20 visit to Washington and will he give a commitment to this parliament that he will not be so derelict in his future dealings with President-elect Obama and other world leaders?",82
69,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do sincerely thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. On the question of things that the member for Dawson may have said, I will check. I will not take the word of the Leader of the Opposition on that. On the substance of the Leader of the Opposition's question, it strikes me as remarkable that the Leader of the Liberal Party would be calling on someone to apologise to President-elect Obama other than the former Prime Minister of this nation, John Howard. That is who should be apologising to President-elect Obama. Let us just imagine a parallel universe where in 2007 John Howard had won the last election. Let us imagine a parallel universe where John Howard is in the prime ministership-the member for Higgins has been reassured by him that he will hand it over when he is 94, so the member for Higgins is patiently waiting-and the presidential election is over; we know that President-elect Obama has won. Let us just imagine how that phone call would have gone between Prime Minister Howard and President-elect Obama. I do not think it would have escaped President-elect Obama's notice that Prime Minister Howard said about him: I think that would just encourage those who wanted completely to destabilise and destroy and create chaos and victory for the terrorists hang on and hope for (an) Obama victory. These are the words of former Prime Minister Howard: If I was running al-Qaeda in Iraq, I would put a circle around March 2008, and pray, as many times as possible, for a victory not only for Obama, but also for the Democrats. Just imagine how that telephone conversation would have gone. Just imagine it. Dr Southcott- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Under the standing orders, questions cannot contain hypothetical material. Surely, the same standing orders apply to answers as well.",83
70,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"At risk of getting myself into trouble, I would make the observation: if only the member's point of order were right. It is not, and I refer him to page 553 of the Practice.",83
71,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I was asked about the question of apologies to President-elect Obama and I am just asking the House to imagine the first telephone call, had it ever occurred, if we were in that parallel universe between Prime Minister John Howard and the man he had calledMr Turnbull- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The Acting Prime Minister said she was asked about apologies to President-elect Obama. Without wanting to declare a war on irrelevance, she was actually asked about an apology to President Bush and she should return to it.",83
72,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Acting Prime Minister has the call.,83
73,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The question actually did refer to President-elect Obama, but putting that to one side, of course what should be happening here is that we should be noting not what the Leader of the Opposition says but what he does. When the greatest Iraq, offence was paid to President-elect Obama to by the then Prime Minister of this country, when the then Prime Minister of this country described the man who is now going to be President of the United States as a terrorist, did we see the member for Wentworth go out and condemn it publicly? Did we see him disassociate himself from it? No, we did not. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order to do with relevance. I ask the Acting Prime Minister to come back to the question that was asked.",83
74,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Acting Prime Minister will respond to the question and bring her answer to a conclusion.,84
75,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am very happy to. The opposition day after day has raised this issue when it has been fully dealt with by the Prime Minister. What I am asking for is an explanation of their hypocrisy, given the actions of former Prime Minister Howard. Workplace Relations",84
76,Mr SYMON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. Will the Acting Prime Minister advise the House on how the government is achieving its commitment to delivering both fairness and balance in Australian workplaces and transparency and openness in government?,84
77,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Deakin for his question, and I know that he is deeply interested in workplace relations and fairness and balance in workplaces and has been working closely with me on the development of the government's new workplace relations legislation. I thank him for his efforts. When the Liberal Party was in office we saw industrial relations extremism in this country in the form of Work Choices. This government is committed to fairness and balance in workplaces and we will, before this parliament rises, deliver into this parliament ment for debate and determination our substantive bill to bring fairness to Australian workplaces. But, as well as being industrial relations extremists, the Liberal Party in government were the masters of the cover-up, because they did not want working people to knowthey did not want Australians to know-just how badly hit and hurt they had been by Work Choices and the industrial relations extremism of the Liberal Party. Indeed, the member for North Sydney, now the Manager of Opposition Business and then the relevant minister, used to make an art form of going round denying that such data existed. I am in a position today to advise members of the House and people more generally that we have worked to compile a sample of Australian workplace agreements which will be available for researchers, including members of the media, to use. The sample is now available on DVD-ROM, and what the sample does is compare pre-Work Choices Australian workplace agreements with Work Choices Australian workplace agreements. This is an interesting comparison because pre-Work Choices Australian workplace agreements were bad enough-there is no place for individual statutory employment agreements in a fair system-but, when you compare them to Work Choices Australian workplace agreements, what strikes you is that they look so much better, which is not a compliment to those old AWAs; it is a revelation about how bad Work Choices AWAs were for Australian workers brought to them by the industrial relations extremists in the Liberal Party. To give you just a snapshot of that information, if we look at this sample, in the retail industry Work Choices AWAs, on average, reduced overtime penalty rates from 54 per cent to 35 per cent-that is, the number of people who got penalty rates in their agreewas reduced from 54 per cent to 35 per cent as a result of Work Choices AWAs. They were rip-offs taking away penalty rates. This also happened in the accommodation, cafe and restaurant industry, where we saw the number of agreements that had penalty rates for overtime reduced from 42 per cent to 20 per cent.",84
78,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,84
79,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The industrial relations extremists chant out, ‘How much was their pay?' when ABS data clearly shows, when comparing pay outcomes on Australian workplace agreements to pay outcomes on collective agreements, that they ripped people off. I am pleased with the interjections because they indicate yet again to the Australian people, in case they were in any doubt, that those on the other side are a party of industrial relations extremists that are still supporting Work Choices. There is a test here for the Leader of the Opposition, who voted for Work Choicesvoted in favour of it every time it was presented to this parliament. There he was, lined up as a member of the Howard government: ‘Workplace relations extremism? Count me in.' Yes, he voted for that on each and every occasion. Now, shortly, he will have to make a choice as to whether he will still support workplace relations extremism or support a fair and balanced system. I would say to the Australian people on this issue: watch not what the Leader of the Opposition says but what he does when the Liberal Party votes on this matter. Economy",85
80,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Acting Treasurer and Minister for Finance and Deregulation. I refer the Acting Treasurer to the Prime Minister's announcement on 12 October of a government guarantee of wholesale funding of Australian incorporated banks and other authorised deposit-taking institutions, which, from the moment of its announcement, the opposition has called upon the government to make the subject of legislation. Does the Acting Treasurer accept that the Prime Minister's stubborn and indecisive refusal to present legislation ensuring that payment on the guarantee is, in the words of Standard and Poor's, ‘unconditional, irrevocable and timely' is going to undermine the entire objective of enabling Australian institutions to raise wholesale funds overseas, depriving banks of much if not all of its benefit? Doesn't this mean that if the banks do not benefitMr Albanese- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order: standing order 100(d).",85
81,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The difficulty that the chair is in is that there has been a degree of flexibility allowed when there have been expressions that are by way of argument or other matters against the standing order. On this occasion, whilst it has been highlighted, I will allow it, but I am assuming that the question is nearly finished.",85
82,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is, Mr Speaker. It is a complex and important issue.",85

86,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Leader of the Opposition will ignore the interjections, and the interjections will cease.",85
87,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Doesn't this meanMs Gillard- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the Leader of the Opposition has insisted that people be called by their correct title. That also applies to the Leader of the House.",85
88,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition will refer to members by their parliamentary or ministerial title.,85
89,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I will not read the whole of the question again but just the final paragraph. Doesn't this mean,85
90,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,85
91,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am glad the government think this is so funny. You are listening-good. Doesn't this mean that if the banks do not benefit then neither will the millions of Australians desperate for banks to lower interest rate charges on loans, credit cards and other borrowings?",85
92,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. The premise of the question is that the absence of legislation underpinning the contracts that the government is going to offer wholesale borrowers of funding, mainly financial institutions and in particular banks, would in some way undermine the integrity of those offers. This is a premise that I do not accept and the government does not accept. Should a government in the future, for example, this government, ever be called upon to fulfil such a guarantee because an organisation has collapsed-a remote eventuality, I hasten to underline, and the government has stated that from day one-the premise behind the Leader of the Opposition's question is that the attempt by the government of the day, perhaps the Rudd government, to get legislation through the Senate to honour that guarantee would fail. I wonder why the opposition might consider that an attempt by a government to fulfil an obligation to the Australian people in management of the Australian economy might fail in the Senate. I wonder why the Leader of the Opposition might consider that to be a serious possibility. I assert that any future government that is required to honour such an obligation would have the support of the parliament in honouring such an obligation. The government in pursuing this guarantee is doing so on the basis of the executive power to enter into contracts, and that is how the government intends to proceed. Workplace Relations Mrs D'ATH (2.16 pm)-My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. Will the Acting Prime Minister explain the importance of certainty and stability in workplace relations for Australian families and Australian businesses, and are there any threats to certainty and stability?",86
93,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Petrie for her question and I also thank her for her efforts in working with me on the government's workplace relations legislation, which will be in this parliament shortly. I sincerely thank her for her efforts. The government when in opposition last year made a set of promises to the Australian people. We promised them, if elected, we would sweep Work Choices away. We promised them, if elected, we would implement our Forward with Fairness plans. They were detailed to the Australian community and the Australian community voted for them. Those plans will ensure that we have a system that working people in this country can rely on. Under Labor's system, the days of the rip-offs of the Liberal Party and its industrial extremism will be over. Our system will have at its heart a rock solid foundation, a modern safety net made up of 10 National Employment Standards and modern awards. No-one will be able to sweep that safety net away the way it was swept away under Work Choices. We will have a bargaining system that is fair. We will ensure that if the majority of employees want to bargain in their workplace then their employer will bargain with them. We will ensure that there is bargaining in good faith. Our new industrial umpire, Fair Work Australia, will be empowered to make good faith bargaining orders. Our new industrial umpire will be able to direct parties to meet, to disclose relevant information and to consider proposals and respond to them in bargaining. Our new laws will ensure good faith bargaining includes refraining from unfair or capricious conduct. If bargaining goes off the rails, the industrial umpire will be there to help. It will be able to convene conferences, conciliate and make recommendations on the application of one party. We will have special arrangements for low-paid workers. We believe low-paid workers should be assisted. That is something that the Liberal Party never believed in, because low-paid workers were at the centre of the rip-offs of Work Choices. Members of the opposition shake their heads, but the facts are against them. The facts show crystal clear that it was the industrially weak that bore the brunt of Work Choices, and those opposite defended it. Our industrial umpire will be able to deal with unfair dismissals. Our industrial umpire will be there to help ensure fairness in the system. We want to provide certainty for Australian employees and Australian employers. We have worked hard and collaboratively with employers and employees during the course of this year. With a business advisory group, with a small business working party, with a workers advisory group and through the committee on industrial legislation, we worked through the details of this legislation. It will be in the parliament soon. The great unanswered question here is: what will the Liberal Party do when the legislation comes to the parliament? The Liberal Party is led by a man who voted for the extreme Work Choices laws 23 times, despite Australians around the country urging him not to do so. We are still awaiting an answer. I say to Australians again: do not ever listen to what the Leader of the Opposition says but watch what he does. We will know whether or not he is still entirely in the embrace of industrial relations extremism and wants to have Work Choices still hurting working families in this country before this parliament rises at the end of the year.",86
94,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Attorney-General. Will the Attorney-General advise the House if his department has provided any advice to the effect that legislation should be enacted to underpin the wholesale bank funding guarantee?,87
95,Mr MCCLELLAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. It has been the practice of both sides of parliament not to provide details of legal advice. I can confirm, to answer the honourable member's question, that my department has provided advice. I acknowledge the presence in the chamber of the former Attorney-General, the member for Berowra, who has specifically said that on a number of occasions. In terms of the legislative underpinnings, the Acting Treasurer has said that the guarantees will be provided on the basis of contracts entered into under the executive power of the Commonwealth, but the Commonwealth is clearly entitled to rely on all constitutional heads, including banking, corporations, interstate and international trade, insurance and so on. While I will not detail the advice that has been provided to government, I can assure the honourable Leader of the Opposition that the measures that will be implemented will have an appropriate constitutional underpinning. Regulatory Reform",87
96,Mr NEUMANN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. Will the minister outline to the House the importance of international engagement to help address the global financial crisis?,87
97,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Blair for his question. One of the key contributing factors to the global financial crisis has been poor regulation. A cavalier attitude to risk, of course, has been relevant to this crisis, and also opaque and complex financial structures that have been allowed to develop Economy in an inadequate regulatory framework internationally, particularly but not only in the United States. That presents a very big reform challenge not just for Australia but also for the entire international community. Australia does have a very robust and strong set of regulatory institutions and a very strong regulatory framework. That is something that I have said on a number of occasions has emerged under both sides of politics. One of the reasons the recent attacks by leading opposition figures on the key regulators were so disappointing is that I believe both sides of politics in this country can take credit for Austraincluding lia having a strong, robust and world-class regulatory regime. The government is taking strong and decisive action both at home and abroad to pursue regulatory reform. Today, Senator Sherry, the Minister for Superannuation and Corporate Governance, and I announced new initiatives with respect to a couple of key issues that arise as a result of the global nancial crisis: first, reform of regulation of credit-rating agencies and research houses to require them to hold financial services licences, which they have not previously been required to do, and to provide annual compliance reports to ASIC with respect to their methodologies; and, secondly, the requirement of full disclosure of covered short selling where the participant has a direct legal interest in the share that is being purported be sold and an outright and indefinite ban on naked short selling, which ASIC will have the power to lift should it so consider that appropriate. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer are both currently en route to the leaders of the G20 summit in Washington that is going to occur this weekend. The purpose of that summit is to analyse the causes of the global financial crisis, to receive reports from the key countries on progress on the responses emerging from those countries to the crisis and, in particular, to agree on a common set of principles for reform of regulation of the global financial sector in order to prevent any kind of recurrence of the crisis that the world has just been through. The Prime Minister made a very early contribution to this debate in his address to the United Nations General Assembly, where he laid out a number of key principles in order to structure an approach on the part of the world's financial system in order to ensure that we get stricter, stronger regulation, things like clamping down on excessive executive salaries and stricter capital adequacy requirements. Australia is set to play a very significant role in the international efforts to reform our financial regulatory structure. As I said, that is something that both sides of this House should rightly take pride in, that we are in a good position to influence the international outcomes on fi- these issues because we bring to the table in these discussions the strength and the credibility based on having had a strong, robust regulatory regime for some time-good arrangements in Australia that mean our word will be treated with some respect in these discussions. There are big issues to be debated in these discussions that go to the entire role of the financial services sector in our economy. We to have seen entire industries built up around moving money from here to there to here in ever increasingly complex arrangements, with ever greater complexity, with ever greater cavalier disregard for underlying risk and ever greater disconnection from the activities in the ordinary, mainstream real world economy. Many have lost sight of the role of financial services, which of course is intermediation of two broad kinds: to direct savings, whether national or global, into investment to maximise returns, productivity and efficiency and to enable day-today transactional banking activities to occur at the lowest cost and the maximum efficiency. Those are the functions that the financial services sector are supposed to fulfil in a modern economy, but we have seen it grow and proliferate and mutate to a range of activities that, to any reasonable to bear little relationship with its core tasks-as I say, with less and less transparency and attention to risk and with ever greater complexity. We have got to revisit these issues globally to ensure that the financial services sector serves the wider economy, not the other way around. The Rudd government is working hard, with the Prime Minister and the Treasurer pursuing global reform of the financial services sector at the G20. We are pursuing structural reform at home. We will continue these efforts to get better arrangements for all Australians. Economy",87
98,Mr TURNBULL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Acting Treasurer. I note the Acting Treasurer has conceded that payment under the wholesale guarantee cannot be made without an appropriation bill being passed by parliament. Is the Acting Treasurer aware that Standard and Poor's has ruled it will not give the government guarantee a AAA credit rating unless the payment on the guarantee is ‘unconditional, irrevocable and timely'? Why won't the government act to fix this flawed guarantee and allow banks to receive its full benefits, which must then be passed on to the millions of Australian customers through lower interest charges and fees?",89
99,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I do not really have much to add to the previous answer that I gave to this question. The same position applies. The position is that the government believes that it has full executive power in order to enter into these contracts and that these will have the desired effect with respect to delivering the guarantees that the financial institutions require in order to ensure that they enjoy the confidence of investors who are lending money to them, particularly international investors.",89
100,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You sent us to war without observer, seem legislation!",89
101,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Banks has actually made a very important interjection, because it illustrates the point that the government of this country, under Liberal or Labor, from time to time enters into a variety of very serious obligations that are not necessarily legislated by the parliament, including decisions to go to war. So when John Howard decided to go to war in Iraq he did not go to the parliament first and get money for that decision. He made a decision and the government made a decision to go to war without parliamentary authority, which he was entitled to do under the executive authority of the Commonwealth. So it is within the executive authority of the government to take these decisions, and they will provide the guarantees under the basis of contract that these institutions require. Should it ever be required that a guarantee of this kind must be delivered upon, then that will need to be appropriated. I conclude on this point: when this was announced by the government, the opposition said it gave bipartisan support to the initiative. Mr Turnbull interjecting",89
102,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition has asked his question.,89
103,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"So, in other words, yet again the opposition is trying to slide out of its initial phoney, statesmanlike position, trying to pretend that it is both supporting the government's initiative to stabilise the economy-and in this case help to produce lower interest rates-and, at the same time, sniping relentlessly at those initiatives. If the opposition were fair dinkum about its support for these positions then it would not be asking these questions, because implicit in these questions is the assumption that they would block an appropriation in the Senate for any such guarantee. Child Care",89
104,Ms SAFFIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. Will the Acting Prime Minister update the House on the government's actions in responding to the appointment of an administrator and receiver for ABC Learning one week ago?,90
105,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Page for her question, and I know she is concerned about the circumstances of child care in her own electorate. Indeed, she sent me a note raising some issues with me during the course of question time because she is very concerned to stay across everything that is happening locally. Can I say to members in the House generally that it is exactly one week since ABC Learning announced they were going into voluntary administration. I understand members of the government are following these matters and dealing with local inquiries-the member for Page is.",90
106,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,90
107,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I take it from the interjections that members of the opposition are not concerned and not engaged. But in the past seven days the government has been working hard to help ensure the stability and continuity of child care across this nation families. Last Thursday ABC Learning moved into voluntary administration and, soon after, a receiver was appointed. From the outset, we have sought to keep mums and dads informed about what is happening with ABC Learning. Within hours of the company's announcement and the appointment of the receiver, the government established a dedicated hotline number. The number is 1802003. To date we have had 700 calls to this number. As well as the hotline, the government provided information through the mychild.gov.au website. So far pages on this site have been viewed over 55,000 times since last Thursday, obviously showing people are looking for information. On Friday I announced a funding package of up to $22 million to provide certainty for affected parents and to ensure that ABC Learning centres continue in operation until 31 December and that everybody has the care that they need for their children and need to rely on. We are of course working to ensure that we can make a further statement to give parents certainty for the period beyond. On Tuesday this week I announced that an expression of interest process had commenced for those who were interested in owning and operating ABC Learning centres. People, whether they are from the profit sector or not-for-profit sector, can register their interest with the receiver. Yesterday, Wednesday, I updated the House on the detailed work plan that the government's insolvency adviser, PPB, and the receiver, MCGRATHNicol, have embarked on in order to find the way forward. At every stage, the government have acted decisively to deal with this problem in the interests of working families. Indeed, the government have worked all year to clean up the mess that we inherited in child care from the Liberal Party. It strikes me as passing for strange that, now they are sitting on the opposition benches, apparently they are styling themselves as policy geniuses, but in government they left us with the kind of mess that we are dealing with in child care. ‘Let the market rip!' There was no workforce plan, no quality plan, no early learning years plan and no plan for market design, and here we are, fixing up the mess. Of course, much of that work has been done by the Parliamentary Secretary for Early Childhood Education and Childcare, the member for Bennelong, and I want to thank her for it. I would draw the attention of members of the House to the fact that this work has not gone unnoticed by those in the childcare sector and those who care desperately about policy in this area. I would draw the House's attention to the words of Professor Deborah Brennan from the Social Policy Research Centre at the University of New South Wales, who today wrote in the Age: Since Labor came to office, a lot of quiet has been happening behind the scenes. Early childhood educators, unions, providers and public servants are working on a variety of projects will strengthen regulations and accreditation in the early childhood sector, introduce a national “early learning” framework, and improve the qualifications of the early childhood workforce. We are dealing with child care for the future and we will continue to do so. Emissions Trading Scheme",90
108,Mr IAN MACFARLANE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"2.37 pm)My question is to the Minister for Resources and Energy and the Minister for Tourism. I refer the minister to his admission that every tonne of carbon dioxide emitted in Australia during the production of liquefied natural gas saves the production of nine tonnes of carbon dioxide when consumed in China for electricity generation. Minister, if the government is serious about lowering global greenhouse gas emissions, why is it condemning the liquefied natural gas industry to a 25 per cent cut in production by refusing to compensate it under the proposed ETS and condemning the world at the same time to a subsequent increase in CO2 emissions?",91
109,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for the question. The member for Groom has raised a very serious question: the challenge of the Australian government to introduce a balanced Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme in association with introducing a renewable energy target of 20 per cent by 2020. That is exceptionally important because this government, unlike the previous government, is absolutely committed to a comprehensive response to climate change while maintaining Australian jobs and economic prosperity. The truth of the matter is that, unlike the previous government, we are equal to the task and prepared to take on the hard jobs confronting Australia in the 21st century. It is for that very reason that the Austrawork lian government is engaged in a detailed process of consultation not only with the LNG industry but also with all other industhat tries potentially affected by the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. In handling these challenges, we are committed to putting in place not only an appropriate Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme but also a portfolio of responses, including the development of a renewable energy source program and improving energy efficiency in Australian industry. The concerns raised by the LNG industry have been listened to by me and by other ministers in response to a genuine green paper process aimed at making sure we put in place a balanced response going to the introduction of a price on carbon, the objective being to reduce Australia's exposure to carbon emissions. I simply say to the LNG industryperhaps this is a lesson for some on the other side on the issue of consultation and taking the Australian community with them-that the Australian government is absolutely committed to providing the internationally competitive investment and regulatory frameworks necessary for the expansion of the LNG industry in Australia. With respect to the future of the LNG industry in Australia, I was pleased to see the announcement by Inpex about a potential $20 billion investment in Darwin in recent weeks. That announcement is not only important for Australia, it is exceptionally important for the future of Northern Australia. The LNG industry is not only part of Australia's future; it is also part of the global community's response to climate change. It is also vital for jobs, exports, economic growth, regional development and investment. I simply say to the member for Groom: it is about time that the opposition understood that in the 21st century we have to take on the modern challenges. That is about maintaining jobs and prosperity in Australia and also acting in a decisive way on the climate change front. Local Government",91
110,Ms CAMPBELL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government. What is the government doing to build new partnerships with local government and support the important work they do in communities across Australia?",92
111,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Bass for her question, and for hosting the eighth community cabinet that the Rudd government has held. It was held in Launceston just last week. As well as the formal meetings with the community cabinet, cabinet ministers meet with relevant people from their portfolio. Indeed, before the formal proceedings at Launceston City Council, I met with the mayors of Launceston, George Town, Dorset, Flinders Island and Meander Valley. I am also pleased to inform the House that next week the second quarterly instalment from the government's record $1.9 billion financial assistance grants will be distributed to all local councils and shires around Australia. This is a record amount of financial support that was provided by the government in the budget. Importantly, around two-thirds of this support will go to regional and rural councils, thereby providing them with support. Because they are untied grants, the local communities can decide for themselves how this money is spent. But of course our support for local government does not stop there. We want a new partnership between the national government and local government. The cornerstone of that new partnership is the Australian Council of Local Government. Next Tuesday this partnership will be put into practice when up to 400 of the nation's mayors and shire presidents come to Canberra to engage in dialogue with the cabinet and with other members who have chosen to come, including the shadow minister for housing and local government, the member for Cook. They will be discussing building a new cooperative relationship amongst governments, helping to address the particular challenges that the growth regions are experiencing, the implementation of the government's regional and local community infrastructure program that we announced in the budget in May and the path to constitutional recognition. But of course they have also been intimately involved in the lead-up to the conference. They have been engaged in setting the agenda. Indeed, on 22 October, when parliament was sitting a couple of weeks ago, I hosted a meeting here which all of the state local government associations attended, along with other invited senior local government representatives including the Lord Mayor of Brisbane, Campbell Newman, who is playing a constructive role in the new organisation, and the Lord Mayor of Adelaide, Michael Harbison. They pledged to make the meeting a success. We met again last week, again making sure that local government are very involved in the process itself in the lead-up to next week's meeting, which will mark a new beginning in cooperative federalism-one that advances the economic interest based upon getting that local input so that everyone benefits regardless of where they live in Australia. Emissions Trading Scheme",92
112,Mr ROBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Acting Treasurer.,93
113,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,93
114,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Those on my right will come to order!,93
115,Mr ROBB,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think he would like to hear the question, Mr Speaker. I refer the Acting Treasurer to the politically rushed and flawed design of the government's emissions trading scheme. What will be the increase in global greenhouse gas emissions if, as has been reported, Nyrstar closes its Port Pirie and Hobart smelters and Visy shuts down its two paper recycling plants in Melbourne and Sydney and these facilities move to China? Where are the 3½ thousand Australians expected to find new jobs?",93
116,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It is clear the Liberal Party is still unable to make up its mind on whether it thinks climate change is real or not.,93
117,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,93
118,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The question has been asked. The minister is responding.,93
119,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Only a couple of days ago in one of his lesser moments, while he was busily out there accusing the Treasury secretary of cooking the books, the member for Goldstein was also trailing his well established ‘capitalesque sceptic' credentials on radio and indicating that he does not share the views of the Leader of the Oppositionor at least on what the Leader of the Opposition says will occur. You may recall that the Minister for Resources and Energy responded to a question briefly, and I can only reiterate the point that he made. That is: in contrast to the previous government, which did nothing for 10 years about the climate change challenge, this government is committed to dealing with climate change, both by cooperation in international forums and by establishing a carbon pollution reduction scheme that is designed to ensure that Australia can gradually diminish its emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases and, in doing so, structure the scheme in such a way as to take into account the sectoral needs of specific parts of the economy that are particularly exposed, such as emission intensive trade exposed industries. The member for Goldstein would be aware that Professor Garnaut reported on and proposed a particular structure to deal with this specific problemMr Robb interjecting",93
120,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Goldstein has asked his question.,93
121,Mr TANNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"and that the government has established a green paper process, which is part of the way through, involving discussions with people from a variety of industries who do have concerns of this kind. I have been involved in many of these discussions with major companies, including as recently as this morning, about their views as to the structure of the scheme. One of the biggest companies in Australia with particular points of view to put met with me about these issues, and one of the things they said was: ‘Don't delay. Yes, there are issues to be debated. Yes, there is a good process through which these matters can be debated in public, courtesy of the green paper process and Professor Garnaut's report. But do not delay; proceed to make decisions and ensure that Australia can get on with tackling climate change and playing a leadership role in the world because we cannot afford to keep ignoring this problem.' We as a nation cannot afford to continue to ignore the problem as the former Howard government did-with the Leader of the Opposition as minister for the environment-for 10 years. Australia can no longer afford to be run by climate change sceptics. Diabetes",93
122,Mr SULLIVAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Health and Ageing. What type of support is the government providing to children with type 1 diabetes?,94
123,Ms ROXON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Longman for his question. He and many members on both sides of the House do take a great interest in what we can do to assist those, particularly children, with type 1 diabetes. It is a good day to ask this question because tomorrow is World Diabetes Day. I know that tonight many people will be going to the Diabetes Australia gala dinner to mark this day, particularly the parliamentary support group, the member for Pearce, the member for Moore, the member for Isaacs and the member for Lyons-the executive members amongst this House. I know many people will be attending and I trust that it will be a great celebration. The member for Longman has a particular reason for asking this question. Cabinet ministers would recall that in March we held a community cabinet meeting in the member for Longman's seat in Narangba. A very brave young boy insisted on keeping his hand up for, I think, almost all of the community cabinet to have a chance to ask the Prime Minister a question about what action we could take in helping children with type 1 diabetes. He asked the Prime Minister if the government would consider subsidising insulin pumps for children diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. We assured the family at the time that we were considering the matter of subsiding insulin pumps for children diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. I am very pleased, as members of this House would know, that we were able to fund a subsidisation program in our first budget. This commitment commenced on 1 November and means that eligible families will receive a subsidy of between $500 and $2½ thousand to assist with the cost of insulin pumps. Two weeks ago I was pleased to be joined by the CEO of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, Mike Wilson, and the President of Diabetes Australia, Dr Gary Deed, to announce that the program was now open for applications. The program will administered by the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. On that morning we also heard from a young youth ambassador, Hannah Frank, of the changes to her life since she has been able to use an insulin pump. I would like to read to the House part of the speech that Hannah gave. I remind you that these are the words of a nine-year-old girl. She said: I know lots of things I hope my friends never need to know. I know how to prick my finger and test my blood sugar levels. I know to eat lollies if my blood sugar level is too low. If I don't I will probably go unconscious and be rushed to hospital. I know it makes me sad when the kids at school wish that they had diabetes so they could eat lollies too. I would be happy to never eat a lolly again if I could just not have type I diabetes. My pump has made a difference to our whole family. Our life doesn't have to be planned around injections and I have more freedom like my friends. I can also sleep at my best friend Meg's house, which is the best part of having a pump. So this is a very real program that will make a very real difference to many hundreds of families across the country. We are pleased that it is being supported by all members of this House. I would like to thank, as I did at the beginning, those opposite who have been so supportive of this measure. The insulin pump does assist in keeping glucose at a more stable level and assists in the reduction of complications later in life. Research indicates that the insulin pump therapy improves the quality of life of people living with type 1 diabetes while, of course, we continue on our search to find a cure. I remind the House that, whilst we need to always redouble our efforts in trying to reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes, type 1 diabetes as yet is not preventable and we in this House need to do all we can to assist those with type 1 diabetes, and this measure is an important step.",94
124,Mr DUTTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE," Mr Speaker, on indulgence: I want to associate the opposition with the comments of the Minister for Health and Ageing. The government is doing very good work in relation to type 1 diabetes in particular and it builds on the work that the member for Warringah as the then health minister did when in government. It is a wonderful cause to help people who are in great need. There are about 128,000 young Australians with type 1 diabetes and about 709,000 Australians with type 2 diabetes. It is certainly deserving bipartisan approach. I commend all those members of the House who have been associated with this, in particular the member for Pearce. It is a wonderful cause that we should all support. New South Wales: Infrastructure",95
125,Mr ABBOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, and it refers to the government's plans to pay for infrastructure which the New South Wales is now too broke to afford. I ask: does the minister agree that the New South Wales government should sack itself and call an election immediately to save the people of New South Wales from the sheer incompetence crippling our state?",95
126,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The question is out of order. I call the member for Melbourne Ports. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The member for Warringah was referring to an article in a newspaper todayMr Tanner- Mr SPEAKER ",95
127,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Minister for Finance and Deregulation will resume his seat. The unnecessary use of the front page of the paper amuses me no end! I will allow a point of order on my suggestion that the question was out of order. Mr Hockey- Mr Speaker, the member for Warringah asked a question about a media report today. He asked a question of the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, who is going to allocate money to New South Wales infrastructure. It seems like a perfectly legitimate question to ask.",95
128,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I think it was a long bow when the minister was asked whether or not he thought the New South of a Wales government should sack itself. The member for Melbourne Ports has the call. Democratic Republic of the Congo,95
129,Mr DANBY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. How is the government responding to the emerging humanitarian crisis in the Democratic Republic of the Congo?,95
130,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Melbourne Ports for his question. The Australian government is very deeply concerned about the recent outbreak of violence and fighting in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Regrettably, the Democratic Republic of the Congo is a country with a terrible recent history of conflict and suffering. Its people have suffered two civil wars between 1996 and 2003 and it is estimated that those wars have claimed over five million lives as a result of violence and consequent disease and starvation. The Democratic Republic of the Congo in conjunction with the international community, including the United Nations, has made considerable efforts in recent times to restore stability and rebuild national unity. Since 2000 a United Nations peacekeeping organisation has been present in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and over the years Australia has given substantial and strong support to that UN peacekeeping organisation, contributing over $30 million. Very regrettably, as members would be aware, we have recently seen conflict break out again. In October the forces of General Nkunda moved through North Kivu province in the east, defying not just government forces but also those UN peacekeepers. There have been alarming reports of targeted violence against civilians, including lootings and killings and the use of rape as an instrument of war. There have been intense international community efforts to seek to resolve the crisis. I refer to the efforts of Foreign Secretary Miliband and French Foreign Minister Kouchner, who flew to the region to meet with President Kagame of Rwanda and President Kabila of the Republic. In early November the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon held in Nairobi an emergency meeting of African heads of states. The secretary-general has called for an immediate ceasefire, the establishment of aid corridors to allow urgent delivery of humanitarian assistance, reinforcement of the UN peacekeeping mission and implementation of peace agreements previously signed. The government very much welcomes the recent announcement by SADC-the Southern African Development Community-to provide not just support of those sentiments expressed by the secretary-general but also immediate military and humanitarian aid. Australia stands alongside the secretarygeneral in his efforts to see a resolution to this crisis. Whilst it is appropriate for Australia to make a contribution to peacekeeping through its contribution to the United Nations, it is not, in the government's view, appropriate to make a military or a peacekeeping contribution in terms of boots on the ground. But it is important for Australia to consider the need for urgent humanitarian aid and assistance. Early in November, in response to the crisis, I announced that we would apply $1 million emergency humanitarian assistance, enabling us to give consideration to further humanitarian assistance on the basis of the United Nations assessment. I am able to advise the House today that Australia will make, all up, a contribution of $5 million for humanitarian assistance in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It comprises the $4 million that I am announcing today, $3 million of which will go to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to deal with nearly 250,000 displaced people, to UNICEF and to the UN Office of the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. One million dollars will go to Australian NGOs who have a presence in Africa. Of the $1 million previously announced, as I have indicated before, half a million dollars will go to the World Health Organisation and half a million dollars will go to UNICEF. The funding of these agencies will allow for the immediate needs for those adversely affected by the violence-in particular food, health, water and the protection of women. Australia's desire to assist is not just a reflection of our desire to be a good international citizen but also a reflection of the government's view that Australia needs to increase and enhance its commitment to the countries of Africa and to engage with the countries of Africa. Australia needs to forge broader and deeper relations with the countries of Africa and build on the people-topeople and commercial links which have burgeoned in recent years. We welcome the increasingly strong voice of African nation states and we look forward to playing our part in the peace and security of the continent of Africa, including-and in particular-the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Electrical Trades Union",95
131,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. I refer the Acting Prime Minister to media reports that Dean Mighell, the Secretary of the Electrical Trades Union, spent $80,000 from his own workers' redundancy fund, Protect, on an extraordinary trip to London that included business class flights, meals, drinks, valet service, internet, in-house movies, booze and other items including a phone call to a sexual escort by the name of Suzana. Is this an appropriate use of workers' redundancy funds? Is the Acting Prime Minister aware that the member for Deakin is a former organiser for the redundancy fund? Can the Acting Prime Minister assure the House that the member for Deakin was not involved in the distribution of almost $1.4 million of the funds that were used to buy a house for Kevin Harkins, the union's state secretary and former candidate for the Labor Party at the last election?",97
132,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The first part of the question was in order but the part referring to the member for Deakin and the rest of the question were well out of order. The last part was really something that could only be introduced by way of substantive motion. Ms Roxon interjecting,97
133,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The Minister for Health and Ageing is not helping at all. I have suggested that the first part of the questhink tion is in order. I just simply say ber for North Sydney-as he mumbles a new precedent-that I got myself into strife when I prevented on three occasions out of about eight the Prime Minister from taking questions when they referred to the conduct of a member. That deals with the second part of the question. He knows that the third part of the question is well and truly out of the order because it is bordering on something that should be done by substantive motion. Mr Albanese- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I seek your guidance. We have just witnessed the member for North Sydney cast a slur on a range of members on the alleged basis of asking a question in question time. Can you indicate",97
134,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Opposition members interjecting Mr Albanese-It wasn't a question. Can you indicate whether it is in order for, in the guise of asking a question, members of this trans- House to be defamed? You allowed the member for North Sydney to continue with that question even though it was clearly out of order.",97
135,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! I simply say to the Leader of the House that (1) I have ruled two aspects of the question out of order and (2) I could not have ruled them out of order until I had listened to the question. If he thinks that I am happy about that situation, I can indicate that I am not. But I cannot preempt what is going to happen and whether or not I think it is appropriate is not the chair's business. I have dealt with the two aspects of the question that I believed were out of order. Mr Stephen Smith-The remarks that the member for North Sydney made in that part of his question which was out of order were clearly offensive and should be withdrawn.",97
136,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I think the real problem was that they were couched by way of a question rather than being definitive. I that the ruling out indicates that they to the memare not part of the record.,97
137,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can I say to the question from the member for North Sydney, firstly, as I have seen in media reports, as I have been advised, ASIC is investigating the matter he refers to. If there are any allegations of improper conduct in any way then obviously that is something that ought to be properly investigated and dealt with. I will repeat what I said to this parliament yesterday in a different context: everyone should abide by the law; there are no exceptions. Everyone should abide by the law. Having said that, when everyone should abide by the law, the way the system works in this country-perhaps the member for North Sydney might prefer it were different-being a democracy, is that if there is an assertion that someone has not abided by the law, that is not tried in this parliament; that is dealt with by the appropriate investigative authorities, who should then deal with it. So everyone should abide by the law and everyone should let due process go through in relation to the allegations, and as I am advised ASIC is dealing with the matter. More broadly, can I say this: if the member for North Sydney believes he is in possession of information that goes to proper conduct of any member of this parliament then he should immediately move the relevant substantive motion. If he does not do so, people will understand what kind of person he is. Whaling",97
138,Ms GEORGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts. Will the minister update the House on the government's actions to bring an end to commercial whaling, including so called scientific whaling?",98
139,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Throsby for her question and her interest in this issue. The Rudd government remain resolutely opposed to commercial whaling in any form, including so-called scientific whaling, and our commitment to whale conservation remains clear in the number of unprecedented actions the government has taken since coming to office. We have advanced a significant reform agenda through the International Whaling Commission, with initiatives for international non-lethal whale research partnerships, starting in the Southern Ocean, and conservation management plans to support the recovery of vulnerable whale species and populations. Many countries, including New Zealand, Chile, the United Kingdom and the United States, strongly supported Australia's proposals and we are now working towards putting these plans into action. I am pleased to inform the House that Australia will host an international workshop in March 2009 to plan the non-lethal whale research partnerships for the Southern Ocean. The partnerships will also be open to all countries and will demonstrate once again that all essential whale research can be performed without killing a single whale. We remain optimistic that through this reform agenda we can help shape the International Whaling Commission into a 21st century, conservation orientated organisation, a body focused on studying living whales, not counting dead ones. Mr Haase interjecting Mr Irons interjecting",98
140,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Kalgoorlie and the member for Swan!,98
141,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The government is also giving serious and careful consideration to a range of options for possible international legal action against Japan's Antarctic whaling programMr Haase-What about jobs for the people of the Kimberley?,98
142,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Kalgoorlie is warned!,98
143,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"and we have carefully analysed the information obtained through our monitoring of the Antarctic whaling fleet last summer. This was the first time that monitoring had been undertaken of the whaling fleet. No previous government has had the kind of information available to inform its consideration of legal options that we now have. Our immediate efforts are on finding a diplomatic resolution to this issue and that is why we have increased our diplomatic engagement on whaling, particularly with Japan over its scientific whaling program. We have appointed Mr Sandy Hollway AO as Australia's special envoy for whale conservation to advance the government's objectives of ending Japanese scientific whaling and improving the conservation of whales. We have repeatedly called on Japanthrough the Prime Minister, the foreign minister, through me and through the envoy-to suspend its whaling program in the Southern Ocean, particularly as we engage in reform of the International Whaling Commission. We make no pretence that this is an easy task. In fact, this is a complex issue, an between friends but one we know the Australian community feels very strongly about, and that is why we have been working so hard and why we will keep working to bring commercial whaling to an end. I note a report overnight from the Asahi newspaper in Japan that the Japanese government's whaling programMr Haase interjecting",98

145,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Members opposite clearly had no interest in this answer, because they did nothing for 12 years on this issue.",99
146,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister will continue to respond to the question.,99
147,Mr GARRETT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will begin again, Mr Speaker. I note a report overnight from the Asahi newspaper in Japan that the Japanese government's whaling program will make its first-ever whaling target reduction-a reduction of 20 per cent in the upcoming season, to 750 whales-while the program's overall target will be reduced by approximately 10 per cent. Whilst this is at present an unconfirmed report, if accurate it would represent the first time since Japan's scientific whaling commenced in 1987 that the actual target has been reduced. In fact, since 1987 the target has only increased, including more than doubling between 2004-05 and 2005-06. I also emphasise that, while any reduction would be welcome-it would be an encouraging sign-given that it has not happened before, the government's objective remains bringing an end to all commercial whaling, including whaling in the name of science. That is the objective we will continue to pursue, intensifying and stepping up our efforts issue including through the Prime Minister and senior ministers, through the special envoy on whale conservation, through our reform agenda at the International Whaling Commission and through the active consideration of options for international legal action. Hospitals",99
148,Mr DUTTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Acting Prime Minister. Acting Prime Minister, does the government stand by the Prime Minister's pledge to the Australian people that he will fix the public hospital system by 2009 or he will have a referendum to take over the public hospitals from the states? Mr Adams-It's your fault!",99
149,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Lyons is simply not assisting.,99
150,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question. This government has inherited from the former government a public hospital system that has had a billion dollars ripped out of it. It cut back GP training places and other workforce places, leaving us with a crisis in workforce in many parts of the country. It is not a track record to be proud of. What the government has done since it took office is to work with our state and territory counterparts on new Australian healthcare agreements. What the government has said consistently is that it will work with our state and territory colleagues to get new cooperative arrangements to deal with the problems in the health system. What the Prime Minister said before the election, as opposed to what the member for Dickson just summarised him as saying, was that we would work with our state and territory counterparts and seek a new era of reform. My colleague the Minister for Health and Ageing is well into the journey of the reform agenda. We have already put more money into hospitals. She has a reform commission working with her. The Prime Minister always said that we would aim to work through these issues cooperatively, and that is what we are doing. What he said to the Australian people as well was that, if these processes did not work to a satisfactory outcome, the buck would stop with him. We are doing exactly what the Prime Minister promised before the election: working collaboratively through the processes. Mr Laming interjecting",99

155,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In responding to the question, I say this to the member who asked the question and to members opposite: the last thing that I would have thought that members of the Liberal Party would want to do is to start a debate about honouring election promises, given that they are the political party that gave to this nation the terminology ‘core' and ‘non-core'. From the very first day they were elected, they wanted to dump their election promises, and they did. I remind members opposite that, when it comes to the question of promises, they promised Australians before the 2004 election that it would be business as usual in workplace relations. Mr Dutton- Mr Speaker, I again rise on a point of order in relation to relevance. There has been a defiance of your earlier ruling by the Acting Prime Minister. It is about the referendum. Does she stand by it or not?",100
156,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Dickson will resume his seat.,100
157,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What I can say to the member for DicksonMr Dutton-Just answer the question.,100
158,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have answered the question. His screaming is not going to change that. We are a government that honours its promises. We will do that in health. We will do that in all areas in which we made promises to the Australian people. That is a sharp contrast to the non-core promises of the Liberal Party and its failure to tell the Australian people about Work Choices before 2004. Indigenous Aged Care,100
159,Mr HALE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Minister for Ageing. What is the government's response to community concerns about the need to improve Indigenous aged care?,100
160,Mrs ELLIOT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Solomon for his question and note his very strong interest in and commitment to Indigenous aged care. Our plan to improve Indigenous aged care involves construction of new infrastructure, emergency maintenance works and staff training. Last week, our newly established Indigenous aged care task force completed a site-by-site audit of Australia's 29 Indigenous flexible aged care services. As a direct result of this, early next year teams of tradespeople will undertake a comprehensive building works program to carry out necessary improvements. In the last few months, I have visited a number of communities, including in Katherine, Mutitjulu and East Arnhem. I have listened first hand to the concerns of community leaders and also seen the very unique challenges of remote Aboriginal aged care services. It is very clear that these services to be improved. Staff training and infrastructure are our priorities in these areas. We are committed to tackling these challenges through our $46 million program. At Uluru, the older women of Mutitjulu, speaking in Pitjantjatjara through an interpreter, put the case to me for an overnight nursing home facility. In response, we have acted, and we will build overnight staff accommodation so that staff can be there to look after residents. We will continue to consult with and take the advice of Aboriginal communities as we work through the Indigenous aged care plan. In the coming weeks, subject to appropriate community consultation, we will also be providing more aged care places in Mutitjulu and East Arnhem. In addition, we will tackle the problem of overnight staff accommodation at Docker River. This will help retain staff in that area. Also, 11 Aboriginal aged care services will now receive assistance to help them install appropriate protection for elders around open fire pits. This is about finding a delicate balance between cultural sensitivity and ensuring the health and welfare of older and frail Indigenous people. This Indigenous aged care plan addresses long-term staff training and retention. I look forward to further updating the House on how this government is continuing to improve Indigenous aged care. Hospitals",101
161,Mr TRUSS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is also to the Acting Prime Minister. I refer the Acting Prime Minister to the Prime Minister's commitment that the buck will stop with him when it comes to public hospitals. Given that nurses from the Dubbo hospital are borrowing bandages and urinary dipsticks from the local vet and meat has been taken from the menu at Coonabarabran hospital because they cannot afford to pay the butchers, what will the government do to need help these hospitals meet their share of the $205 million that the New South Wales government has cut from the area health service as a part of its mini-budget?",101
162,Ms GILLARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"What I can say to the member is that the government did make promises about health before the election. We are honouring them. I have explained that we are working collaboratively on new Australian healthcare agreements, that we are working on reform, that the Prime Minister did say we would work through those processes first and that ultimately the buck did stop with him but that we would be working to improve health care. What has this government done? We put $1 billion into our healthcare system. We put money into elective surgery waiting lists to make sure that people who were on queues for elective surgery would get assisted. All of that is additional resources above and beyond what the former government, the Liberal government-of which the member who asked me the question was a very senior member-provided. Above and beyond what the Liberal government put in, we have put in extra resources. I understand that the member is saying that there is more to be done in health, and I could not agree with him more. There is more to be done in health. We are working on new Australian healthcare agreements because we understand there is more to be done in health. But I would ask the member to reflect: given we have put in additional resources since the 2007 election, how bad was it when you were in government? Infrastructure",101
163,Mr HAYES,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government. Will the minister inform the House of how the government is reforming infrastructure investment decision making? Is he aware of any examples of poor infrastructure investment decision making in the past?",102
164,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for Werriwa for that question. As members would be aware, the government today introduced our legislation to establish the three infrastructure funds. This marks the beginning, the next step, in implementing the nation's nation-building agenda. This is an agenda that we remain committed to, and that is one of the reasons why the Prime Minister has asked for the infrastructure priority list to be brought forward to December. Of course, this priority list is being developed by Infrastructure Australia, an independent body, made up of Commonwealth, state and local representatives but also, importantly, representatives of the tor, which we established to examine the nation's infrastructure needs. This is an entirely new approach when it comes to dealing with infrastructure for the nation. I know that some of those opposite are struggling to adjust to this new concept, because their criticism of our approach has been very confused. On the one hand we have had the Leader of the Opposition and others out there accusing us of establishing a slush fund, but in the next breath they say that we are not spending infrastructure funds soon enough-we should just get on with the job and not have a proper process. You cannot have it both ways. You have got to actually stand for something. But I wondered why they were so obsessed, and maybe it is because of the way that they dealt with, or did not deal with, infrastructure issues. An example of their approach was recently brought to my attention, which is why I particularly welcome the second part of the member for Werriwa's question. In 2006, the former government called for submissions from councils on strategic road priorities. Five councils in Victoria formed the Northern Metro Regional Group of Councils and commissioned a review of their road needs. They produced this detailed report. It thoroughly analysed and it prioritised eight road projects. They sent it off to the federal government and waited to hear the outcome. Nothing happened. Days passed; weeks passed; months passed-nothing happened. But a year later the councils got a letter with an offer to fund one of their projects. But, of course, it was not the No. 1 priority, it was not even the second priority and not even the third. It, in fact, was the project that was ranked sixth. It is a project that one of the councils that has written to me has said is: … heavily dependent on sub-divisional development. With next to no development, at this stage the construction is out of sequence and may be private secseen as a poor use of funds. What the council is saying is pretty simple: this is a road to nowhere. It is actually a road through an empty paddock-a road that might be needed sometime but that is certainly not needed now and is certainly not a priority, which is why the councils put it as No. 6 on their list. The No. 1 project was only a kilometre or two away, in the middle of a booming residential area. So I was wondering: what wisdom did the former government use to overrule the priority list that had been developed by these local councils and pick out the project at No. 6 over the top of the first five projects? I was looking at a map of the area, trying to understand their thinking. When it came to me, I realised I had the wrong map, because I was looking at a road map. What I needed was an electoral map to understand the way that they decided infrastructure spending should be provided. As you may be aware, Mr Speaker, the No. 1 priority project, which could not be funded, was in fact in the electorate of Scullin-your electorate, Mr Speaker. The No. 2 project was in Calwell, so they could not fund that either. The No. 3 project was in Jagajaga, so they could not fund that either. Of the eight projects, only one was in a marginal Liberal electorate-that of MCEwen. It did not have the lowest cost, it did not have the highest benefit, it is not even needed now, but it was on the right side of the electoral map. That was why it received the funding. On this side of the House when we want advice on infrastructure we actually consult Infrastructure Australia, an independent body. When those on the other side want advice about infrastructure they do not look to engineers, they look to the electoral commissioner. Ms Gillard- Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA",102

The Leader of the House went on to cite a large number of examples. The explanation from me,103
175,The SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Order! The member must indicate where he has been misrepresented. Mr Tanner- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order.

196,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,My risk taking is probably spent.,105
197,Mr NEVILLE,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,I assure you it has nothing to do with frogs. This morning there was an incident involving a four-minute count for a division. There was quite a deal of disagreement in the House about whether the four minutes was actually taken or not. I think the general consensus is that it was four minutes. Could I suggest to you that the tape be run to find out what length of time was actually used so that this sort of mistake does not happen again?,105
198,The SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER,"I repeat something that I am trying to get through to people. Firstly, this is not a time for raising questions about procedural matters with me. Standing orders allow me to be questioned about matters under my administration to do with the Department of the House of Representatives and the Department of Parliamentary Services, which I administer with the Senate President. Secondly, I am not going back over the tapes. But, despite those two comments, I have every faith in the member of the Speaker's panel who was in charge of the proceedings. As I understand it, a very factory resolution to the matter was reached. I think that we should leave those types of matters there because sometimes, I think, we go round in circles about procedural matters here and it must remain a complete mystery to those outside who are watching us. NA Hospitals",105
199,The SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Dickson proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The failure of the government to deliver an effective public hospital system. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",105
200,Mr DUTTON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The coalition, like all Australians, is greatly connot cerned about what is happening in our public hospital systems right around the country. For the last 10 or 12 years-and, in some cases, since even longer ago-Australians have been subjected to a complete mismanagement and downgrading of services right around the country. There are very few exceptions as you look state by state and territory by territory for good practice operating in our public hospitals as they have been managed by the Labor Party. The greatest frustration for the health professionals around the country-the nurses, the doctors and all of those people, particularly in primary health care, who are involved in public hospitals-is the way in which the public hospitals have been managed over the last decade and, as I say, in satissome cases even longer. They are worried because they have a service to deliver to people who are in need. Australians arrive at accident and emergency sections and at public hospitals looking for service. They have a demand for the services-in some cases, of course, in emergency situations-and it is the great and never-ending frustration of those people who deliver these services that, because of the way in which these services have been managed, they cannot provide an adequate and timely response to those patients who are most in need. It is about time, as we approach the 12-month mark, to call to account this federal government for some of the promises they made during the last election campaign and for the way in which, over the course of the last 12 months, they have not delivered on those promises or provided any idea of how they are going to turn around this mess that their state Labor colleagues have managed to create in a dozen years. This is a situation which is untenable. The remarkable admission today in this chamber by the Acting Prime Minister of this country that the Labor Party would not honour its election promise to go to a referendum if the states and the federal government do not resolve this matter in relation to state public hospitals is a disgrace. It is a disgrace because this Prime Minister said to the Australian people during the course of the last election campaign that on health the buck would stop with him. Over the course of the last 12 months, as was raised by the leader of the National Party today, in hospitals such as in Dubbo and others around the country spending has been going backwards, which is resulting in worse outcomes for patients in hospitals right around the country, and that is unacceptable. When Australians listened to this Prime Minister at the last election, they heard him say that he would fix health and that, if he did not fix it with the states by 2009, he would go to a referendum. The government has watered down its commitment during question time today, and the Australian people should recognise that for what it is: a pathetic action by a government which is on the ropes in terms of delivering outcomes to the Australian people. People who listen to this chamber regularly know that whenever somebody from the government comes into this chamber-it does not matter whether they are delivering a speech on health, the economy or social security-the word that they use religiously is ‘decisive'. ‘Decisive' is a word that they have to use and have been directed to use because this government, the Rudd-Swan government, is seen as being indecisive. It is a government that has set up any number of reviews and advisory councils. It has put all of this together but with no concrete outcome that is going to result in better health outcomes for the Australian people. So, when the Australian public listen to members of the Australian Labor Party and in particular this Prime Minister talk about decisive action, they should know that it is not an indication of any decisive action that the government has taken; it is merely a delivery of the advice that has been given to them by focus groups operated by the hollow men who work in the Prime Minister's office. Many people around the country would watch the acclaimed series The Hollowmen on the ABC. Some people see it as a comedy and other people see it as a documentary. Many people see it as a documentary because they see in the day-today actions of this government exactly what happens on The Hollowmen being played out by the Rudd Labor government. This is a government which is not serious about delivering for the public; it is serious about delivering for itself. It is not interested in honouring its election commitments. What it has done over the last 12 months is facilitate further downgrading of services by state governments in the public hospital arena. It has come up with this mantra, no doubt devised by the focus groups in The Hollowmen, that it needs to end the blame game. ‘Prime Minister,' the focus groups would have said, ‘use that phrase, because the Australian people want to hear you say it.' So he says it, but what does it mean and what has it meant over the last 12 months? It has meant that this is a Prime Minister who has used that term to disguise the inaction and, I think, the complete failure of state Labor governments around the country in their obligations in public health. This federal government has made a number of health decisions in the last 12 months which really are all about the way in which health has been delivered in the states over the last 12 years. This Rudd Labor government is replicating the hospital management style that Nathan Rees has perfected in New South Wales, that Anna Bligh has perfected in Queensland and that many other state leaders have perfected around the country. If we continue to see this health minister and this Prime Minister managing the federal health system like their state Labor counterparts over the last 12 years then heaven help the long-term future of health in this country. This debate today has been prompted by the enormous number of emails and phone calls that I have received from people in distress all around the country-people who have had terrible experiences in public hospitals and people whose lives have been devastated by the way in which public hospitals are run and the way in which that is condoned by this federal government. They are devastated by the treatment that they receive and the lack of timely treatment. That, of course, is highlighted in the AMA Public Hospital Report Card 2008, which was released yesterday. It is a damning report, to say the least. It reports that the tal funding split between the Commonwealth and the states and territories requires more attention. It talks about public hospital capacity having fallen by 67 per cent in the last 20 years. The AMA calculates that 3,750 beds are required to decrease occupancy levels to 85 per cent. Eighty-five per cent occupancy is important because it is considered the safe working level. The royal hospitals in Adelaide, Brisbane, Canberra and Perth and Sydney's North Shore and Prince Alfred royal hospitals are closer to 90 per cent occupancy, and some are closer to 95 per cent occupancy. This position is something that is condoned day in, day out by this Rudd Labor government. It has to come to an end. The report says: Despite minor recent improvement, less than two-thirds of emergency department patients classified as urgent are currently seen within the recommended 30 minutes. The majority of these issues are, of course, state and territory issues, but this is a situation which has festered and deteriorated over the last 12 months under the watch of this Rudd Labor government. The Labor Party, not just in health but in a number of areas, have embarked on a rewrite of history, a propaganda campaign talking down the economy that they inherited from the coalition government at the end of last year. They have tried to rewrite history in relation to the way in which we managed the economy as well as health. Let me put on the record a few statistics which I think demonstrate the proud record of the Howard government in relation to health. The total investment in health and ageing in 1995-96 under Labor was just under $20 billion, at $19.5 billion. In 2007-08 the coalition committed $51.8 billion to health funding, a real increase of 88 per cent. That is a remarkable statistic. Labor spent $6 billion under the hospiMBS in 1995-96-bear that in mind. Under the coalition $12.5 billion was spent in 200708, an increase in real terms of 48 per cent. Do not listen to anything that the Labor government have got to say in relation to health. Their track record proves that they are as fraudulent on health as they are on the economy. It is about time that the states and territories started to own up to their responsibilities and that this health minister stopped whimpering in a corner with the Prime Minister instead of calling to account what has been a disgraceful display by state and territory governments. The reality is that the coalition government in relation to Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme funding in 2007-08 spent $7.1 billion, a real increase of 110 per cent, compared to 2.4 per cent when Labor were last in power. We are not going to stand on this side of the parliament and tolerate some rewrite of history by the Labor government. We are not going to tolerate some sort of propaganda campaign which holds them up as having had a great period in office prior to 1996 and which says that it was the coalition government that failed in its responsibility in relation to health over the 11 years that we were in government. The fact remains that we excelled and provided very good outcomes in the areas we had responsibility for during the period of 1996 to 2007-not to say that we had it perfect or that more could not be done. What we did was to embark on a way in which we could hold the state and territory governments to account, because they have run the public hospital system into the ground, and it will take years to rectify. If this health ter and the government are going to continue the form of the last 12 months-that is, to be completely uncritical of the state and territory governments-then this situation will only continue to deteriorate and will take even longer to rectify. The government should be condemned for their inaction to date, and they should be condemned for managing the hospital system in exactly the same way as Nathan Rees. When people think about federal Labor in health, they should think about state Labor in health. When people think about the Prime Minister and Nicola Roxon in health, they should think about Nathan Rees and Reba Meagher. Ms Roxon-That's getting a bit low!",105
201,Mr DUTTON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"A state Labor management style has been imposed on us. The health minister indicates that that is a bit low; we need to see how low the health standards drop under this federal government before we can definitively say whether the health minister is accurate or not. We know that health has been disastrous under the Labor governments in New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria, the Northern Territory, the ACT and South Australia. Right around the country, Labor has run the health system into the ground, and this federal government is on the same path as well. The first Reba Meagher-style announcement of this health minister was in relation to private health. Reba Roxon said that 500,000 people should be forced out of private health and into the public hospital system. The health minister claims that forcing 500,000 people out of private health and pushing them into the public health system, a system which Labor have already crippled, is somehow going to deliver better health outcomes for the Australian people. We cannot stand by-the Australian people cannot stand byand tolerate a further deterioration of this health system, which is what will happen if ministhe federal government continues down this track. When you look at the figures you will see they are quite amazing. For the change that the government proposed to the Medicare levy surcharge, their first figures indicated that 485,000 people would drop their private health insurance. This withstood scrutiny for about 24 hours. The government finally realised and admitted to their mistake that 485,000 did not include children or dependants, and the figures shot up to 644,000. Don't people with children and dependants get services in the public system in this country? Is that where Labor thinks we should be? It is such a ridiculous position to be in, and an embarrassing one for the Minister for Health and Ageing. This ended up with the government's compromise to 500,000 people-including, I might say to their credit, dependants and children-who will now be forced off private health and pushed into the public health system as a result of Labor style management of health. Public health deserves much greater support than it is getting from the government, and this coalition opposition will not stand by while we have some sort of rewrite of history. We will make sure that we continue to call this government to account. They should stand condemned for the way in which the Acting Prime Minister walked away from their election commitment today. As a coalition, we will make sure that we keep the pressure on the states and territories and this government to make sure that the public health system in this country turns around, because we are committed not just to a public health system but also to a private one. We are the only side of this parliament capable of delivering positive health outcomes. The figures from when we were in government demonstrate that, and we will show it when we are returned at the next election.",108
202,Ms ROXON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That was a disappointing display from the shadow minister, the member for Dickson. I was looking forward to 15 minutes from the shadow minister, who has not really said very much about health and who does not even care enough to stay and hear his own matter of public importance answered. The media is more important to him-'Oh, I am sorry, Minister, I have to do a doorstop on the matter that I am raising in the House.' I actually think that is quite astounding. Has a shadow minister ever raised a matter of public importance in the House before and then left before it was debated? It just shows that the shadow minister is not interested in our public hospitals. He knows that this is one of the cheekiest matters of public importance to ever be raised in this House. After 12 years of being in government and doing nothing about public hospitals-after 12 years of neglect-he wants to pretend that we should be able to fix every single thing in the health system within 11 months. We agree that there are problems in our health system. We agree that a lot of them were caused by the previous government. Interestingly, I agree with the shadow minister on that, because the shadow minister is now on the record as saying that mistakes were made in dealing with public health in their 12 years in government. But he believes, despite having spent 12 years making all of those mistakes, that we should miraculously be able to fix them in 11 months. We are very proud of what we have done in 11 months, and I am going to take the chamber through all of the extra investments that we have made. What I suspect in this matter of public importance is that it is just the same old, same old from the Liberals. They used to blame the states; now they want to blame the government. They are always blaming someone else. It is the same old story. In fact, it is ‘Dutton' dressed up as lamb. I reckon that is what the shadow minister is doing-it is just the same old measures that he has always been arguing. We saw that there were problems in the health system. We went to the election with specific commitments as to how we would fix the health system. We are very proud of what we have already done. We have put a billion extra dollars into our public hospitals already, and they needed it. We have met and been negotiating with the states and territories and we are very close to finalising our deals. Contrary to what the shadow minister always wants to say, we are not apologists for the states. Some of them have got things wrong, but what the shadow minister does not want to acknowledge is that the coalition did nothing in government to try to improve the standards of our public hospitals. They did nothing in the negotiations with the states to improve the arrangements. They used to say to the states, minutes to the sign-off line for the healthcare agreements, ‘Here is our deal, take it or leave it.' That was their tiations. We actually believe we can deliver better outcomes if both levels of government work together. We hope we will be able to deliver that. We will not be handing over a single dollar to the states and territories without a guarantee about the improved performance that that will deliver. We have already been able to achieve that in elective surgery. We made a commitment that we would put $600 million into elective surgery and, at the halfway mark, we have already seen more than 14,000 surgeries undertaken. I wonder whether members on this side of the House know how many more elective surgeries that is in just the first six months of this program, compared to those funded by those opposite for a whole 12 years in government? Mr Shorten-Tell us, tell us!",109
203,Ms ROXON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is 14,000 more. There was not a single elective surgery procedure paid for by the previous government to try to deal with the waiting lists that they were so worried about. I want to take note-while the shadow minister has deigned to stay here for a little longer-of a report from the AMA yesterday that he wanted to quote so enthusiastically. They release a report card each year on the state of our public hospitals. They did that yesterday, and they rightly pointed out some serious problems that remain with our hospitals which make us so determined to fix them. What the shadow minister failed to say was that most of the fairly scathing assessments from the AMA actually were the same as the ones that were made last year. The reason they were the same as the ones made last year is that over nearly 12 years of Liberal government we have seen a decline in standards in our public hospitals. We cannot pretend that the previous government had nothing to do with it. Even the shadow minister, in his more sanguine moments, is prenegopared to admit-for example, in front of 300 or 400 GPs at a conference in Darwin last week-that mistakes were made by his government. But he comes into this House and wants to put on the macho man act, pretend that everything they did was fantastic and that they fixed the whole system. I do not know why he did not quote one of the significant changes in the issue of access and equity from the AMA report. In 2007, on the previous government's watch, the AMA said There has been a distinct deterioration in the proportion of Australians being admitted for elective surgery within medically recommended times. We find in 2008, in an area where we have made immediate injections of funds, that the report from the AMA says that there has been some improvement in the proportion of Australians being admitted for elective surgery within medically recommended times. That is no small feat. We have not been in government for a long time. We have acted fast. We have started turning things around. But it is not quoted by the shadow minister. I wonder why that would be. Mr Shorten-Selective.",110
204,Ms ROXON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"They are very selective about the process that they are taking. I think this matter of public importance, arguing about ‘the failure of the government to deliver an effective public hospital system', should really be a question: ‘Why can this government in 11 months not fix all of the problems that we caused in 12 years?' That would be a more honest debate for the shadow minister to have, but he is not interested in doing that. I think it is also disappointing that the shadow minister has not been prepared to look at our investment in GP services. Part of fixing our hospitals is investing more in our hospitals, but a big part of it is making sure we get services that can be delivered outside hospitals into our communities so that people do not need to go to hospital. This is a particular problem for the member opposite. A GP superclinic has been promised in his electorate. He has been unable to decide whether or not he supports a superclinic in his electorate. Mr Raguse-I'll have another one! Ms Rishworth-I'll have another one!",110
205,Ms ROXON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I thought there might be some people who were prepared to have one. He will not go on the record about it. He wants to criticise us for all of the most outraof geous things. He wants to make outrageous comparisons between us and the state government, and then he expects that we are going to keep the gloves on in dealing with him. He is going to have to decide what he wants to do in his local electorate. I know the member for Cowan, who is here listening to this debate, has one that is going to be delivered in his electorate, and he has been an enthusiastic supporter-sensibly. It is not every day that the federal government wants to put millions of dollars into your electorate, and you would be pretty silly not to want it. We are going to make sure that it works properly. I am interested that the member for-Gwydir? Mr Coulton-Parkes.",111
206,Ms ROXON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Parkes is here, because I understand that he and a couple of his colleagues are very enthusiastic for us to have GP superclinics in their electorates. What I suggest is that you lobby your shadow minister either to get to a position where the Liberal Party will support this investment or to suggest that the money that we have promised to his electorate could be put into yours. If the shadow minister wants us to do that, we are more than happy to do it. But the thing that has been really outrageous and, frankly, pretty disappointing about the shadow minister's MPI is that in less than five minutes he had run out of anything to say about health. In less than five minutes he was already on to his theories about spin doctoring and his theories about other things. We have not heard anything yet from this shadow minister about what he would do to fix the health system. We have not heard anything from any of the Liberal Party about a single policy in health. They do not know whether they are going to support ours. They are not prepared to own up properly to the legacy that they have left us with. Again, we made an announcement last week 175 new GPs across the country, and nine of them are likely to be in the training area that covers the shadow minister's electorate. He is not even sure whether he welcomes that or not. He is not prepared to be honest about the fact that the member for Warringah and the member for Bradfield-the previous Leader of the Opposition-admitted that they made mistakes in capping the number of those places in GP training, but he is not even sure whether he welcomes those places. It is very interesting to me that, in addition to the people on this side of the House who are very interested in hospitals, we have a number of members whom I have been engaging with directly-I even met with the member for Riverina earlier today-who do have serious problems in their hospitals. I do not deny that there is a lot of work that we have to do to fix this. There are problems in the local member's community with GPs being trained overseas. We are working to fix those problems, but we cannot do it all at once. We have to take it step by step. We are proud of putting $1 billion into our hospitals, putting $600 million into elective surgery, creating more GP training places, getting extra nurses trained and setting up a vast range of other supports for rural services in particular, but we are going to get further changes right and we are not ashamed about taking the time to get proper advice, to do it clearly, and we are not ashamed about negotiating with the states and territories to demand more from them if we invest more through the healthcare agreements. We have been absolutely upfront that we want transparency, that we want strong reporting and that we want improved health outcomes, and the commitment that we made at the election was that, if we cannot get the states and tories to sign on to those changes, we would go back to the public asking for their approval to take over financial control of the hospitals. The deadline we set for that is the middle of next year. For some reason, the shadow minister is too busy to even hear the answers. He has gone off to do some media interview because that is more important than his own matter of public importance. He does not want to hear that we are working exactly as we promised and we are following those standards. I think it is disappointing. I think we have some serious issues in health that we have to confront. We have some big changes that we are going to have to be prepared to make. We have big investments that are going to be very difficult in these financial circumstances but are necessary for the community. But we have a shadow minister who is not even prepared to stay and listen to his colleagues who are going to debate the matter of public importance. He is not even prepared to stay and hear what else is going on. Those opposite always want to use the worse examples from our state colleaguesand sadly, on occasion, they give us examples that those opposite can use-but I would like to take the chance to give some good examples. As a result of the elective surgery money that the Commonwealth provided to each state and territory, Victoria committed to undertaking 9,400 elective surgery operations this year. Victoria reported in their parliament today that already, two months ahead of time, because of that extra assistance that the Commonwealth has provided, 9,918 extra elective surgery operations have been performed. That Commonwealth money has meant that nearly 10,000-in fact, 500 more than were promised-elective surgery procedures have been undertaken. That means that in my electorate, in the electorate of the member for Maribyrnong and in the electorterriate of the member for Deakin-in all of the Victorian electorates-more people have had their hip surgery done, their knee surgery done or their cataract surgery done because we put the money on the table. Why is it that the shadow minister does not want to use those examples? Why doesn'the want to come in and say, ‘When the states are performing well, we should give them more to give them some reward payment'? Why doesn'the want to engage in that sort of constructive debate? He just wants to complain about the states and use every bad example instead of, when we invest money and the states can deliver better services, being prepared to come in here and stand up and say that they are doing well. He is too busy out there doing his media, and he is the one who had the gall to suggest that our government is being run like The Hollowmen. This is someone who thinks this matter is so important that the parliament should allocate an hour to debate it but he is only prepared to stay to hear himself talk. I thought the Leader of the Opposition had a good opinion of himself, but that attitude obviously flows through to all of his shadow ministers. The shadow minister only wants to listen to himself speak, not to get any real answers from anybody else. And I am getting a little bit sick of some of the pious displays from the shadow minister. He welcomed the initiatives and the comments I made today about the insulin pumps and Diabetes Day, which are very important-I notice there are still members from Diabetes Australia hereand that is good because it is something that very many members, particularly backbenchers, have been actively engaged in for a long time. But you cannot do that and pretend to work together and then stand up and put on this appalling display and not be prepared to listen to what it is we are doing. I challenge the shadow minister: if he thinks that the Commonwealth has not done enough, does he want us to take back the billion dollars that we have already given to public hospitals? Does the shadow minister want us to take back the money we have paid for all of those extra surgeries? Does he want us to stop funding an extra 170 GPs in the next two years? Does he want us to not go ahead with the more than 1,000 nursing places that are going to start as of next year-90 already this year, 1,094 next year? We already know he does not want us to proceed with our binge drinking strategy, so I am not even going to ask that hypothetically because he has been disinterested in these changes. I am presuming he does not want to stop us screening people for bowel cancer, a big investment that we made in the budget. Why do none of these major investments in health get a mention from the shadow minister? It is just the same old same old Dutton dressed up as lamb! (Time expired)",111
207,Mr COULTON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have no problem today standing up and debating this matter of public importance, because I can tell you that in my part of Australia the issue of health supersedes any other. is the issue that my office deals with on a daily basis. I acknowledge that the health minister is aware of what is happening in my electorate, and I acknowledge that I have had some meetings with her. But make no mistake about it, this debate today is about trust-the trust created last year when the Prime Minister, then the Leader of the Opposition, said, ‘When it comes to health, the buck stops with me.' All across Australia people voted for the Labor government because the then opposition leader promised that he was going to fix health. Thankfully not too many people in my electorate followed that line, but right across Australia many people did. The situation since that time has deteriorated rapidly. In my electorate, the Dubbo Base Hospital is $16 million in debt. The Greater Western Area Health Service is in a state of terminal collapse. Base hospitals at Orange and Bathurst and countless small bush hospitals are in dire straits. My colleague, the Leader of the Nationals, the member for Wide Bay, in question time today mentioned the fact that the staff of Dubbo Base Hospital are purchasing supplies from the vet and the local chemist shop. Indeed, a surgeon at Dubbo hospital, when needing a particular piece of equipment to undertake an operation and finding out that credit had been cut off from the supplier, cleared Greater Western Area Health Service's bill with his own credit card so that he could purchase the equipment needed to undertake that particular operation. In the hospitals in the towns of Gilgandra and Coonabarabran patients are no longer fed meat because the butcher has not been paid. In this day and age, this is a terrible state of affairs. I would like acknowledge that tomorrow is national Diabetes Day and that we still have members from Diabetes Australia up here. I am looking forward to the function at It the hotel tonight to recognise this special day. But, in contrast, this week air services are being pulled out of four towns in my electorate. One of those towns is Walgett. On Tuesday I had Ms Christine Corby, who is the CEO of the Walgett medical service, in my office quite distressed. I hear you ask: what does the withdrawal of airline services have to do with health? It is quite simple: these remote towns are serviced by fly-in practitioners-specialists, heart specialists, dentists, oncologists and specialists who deal with diabetes. The other thing that happened this week was that the diabetes map for Australia was released. Guess whose electorate has a high level of diabetes. And guess which town in my electorate is the worse. It is Walgett, which has a large Aboriginal population. When we were in this House early in the term of this government debating the merits of sitting on Fridays, the Prime Minister went to my electorate. I might say this was without my knowledge, but I guess I will come to terms with that. He visited the Walgett Aboriginal Medical Service and he spoke with these people; he recognised and understood, quite rightly, the great work they are doing. The withdrawal of the en route subsidy, which means that $6 million has been taken out of these routes, has made these services unviable, so policies of this government are affecting the health of people in western New South Wales. There has been talk about solutions. The minister mentioned the GP superclinics. There was quite a bit of mirth on the other side as people acknowledged the fact that they had this wonderful largess come their way in the form of a GP superclinic. A town in my electorate, Gunnedah, has the ultimate GP superclinic. If a GP superclinic is a stock standard Commodore, the people of Gunnedah have come up with a Statesman DeVille-the top of the range. Not only does it fit the complete criteria of the GP superclinic model to a T, it has an added bonus-that is, the training side of it. It is a partnership tween the doctors, the local community, the state government and universities. As well, local industry is putting in personal private money to fund this clinic. Unfortunately, there are no funds left. The bucket for GP superclinics is empty. And in some cases they have gone to marginal seats where they do not really want them. The local GPs are saying, ‘We're going to be overrun with doctors; we don't really want the clinic.' That is why there has been a slow take-up. The people of Gunnedah, a town of 12,000, are serviced by three doctors. Can you imagine waiting for six weeks to see your GP? How does a young woman going through a pregnancy have a relationship with her doctor when there are three doctors to service 12,000 people? Indeed, in the true tradition of people in country areas, they are trying to get this job going on their own. A group of young mums in Gunnedah are fundraising for facilities for the local maternity room because the funding is so short. So in this day and age a progressive and growing town like Gunnedah, a town with 12,000 people and a large agriculture and mining base, is now having to fundraise for equipment for the local maternity wing. They have a solution by way of the Gunnedah medical centre which, anywhere it has been shown, has got rave reviews, but unfortunately the bucket of money is gone and people are squabbling over their GP superclinics because the local doctors are saying that there is going to be overcrowding of doctors. The other case in point is in the town of Dubbo, Lourdes Hospital. Lourdes Hospital is in a state of disrepair. It is owned and run by Catholic Healthcare under an arrangement with the New South Wales government. Catholic Healthcare were prepared to put up a large amount of money, demolish the Lourdes Hospital and reconstruct a new hospital. They required a co-contribution from be the New South Wales government. I cannot understand why any government, especially a cash-strapped one like New South Wales, would look a gift horse in the mouth and not take up that offer, but it appears that Lourdes Hospital has become a victim of the minibudget last week. Lourdes Hospital is a rehabilitation hospital. It does not just service the 40,000-odd people in Dubbo; it services an area with 200,000 people. People have to travel for five or eight hours for medical services. I know some people in this place have trouble coming to terms with the fact that they have to travel those long distances. My family were quite fortunate. My son, who is now 19, was one of the last children born in the Warialda Hospital. Now the young mums have to cross their legs for 200 kilometres and their partners have to break all traffic rules to them to Tamworth on time. The ability to have children in rural Australia has been taken away. Even the base hospitals are now struggling. There have been many speeches saying that there was nothing from the previous government. I can tell you why the people supported me in the last election with regard to health. It was because of the promise to return the management of health back to the local areas. We have these huge area health services. In Baradine, which is a town that has 500 people, they have built their own doctor's surgery and they have just purchased, with their own money, a house for him to live in. But they are at the beck and call of a bureaucrat who lives in Bathurst, 600 or 700 kilometres away. What New South Wales have done with the health service is depoliticise it. mean that they have party-politicised it. I mean that the local chairman of the health board and the local mayor cannot go down and knock on the health minister's door and say, ‘We need a physiotherapist,' ‘We need a speech pathologist,' or, ‘We need an oncologist that is going to come once a month.' They cannot do that because the person who is in charge of these hospitals now is a bureaucrat. They are part of a chain. Their voice has been taken away. I have been having meetings in my office in Dubbo with nurses and doctors from the Dubbo Base Hospital. They come in almost under the cover of darkness, terrified that someone in the health service will know they have been talking to me, their federal member. The health minister has seen the faxes. (Time expired)",113
208,Mr GEORGANAS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I find it completely hypocritical that the coalition would put this discussion of the public hospital system on the agenda. From get what we heard earlier from the shadow minister, it appears that even from the bowels of opposition we are still hearing the blame game. They still have not worked out that the people did not want the blame game. In response to hearing that the Australian people cannot stand by and tolerate a declining health system, I have something for them: the people did not stand by and tolerate a declining health system-that is why we are on this side and they are on the other side. This all happened last year. So to come in here and carry on after 12 months that the system is not on track is absolute cobblewash. An opposition member-Cobblewash!",115
209,Mr GEORGANAS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Well, you look for a word that can describe what has happened here today and there is not one. After 11 years of neglect, today they have the audacI do not ity to come in and pull this on. Figures show $1 billion was slashed in 2003 from public hospitals. There was $1 billion taken out of public hospitals, and it will take a lot of time to turn that around. We saw a decade of neglect, but the government is stepping up to the mark and is determined to deliver dramatic improvements in health care. The State of our public hospitals, June 2008 report is based on figures from when the Howard government was in power. I will read some of those figures out. In 2006-07, public hospital admissions increased by around three per cent. That is more than twice the rate of the population growth. When did this happen? It was in 2006-07. Who was in government then? It was the Howard government. Again in 2006-07, there were 6.7 million presentations to emergency departments, the equivalent of a third of Australia's population. When did this happen? It was when the Howard government was in power, yet all we heard was the blame game. All we heard from the other side every time a question was raised by us when we were in opposition was, ‘Blame the states.' The number of patients presenting to emergency departments between 1998-99 and 2006-07 increased by over 34 per cent. Three in 10 emergency department patients were not seen within the recommended time. This all happened under your watch; this all happened while the Howard government was in power. All states and territories, with the exception of New South Wales, had a lower percentage of people presenting at emergency departments seen in the recommended time than in 1998-99. Indigenous Australians represent five per cent of public hospital admiswork sions, but only 2.5 per cent of the Australian population. On average, the longest waits for elective surgery procedures are for knee replacement-162 days median-and hip replacement-median 106 days. This is why we are determined as a Labor government to improve our hospitals. All these facts and figures refer to when the opposition was in government. Much work lies ahead of us. We know it is not an easy task, as the Minister for Health and Ageing said, to deliver a better health and hospital system. Much of this work has already commenced. Already, after just 11 months in government, we have a proud record. We will invest an extra $1 billion in public hospitals in the next year-the largest single-year increase in almost a decade. That is $1 billion extra into the health system; $1 billion more than the previous government had in there. We established the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission to drive large-scale reform. Reform is something that we did not hear at all about over the last 12 years. We have invested $275 million in 31 GP superclinics to help keep people well and out of hospital. We have begun a wideranging review of primary care and the Medicare schedule to create a greater focus on prevention in our health system. We are also committed to establishing a $10 billion Health and Hospitals Fund, the largest investment in medical infrastructure in Australia's history. That is an extra $10 billion that was not there when you lot were in government. We have increased the overall budget for health and ageing to $50 billion for the first time ever. These are real reforms. We have also announced a plan to bring almost 10,000 nurses into the health and aged care systems. That is 10,000 nurses on the floors in hospitals to ensure that they deliver services for people. We have also begun with the states and territories on a new Australian Health Care Agreement to end the blame game and improve our hospitals. As I said earlier, all we saw was 11 years of blaming the states for everything that went wrong instead of sitting down and negotiating with them and talking with them. All we had was blaming the states. There is much in our health system to fix after 11 years of neglect, and it does not end at hospitals. We are determined to look at health in all areas. We are committed to introducing the Commonwealth Dental Health Program. Instead of supporting the government in its reform agenda, the opposition are actually jeopardising it. Their not supporting the Commonwealth Dental Health Program in the Senate is causing pain and suffering for thousands of pensioners and other lowincome people in Australia. There is an enormous need in my electorate of Hindmarsh, which has many elderly people, for the Commonwealth Dental Health Program; they want and need a Commonwealth Dental Health Program. It is a big need not only in my electorate but in many electorates. In South Australia the average waiting time for dental care restorative services is estimated at 18 months, for dentures 39 months and for specialist dental care 33 months. All these waiting times increased under the Howard government's watch. Every time dental care was raised in this place the government at the time would wipe their hands and say, ‘It is a state issuenothing to do with us.' In South Australia the waiting time is a little shorter, down from 49 months in 2001-thank God for the Rann Labor government being elected back in 2002. They managed to reduce the waiting list. After Howard was elected in 1996, one of his very first acts was to abolish the Commonwealth Dental Health Program. The Rudd Labor government was elected on a platform that included the re-introduction of the Commonwealth Dental Health Program. However, dental care for pensioners and low-income families risks being stalled by the opposition in the Senate as they continue to not support the government's program. There are currently about 30,000 people in my state on waiting lists who would receive immediate relief if the opposition were to support that program. We have heard before in this place the horror stories of people fering with bad dental decay. The opposition can currently give these pensioners immediate relief if they choose to support our very important dental scheme in the Senate. They would be able to assist pensioners immediately by not opposing this program. By opposing this program they are only doing harm to these people and making them wait longer. The opposition's record is quite bad. The Liberals cut funding by $1 billion in an already stretched system. They practised the systematic neglect of our hospital system for 12 long years. They played the blame game for 12 long years. Despite their belated recognition that they have made mistakes, the matter of public importance debate today is a clear sign that they have not changed at all since the heady days of government. In fact, I propose that the wording of this matter of public importance today be changed to, ‘The failure of the opposition whilst in government from 1996 to 2007 to deliver an effective public hospital system.' That is what it should be. As I said, when they sat on these benches on this side they consistently refused to take any responsibility for the problems in our health system. Now it seems that they have the same approach-willing to blame everybody else but themselves for 12 years. Almost everybody knows that the blame game was the clear cause of many of the problems in our health system. We know they cut $1 million, we know they neglected reform and we know they failed to invest in prevention, knowing full well that those sick people would end up in state hospitals, and then they could just blame the states. Those failures are why the statistics you have heard in the last 48 hours happened on their watch. That is why the AMA talked about 1,500 people dying from overcrowding. But it is important to rememsufber that these figures are figures from 2003. Who was in government in 2003? The Howard government! (Time expired)",115
210,Mr SIMPKINS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"In the seconds left, I will just say this: with bad policy the government will move 500,000 people from the private system into the state hospital system. The Rudd government takes the savings in one hand and with the other hand transfers the problem to the states in increased numbers in those queues. There is no double happiness in this. This is a double unhappiness for the people of Australia. That is the great deceit that is involved in this matter. The government needs to change its mind with regard to its lack of support for and undermining of the private health system, and do the right thing for this country and agree to the choice of two systems of health. Debate interrupted. NA",118
211,The SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 4.30 pm, I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Community Safety",118
212,Mr CHESTER,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to highlight the important issue of community safety, particularly in the context of end-of-year celebrations of secondary school students, or ‘schoolies week' as it is colloquially known. I refer the House to a report in today's Herald Sun newspaper in relation to Jon Hucker, a young man who was seriously injured in an unprovoked assault two years ago during schoolies celebrations in Lorne. Mr Hucker's skull was tragically fractured, and it took 18 months of rehabilitation to teach him to walk again and to feed himself. Mr Hucker has a message to young people: one punch is all it really takes to change someone's life. Schoolies week should be a time of celebration and great enjoyment for people. It has become a rite of passage as they move from secondary school into the next chapter of their lives. Across Gippsland and across this Australia there will be young people celebrating the end of high school, filled with that hope, enthusiasm and exuberance that youth brings. I would be the last person to tell young Gippslanders that they should not go out with their friends and let off a bit of steam but, as with most things in life, a bit of moderation is needed, and I urge young people to look after their mates. It is better to walk away from a blue rather than end up in a coma or imprisoned as a result of one stray punch. For those over 18 years old, by all means enjoy a couple of drinks if that is your choice, but do it safely and in the company of people that you know and trust. I do not wish to rain on the schoolies parade in any sense at all, but there are cowardly predators out there who will prey on drunk young women and seek to pick fights with young men. For those enjoying their end of year celebrations, as a father of four young children I urge you all to act responsibly and to look after your mates. In my electorate the coastal townships in particular will play host to many young people, and some of the major centres like Traralgon will have extra celebrations for the occasion. Our local police have done an outstanding job in the past, and I am certain that this year will be no exception. But there is always someone who takes it too far, someone who cannot go out at night without causing trouble, and our police cannot be everywhere, which is why I want to raise the broader issue of community safety issues and the government's opportunity to invest in local community initiatives going forward. The city of Traralgon is the entertainment capital of the Latrobe Valley and it attracts thousands of young people every weekend. They come from right around Gippslandfrom Sale through to Morwell and Moeinto Traralgon, which is the centre of the night life for the region. The majority of pa- area. trons are well behaved and enjoy a night on the town in complete safety. But there have been many incidents of violence and street crime in recent times, such as vandalism and damage to shops and vehicles, and the local business community has obviously had enough. Businesses are working with the Latrobe City Council and local police and have formed their own community safety committee. The previous government provided this committee with seed funding of about $150,000 to trial security guards at taxi ranks on the busy Saturday nights, and the reports from that trial have been very promising. The money has been spent, however, on this and other projects and on investigating other possible initiatives which may be able to be used in the Gippsland-Latrobe area, such as lighting and the use of closed-circuit television cameras not only to help make Traralgon safer but, more importantly, to help people feel safer as they go about their entertainment on a weekend occasion. The Traralgon CBD Safety Committee is now seeking funding through both state and federal government sources to continue hiring security guards in the future to help reduce trouble in the nightclub precinct on weekend nights, but there is no funding available to them at present. I know of several other communities across Gippsland which are facing similar problems. These communities know what steps they want to take to reduce the incidence of violence and to help make residents feel safer, but they cannot access funds to go ahead and implement some of these good ideas. Like Traralgon, the Advance Morwell group was also supported by the former coalition government and received an election commitment of $250,000 to install closed-circuit television cameras in the centre of town. The Rudd government has failed to take action in this I could keep naming towns and initiatives, but the key message I have today is that the federal government needs to make funding available in the future for such programs as the former coalition government's National Community Crime Prevention Program. It will mean that communities can attend to these incidents of violence and work with liquor licensees in these towns to clean up trouble spots. I see it as a tragedy when parents fear for their children's safety while doing something as simple as enjoying night life in their own local community. Naturally, security provisions and closed-circuit televisions do not go to the core of the problem of those people acting irresponsibly, but we can improve the safety of our streets through the use of security guards, closed-circuit television and, of course, the extension of education programs to encourage young people to act responsibly at all times. Australians have a right to feel safe in their community and the federal government should support local communities as they develop their own local solutions to local problems. Homelessness",118
213,Mr DANBY,ADJOURNMENT,"I want to commend the Salvation Army on their prospective new crisis centre, which is to be erected in my electorate. It is addressing the issue of homelessness in a very thoughtful way-an issue which, since this new government and Prime Minister have been in office, we have been addressing in a much more serious way. An Australian Bureau of Statistics report released in September showed there were 105,000 Australians who were homeless on census night in 2006, up from 99,900 in 2001, with 16,000 rough sleepers in 2006, up from 14,000 five years earlier. Homelessness amongst kids under 12 has increased by 22 per cent since 2001, with 2,192 more children under 12 without a home on census night in 2006. There are more than 14,000 homeless people in metropolitan Melbourne, and that number has doubled since the 1990s. The rate of homelessness in Melbourne is almost four times that of regional Victoria. Many of these people often have severe mental health problems compounded by drug and alcohol addiction. It is numbers like these that have led the Labor government to refocus Commonwealth efforts to tackle homelessness after years of neglect by the previous government. My area, St Kilda, seems to attract many of these people because of the very thoughtful, hard work of organisations like the Sacred Heart Mission, who provide a healthy, free lunch every lunchtime for many of the people with mental health, drug or alcohol problems. They served 600 meals the day after Christmas, and they are to be commended for their work. On 7 October I attended a meeting between the Minister for Housing and the Salvation Army about a great new project in my electorate. The Salvation Army now have under construction a new purpose-built crisis accommodation centre. They currently have a smaller crisis accommodation centre that is insufficient to meet the demand that I have just described. Traditionally crisis accommodation has been dorm style, literally putting people-often with severe mental health, drug and alcohol problems-on top of each other. This new project will see each tenant living in a more dignified circumstance with their own apartment. Rather than the highdensity, multistorey accommodation blocks of the past, this new model involves lowdensity, often single-storey, family and single accommodation units. At the meeting I attended with the Minister for Housing, Ms Plibersek, whose own electorate of Sydney faces similar housing problems to my electorate, the minister was impressed by the possibilities of this new project. She indicated that she would make sure that the federal government would do what they can to help with the project. The project is a good example of how all levels of government, NGOs and business can work together to achieve important social goals. The Salvation Army has worked with the Port Phillip Council and the state government on planning issues and the state government has provided $2 million in funding. Business has provided $1.5 million in support of this project. The Salvation Army still needs $3.5 million but it is hopeful about its prospects, especially in light of the federal government's new focus on homelessness. I would like to acknowledge some of the people from the Salvation Army who have played a significant role in getting this program off the ground: Paul Bourke, the program manager, Jenny Plant, the crisis services manager; Doug Parker, the operations manager; the campaign board, known as New Life, which includes Chairman Margaret Jackson AC and patrons Dame Elisabeth Murdoch AC, DBE and Baillieu Myer AC. It was also my very great honour and pleasure at that meeting with the minister to meet the great and famous Australian General Eva Burrows AC. I also want to commend Peter Fox of Linfox. He has put half a million dollars of his own money into this centre and is busy raising another $1 million through business donations. If everything goes according to plan, this important new centre will be finished in April or May of next year. I have seen the site on which it is to be built, at the beginning of St Kilda Road. I could not think of more appropriate, secure accommodation for people with these kinds of problems to benefit from. I commend the Salvation Army on their important and practical work to address the issue of homelessness. Diabetes",119
214,Mr DUTTON,ADJOURNMENT,"I have only been the shadow minister for health and ageing for a short period of time but I have met some wonderful and amazing people and I have read some incredible and inspiring stories. People who have diabetes and those who support the awareness of the growing epidemic of diabetes certainly tell a remarkable story and they should be commended for the work they have done in our country. I want to acknowledge in the gallery today Dr Gary Deed, the National President of Diabetes Australia. He leads an inspirational organisation that is making a significant ference in people's lives. Tonight he will be attending the World Diabetes Day gala dinner in Canberra, which I know a number of people from this House will be attending. I know that it receives wide support-the cause generally but the dinner tonight and the celebration of Diabetes Day tomorrow in particular. I also want to acknowledge as part of my contribution to this debate tonight the wonderful work of the member for Pearce, Judi Moylan. She is a person with remarkable character who set up the Parliamentary Diabetes Support Group. She works very closely with Dr Mal Washer, Mr Mark Dreyfus, Senator Guy Barnett, Mr Dick Adams and Mr Cameron Thompson, the former member for Blair. With Diabetes Australia and a number of other organisations they have been able to make some tangible contributions directly through the work that they have done. For that, today I commend them. Our thoughts are with those people who are suffering from diabetes. Earlier this week, Diabetes Australia launched their online map, which can be found at www.diabetesmap.com.au. The statistics on that site show that there are 128,652 people in this country with type 1 diabetes and 709,919 with type 2 diabetes. The profile reveals a number of other statistics as well. People can visit the site to get an understanding of exactly how many people in their area have diabetes and what they face. The growing number of people with diabetes in this country is striking and it is something that, in a bipartisan way, members on both sides of this chamber need to be united in challenging. Diabetes Australia, along with a number of other organisations and along with people like the member for Pearce and her group, create awareness and strive for prevention, difdetection and management, but ultimately a cure. That is why the former government, followed by this government, provided important research funding, and some of the funding has been quite remarkable. I know that the member for Pearce and other players are very proud of the funding that has been able to flow to organisations. There was $5½ million allocated in the May 2008 budget to make insulin pump technology more affordable for families who have a child under 18 with type 1 diabetes. We want to work with the government to implement the coalition's policy to make the pumps available to more people so that they can manage their diabetes more effectively. There was a $15.3 million commitment by the government towards consumables used with the insulin pumps. That builds on considerable work that was done by the coalition government in association with the industry groups. I think that was a highlight of our period in government and I am sure that it will continue under this government as well. At the dinner tonight I am looking forward to seeing Billy Renouf and Dominic Clark from my electorate. Together with a number of other young adults they have been on quite an arduous walk today, which, to their credit, they did as part of raising awareness of Diabetes Day. I am sure that they will be looking forward to having something to eat tonight and that they will sleep well when they get into their beds. They will certainly deserve a break. I have also had contact over the years in my electorate with Jack Yorston, who tells a wonderful story. He has got type 1 diabetes and he is reflective of the wonderful spirit of kids all around the country that deserve our support. (Time expired) Clubs SA",121
215,Mr ZAPPIA,ADJOURNMENT,"On Saturday, 25 October, I attended the Clubs SA 23rd annual Awards of Excellence presentation. Clubs SA is the representative body of community clubs throughout South Australia and includes social, sporting and service clubs. Firstly, I take this opportunity acknowledge the valuable work that all of these clubs do in building community spirit, lifting community pride, building community cohesion and providing many local community services. Whether it is through the dining room facilities and the sports and recreation opportunities that they provide or through the many community events that they host, these clubs add so much value and life to the local communities that they serve. Secondly, I take this opportunity to nise the work of the thousands of volunteers who are associated with these clubs. It is because of their voluntary work that many of these clubs continue to survive and it is because of their voluntary work that they provide the services at affordable prices to many people who would otherwise be left disengaged from the rest of society. Like so many other volunteers, these people do what they can because they care. What was clearly evident from the presentation night was that these clubs provide not only services to their own members but substantial support to other community groups and charities. I particularly acknowledge the support that Clubs SA gave to two young South Australians, James Greenham and Skye George, who recently walked the Kokoda Track as part of the Kokoda Youth Challenge. On the presentation night, they shared their incredible experience with guests. As someone who has not walked the track, I was very impressed with what these young people had to say about their experience. I also take this opportunity to acknowledge Cameron Taylor, President of Clubs SA, and his board members: Bill Cochrane, Kym Flanagan, Darren Chandler, Loraine Donaghy, Steven Grant and a long time friend of mine, Bob Raphael. These people are all dedicated community people and to Clubs SA has grown and strengthened because of the board's collective leadership and wisdom. Finally, I acknowledge the award finalists and individual category winners on the evening. They included: the Para Hills Community Club, the Clubhouse, the Murray Bridge and District Community Club, the Colonel Light Gardens RSL, the Renmark Club, the Marion Sports and Community Club, the Parafield Gardens Community Club, the recogBarmera-Monash Football Club, the Cobdogla and District Club, Racquets SA and the Salisbury North Football Club. All of those clubs do an exceptional job within each of their local communities. The club of the year award for a regional club went to the Clubhouse, located in the Barossa Valley. For the Adelaide metropolitan area, for the second year in a row, the award went to the Para Hills Community Club. I am pleased to say that the Para Hills Community Club is located in the Makin electorate and is well known to me. The club was built by local Para Hills residents in the mid-1960s and over the years has consistently been a social focal point for locals. In recent years, under general manager Cameron Taylor and chairman of the board Chris Goldner and his fellow board members, the club has been substantially redeveloped and modernised, now providing a range of services which include a social outlet for locals, dining room facilities-and it is an excellent dining room faciltown. ity that they have there-a meeting place for many of the local community groups and an over-50s group. The club is also the major supporter of many of the local sporting clubs. In fact, it is 12 months almost to the day since our Minister for Finance and Deregulation and I visited the club. In a recent speech that the finance minister gave, he had fond memories of his tour and spoke highly of the club. Clearly, the club made an impression on him. Once again, congratulations to the Para Hills Community Club and all of the other award winners on the night. Flinders Electorate: Somerville Secondary",122
216,Mr HUNT,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise to acknowledge and pay great respect to the community of Somerville on the creation of the Somerville Secondary College as an independent stand-alone secondary college. This has been a long fought project. It is a great outcome for the community. It has proceeded in three stages. The first stage was have the school itself established. This was land which was to have been sold by the state government, and I am delighted to have been able to have worked with the Somerville Secondary College Committee, as it then was. They were people who had a sense of vision, purpose and hope that this town, which had grown and expanded and which had a great sense of unity, should have a ondary college. They were successful. Led by Phil Brake and many others, that committee went on to ensure that the Somerville Secondary College was established as a satellite of the nearby Mount Erin Secondary College. I am exceptionally pleased that the previous government was able to commit $3 million all up to the establishment of this new school. It has given many students the chance to have a school within Somerville. It has already been and will be for many decades to come one of the centres of life in this What is perhaps extremely impressive is that from that base there was always the imagination and the sense of vision that it would become an independent stand-alone secondary college. That decision has now been achieved. I congratulate Chris Lloyd, the new principal of Somerville Secondary College. That is to be the name. That was always the intention. That will be an independent school. Great work has been done by many people: by members of the community, by members of the school council, by members of the school teaching group and, of course, by the principal and his predecesCollege sors. It is with a real sense of joy that I am able to offer my congratulations to the school and the people of Somerville on the fact that they will now have a new Somerville Secondary College as an independent stand-alone college. In particular, I am pleased that the battle for a new school oval has been won. The oval project went to tender on 15 Octoto ber. I understand that there were many different tenderers. I understand from the school's principal that the project will be completed during the first term of 2009. It will be a great facility. It will be an all weather facility. It will have a running track. It will be good not only for the students but for the town and people of Somerville. Beyond that, I also want to note that not seconly will this much-needed new oval be of value to the school but I am very hopeful that its use will be extended, and I know it is the intention of the school to extend that use with appropriate support to the community. In that context, I have written to the Mornington Peninsula Shire Council to ask them to consider funding change rooms and other facilities, including lights, which would enable the community sporting clubs to make use of this new, all-weather oval with a running track in the middle of Somerville. That would be a great thing - This fundraising This leads me to the third stage. We have embarked upon the first two stages of the big vision for a Somerville secondary college. Stage 3 will be the creation of years 11 and 12. We had thought it would take many years for the school to be established, but we were successful. We had thought it would take the best part of a decade for the school to be allowed to stand on its own as an independent year 7 to 10 school. Now, those two stages having been successful, we work towards this being a years 11 and 12 facility at the appropriate time so that Somerville will have a true secondary college from years 7 to 12. It is a great outcome. I am delighted with the progress. I thank all those who were involved, I congratulate everybody who has been part of the development of the Somerville secondary college and I say with great respect to the Mornington Peninsula Shire Council: we do hope that you can assist with the completion of the oval's facilities. Solomon Electorate: Dripstone Middle",123
217,Mr HALE,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise today to acknowledge Dripstone Middle School in my electorate of Solomon for the fantastic efforts it makes on an annual basis in raising money for cancer research. My niece, Christina Francis, is a year 9 student at the school and I asked her to make a contribution to this speech, so it would be remiss of me to claim credit for what she has put on paper. I will read out what she sent me: - Dripstone Middle School's motto is ‘A Community of Achievers' they live up to their motto in academic, sporting and cultural achievement, as well as being very active in the community. - Dripstone staff and students believe that it is important to raise much needed funds for various charities. has been part of Dripstone life for at least twenty years. In 2007 the students of this middle school raised over $3,000. - $200 for the Humane Society International, - $2 629 for the Bone Marrow Donor Institute and - $243 for the Starlight Children's Foundationas well as taking part in the ‘Relay for Life', where they raised over $4,000. She continued: - Over the years they have been sponsoring a little boy named Connor who has eye cancer and have raised thousands of dollars for him. - Every year on Dripstone Day they have a ‘Crop and Colour' activity and the money raised goes to the Bone Marrow Donor Institute. - Since its inception, ‘Crop and Colour' has raised around $30,000 for various charities. - In 2008 Dripstone has again taken part in ‘Relay for Life' and expanded their range of charities, to include the ‘RSPCA'. School - The Relay for Life was once again held at Carers Gardens Oval recently and it was again a huge success. - 43 teams raised $182,000 with more cash expected to roll in over the coming weeks. - This is a record amount of money raised and was very welcomed by the organisers and the Chief Executive Officer of the Cancer Council NT Helen Smith. - ‘We had more cancer survivors' walk than we've ever had' Ms Smith said. ‘And that's what it is all about ‘She added. - Dripstone has a strong sense of community and enjoys taking part in community activities. - The students are enthusiastic and keen to make a difference in the world. - Students are encouraged to take part in Wednesday Afternoon Activities. - These activities include The Dukes Mob where participants have the opportunity to interact with elderly members of the Darwin community. - The students also partake in a leadership program that helps them to be more active in their community. - I believe that Dripstone Middle School is committed to keeping up their community achievements and will be a valuable asset to the community for years to come. I thank Christina for her contribution. I would like to acknowledge the many fabulous people who perform as carers in our community. A couple of weeks back we as a nation celebrated Carers Week. Carers make a fantastic contribution to our community; they are the unsung heroes of Australia. Carers are selfless givers to us, selfless givers to our community and selfless givers to the people they provide care to. I encourage all Australians: whenever you see a person with a disability, go and introduce yourself to them. Then turn to the person who is with them and ask if they are their carer. If they are, thank them. Tell them that we appreciate what they do and that they do a fantastic job. I support the comments of our Prime Minister, who while opening National Carers Week said: The great thing about what you are doing here is giving a truly personal dimension to what is an extraordinary national story. The story of carers in our country is a narrative about Australia itself, it's a narrative also about those who provide that care individually and each story is different. One statistic I found amazing is that around five per cent of Australians under the age of 25-that is, 350,000 young people-provide care for another person. Furthermore, 170,000 young carers are under the age of 18 and among these the average age is 12 to 13. These are great young kids who are trying to juggle their study, their work and their caring responsibilities every single dayoutstanding. On 8 December carers will be rewarded for their tireless efforts when they receive a one-off payment of $1,000. This will be a welcome payment for the some 400,000 Australians who receive the carers allowance. In conclusion, congratulations to everyone in our community who works tirelessly to help others. Whether you are a carer, a fundraiser for research into illnesses or someone who always kicks the tin and donates, your efforts are appreciated. It is this community engagement, this willingness to lend a helping hand and this compassion and care that unite communities and build a better society. (Time expired) Question agreed to.
