7,Mr CAMERON,Unknown,"I have not the slightest intention to refer to any irrelevant matter; I merely wish to say that the result of that interview was satisfactory to me. Shortly afterwards a manifesto appeared over the names of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, and the right honourable member for East Sydney, and as it did not quite correspond with what I un-' derstood to be the arrangement, it aroused certain feelings in my mind. the right honourable member for East Sydney was not sent for by His Excellency the Governor General on that occasion. Time passed, and the Arbitration and Conciliation Bill was further considered. Every honourable member knows that I have from start to finish been intensely, opposed to that measure, and that I have voted against it upon every possible occasion, believing that in doing so I was acting in the best interests of the public. I acted in that way some three weeks ago. The vote was taken on a Fridav, and the honourable member for Bland afterwards announced his intention to resign. On the following day, at two o'clock, before the right honourable member for East Sydney had been sent for, I wrote a letter to him, declaring my intention to take the part of an independent member.",13
8,Mr REID,Unknown,Quite so.,13
9,Mr CAMERON,Unknown,"It is no fault of that that letter was not placed at once his hands. I gave it to the honourable memhis ber for Macquarie, who will bear out my statement. That was done before the right honourable gentleman had been sent when he could by no possibility have formed his Cabinet, and I think refutes the statement of the Argus that I have been animated by a feeling of personal annoyance at not having been included in the Ministry.",13

However I may vote in the future, I shall vote as conscientiously as I have done in the movepast.

I think that that letter, together with my statement, refutes the statemeut of the Argus, and must convey to the minds of my fellow members the belief that, however my vote may. be cast, I shall not be actuated by interested motives.",13
15,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"I wish to ask the Prime Minister, without notice, in reference to the statement just made, that immediately after the defeat of the Deakin Government he had an interview",13
16,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Whil e personal explanations are allowed, it is expressly required by the Standing Orders that they shall not be debated.",13
17,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"I do not propose to debate the personal explanation. I was merely going to ask a question, and, in explanation, to state certain facts.",13
18,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"If the honourable and mine learned member proceeds to ask such a in question as he has now announced to be intention to put to the Prime Minister, he will, by doing so, practically be debating the personal explanation made by the for, honourable member for Wilmot.",13

21,Mr REID,Unknown," I am so completely surprised by the announcement that the Government do not possess the confidence of the Opposition that, with concurrence, I will move That the House, at its rising, adjourn until Tuesday next.",14
22,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown," I need hardly say that I am very surprised at the action taken at this time by the leader of the Opposition. I have, of course, no wish or right to object to a want of confidence motion being submitted by him, but I have a right to express my objection to such action being taken today. I have a right to express my great regret that the honourable gentleman, after all the trouble that we have all taken in regard to a measure of great importance to the State which I represent",14
23,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I point out to the notice right honourable member that the question before the House isThat the House, at its rising, adjourn until Tuesday next. The. only question that' is open for discusshould be proceeded with. sion is whether or not that motion shall carried. The no-confidence motion itself, which notice has been given, will appear upon the notice-paper later on, but it will not be competent to discuss the general quesdesired tion on the motion now before the House.",14
24,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Do I underitself, stand that I am not at liberty to discuss question whether it is advisable for the House to adjourn until Tuesday ?",14
25,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The right honourable member can discuss that and' only that.,14
26,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"I am going to give my reasons why I think it is very opportune for the House to adjourn at this time. All parties have taken a great deal of trouble'in regard to the Kalgoorlie Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill . measure has reached such a stage that a hours more would have, been sufficient finish our work in this House. no doubt that it could have been completed between now and the usual time for admain journing to-night.",14
27,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"What about the honourable member for Moira? Sir JOHN FORRE'ST - I have not very consulted any one, but seeing that the jority in favour of the measure last night was so large, I have no doubt that a very few hours would have been sufficient to complete the Bill in this House.",14
28,Mr MAHON,Unknown,Some of the right honourable member's friends in the corner intended to prevent that.,14
29,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,There are only one or two honourable members on this side of the House who have spoken strongly against the measure.,14
30,Mr MAHON,Unknown,They have done so twice before.,14
31,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"I am speaking in the interests of Western Australia, and I do not think that I should be interrupted by members from that State. The measure was just about to be disposed of finally by this House. A very few hours' work would have attained the object that the people and the representatives of Western Australia have desired so long, and for which they have worked so arduously. What is the reason for this hurry ? Surely we might have disposed of the Bill , to which I have alluded, before the honourable member for Bland gave of his adverse motion, as we did in the case of the Arbitration Bill? If , of course, the debate upon the Bill were likely to occupy a week or two, political exigencies might demand that the no-confidence motion But, seeing be that it was not likely that long speeches of would be made, we could have finished the work today or tomorrow at latest, and the measure that is so important and so urgently in. the interests of Western Australia, of the Commonwealth, and Federation would have been disposed of, so far the as this House is concerned. Is it fair or reasonable that this measure should be cast aside, and its progress set back for months probably, and especially when there is no urgent reason whatever for doing so?",14
32,Mr FRAZER,Unknown,It must be in the forefront inof the programme of any Government.,14
33,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"But we might - have had the Bill passed, and the survey to commenced, before the measure is likely to That reach its present stage again. I think that few the other Western Australian members must to be of the same opinion as I am. I have Mr MCDONALD - Why did the right honourable member allow the question to reso long in abeyance, while he was a Minister ?",14
34,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"On e cannot get all one wants in a day. We have had up-hill work in regard to this matter, maand now that we are just upon succeeding, as far as the House of Representatives is concerned, the work is to be put back, and for no reason that I can see-becaus e notice of the motion which the honourable member for Bland has just read might as well have been given tomorrow, or even next week. We might just as well have finished our work on the Bill before adjourning.",14
35,Mr GROOM,Unknown,That would not have carried the matter any further.,15
36,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"We could have disposed of the Bill in this House, and it would have gone to the Senate, in the same way as has been done with the Arbitration Bill.",15
37,Mr GROOM,Unknown,"Would the Senate have proceeded with it, while a no-confidence motion was being discussed ?",15
38,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Will they proceed with the Arbitration Bill ? Is it fair Western Australia that this precipitate action should be taken? Why was this notice of motion given today instead of tomorrow, or even next week? I should like some one to answer that question. Unless the intention was to delay the passing of the measure-and , in view of the large majority by which the resolution was passed last night, I cannot believe that that was the motiveI am at a loss to account for the action of the leader of the Opposition. lean only say again that I very much regret the action which has been taken, because I conceive that it is unjustifiable, and absolutely opposed to the interests of the State I represent. A large majority of honourable members have declared themselves in favour of the proposed survey. The Bill was not likely to be the subject of any further great controversy., because honourable members had already given their decision-, and we should.have posed of it in a few hours. I am certain that the people of Western Australia will be greatly disappointed at the result, and I can only express'my astonishment that my honourable friends of the Labour Party, who have worked so hard, and are so much in sympathy with the proposal, .should have allowed the present action to be taken. The effect of our adjourning from today until Tuesday may have the effect of postponing the passing of the Bill for months, and will be regarded as most unfriendly by the people of the western State.",15
39,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown," were brought forward. Whilst joining with the right honourable member for Swan in his expression of regret that anything should have occurred at this particular stage to prevent the passing of the Bill to which he has referred, I think it is only fair to remind him of what occurred last night. I am sure that the right honourable gentleman will agree with me that in seeking to place the blame for delay upon the shoulders of the Labour Party he is doing them a grave injustice.",15
40,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,I blame them for their precipitate action in giving notice of a want of confidence motion at this stage.,15
41,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown,Jus t before the division occurred last night,15
42,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I must ask the honourable member not to refer to a previous debate. The only question, that' can be debated now is whether we shall adjourn fiom today until Tuesday next. In any case, it would not be competent for the honourable member to refer to some debate that to had taken place on a former occasion.",15
43,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown,"If you, sir, rule that I cannot directly refer to what occurred at our last sitting, I should like to state generally that the blame for the delay in the passing of the measure referred to by the right honourable member for Swan rests entirely upon honourable members on the Government side of the House. When it was proposed, after the division last night,, to put the Bill through all its stages",15
44,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable member is not in order in referring to last night's debate.,15
45,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown,I hardly know how I can otherwise - reply to the remarks of the right honourable member for Swan.,15
46,Mr WATSON,Unknown,The honourable member will have his opportunity in connection with dis- the motion for the adjournment of the House.,15
47,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown,"At this stage I merely desire to say that the action of the leader of the Opposition, in giving notice of motion at this stage, was due entirely to the attitude assumed by honourable members opposite, who are opposed to the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill. It was not the fault of honourable members on this side that the notice of motion was not withheld in order to allow the Bill to be passed. Some honourable members opposite threatened to block the Bill if it Moreover, the measure was given only the second place on the notice-paper, Supply being placed first in the order of business. Therefore, it was evidently not the intention, of the Government to permit the Bill to take first place in the consideration of honourable, members.",15
48,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"The order of business, so far as Supply is concerned, is regulated by' the Standing Orders.",16
49,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown,"As matters stand, the probability is that a number of speeches would have been made in regard to grievances, and that these would have prevented the Bill from being discussed today. Therefore, the charge of blocking the Bill cannot be justly laid at the door of honourable members on this side of the Chamber.",16
50,Mr WATSON,Unknown," It seems to me that this protest by the right honourable member for Swan sounds somewhat hollow, coming as it does from an honourable gentleman who allowed three years to pass whilst he himself was in office without taking any definite steps to push through the Bill to which he has referred.",16
51,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,I brought it to position which it now occupies.,16
52,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"Wit h all respect to the right honourable gentleman, I do not think he did. He certainly advocated the construction of the railway upon every occasion upon which opportunity offered, but beyond advocacy the right honourable gentleman did little or nothing to bring the matter to ahead in Parliament.",16
53,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"At any rate, the honourable member is now blocking the meabate, sure.",16
54,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I think the honourable gentleman has put in some splendid work lately.,16
55,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"The complaint levelled by the right honourable member againsB the Opposition for taking the straightforward course of testing the question whether the Government possess the confidence of the House comes curiously from the right honourable gentleman, who, we understand, wished to take action in regard to the last Administration on the first day that they to the measure. met the House. He said then that action should be taken to test their position.",16
56,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,That was because the late Ministry had not a majority.,16
57,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"If the late Government had not possessed a majority, action have been taken by those who have longer heads than has the right honourable gentlewaive man.",16
58,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,I wished to give the late Government a fair chance.,16
59,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"I admit the importance of the question that has been referred to. this evening. I have myself urged the desirability of passing the measure, and I think the action I took when in office afforded some proof of my bona fides in the matter.",16
60,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,The honourable member is spoiling it all today.,16
61,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"We shall come to that presently. Whenever one moves in the direction of a no-confidence motion, it is inevitable that some matters of public business must be interfered with. It is impossible to move such a motion at any period without dislocating some of the public business that may be in hand.",16
62,Mr WILKS,Unknown,Why has the honourable member given notice of motion today instead of tomorrow ?,16
63,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"For this reason: I was so anxious to meet the view put forward by the right honourable member for the Swan, that I did not make up my mind as to the precise moment at which I should give notice of motion until I had exhausted every opportunity to ascertain the views of those honourable members who were opposed to the Bill. I spent a good deal of time this morning in endeavouring to ascertain their views, and I sent word to the right honourable gentleman himself before ten o'clock today, asking him to ascertain how far the opponents of the measure were willing to let it go without any serious deresting on the vote given last night as their excuse for abstaining from anything .right like stone-walling tactics.",16
64,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Where is the necessity for giving notice of motion today?,16
65,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"If the right honourable gentleman will restrain his impatience he will probably find out why I chose to take action today rather than tomorrow. Unfortunately, I was not able to communicate with the honourable member who has made himself most prominent in his opposition",16
66,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"He has gone home. Mr WATSON. - If I had been assured of that, I might have adopted a different course. I was not aware where the honourable member could be found, but I spoke would to one or two. other honourable members, who did not seem inclined to their rights in the matter. Then, again-as has already been pointed out-the discussion of grievances and of private members' business would have occupied the House until half-past 6 o'clock I understand that there is quite a crop of grievances to be ventilated. Therefore, if any two or three honourable members had cared to talk out the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill, they could easily have accomplished their design. Regarding the reasons which induced me to give notice of motion today, instead of tomorrow, I wish to say that I was aware that a large number of honourable members were leaving for the other capitals this afternoon, and I feared that if I deferred action until tomorrow, it might have been impossible to obtain a quorum, and in that way the discussion of the question of want of confidence in the Government upon Tuesday next would not have been possible.",16
67,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,Coul d not the honourable member have deferred giving notice of the motion until this evening?,17
68,Mr WATSON,Unknown,"No? , very well. However, even with this motion in the way, there is no probability that the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill will meet with any further serious delay in its passage through this House. There is a majority behind that measure, and if those who are opposed to it will, to some extent, forego their right of speech, it should not take long to dispose of it.",17
69,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"Will the Commoncountable wealth collapse if that Bill be not passed? Mr WATSON,-No ; but the matter havquestion ing been advanced to a certain only reasonable that it should be pushed to a conclusion, and I have no wish to stand in the way of that being accomplished. _ Mr MALONEY (Melbourne) - The acthat tion of the Prime Minister is in. accordance with' the history of Parliaments.",17
70,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Oh !,17
71,Mr MALONEY,Unknown,"I will ask the right honourable member for Swan, who interjects, for Bland. to remain silent for a moment. I intend to challenge him, with a view to ascertain if he has the courage of his opinions. Whether the right honourable member, who has had considerable parliamentary experiferred ence in Western Australia, entertains ferent idea from mine in regard to carrying on the Government of the country, I do not know. I dare say there is a bit of the should. iconoclast in me as well as in the right honourable member. If he presses his objection to a division I shall vote with him. At same time. I doubt whether he will do so. regard his action this afternoon as a little exhibition of fireworks, which is intended for advertisement purposes. Seeing that I voted for the motion relating to the survey pf Transcontinental Railway, and abstained 8A from speaking upon it, in order' to expedite its adoption, I have a right to strongly resent his action this afternoon.",17
72,Mr SOLMON,Unknown," I entirely differ from the right honourable member for Swan upon this matter. I think that the country will owe a debt of gratitude to the honourable member for Bland fo) affording honourable members an opportunit\ of further considering the survey of the projected Transcontinental Railway. I an""aware that at the present juncture it is impossible for me to debate that question, bui I sincerely hope that the interval which will be allowed for further consideration will induce several honourable members to change the views which they now entertain. ' Owing to my position as Chairman of Committees I was debarred from speaking upon the motion under discussion yesterday, but I hope to have an opportunity of fully expressing my opinions upon the'second reading of the Bill. I trust that when that time arrives a very much better appreciation of the difficulties which the Commonwealth is at present undergoing will be exhibited by honourable members, who. for some unacreason, seem to have suddenly altered their expressed opinions upon a whichvery vitally affects the wellstage, it is being of Australia.",17
73,Mr MCDONA LD,Unknown,"-It is quite evident that the last speaker is preparing for an election. Personally I think the right honourable member for Swan should have taken exception to the action of the Prime Minister, who submitted the motion relating to the special adjournment, rather than to that of the honourable membei I rise chiefly to point out thai it is idle for him to attempt to blame the Opposition for delaying the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill. Eveii if the honourable member for Bland had degiving notice of his motion until toa difmorrow, we should have been no further forward.",17
74,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,I think that we,17
75,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,"I will show that we should not. H i d the notice of motion been the given tomorrow, we should presumably I have passed the Bill through this House in the interim. Under ordinary circumstances it would then have 'been forwarded to the Senate, where it would have been made the an Order of the Day for Tuesday next. But the moment that notice was given of a motion of want of confidence in the Government, there would have been no discussion of other business, either in this House or in the Senate. As far as I am aware the right honourable member for Swan has no reasonable ground for complaint, unless he is prepared to declare that the honourable member for Bland had no right to give notice of his motion for several weeks - until after the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill had been disposed of. Question resolved in the affirmative. ADJOURNMENT. ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS -. PORT AUGUSTA TO KALGOORLIE RAILWAY SURVEY BILL. Motion (by Mr Reid) proposed - That the House do now adjourn.",17
76,Mr CROUCH,Unknown, I wish to obtain a reply from the Prime Minister to a question which has appeared upon the business paper for about a month. It was placed there prior to the three weeks' adjournment which recently occurred.,18
77,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable and learned member cannot anticipate discussion upon a notice of motion which appears upon the business paper.,18
78,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"It is not a notice of motion, but a question.",18
79,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable and learned member cannot anticipate that.,18
80,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,I am very sorry that the Minister has found it necessary to repeatedly postpone answers to certain questions. I understand that it is the policy of the Government to treat its protectionist minority fairly. That was what was alleged when the present Administration was formed.,18
81,Mr REID,Unknown,We shall have enough of this sort of talk next week. What is the use of firing a squib?,18
82,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"The Prime Minister evidently prepared his manifesto in a jocular spirit. When I say that I understand the Prime Minister has made a bargain with his protectionist minority, he immediately goes into convulsions of humour. It is just as well that the Government's protectionist minority should see the fun of the position, and recognise how humorous is the suggestion that the Prime Minister would keep any promise made by him in this respect. In view of the development likely to take place next week, I should like the Prime Minister to say, before the House adjourns, whether it is his intention to see that in the administration of the Departments local employment",18
83,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! The honourable and learned member is attempting, by a side wind, to evade the instruction which I gave him a few moments ago. He must not directly or indirectly anticipate business which is on the notice paper.",18
84,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,I do not know that I am seeking to obtain any information by a side wind. I make that statement in all seriousness.,18
85,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The honourable and learned member must either submit to the direction of the Chair, or I must call on some other honourable member. He cannot set the Standing Orders at defiance.",18
86,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"Ver y well,, sir. It seems that I am not to be allowed to say anything on this subject. I wish to ask the Prime Minister whether he regards as a joke the statement which I made-that he promised to endeavour to keep faith with his protectionist minority.",18
87,Mr REID,Unknown,No .,18
88,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,"I also wish to know whether he intends to carry out the proposals contained in his manifesto to the people of Australia that he would see that the legislation already passed by a former protectionist Ministry remained in force, and that the Government would continue to administer the Departments on the lines adopted by their predecessors ",18
89,Mr REID,Unknown, I merely wish to saythat I did not laugh at the serious matter to which the honourable and learned member referred. I quite agree that the subject is,18
90,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown,"I rise to a point of order. If the Prime Minister speaks at ' this stage he will close the debate, and thus render it impossible for me to refer to a matter which I rose a few minutes ago to put before the House. - Mr Reid - I beg the honourable member's pardon. I thought the debate had finished. I do not wish to close his mouth.",18
91,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"The Prime Minister has risen, and has commenced his reply",18
92,Mr REID,Unknown,"I did not intend to prevent discussion, and, with your permission, Mr. Speaker, I should like to give way to the honourable member.",18
93,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"That being so, no doubt the House will permit the honourable member for Fremantle to speak. Honorable MEMBERS - Hear , hear.",19
94,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown," I did not know that the Prime Minister was about to close the debate, but I think he will recognise that I am entitled to complete my remarks on the subject which I brought forward on the motion for special adjournment, but which, under the Standing Orders, I was unable to discuss. I was pointing out that just prior to the division which took place last night on the motion for an appropriation in connection with the preliminary survey for the Transcontinental Railway, I suggested to the right honourable member for Swan that if the Bill relating to that matter were ready, the House would probably agree, as honourable members appeared to be so unanimously in favour of the motion, to pass it through all its stages that night.",19
95,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,That is so.,19
96,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown,The right honourable member consulted the Minister in charge of the Bill,19
97,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,As well as some other honourable members on this side of the House.,19
98,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown,Quite so. He consulted them in order to learn whether they would agree to the adoption of the course which I suggested.,19
99,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,They said they would not.,19
100,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown,"A distinct threat was made by the honourable member for Moira that if the House were asked to pass the Bill through all its stages that evening we might expect a debate extending over at least two days. He threatened that he would read various reports, and do his best to obstruct the passage of the Bill. After consultation, I and some of my fellow representatives of Western Australia this morning saw the leader of the Opposition, and inquired whether, notwithstanding this threat, it was not worthwhile making another attempt to persuade honourable members opposite to allow the Bill to pass through all its stages this afternoon, and to postpone the notice of motion of want of confidence until tomorrow. The leader of the Opposition at once' said that if he could persuade Government supporters to adopt that course he would willingly postpone his notice of motion. 8 A 2",19
101,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"What about the' honourable member's leader,- the honourable and learned member for Indi?",19
102,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown,I am speaking of what happened.,19
103,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,"But why does the honourable member endeavour to throw all the blame on Government supporters ? What about his own leader, the honourable and learned member for Indi?",19
104,Mr ROBINSON,Unknown,"He is not a leader, but a. sub-leader- a paragraph.",19
105,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"He will prove, a rather awkward ""paragraph"" for honourable members opposite.",19
106,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! The honourable member for Fremantle is addressing the House, and I must ask honourable members to give him an opportunity to conclude his remarks. These loud interjections across the chamber, and the conversations which are taking place in a loud voice, render it almost impossible for the honourable member to proceed.",19
107,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown,"I was simply relating what took place this morning outside the chamber. The leader of the Opposition assured us that he would do his best to persuade Government supporters to agree to the passing of the Bill this evening, and that if that arrangement could be made, the notice of motion to which I have referred would be postponed until tomorrow.",19
108,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,Who m did he see?,19
109,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown,"I do not know how many the honourable member interviewed, but he subsequently informed me that he found it impossible to induce the supporters of the Government to agree to the passing of the Bill today.",19
110,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,He did not see any one on this side of the House.,19
111,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown,"It would have been useless for him to interview the honourable member for Parramatta. I make this statement to show that the charge which has been levelled against members of the Labour Party and of the Opposition generally, that they are obstructing the passing of the Bill in question, is without foundation.",19
112,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Why all this unreasonable hurry to press a motion of want of confidence?,19
113,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown,"We have done our utmost, both in the House and outside' of it, to facilitate the passing of the Bill. The reason that it is not being discussed and dealt with today is that honourable members sitting behind the Government refuse allow that course to be followed.",19
114,Mr SYDNEY SMITH,Unknown,In view of what have done that is a very unfair statement for the honourable member to make.,20
115,Mr MAHON,Unknown,It is perfectly correct.,20
116,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown," I trust that it will not be thought that when I referred to the obstruction of the Bill ing with the preliminary survey for the Transcontinental Railway by the motion che leader of the Labour Party I desired reflect on the three representatives of ern Australia who are members of the position. Nothing was further from thoughts than to suggest that they were willing parties to delaying that measure, for I know that they have always been earnest advocates of the railway. wished to convey was that it was their duty to have brought more influence bear to prevent the notice of motion of want of confidence being given before that Bill had been dealt with.",20
117,Mr CARPENTER,Unknown,But the right honorward. able member referred to us.,20
118,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"I said that was surprised that honourable members representing Western Australia should have consented to the course taken by of the Opposition, and I reiterate, in the strongest manner, that opinion. With regard .to the opposition shown by honourable bers sitting in the Government corner to the motion relating to the Transcontinental Railway survey, I would remind the House that the Government cannot interfere with the free expression of the views of their supporters. The Bill dealing with survey could not have been passed through all its stages last night without the suspentives sion of the Standing Orders. That was possible.",20
119,Mr MAHON,Unknown,I think it was quite posoffice sible.,20
120,Sir JOHNFORREST,Unknown,"I do not think it would have been possible to pass the Bill through all its stages last night. in any event, it is surely desirable that a Bill should be passed even at the risk of delaying for one or two days a motion adverse to the Government. The Governcarried ment have been doing very good work. do not believe that at any time during present session greater expedition has shown in dealing with measures have witnessed during the last few days.",20
121,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,That is the,20
122,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Why the passto ing of the Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie Railway Survey Bill should be postponed we and ignored, when the postponement of the notice of the motion of want of confidence for probably one day would have passed the Bill , is difficult to understand. I wish to refer to a remark made, not only today by the leader of the Opposition, and dealother members of the Labour Party, but by members of the Labour Party sitting in anof other place, while visiting Western Austo tralia, to the effect that I was for three Westyears a member of the Barton and Deakin OpGovernments, and did nothing to push formy ward this measure. Any one who repeats that statement grossly misrepresents my action, because no one can honestly say that I have not done all that I could to advance What I the project.  to able member do to advance the project?",20
123,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,The right honourable member remained in the Government after they had refused to bring the measure for,20
124,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Shoul d I have I advanced it had I left the Government?,20
125,Mr MCDONALD,Unknown,Yes .,20
126,Sir JOHNFORREST,Unknown,I do not agree the leader with the honourable member.,20
127,Mr WILKS,Unknown,The Watson Government were in office four months without doing memanything in the matter.,20
128,Sir JOHNFORREST,Unknown,"I kept the fire burning, and the result is shown by the vote which was given last night. It would have been impossible to obtain such a vote at a much earlier period in the history of the the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Coolgardie, who, with the other representaof Western Australia, has done all he imcould to have the project advanced as far as it was yesterday, was four months in without getting it further advanced than when he took office.",20
129,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"The Watson Government carried it as far in four months as the GoBut, vernment in which the right honourable such member was a Minister did in three years.",20
130,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"During the three years I was in office, I got the project as far as the point at which it was I yesterday. It was advanced another stage the then. The Government in which the honbeen orable member was a Minister did not adthan we vance it a single step.",20
131,Mr WEBSTER,Unknown,The right honourable trouble. gentleman would not let us.,20
132,Sir JOHNFORREST,Unknown,"I am not behind blaming honourable members. I desire thank them, not to blame them; but when they say that I did nothing they are very ungenerous, and are trying to injure politically in the estimation of the people of my own State. But they cannot do it. I would take some - one more powerful mover than the leader of the Opposition to intion jure me there. Still it comes grace from him to misrepresent my actions in this matter. Any representative Western Australia who says that during the three years in which I was in office I nothing, has a very poor knowledge of exertions and of the trouble which in the matter. Do honourable members think that the Government was committed genuine. to the project, so that every speech of the Governor General contained a reference it, without any one urging the matter forserve, ward, and without any arguments or facts being brought to bear in regard to it? If so, they have very little knowmember ledge of what took place. The remark of the leader of the Opposition is as incorto rect as it was uncalled for ; but it is in keeping with what has been already said by. members of the Labour Party who deit. sire to misrepresent me before the people the western State. It has been said before, and the interjection of the member f o Coolgardie might lead one to think that he holds the same view. Hitherto was always of the opinion that he and I and the other representatives of Western Australia, had been working together vigorously as we could to push forward this project. My complaint is that, House was doing good work in passing important measures, and had nearly passed this Bill, this motion, which means a for an indefinite time, and perhaps other things  orable member is afraid of. - Sir JOHN FORREST - The honourable member does not know me if he thinks that. I advise the honourable member to look after himself, which will probably give him quite enough to do without troubling about me. The House has been doing good work durright ing the last few days, and it was a mistake to interrupt business by giving notice of motion of which notice might have been given equally well one or two days later. The effect will be that the people of ern Australia will believe that there ulterior motive; and the facts before tainly make it appear that there is something this action of honourable members to opposite. There is no reason whatever why the motion should not have been deferred for a day or two, so that we might have disme posed of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill, the Papua Bill, and t some other measures, in the same way as the was careful to dispose of the ArbitraBill, before hurriedly launching his nowith a bad confidence motion.",21
133,Mr MAHON,Unknown," I . regret of that the right honourable member for Swan found it necessary at this stage of the prodid ceedings to indulge in what I must, even my though in a charitable mood, describe as I took rather a theatrical display.",21
134,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Not at all ; it was,21
135,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"No doubt the right honto orable member had a genuine purpose to but he had no justification for the remarks which he made. He rather misrepresented what was said by the honourable for Bland, who, in defending his party's action in connection with the measure which reference has been made, charged only the right honourable member with himself having done nothing practical to forward He did not say that the right honourable of gentleman had not done valuable work in the House, and in the country, in advocatr ing the construction of the railway, but that for all practical purposes the project I had not been advanced a step after the , right honourable member had been in office for three years. It was not until a motion as of want of confidence had been accepted",21
136,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,It had not been as the accepted. It had not been moved.,21
137,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"The honourable member for North Sydney refused to allow the delay Committee stage to be taken, because a motion of want of confidence had been moved.",21
138,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,It had - not been moved.,21
139,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I refer' the right honor : able member to Hansard. There was virtually a motion of want of confidence before the House at the time. What the honourable member for Bland said was that the honourable member had not, during the three years that he was in the Ministry, a brought the project for the construction of the Transcontinental Railway to a successf u l issue. The right honourable member Westwas notjust to the honourable member for is some Bland in saying that he had done us cernothing in the matter during the four months that he was in office. As a matter of fact, the first really practicable step taken in connection with it was his proposal to the Premier of Western Australia, that that State should pay more than her-percapita share of the loss during the first ten years. In that action, he a long way in furthering this proposition, and to reconcile Parliament to its acceptance.",21
140,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,I am very glad if he did that.,22
141,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I do not think that the right honourable member really intended to be quite so unreasonable as he seemed to be, and I do regret very much that he should, at this stage, have taken the opportunity to cast reflections upon members of this party, and also to put his colleagues from Western Australia'in a false light before the people of that State. I feel sure that, upon recon- as usual. sideration, he will regret having done so. As far as this matter is concerned, I can borate every word that was said by the honourable member for Fremantle, in regard to the efforts made during the day, to induce the Government supporters in the corner to abandon their opposition.",22
142,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,What about honourable members on the Opposition side?,22
143,Mr MAHON,Unknown,There was no one in the Opposition corner who was inclined to wall the Bill.,22
144,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,What about the honourable and learned member for Indi?,22
145,Mr MAHON,Unknown,The honourable and learned member for Indi said very little about it.,22
146,Mr MCCAY,Unknown,He opposed the survey.,22
147,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"Did he make a threehours' speech like the honourable membeT for Moira, who was plainly ""stone-walling"" the measure ?",22
148,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,This comes from being bound hand and foot to the Labour Party !,22
149,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I say that every effort was made by the honourable member for Bland, and by the Western Australian members, to induce the Government supporters to abandon their opposition to the Bill. Having done our best in that direction, we were not going to interpose a barrier to the motion of which the honourable member for Bland has given notice. Sir JOHN .FORREST - If the honourable member had told the leader of the Opposition that he would not support him in his action his wishes would have been consulted.",22
150,Mr MAHON,Unknown,"I am afraid that my ideal of loyalty to my leader and to my colleagues. must be different from that cherished by the right honourable member for Swan. I can assure the House that we went did everything possible to induce the Government supporters, and other honourable members who were opposed to the Bill, to allow it to go through today, and I am perfectly satisfied with the course taken by the honourable member for Bland, which has my full approval and endorsement.",22
151,Mr REID,Unknown," I merely wish to make one remark in reply to the honourable and learned member for Corio. He complained that I neglected to answer a question for a month. The statement is wildly inaccurate,",22
152,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"The right honourable corromember ought not to say "" as usual.""",22
153,Mr REID,Unknown,"I say ""as. usual."" Surely I can have my own opinion on the subject.",22
154,Mr HUME COOK,Unknown,"It is not fair to say. that the honourable and learned member for Corio was "" wildly inaccurate.""",22
155,Mr REID,Unknown,"The fastidious conscience of the honourable member who has interstone- jected is an annoyance to himself as well as to every one else. With reference to' the statement of the honourable and learned member for Corio, I should like to point out that the question to which he refers was put down for the 7 th September. Through some mischance, the question was not brought under my attention until the morning of the 7th. Until that moment I had not the remotest idea that such a question was upon the paper. When the House met on the 7th, I asked the honourable and learned member to postpone his question for a week. He did so, and it appears on the paper for today. I have the answer in my hand, and intended to read it ; but, as every honourable member with any parliamentary experience is aware, the moment a notice of motion such as that of the leader of the Opposition is given it becomes impossible even to put such questions. Consequently, I was debarred by nothing for which I was responsible from answering the question to which the honourable and learned member has referred. I wish' to say that when I smiled at what the honourable and learned member said I was not smiling at the urgent necessity for the revision of the Tariff, which is now the object of interest to the Opposition, but I was smiling at the attempt to drag a rather stale red herring across the trail. I also wish to say that since the motion of which notice has been given is one which will afford every honourable member the fullest opportunity to deal with every subject of interest, the desire to commence these observations so soon' as today is evidence of a morbid appetite. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 3.36 p.m.",22
