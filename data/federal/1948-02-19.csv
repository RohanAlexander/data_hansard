1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. J. S. Roseveai) took. the chair at 2.30 p.m., and read prayers. PETROL. Mr HARRISOlT.r^Has the Prime Minister seen a report of the conviction in the Special Federal Court, Sydney, .of a youth - for a petrol coupon racket by' means of which, he obtained tickets for 50,t)t)0 gallons of petrol a month ? Is he aware that a poliee. witness said that the youth obtained the tickets merely by filling in a form.' and that he had not . been asked to produce any certificate of registration of trucks - or other . motor vehicles? Will the Prime Minister state the reason for this apparent laxity on the part of official's in failing to demand proof of bona fides when issuing petrol coupons? What action is contemplated to ensure against a repetition of such ' illegal practices?",13
2,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"r l did see that a youth of nineteen was convicted of a - charge relating to petrol tickets. I did. not read ""all the details mentioned 'by the honourable member of how he acquired the tickets. I said in .the last sessional period that we were not satisfied with the .policing of the distribution ""of petrol tickets' and that the system was being examined right through from the Noto Issue Department of the Commonwealth Bank, which - prints the tickets, through the distributing officers and then, to the oil companies, which"" collect the tickets from the petrol resellers."" ' I believe that I also stated that I had - asked the Auditor-General to have an examination made of the. whole matter. All those things have been done. I do not know anything about this case, but I . will obtain particulars for the honourable member. We are satisfied,' - however, that the checking of tickets from the Note Issue Department is complete. I understand that there was a question whether forged registration certificates were being tendered and whether there was a complete check of .'applications for petrol coupons. Thai, aspect has been investigated. I will have a short report prepared, for the honor' able member. . He may rest assured that .nothing has been left undone that ought to be done. The .services of; the Commonwealth Investigation Service and the police .departments in the States have .been enlisted to ensure-a tightening, "" the policing of petrol rationing REPATRIATION . r : ' . DISPENSING PATMENTS. '"" Mr HADLEY - Has the Minister for Repatriation seen a recent statement in a ^Brisbane newspaper that an ex-serviceman"" - suffering from malaria was given a "" prescription for atebrin and quinine tablets'? He was surprised to learn that two chemists in the suburb in which he - resided refused to make up the prescription because they woud have to wait too ""long for' payment from the Repatriation 'Department. To prevent a recurrence of refusals by chemises to make up prescriptions for ex-servicemen, will the Minister expedite payment to the chemists in order, that patients suffering ' from malaria may have their prescriptions made up without delay?",13
3,Mr BARNARD,Unknown,"No complaints-have been made to me and I have not read in the press any 'reports relating to this matter. However, I shall obtain a report from. Queensland on the .subject of the. alleged delay in the department making, payments for prescriptions, and ascertain whether - any delay . is occurring. Obviously, , when . thousands of prescriptions are dispensed by chemists, it is difficult for the Repatriation Department to keep. the position completely watertight regarding payments. I have not heard - of any delays, and I do not think that any inordinate delays in making payments have occurred. However, I shall inquire into the matter, find inform the honourable member of the result VERMIN DESTRUCTION. SHORTAGE OF WIRE NETTING. ' Mr TURNBULL - The rapid increase of rabbits and hares in Victoria has created a real menace to production. In the Wimmera electorate, one has. only to travel by motor car at night to'see hundreds of rabbits and scores of hares. The increase has no doubt been brought about by the shortage of wire netting, rabbit traps and fumigating material, and the inability of producers to obtain supplies of cartridges. Of course, the destruction of rabbits has' not been assisted - by the up of levy of Is. 6d. per lb. on skins. Mr SPEARER^-brder I. The honourable member, is debating all the reasons' for the increase of rabbits' and hares in Victoria. He is not entitled, to do so"" when asking a question...",14
4,Mr TURN,Unknown,"BULL - Will the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture treat this matter as urgent, and order an immediate - investigation with a. view to making the materials which I have mentioned avail-' able to those producers who are menaced ' by vermin?  ber will be aware that there is a grave' - scarcity of labour, in Australia today, particularly in the heavy industries. This shortage is due to the inability of private enterprise to recruit sufficient labour.for the manufacture of wire netting Mr TUHNBUXI. - What of the shipping hold-up?",14
5,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Order ! The honourable member has asked a question, and now .proceeds to answer it. He should listen in silence to the reply to the question which is being given by the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture  it is due to the inability of private "" enterprise torecruit sufficient labour for the manufacture of wire netting and fencing wire that a desperate shortage of these materials does exist in Australia. If the honourable member suggests that the Australian Government should commence manufacturing wire netting and fencing wire and recruit the labour required for this purpose, I shall be prepared to consider his proposal. All honourable 'members realise that these materials are in short supply, but every possible action is being taken to overcome the scarcity. The honourable member will also be aware that my very active colleague, the Minister for Immigration, is working day and night in an endeavour to ensure that every available ship that we can obtain from the people who own them shall come to these shores laden with migrants who will be willing to engage in our heavy industries and produce our requirements. Further, I direct the attention of the honourable member to the fact that the problem of keeping down vermin in Victoria is the responsibility of the State Government, and the honourable gentleman should also make representations on the subject in that quarter. Ammunition, too, is scarce for the same reason that wire netting and fencing wire are scarce. Again, I admit, that the production' of this commodity is in the hands of a very efficient private prise in this country, but, until production difficulties can be overcome, with the assistance of the Minister for Immigration, the improvement will be rather slow.",14
6,Mr TURNBULL,Unknown,"""What about the levy  letters to nearly every member of this Parliament on many occasions explainof ing that the levy on rabbit skins was imposed by the Menzies Government with the support of the Opposition of the day. iSo, if there is any blame attaching this action, we are all blameworthy some measure. The purpose of the levy was to ensure that the felt hats required by our military forces and by the civ-ilian population would be available at a price in keeping with Australia's internal nomy. The rabbit skin levy does not have any material effect on the activities of those who carry out rabbit destruction this country because the high prices ruling overseas for rabbit skins provide ample incentive for this work. Last year, rabbit skins exported to the United States of America and other dollar area9 realized 6,000,000 dollars. In fact, it is claimed that rabbit trapping is so remunerative that trappers will not destroy does found in the traps because they want to ensure an increase of the rabbit population so that their livelihood may continue. - OATS. Mr DUTHIE:-Wit h reference to the arrangements that are being made in respect of the price and marketing of oats this season, can the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture inform me whetherTasmanian oat-grower3 will receive a share-of the export price? Arc there any agents of the Australian Government in Tasmania who can receive oats for home consumption or export? When the oats are sold to millers, will thf; first price be the last?  growers of oats in Australia this season shall receive the full benefit, if they so desire, of the high prices ruling overseas, the Government has established a voluntary oat pool. Growers who deliver oats to the pool are guaranteed 3s. 6d. a bushel on trucks at railway sidings. That payment will be in the nature of a guaranteed enterprice and a first advance. The Barley Board, which will receive the oats into the pool, will have the sole right to export the oats. In addition, it will be entitled to sell, oats for consumption in this country. The operations of the pool will ensure an ? equalization of returns to growers who deliver to the pool. That is to say, if the Barley Board .receives 10,000,000 bushels oats this season and exports 5,00.0,000 at 10s. a bushel and sells 5,000,000 in this country at 5s. a bushel, the equalized price to the oat-grower will be 7s. 6d. a to bushel less the cost of administration, in which is estimated at lOd. a bushel. Those who do not deliver to the pool, of course, can sell their oats only within Australia. They will receive only the price paid to them initially by the purchasers. The pool will be effective in ecoevery .State, including Tasmania. in - JAPANES E PEAC E TREATY .",15
7,Mr RYAN,Unknown,"Can the Prime Minister indicate when the^conference to draw up the terms of the Japanese peace treaty is likely to assemble? Is he not of the opinion that the sooner the treaty is drawn up the better, and can he give a reason for what seem.s to be a long delay in calling the conference together?",15
8,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"I regret that it is not possible to announce a date for the assembling of the conference to draw Tip the Japanese peace treaty. A deadlock has been reached in regard to this matter. I believe that the Soviet Government takes the view that the treaty should be dealt with in the first place by the foreign ministers of the four major powers. Of course, that is not acceptable to Australia, and I believe that it is not - ncceptable to a number of other nations. It is generally considered that all those nations which participated in the war --against Japan in the Pacific area should take part in the peace conference. Every endeavour has been made to overcome the present deadlock, but I cannot say whether the suggestions that have been made are acceptable or not. The answer to the honourable member is that the deadlock occurred because of a difference of opinion regarding the composition of the body to deal with the treaty. At present F can give no indication of the date when the treaty will be considered. STEEL.",16
9,Mr THOMPSON,Unknown,"Can the Minister representing the Minister for Supply and .Shipping inform the House whether control of steel, supplies by the Commonwealth is still in operation? If so, can he explain why there is a great shortage of steel in South Australia, ticularly of steel required for the manufacture of ploughshares, discs and other agricultural implements? Furthermore, is there any truth in the report approximately 60,000 tons of steel is at Newcastle awaiting shipment to South' Australia ?",16
10,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,"I am not aware whether there are any supplies of steel awaiting shipment at Newcastle. I shall have inquiries made and inform the honourable member of the .facts. It is true that there is a general shortage of steel throughout Australia, and that control over steel supplies is exercised by the Commonwealth. As far as I am tach State is provided with an allocation and it is then the responsibility of each State government to distribute its quota amongst the different industries. Until such time as the production of steel increases considerably the shortage will continue. I shall make further inquiries, and if I obtain any additional information I shall convey it to the honourable member. SHIPPING. BAN ON DUTCH SHIPS.",16
11,Mr RANKIN,Unknown,"Has the Prime Minister seen the statement made on the 31st January by the secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation, Mr Roach, that the wa terside workers' ban on Dutch shipping still operates? Has he also seen Mr. Roach's further statement that the ban bad been imposed at the request of the Indonesian trade union movement, and would be lifted or modified only when that, movement asked the .federation to do so? Is the ban still in existence? If so, does the Prime Minister approve the Government abdicating its responsibility to govern in favour of an outside body?",16
12,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"I have not seen the latter statement attributed to Mr Roach. However, a most reputable person did bring to my notice a statement made by Mr Roach some time ago, in the course of which he was reported to have said that the ban on Dutch shipping, which had been imposed, with the concurrence of federal unions within the Australian Council of Trades Unions, could not be lifted until the decision of that body had been reversed. The copy of the statement par- which Mr Roach was said to have made did not contain any reference to the union, with which Mr Roach i9 connected. Endeavours have been made by that the Government to have the ban on the lying transportation to the Netherlands East Indies of civilian goods, as opposed to arms, lifted., and it was hoped that the establishment of the Committee of Good Offices, whose members are now reporting to the Security Council, would result in the ban being lifted. The Government has never acquiesced in the imposition of a ban on the transportation of civilian goods to Java. Mr BEAU: - But the Government has aware. done nothing about it ! Mr .CHIFLEY - I do all I can. For instance, when it was reported recently that a ban was to be placed on the resumption of shipping between Holland and Australia by a Dutch line, I made - certain representations and issued a a public statement, as the result of which it was decided not to impose the threatened ban. The resumption of shipping between Holland and Australia is something which affects this country mpre than the carriage of goods to Indonesia. We all hope that a peaceful settlement of the dispute in the Netherlands East Indies will be reached, and (hat normal trade relations will be re? sumed between our two countries. LEAVE OF ABSENCE. Motion (by Mr CHTFLEY)-by leaveagreed toThat leave of absence for one month be given to the right honourable member for them. Yarra J Mr Scullin), on the ground of ill health. WHEAT. Mr LANGTRY.^-Publicatio n of rethose ports of the proceedings at. the recent conference between the Minister for Commerce and. Agriculture, State Minisof ters of Agriculture and wheat-growers' organizations concerning the adoption a. stabilization scheme for wheat has to a (great deal of criticism of the Gowho vernment. Of course, the rumour that negotiations had broken down completely was inaugurated. was denied by the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture in the House yesterday. Can the Minister now inform the House whether the "" stumbling block "" encounters tered in the negotiations was the matter of a guaranteed price, the home consumpzation ' tion price or the suggested extensionof time of operation of the scheme to in-; elude the 1953 season's crop? Has period been fixed for State Governments and wheat-growers' organizations to consider the matter before informing Minister of their final decision?  plete answer to. the honourable member's question would necessitate my making speech, which I do not propose to do. The discus.si.oii9 referred to by the honortial able member took place at a special conscheme. - ference held after the termination of the recent meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council, and was the outcome of a decision reached at the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers, held in August last. At the latter conference it was decided that Commonwealth and State Ministers should meet later in Canberra to explore the possibilities of evolving a satisfactory stabilization scheme, and it was also decided then that representatives of wheat-growers' organizations should be invited to hold a simultaneous meeting in Canberra, so that they could submit proposals in writing to the special conference of Ministers. The Wheat Growers Federation met simultaneously with the conference of Ministers and submitted its proposals, which were then considered. The conference then indicated its decision upon the proposals and, after considering them, the federation intimated whether it accepted or rejected After some discussion, I indicated the decisions of the Australian Government on most of the stabilization proposals, pointing out that there was no deviation from announced when the increased price was published. I undertook, to take to Cabinet a recommendation that the period the plan should be extended by one year and a proposal that a responsible of committee should be appointed to conled sider m'eans. of making payments to those sold their properties before any stabilization plan was finally wound up, if one It was never envisaged that the conference of Commonwealth and State Miniswould be able immediately to determine a mutually acceptable wheat stabiliplan. The State Ministers for Agriculture go back to their own cabinets, report what they are told by the Commonany wealth Minister for Agriculture about how far the-Federal Government is prerepared to go, decide what further recomthe mendations shall be made to the Australian Cabinet, and so on. Then the State are in a position to inform 'he Australian Government whether they, a in turn, are prepared to introduce the complementary legislation that is essento the continuation of a stabilization As to the time element, it has been veyed clearly to the State Governments that if stabilization is to be accomplished, in ' Australia House. they must pass the necessary legislation in time for the plan to operate in respect of the new crop in November of this I am awaiting further information them. ABORIGINES. ' INCOME TAX-SOCIA L SERVICES.",16
13,Mr MCBRIDE,Unknown,"I ask the Primi - people Minister whether it is a fact that Aus200,000 tralian aborigines in receipt of approthat priate incomes are required to pay incornu lax, including social service contribuhas tions? Is it also a fact that aboriginfssponsor are not entitled to existing social service benefits ? If those are facts, will the Prime Minister consider extending existing social service benefits to the aborigines?",18
14,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"That question reWales quires a lengthy answer. As to the first part, in some cases, income '.ax does apply. Aborigines living under civilized condivided tions are ordinary citizens, and, there for fore, the normal income tax laws apply to them. As to the second part of the question, in some cases social benefits paid. I do not want to take up the time of the House now, and I shall arrange for a full reply to be given to the honorensure able member later: IMMIGRATION .",18
15,Mr HAYLEN,Unknown,"Has the Minister for Immigration read reports of a scheme being undertaken by the Legion of Exservice Men and Women known as the "" Sponsor of Migrants Scheme "", whereby ex-service personnel in Australia renew acquaintance with "" mates "" on the battlefields with a view to bringing them to this country as. migrants? Does he approve the scheme? Will it conflict with the free and assisted passage scheme for British migrants? If he does approve the scheme, and we are to have outside organizations assisting in our migration plans, can he give an assurance that permanent employment and permanent housing accommodation will be provided for such migrants ? - Mr Calwell - As I explained some months ago, considerably in excess of 400,000 persons are registered at Auscontralia House to come to Australia, and 211,000 are included in applications filed About 90,000 have relatives and friends in Australia who are prepared to arrange year. accommodation for them in their own from homes. The employment aspect, does not present any difficulty, because this country is in the extraordinary position of having a depression in reverse. We have more ;jobs available today than we have '.o fill them. Possibly, we could fill jobs if we could only transport number of additional people to these shores. The Lord Mayor of Melbourne interested himself in a scheme to the migration of persons from Great .Britain, who have neither friends nor relatives in this country, to give them accommodation here. The Legion of Exservice Men and Women in New South has propounded a similar scheme. I shall approve any scheme which will help to bring people to Australia prothat accommodation here is ready them, so that Australians, particularly Australian ex-servicemen, are not placed - in further difficulty in obtaining housing are accommodation for themselves and their families. With respect to suitability of accommodation, every effort is made to that persons offering accommodation are genuinely offering suitable accommodation.",18
16,Mr HAYLEN,Unknown,Suitabl e and permanent accommodation.,18
17,Mr CALWELL,Unknown,Yes . We inspect the accommodation offered. In some cases we have refused applications because the accommodation offered was either not suitable or did not give any evidence of being permanent. The' honourable member can rest assured that anybody with proposals to put up will have them sympathetically considered by the Department. CIVIL AVIATION. TKANS - ATJSTRAL IA AntLINES.,18
18,Mr DAVIDSON,Unknown,"I ask the Minister for Civil Aviation whether it is a fact that Trans-Australia Airlines recently established a service from Townsville to Charters Towers, Julia Creek and Cloncurry, notwithstanding that a service on the same route had already been established by ex-servicemen? If so, will the Minister inform the House of the justiv fication for the establishment of this service, which will seriously hamper the rehabilitation of these ex-servicemen?",18
19,Mr DRAKEFORD,Unknown,"As from Monday last, Trans-Australia Airlines established a service from Townsville to Mount Isa. Previously, Townsville and Inland Services was operating on the same route, with aeroplanes which could land at places where Douglas machines could not land. The new service is intended to give a more frequent and better service, and it has been commenced, with the consent and encouragement of the Queensland Government. The suggestion that some injustice is being done to ex-servicemen i$ entirely without foundation. Eighty per cent, of the employees of Trans-Australia Airlines are ex-service personnel; and no other organization em.ploys a higher percentage of ex-service personnel. « MOTOR VEHICLES.",19
20,Mr JAMES,Unknown,"I understand that reto cently the Minister for Transport tralian products? assumed control of what is known as the New Vehicles Releases Committee. Can the Minister inform the House what will be the policy with respect to the release of new motor vehicles in future? Will priority be' given to applications from persons who require vehicles for urgent business. and ""industrial reasons applications from persons requiring motor vehicles solely for pleasure. I am informed that in some States vehicles are released to people to be solely for pleasure. Yet, in New South Wales, many people engaged in the ing industry are unable to procure motor cars in which to carry on actiplaints vities associated with that important industry. Will they be given""priority over people in other States who require cars merely for pleasure purposes? Can the Minister arrange to transfer to New South Wales cars that are surplus in other States?",19
21,Mr WARD,Unknown,"It has never been the practice since the control was established to approve the release of cars for purely pleasure purposes. In New South Wales, the organization has been changed at the request of the State Government. The changes made by the Commonwealth are designed to prevent any of the abuses which, it is alleged, have occurred in /the past. The same policy as previously is applied in the other States. The cars are released on the basis of the essentiality of the purposes in respect of which applications have been lodged. If the honourable member knows of any releases haying been made for purely pleasure purposes and he furnishes details immediate investigations will be instituted. FRESH FRUIT. MALAYAN MARKET.",19
22,Dame ENID LYONS,Unknown,"Has the attention of the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture been drawn to the recent statement of Malayan importers that, unless Australia re-organized its haphazard methods of shipment, South Africa would capture the Malayan fresh fruit market-wort h £800,000 to Australia last year? If so, can he indicate what action has been taken or is intended protect this valuable market for Aus been drawn to the statement, but I am sure that the honourable member will realise that Australia does not control shipping between Australia and Malaya. Control is entirely in the hands of the over shipping companies. I am not always impressed by some of the statements that come from Malaya about Australian fruit. It seems that when there is a used glutted market there the importers tend to blame the Australian exporters. Those mincircumstances have always to be taken into consideration in respect of comof that sort. I assure the honourable member that our officers who are in charge of the inspection of fruit for export, are most careful about the types, standards and packing of fruit consigned to Malaya. Sometimes trouble occurs in Malaya. Recently, there was trouble over a shipment of oranges. Waterside workers in Malaya were on strike and the oranges were not unloaded. There was sabotage on board after the ship reached port and the fruit was deliberately damaged. There were, of course, "" kickbacks"". Some people in Malaya tend to blame the Australian exporters) merchants and growers, but I assure the. honourable member that our trade representatives in Malaya and Singapore, who keep in close touch Australia are co-operating with us keep our fruit trade with Malaya on high plane and to preserve a high ethical standard between the Australian exporter and the Malayan importers. EMPLOYMENT. ARE LIMITS ",19
23,Mrs BLACKBURN,Unknown,"Can the Minnot ister for Labour and National Serployees vice verify statements that a number But I have no proof that an employer of private business firms and those controlling some public works have an age limit of 35 years for men up. seeking, employment, and. that, in the main, ""only"" heavy woi;k or labouring w.oxk is. being offered at the, employment offices to men over 50 years it be possible to. ascertain whether many men. iii the, 45 to, 65 year group are out of employment ?

A'ni-I right in assuming, that the means test should not app'ly 'to men in thjs. group who,seek unemployment, relief when they have failed to ""obtain employment of which they are capable?' Mr HOLLO ^ A y - I will reply, to the' last, part of the opest'ion first. ' easy to ascertain the agesof-those who are unemployed, if there are any, and cr,eas.Sfthe where they are. The honourable member's question was whether there could be some discrimination in determining the right of eligibility for social service payments because of the age of-applicants. not; There is. no need for that, because the mere fact that they are. out of work and, having been submitted to the works test, cannot be given, work, entitles them to unemployment relief. The first part the question is the most difficult. Do know' of any cases of employers having refused to employ people-over the age 35? I have heard of such cases, and have investigated them, but I have never been able' to prove one, with this qualiissued fication : some' large companies that employ men over the age of 70 are making some, of their employees permanent, but do not make permanent any one over the agp of 40 or 45. When I ask them why - they do that, in view of the state of the labour market, they say that it is not because they do not want to employ men over that age, or that such men are not with so good as others, but because of the to welfare schemes of superannuation and a retiring allowances, that they have putinto operation at the request of the Australian Government. So, we have repercussions, when we take steps to improve the lot of the masses. If the companies are to put their employees on a permanent basis and,- allow them to share in the benefit of retiring allowances, they cancarry out those schemes if the embegin at 40 or 50 years of age. (will not employ men pr women because of age. I intend to follow this matter because I have had casesi reported to me that I have, not been. able, to prove.'

So as I know, a confidential report has yet been supplied to the Department Civil Aviation about these aircraft. If such a report has been made, it has not yet me, I should like to see it. The GoConvair airliners have been purchased no to specifications which provide for the carriage of 40 passengers between Melbourne and Sydney, and similar distances Australian cities, with ample fuel to reserve to meet the requirements of the but regulations of the Australian Department Civil Aviation. The latest reports from the technical representative of the Transhad Australia Airlines at the Consolidated passVultee factory at San Diego in the United he States of America confirm that these requirements will be satisfactorily met. The Convair-airliner has been granted an approved type certificate by the United States civil aviation authorities, but tests on pressurization and de-icing equipment are not yet completed. Speed and performance figures for these aircraft during the United States civil aviation authority's tests have been satisfactory. Three Convair-airliners have been delivered to airlines in the United States, and a further 173 are on order by American and overseas airlines. Delivery in America of the five aircraft for Trans-Australia Airlines is. expected as follows: One in April, one in May, one in June and the remaining two in July. Pinal acceptance by Trans-Australia Airlines is conditional upon the aircraft having a full certificate of airworthiness for scheduled airline operations. I hope that this information which I have given to the House, will help to kill the inspired propaganda that has been disseminated from time to time against these fine aircraft. INCOME TAX .

If so, what action has been taken to collect this huge sum? What was the amount outstanding at the 31st December last?",22
29,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"I have not yet read the Auditor-General's report, but I hope to do so next week-end. Every effort is being made to reduce the amount of tax arrears, and I believe that this task has been satisfactorily accomplished. Hmse must remember always that a considerable percentage of the arrears are related to appeals against assessments.",22
30,Mr FADDEN,Unknown,-The taxpayer is obliged to pay the amount shown on the assessment even though he proposes to appeal later.,22
31,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"Some taxpayers ask for a deferment of payment. Doubtless the right honourable gentleman had in mind the Taxation Board of Review, which hears appeals against assessments, but often when I use the word "" appeal "", I refer to applications for deferment of the payment of tax, or applications for final permission to pay by instalments. This applies not only to companies but also to individuals. Every effort is being made to collect the arrears. I am not able to inform the right honourable gentleman as to the amount of arrears at the 31st December last, but I shall obtain the figure for him. NORTHERN TERRITORY. WOBKS PROGRAMME.",22
32,Mr BLAIN,Unknown,"I address to the Minister for Works and Housing a question arising out of a report published in the Melbourne Sun News-Pictorial yesterday of the proceedings of the Legislative Council of the Northern Territory in Darwin on Tuesday. The report statesThe harmony of yesterday's opening proceedings in the Northern Territory Legislative Council was forgotten today during a sharp debate on housing. At one stage the Speaker (The Administrator, M.T. Driver) threatened to name Mr. V. H . Webster, member for Tennant Creek. Mr Webster had moved that the workings of the Department of Works and Housing should he investigated - He said there was great dissatisfaction throughout the Territory because too few homes were being built. When the Government Secretary (Mr R. Leydin), speaking against the motion, doubted Mr Webster's sincerity, Mr Webster jumped to his feet, protesting. Voting on the motion was adjourned until the next sitting so that the Council could ascertain what power it had to investigate a department with head-quarters outside the Territory. A motion to investigate the shortage of medical staff was similarly dea.lt with. I ask the Minister for Works and Housing who, in the absence through illness of the Minister for the Interior last year, The introduced into this Parliament the legislation constituting the Northern Territory Legislative Council, to ascertain whether there is any real authority vested in this new body or whether it is an emasculated legislature. Further, will the Minister undertake to hold immediately an investigation of the activities of his department in the Northern Territory, not only in the light of the criticism that I have voiced of it in the last year or two, but also because of the supporting criticisms that have been offered by Dr Webster? I should like to know particularly"" what was the cost of renovating the - Darwin Post Office and whether it is a fact that the Department of Works and Housing was ashamed to send its bill to the Postmaster-General's Department for this work?",22
33,Mr LEMMON,Unknown,"At no time have 1 been ashamed to give the cost of any project undertaken by my department, wall and I shall be pleased to provide the orable member for the Northern Territory with the figures relating to the job that he has mentioned. I have no intention of holding an inquiry into the charges which the honourable member claims have been 1930-31. made by Dr Webster. If the Administragentleman's tor believes that the charges are worth referring to me I shall examine them and take whatever steps 1 consider to be sary. The question of the power of the Legislative Council is a matter for the Minister for the Interior, but I am sure that it will be necessary for him to refer it to the Attorney-General's Department for legal advice. CUSTOMS TARIFFBILL 1948. In committee: Consideration resumed from the 18th February (vide page 63). Schedule. Item 3 (Ale, spirits and beverages) and - item ' 19 (Tobacco leaf)-by leavefurther considered together. .",23
34,Mr ARCHIE CAMERON,Unknown,"Barker) tant [ 3 . 2 8 ] - I should not have risen had not been for certain statements made by the Vice-President of the Executive CounAdelaide cil (Mr Scully) last night. The honorwould able gentleman should cast his mind back to 1930 when certain duties were levied on imported tobacco. The Minister virPollard) tually expressed himself as a dyed-in-themind wool protectionist and ventured the gestion that the only hope for the tobacco industry in Australia was a reversion some form of punitive tariff taxation imported tobacco. I say to the Minister and to the Government that under the.conday. ditions that prevail in Australia today the customs duties required for this purthe pose must necessarily be much higher than they were in 1930-31. I remind House that quite recently the Governgiven ment-perhap s quite willingly-permitte this country to. be handed over to 40-hour week system. In my opinion that is one of the wickedest things that have ever been done to Australian 'industry. It stands to reason that the cost of production of goods manufactured in this country must rise considerably as the result of the shorter working week and the Government, if it thinks at all on these matters, .must recognize that the tariff that will be required, to protect Aushontralian industries functioning on a 40hour week from outside competition of the kind referred to by the Vice-President of the Executive Council last night, will necessarily be much higher than it was in I recall to the honourable mind something that he has probably forgotten, namely, the effect of the 1930 tariff on the sheepskin in necesdustry. We do not want to revert to administration of that kind. The first essential is to grow tobacco on the right country; the second is to. grow tobacco of the right variety; and the third is to grow it in the right way. My experience as a. Minister for Commerce in this country on two occasions, is that if the quality is in the tobacco, there will never be any doubt about selling it at the right price. There is a far too great tendency in the Australian tobacco industry to assume that anything that is grown and called tobacco will find a local market at a price satisfactory to the grower. In relation to production, I raise the imporconsideration of the 40-hour week it because, recently, a prominent gentleman associated with the Labour party said in that shortly the dairy industry have to be converted to a 40-hour week. When that happens, the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr . will find it necessary to turn his to the price of milk, butter and sugcheese. When tobacco plants are first 'put out, they must be watered about five to times a day or even more if the weather on is hot. Then, when the tobacco is being cured, it has to be watched night and W it h a 40-hour week in operation, it stands to reason that the troubles of tobacco industry will only be starting when the proposal to which the comthe mittee is now being asked to agree is effect. Probably when the memberd ship of this Parliament is increased as a it may be before the next elections, we shall find that the Minister for Immigration (Mr Calwell) has sponsored a few immigrant members so-that there wilt be a proper infusion of overseas, interests into the new House. Mr FADDEN >'Drrling Downs Leader of the Austr:;li;-;i Country party) [3.33] - This debate affords me an opportunity to make a. few observations regarding the potentialities of the tobacco industry in Australia. The advantages to be gained are twofold. First, we' would be establishing a very important industry on a sound basis, and, secondly, the production of tobacco in this country would ease our dollar difficulties considerfor ably. Sixteen years ago, in March, 1932, I,personally carried out considerable research into tobacco-growing in Australia and had prepared and printed a. review of the investigations. I was particularly interested in the tobacco industry at that time because of the acute economic conditions then'existing in this country. It will be recalled that during the depression there was considerable unemployment throughout Australia, particularly in Queensland, and I considered that the establishment of the tobacco-growing industry in that State would do much to alleviate the economic strain. statistics that I gathered in the course of my inquiry, are, of Gourse, out of date tq-day, and the conclusions may not have application to existing circumstances. However; I ascertained that only 2 or 3 per cent, of the trade of the largest tobacco companies operating in Australia was in Australian tobacco, and that only between 2 and 3 per cent, of Australian smokers would smoke composite tobacco. Growers then were producing only enough bright leaf to enable the manufacturers to include about 2 i per cent, of Australian tobacco in every pound produced. Mr. G. P. Darnell-Smith, a Doctor of Science and Director of the ' Sydney Botanic Gardens, sajd in 1-932 that Australians were growing tobacco in districts not suited to the production of the type of leaf demanded by Australian manufacturers and consequently by. Australian smokers. Giving evidence before a select committee which had been appointed to investigate the tobacco industry by a government composed of the parties now in Opposition, Mr Darnell-Smith stated that, in she. Mareeba district in northern Queensland, there were large areas of land which appeared to be ideaL for the production of tobacco suited to. Australian requirements. His evidence also indicated that the future of the tobacco industry for the production of light leaf and cigarette tobacco lay north of Bowden, about 2.0 degrees south latitude. An official survey, including examination of the results of test plots, conclusively proved that Queensland was pre-eminently suited to the production of bright leaf tobacco of superior texture, colour and aroma, a type which therewould be fully a 90 per cent, demand in Australia and in other English-speaking countries. Small quantities of tobacco have been grown in Queensland almost since it was established as a colony. In 1894, qver 1,000,000 lb. of cured leaf was produced in Queensland from 900 acres of land. However, after 1896 the industry slowly declined in Queensland and production contracted to an area of less than 100 acres in 1925. After 193Q there was an expansion of cultivation in all States. Production was so increased in Queensland that, in 1944-45, that State produced The about 50 per cent, of the entire Australian crop. The remainder was grown in Western Australia, Victoria and New South Wales. ""Of the 1,300,000 lb. of dried leaf produced in that year off 1,800 acres, 60 per cent, came from the Mareeba district of the Atherton Tablelands. Most of the remainder was grown in the Townsville, Mackay, Bowen and Gladstone districts. As long ago as 1932, I declared that Australia could produce all .the bright leaf tobacco required for home consumption and that, in addition, production eould he ""stepped up so that millions of pounds of this readily marketable type of tobacco would be available for export. Expert tests have proved that light Australian tobacco produced in northern Queensland districts is comparable with the best light Virginian leaf. Had this industry been fostered in northern Queensland, Australia would have been able to save millions of dollars pf expenditure on imported tobacco. We could have built up a splendid Australian industry and also we should have had the chance to establish export markets both in Great Britain and in other English-speaking countries. A thorough investigation of the needs of the industry and proper encouragement of growers even at this stage can be of great value to the nation. The increase of production which did occur after 1933 was due largely to the encouragement given to the industry by the government of the day. That government decided to pay £20,000 annually to assist the States to continue economic and scientific research in the industry. This was of great assistance to the industry. A further grant of £62,500, increased later by £11,250, was allotted by the Commonwealth Government for periodic distribution, . commencing with the year 1939. Then, of course, the inter-vention of war interrupted the plan which had been operating since 1931. This plan did much to develop disease-resisting Tarieties of tobacco. It improved the smoking qualities of Australian leaf and enabled the growers to deal with diseases such as blue mould. However, much still remains to be done. The Australian tobacco-growing industry has never received the encouragement which it has deserved and which it is - entitled to receive in the interests of tralia generally. A superficial survey of ithe industry indicates its potential value. ""The dollar .situation today is most acute. And it will continue to be so even if the position is not aggravated. Consequently, - we should do everything possible to entourage production. of our own requirements within Australia. That is our - responsibility as Australians. I emphasize that Australia can produce sufficient tobacco to meet the needs of Australian smokers in terms of both quantity and - quality. There has been - a great deal of prejudice against Australian leaf and in - many instances that prejudice has been - ill founded. The researches of the Council-for Scientific and Industrial Research and the - evidence submitted at tariff inquiries and to a Royal Commission which sat in 1929 provide adequate proof of my statements - should proof be required. I hope that this - Government will authorize a survey of the industry with a view to its future development. ""We have plenty of idle land that - can be adapted .to tobacco production because, paradoxically, expert opinion is that poor land is most suited to the successful growing of good tobacco. Allthe facilities are at hand for the development of the industry, and present economic conditions, particularly in thelight of the dollar situation, demand that we should do everything possible to expand Australian industries ' and make ourselves independent of imports. The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research should be instructed to carry out a survey of the industry, and to resume the work which it was carrying out until 1932. The industry can be of great value to Australia. It requires a great deal of husbanding and all of the scientific 'assistance that can be given to it. Tobacco growing has been described more than once as scientific gardening. It is hard work; the crops have to - be watered continuously and given constant attention, and expert advice and guidance is required not only during the growing period but also during the treatment and curing of the leaf. I trust that the Government will continue the operation of the scheme decided upon by the Lyons Government, and will make available annual grants for the establishAusment of experimental stations and other scientific facilities, because the industry is destined to be of great .importance to Australia.",23
35,Mr MCEWEN,Unknown,"Indi) [3.46] - When I spoke on this matter yesterday, I emphasized the importance of the tobacco industry to Australia, and referred particularly to the possibilities of increasing production. , I explained that the product-ion of local .tobacco leaf would ease the dollar situation, not only for Australia, but also for the United Kingdom. Whilst I do not regard tobacco as a completely avoidable import, the fact remains that every pound of tobacco which we import diminishes the'pool of dollars available for the purchase of unavoidable imports from, dollar areas.' Furthermore, it draws upon the dollars available in Great Britain, and this is important because now, as always, we rely upon the United Kingdom to make good our dollar deficit Conversely, every pound of local tobacco leaf which we export to the United Kingdom represents a savings, in dollars to that country. Those are obvious facts, and, to me, it seems incumbent upon the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture  Government's policy in regard to the encouragement of Australian tobacco production. The*schedule now before us is more than a mere revenue-producing or protective one. Indeed, it is of a most unusual nature, in that it proposes to fer upon the Minister for Trade and Customs discretionary power to prescribe the proportions of Australian leaf which may be mixed with imported leaf, thereby absolving imported leaf from payment of a high rate of duty. Notwithstanding this, the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture has listened to this protracted debate without attempting to make any statement of policy, and I protest against the attitude he is adopting. I believe that it is his duty to state clearly the policy which the Government intends to follow-if it has any policy-in regard to the stimulation of tobacco production in this country. The Lyons Government, which I supported before I became a member of it, took what I believe to be the most constructive step yet taken in Australia to foster the development of the Australian tobacco industry. The tariff schedule which it devised was no mere, unscientific protective tariff, but was one carefully signed to enlist the active support of manufacturers and importers to stimulate the production of Australian leaf. Indeed, that was the first time in the history of this country that importers of 'a particular commodity were deliberately encouraged to stimulate local production of that commodity. That result was achieved by the' imposition of a variable duty. The honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White), who was then Minister for Trade and Customs, was responsible for the introduction of the legislation, and I pay tribute to him for it. That legislation provided that if cigarettes blended from imported and local tobacco contained 2-J per cent, of the latter, the duty payable on the remaining 97i per cent, of imported leaf was to be subject to a substantial "" drawback"". Similarly, if pipe tobacco blended of imported and. Australian, leaf contained 13 Mr MCEwen. pei cent, of the latter there was to be a considerable rebate in the duty on the imported leaf. This policy not only overcame the difficulty of smokers having to choose between tobacco mixtures containing only imported tobacco and other mixtures containing only Australian leaf, but it was also designed to cultivate a taste for Australian tobacco amongst con- smokers in this country. That intention was quite a proper one. If one were to go to Egypt, Greece, Turkey, Rhodesia, or any other country which grows tobacco in any quantity, one would find that the people of that country appreciate and demand the peculiar flavour of the local product. Therefore, it is only proper that the Australian Government should seek to cultivate a taste for Australian tobacco and its distinctive aroma. The percentages of local leaf permitted to be blended with imported leaf were later increased from 2-J per cent, lo 3 per cent., and from 13 per cent, to 15 per cent., in the case of cigarettes and pipe tobacco respectively. At the time it was announced that as sufficient quantities of Australian leaf became available the statutory minimum percentage of local tobacco would be raised, and no one has ever criticized that policy. The tariff schedule now before the committee does not propose to abandon that policy, but it does propose to alter considerably the de- application of that policy. Although the Minister has not yet spoken, the proposed tariff schedule contains, in itself, an admission that sufficient Australian leaf to meet the statutory minimum percentage is no longer available. Sufficient Australian leaf is not being produced to provide an admixture of 3 per cent., in the case of cigarettes, or 15 per cent.,, in the case of pipe tobacco. Adoption of the proposal before us would authorize the Minister for Trade and Customs to prescribe from time to time the proportion of Australian leaf to be blended with imported leaf. The fact that it is necessary to make such a provision is in itself a serious reflection on some one. The honourable member for Griffith (Mr Conelan) pointed his finger at the farmers, and obviously either the farmers or the Government are responsible for the present decline of production. I shall discuss this aspect of the matter presently, but at the moment I point out that it is a very serious thing for the committee to authorize any Minister to say to importers and manufacturers: "" In my judgment you are entitled to be absolved from the obligation to pay vast sums of money in duby "". And it must be realized .that, the amounts involved will be very large. I have extracted figures showing that in the year .1945-46, in the course of the operation of the law, duty .concessions on cigarettes totalled £592.000. The concessions were made because the manufacturers used 3 per cent, of local leaf. In the same year, duty concessions to manufacturers using the statutory minimum admixture of 15 per cent, of Australian leaf in ' pipe tobacco amounted to £845,000. In that year, in respect of cigarette and pipe tobacco, manufacturers were granted a concession of £1,437,000. The figures for 1946-47 are, for cigarette tobacco. £-910,000, and for pipe tobacco, £1,1.38,000. The total concession to manufacturers in that year was £1,953,000. In those two years duty concessions were approximately £3,500,000, but those concessions are now to - be given on the personal decision of the Minister for Trade and Customs and not in accordance with the specific operation of a statute. We have allowed ourselves to drift into a tion in which we are required to repose in a Minister the power to grant a rebate of £'3,500,000 in two years. I hare no doubt, that that fits in with the policy the Labour party, which seeks to .avoid the specific application of statutes and - centralize authority in officials and in particular Ministers. I protest against the drift that has resulted in this most obnoxious result.",25
36,Mr FULLER,Unknown,Is the honourable member serious ?,27
37,Mr MCEWEN,Unknown,I have no doubt that the honourable member for Hume. (Mr. Fuller) regards this as a joke. It is wrong that a policy with such far-reaching and serious implications should be brought before the Parliament without any explanation being given by the Minister concerned.  I delivered my second-reading speech the honourable member was absent from the chamber.,27
38,Mr MCEWEN,Unknown,"That is not correct. The Minister's speech contained none of "" this information.  game played by-the honourable member.",27
39,Mr MCEWEN,Unknown,"Thes e concessions are to be granted by the Minister principally to one company. It has been pointed out from all sides of the House in debates on tobacco that the British-Australasian Tobacco Company Proprietary Limited produces 90 per cent, of the tobacco manufactured in this country. I do not know whether that figure is correct, but there is no doubt that it produces the great majority. This is the company upon which a former Minister for Commerce and Agriculture made a violent attack last night. It is not a satisfactory state of affairs when a member of the Cabinet makes such an attack in the course of a debate upon legislation de- signed to repose in a Minister personally the right to grant or withhold these vast concessions. The root of the trouble is to be found in the serious decline in the production of tobacco in this country in recent years. It is a crop that is bound to fluctuate from year to year. Production, however, has not only fluctuated but has gone down posion a continuous and unarrested slide. In 1941 tobacco production was rather more than 5,000,000 lb.; in 1942 it was almost 7,000,000 lb.; in 1943 it was of 4,000,000 lb.; in 1944 it was 3,800,000 lb.; in 1945 it was 2,500,000 lb.; and in 1946 to it was 2,400,000 lb. I do not know what the figure will be for this year, but I have no reason to believe it will improve. The explanation of this decrease in production is to be found not in seasonal conditions but in policy. Since 1941 the tobacco-growing industry has been virtually under absolute government control, with the prices to the growers determined positively by the Government. There is not the slightest doubt that a man's decision to accept a certain job or to grow a particular crop is largely determined hy his estimate of the return he will get. From his meagre knowledge of the industry, the honourable member for Griffith (Mr Conelan),. speaking as a supporter of the Government, said last night that the explanation for the decrease was that the farmers turned from the production of tobacco to '.'he raising of other crops. I disagreed with most of what he said, but on that - point he was right. In the exercise of their discretion, the farmers turned to the production of other crops. By its i judged policy of maintaining too low a price for tobacco, the Government is discouraging the production of this crop. It - is one that we need more than tomatoes, maize, beans, peas and the other alternative crops that the farmers grow. It would have saved us dollars; if production had risen instead of falling, a tremendous contribution would have been made to the easing of the acuteness of our present dollar position. I propose to quote figures showing how the Government handled the price factor. A system of appraisal of tobacco leaf was introduced. It was somewhat similar to the system for the appraisal of wool. That was a good decision, and one that I have advocated for years. But the whole success of the appraisal system in respect of its impact upon the volume of production lies in the price level of the table of limits. The Government took 1939 as the base year; .and for the first year to which appraisals were applied, namely, 1941, the table of limits was worked out on the basis of a 25 per cent, increase of the 1939 price. In 1942 there was a further 10 per cent, increase upon the previous year's table of limits, which was the base year plus 25 per cent. In 1943 there was an additional 10 per cent, on the base year; and in 1944 there was the same figure as in 1943 plus a 10 per cent, subsidy. In 1946 there was the same figure as in 1943, again plus a 10 per cent, subsidy; and in 1946 10 per cent, was added to the total of the previous year's actual table of limits. For 1947 there was a 13 per cent! increase on the figure for the previous year. In view of those figures, honourable members and listeners may be inclined to ask what one is moaning about, because those figures seem to present a continuous upward curve in the price which ought to provide an adequate incentive to production. This magnificent and .continuing increase of price will be more readily understood when I quote from the corresponding table of indices. Taking 1939 as the base year - Mr MCEwen. .with a base index figure of 100, we find that the fixed price on the table of limits in respect of subsequent years expressed in terms of index figures was as follows: 1941, 125; 1942, 137.5; 1943, 150; 1944, l l - 150; 1945, 150; 1946, 165; 1947, 187.5. Those figures sound all right but let us see how they actually worked out in money to the farmer. In 1941, the first year of appraisal, the average return to the farmer was 29.06d. per lb. In the next 'year, after receiving a 10 per cent, increase, the farmer received 29.94d. per lb. The next year, when he was receiving ani'other I'O per cent, increase, his return - was 30.86d. per lb.; and the next year,, when he was still receiving an increase of '10 per cent., and when the index figurewas 150, h'is return was 2S.'87d. per lb.. In theory, he was receiving 50 per cent.. more for his tobacco; but, in fact, hisre'turn was a half-penny per lb. less than he received in 1941. In 1945, when the index figure was still 150, or an 'increase - of 5'0 per cent, on the base year, his return was 27.07d. per lb. or 2d. per lb. less than he received in 1941. Mr BOLLARD:-Plu s a 10 per cent., subsidy.",27
40,Mr MCEWEN,Unknown,"Yes ; and that wouldl r return hirn another 2Jd. per lb. In 1946,. when no subsidy was paid, and when theindex figure had risen to 165, he received,, despite the increase of 65 per cent, in theindex figure, only 3d', per lb. more than, he received in 1941. Having regard to. the. increase of the index figure by 65 percent, on an original price of 29d. per lb.,, an increase of 65 per cent, on the base year index, at a quick glance, would represent an increase of 20d. per lb., but, in fact, the farmers received only 3d. .per lb. more. .. Mi'. POLLARD - The honourable memberis assuaning that the leaf is always of the same quality.",28
41,Mr MCEWEN,Unknown,"I am pointing out what the farmer actually received; and it is the money which the farmer receives that determines whether he will go on growing tobacco. That is the only factorthat counts in this matter. ' Mi . POLLARD - On the quality of 'the 1 leaf produced at Myrtleford this year, does the honourable member suggest that the table of limits would return to thegrower the price which the honourable member thinks it: should' return, to him:? Mr MGEWEN"" - There will be no crop at Myrtleford this, year: Departmental 1 officers informed me that their latestestimate was that there would be 30' tonsof tobaccoat Myrtleford, but two weeks ago 3' inches of rainfell in that' district, and consequently, if I know anything about the industry at all, J_ know that therewill be no crop at all in that area. 'That fact emphasizes the precariousness-of' the industry and should make the Government realise that it mustnot shave the return to thegrower to the last penny. Periodically, growersexperience adverse weathei"" conditions, or the depredationof»' pests and diseasessuch as blue mould'. In respectpf the last year,, 1947, when there was another increase-of 13 - per cent., bringing theindex figure to 1'87.5, T a-mihformd' that' the anticipated overall return to the' growerwill' only be between 35d. and 89k per-lb. T say to the committee and to the country,, here is an - a.ctual' example of - the operation of price control applied' to an. industry and, having the effect of d'estroying it. Price control' has. damned this, .industry. Curing the last seven years, the Government has exercised all the powers with respect to the tobacco industry that it now seeks to apply to every industry in this country if the prices referendum be carried. In, respect of the tobacco industry, it has exercised uninhibited powers and it has destroyed the industry, and has thus helped,to put this, country "" in the cart"" with respect to our, dollar problem; but not satisfied with its ineptitude in applying price control to one industry, it now seeks to apply price control to all industries. An examination of the control exercised by this Government over the tobacco induatry reveals a sorry state of affairs. I challenge honourable members to mention any other industry that has thus been brought to its knees during the term of office of this Government when it has been armed with every control and authority it could imaginably possess. It. is the duty of the Minister to stand up and tell the committee what is the policy of the Government with respect to stimulating the production of tobacco in Australia. I'n a country which has. not. yet beencompletely socialized, no. gp.vesnment wall everattain satisfactory production in any industry unless it giv.es * sufficieat incentive.' f'0 producers byrecognizing the - profit motive. I believe that the experienceaf the tobacco industry ought to be a guide to the people of this country when they ar.e' asked to place every otherindustry completely within the clutchesof. this Government.  for Commerce and Agriculture) [4.14]. -.The problem of tobacco production in Australia should be approached in a non-party impartial spirit. The honourable member for Indi' (Mr MCEwen), of course, is incapable of approaching any subject in that spirit. After all, I do not suppose there is any form of agricultural"" production in Australia which presents to. the producer a. more complex set of problems than. does, tobacco production.. My mind goes, back nearly twenty, years, to the problems of tobacco production in Victoria, when,, in the. Ovens Valley, in, the very electorate-that the honourable member for Indi. now represents, a, vast expansion, of tobacco production was taking place. That expansion occurred largely as the direct outcome of the incentive given to the industry, by the Scullin Labour Government. It is. true-and 1 want to. be. perfectly fair-that that incentive-was s.o. great that it stimulated the formation of bogus companies, or., to say the least, companies with little substance and little knowledge of the propositions that they were 'embarking upon. It' encouragedin. theind-ustry people with neither the production nor thetechnical knowledge required in such, a difficult industry;, but, at least, itdid bring forward vastly increased! production both there and; in other parts of Australia. It is true that for a period in the 'thirties, there was again some degree of expansion of production. But always, in certain circumstances, this industry has taken, from time to. time, a serious backward step. It is useless any one in the Parliament or anywhere else trying to tell me that that nan be. attributed to the Government.. The fact is that here is a combination, of factors, not the least of which is that the highly specialized nature of industry requires, in its very essence, people who engage in tobacco production must be qualified for that type of work. Lots of people engage in tasks for which they are not qualified. One could illusconcerned. trate that point by the example of the honourable member for Indi who has entered a particular occupation, - to wit, membership of this Parliagrowers ment. He is not really qualified for job, but, at lea.3t, he does some sort of But if a person goes into tobacco producstanding tion without that great g if t of being fied for it , there is no hope for him. problems confront the industry-pro blems of soil character, water application, insect infestation, and the fact that there is practically only one buyer, one great company. No Australian government has, as far as I know, the power to force that company to buy at a specific figure. In addition to those problems, there is the prejudice of the Australian smoker against Australian tobacco. I believe that the prejudice is rapidly disappearing and that, in due course, when production increases, the Australian smoker will smoke Australian tobacco as avidly as he combination smokes the imported today. Let us be fair. We know that in 1929, 1930 .or thereabouts the evidence given before commission into the tobacco industry a man in a high technical position in tralia-and the evidence is on recordwas that tobacco grown in Australia in proximity to eucalypt plantations or eucalypts growing naturally would be tainted with the eucalyptus. He was an employee of the British-Australasian Tobacco Company Proprietary Limited or any other tobacco interest, and, probability, he really believed that statement was factual. But every knows that the statement was absurd. I has been mentioned during the debate i this chamber. It would be as stupid to coloured leaf. say that cabbages grown near eucalypts would be tainted. The fact is that in Australia the tobacco-grower has one purchaser, and whatever the Government does, short of compelling that purchaser to buy at a specific price, the growers main in a difficult position. In addition, the marketing situation is precarious. During the war, as the honourable member for Indi has said, the Go the vernment established a Tobacco Marketthat ing Board under National Security Regulations. On that board were representatives of the tobacco-growers themselves and representatives of the other interests Tables of limits were set up. Appraisal authorities were established and with the appraisal authorities alwayswent a representative of the tobaccoand two observers. It has been the well said-and there is a considerablejob. amount of truth in it-that , notwiththat the Government from timequalito time, for the period of the operation, Great of that board, increased tobacco prices by about 50 per cent., the increase to thegrower was not very great. The fact remains that the observers representing theTobacco Growers Association, so far as I know, have not lodged one protest or suggested the appraiser did not appraise thetobacco correctly. One would naturally expect protests to be lodged with the Government by the growers' representative'or the observers if the 1 appraisersnefariously did not grade and appraiseleaf as it should' have been. Owing to a of circumstances, thequality of the leaf did not keep pace with the increased prices set down in thea table of limits. They included the entry by of inexperienced people into the indusAustries, climatic conditions, insect infestation, shortage of materials and shortageof insecticides. I cannot be dogmatic, but I can say that the fact that, as far as I know, no protest was ever made, indicatesnot that that is the unfortunate position today. In m y room I have samples of Australian tobacco leaf taken from thei n all stocks held in one of the tobacco his appraisal centres recently. Honourable one members are welcome to inspect them. t Among them is tobacco leaf that realizes n 3s. 6d. per lb - It isbeautiful, lemon",28
42,Mr BLAIIT,Unknown,Fro m the north?  member for the Northern Territory (Mr . Blain) is not an expert but he has some reknowledge of tobacco-growing.,30
43,Mr BLAIN,Unknown,"I grow it .  brought 6d. per lb. I cannot claim +,o be an expert either, but tolook at the tobacco leaf that wassold 1 at 6d. per lb.,- one would say - that - at one stage it must have sbown promise - of maturing as a beautiful lemon-eolouroc] leaf. To me, it looks as though it was picked immature or placed in an inefficient drying kiln. Anyway, it did not result as a high-class leaf. Also .amongst the samples are samples of leaf for which no price was offered because of its inferior quality owing to poor kiln-drying, picking or some other cause. Those are problems that cannot be overcome solely by the price factor. The people in the industry must know how to engage in it . Science must be applied to it. Shortages of material and labour for irrigation, which is required particularly in Queensland, must be overcome. It is said by investigators that irrigation is essential in Queensland. In addition, further research work is essential by the State authorities and the Council for 'Scientific and Industrial Research. That work is going on all the time. The problem finally in regard to prices is one that - c:ir.nct be overcome, despite what the honourable member for Indi says, unless he is prepared to accept the responsibility - of saying to the people who are almost .the sole purchasing authority, "" You have to take this leaf into your factory and pay so much per lb. for it "" . Of course, the honourable member - would describe that as an illustration of bureaucratic control and interference with the liberty of the subject, and another example of the activities of a socialist government in this country. I ask the honourable member to state whether he is prepared to support - a proposal to force the company to pay a certain price for the leaf, whether it considers the leaf is worth that amount or not, and to compel the company to take into the factory for manufacture into cigarette or pipe tobacco a type of leaf which it considers does not measure up to its requirements.",30
44,Mr MCEWEN,Unknown,"I have never suggested it, but the Minister is now doing so.",31
45,Mr SCULLY,Unknown,The honourable member - did suggest it .,31
46,Mr MCEWEN,Unknown,"I did not.  ment is doing is to continue the policy - of the Government of which the honourable member for Indi was a member, of allowing tobacco to be imported at a reduced rate of duty in accordance with the proportion of Australian leaf which is incorporated in it for smoking .in Australia. The honourable member claimed that the administration of which he was a member introduced that policy. We are continuing it, and are making provision, unfortunately because of decreased production, for a smaller quantity of Australian leaf to be used with the imported leaf', and the company will have the right to enjoy a lower rate of duty.",31
47,Mr WHITE,Unknown,"What provision has been made for research into tobacco-growing?  for research in the vote for the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. We are not now dealing with research, or the Council for ""Scientific and Industrial Research. However, I assure the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr . White) that since I have been Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, I have been keenly desirous of advancing the welfare of the tobacco-growing industry in Australia.",31
48,Mr SCULLY,Unknown,More money is now expended in a month than was expended in a year on the industry when the honourable member for Balaclava was Minister for Trade and Customs.,31
49,Mr WHITE,Unknown,"I merely asked whether provision had been made for research into tobacco-growing.  matter is the responsibility of the State epartments of Agriculture. The Australian Government should and does become involved to any degree only in the matter of research, and this work is undertaken by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. We co-operate with the State Departments of A g r i c u lture, and assist them in every possible way. I now desire to speak briefly on another aspect. During World War II . , the Government established the Tobacco Marketing Board on which various in terests concerned in the industry were represented. The Government considered that if we are to ensure to the tobacco growers in Australia at least some competition and some rights under an appraisal scheme, it is - essential to continue in the post-war period some form of co-ordinated Coimnoiiwealth-Statc marketing control. With that .object in view, the Commonwealth representatives at the meetings of the Australian Agricultural Council in July, 1947, submitted to the State Ministers for Agriculture the proposition that the States should cooperate in such a plan. They expressed their concurrence with the proposal, and the Australian Government thereupon decided that, the States having indicated their willingness to co-operate in such a plan to continue appraisal and Commonwealth marketing, it would introduce the necessary legislation, provided the State Governments brought down similar legislation. At a meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council last week, the Victorian Minister for Agriculture indicated that his State was not interested. In those circumstances, Commonwealth marketing cannot be continued. The result will be that tobacco-growers in Victoria will market their leaf as a separate entity, and tobacco-growers in Queensland will market their leaf as. a separate entity. There will also be a division of appraisal authorities. Indeed, the Commonwealth appraisal authority will cease to exist.",31
50,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown,"-When , will happen?  season. Unfortunately, there may be several marketing authorities, and only one buying authority. That situation may lead to a differentiation in price systems in the'two States, with substantial ultimate disadvantages to the tobacco growers of Australia. Any hope that one might have of dealing with any sinister practices,, as they have been termed, can be realized only through a co-ordinated all-powerful marketing authority, having the blessing and .legislative assistance of the respective State parliaments. Unfortunately, that will not be possible. I can only hope and pray that matters will turn out all right, but I have grave fears indeed about the ultimate result. Reference has been made to sinister influences in the industry. I believe that we should say .less about sinister influences, and get down'to facts. After all, sinister influences do not count very much if one produces a first-class leaf. Where a first-class product is available, the protection afforded by the tariff should, in itself, result in the purchasing authority at least endeavouring to "" play the game "", I know that, in the past, it has not been in the interests of buying companies to encourage Australian production, but I am' extremely doubtful if today they are deliberately standing in the way of increased tobacco production in Australia. If the Australian tobacco-grower, aided by scientific research and adequate marketing facilities, produces a quality leaf, the buying authority can be brought to a sense of realism, and will face up to its responsibility, provided always that some body is vested with a residual power to deal with it, should it not face up to its responsibility. >",32
51,Mr RAJSKJN,Unknown,"The purchasers have put whole districts out of the industry.  out that the Commonwealth tobacco marketing authority, because of the objections of Victoria, is virtually dead. If we are to have several States marketing tobacco and only, one buying authority, they all might be put out of the industry, but I do not believe that will happen. In my opinion, we must concentrate on helpthat ing the tobacco-grower, particularly with scientific advice, and ensure that, wherever possible, suitable persons engage in tobacco culture. At present, the Bureau of Agricultural Economics section of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture has under consideration proposals for tobacco-growing in Northern Queensland. I consider that there is scope in the tobacco industry for the .right class of ex-serviceman, contiguous to people who have a lifetime of experience of the industry. Making allowances for all the war-time disabilities, the Government has always demonstrated its earnest desire to assist this industry. We shall continue to do so, and anything within reason that we can do to increase the production and quality of tobacco in Australia, we shall certainly do. The following premium system has been adopted for the 1948 crop, on the basic value of the leaf. The prices quoted in the table of limits, without the percentage addition, are as follows: If the basic value of the leaf is 27d. per lb. and over, a premium of 9d. per-lb. will be paid. If the basic value of the leaf is from 18d. to 26d. per lb., a premium of 6d. per lb. will be paid. If the basic value of the leaf is from 15d. to I7d. per lb., a premium of 3d. per lb. will be paid. If - the basic value of the 'leaf is 'less Khan 15d. per lb., no 'premium, will be paid. It is useless to - pay a premium on .tobacco leaf which does not measure up - to the required standards of quality, and encourage 'additional production of that type of leaf. Last night, the honourable member for Balaclava made a remark about the Government paying 4.^ per cent, rebate to the company on .account of increased prices of tobacco. 'The ""fact is that no preferential treatment has 'been shown by this 'Government to 'the British-Australasian Tobacco '""Company Proprietary Limited 'The 4£ per cent, 'which 'was paid ,to the British-Australasian Tobacco Company Proprietary Limited was a rebate paid to an importing 'company, just as it is paid to - other importing companies, in - order'to keep down the price of a particular product to the Australian consuming public,. anfl is in accordance - with the economic regulations which the Government .promulgated in 1943. Any snide 'suggestion 'by the 'honourable'member that the-Government showed preferential - treatment - to the British-Australasian Tobacco 'Company Proprietary Limited, as such, (vi.U - not bear examination.",32
52,Mr WHITE,Unknown,"I did not make that allegation, and the Minister is .perfectly aware of it. I replied to an attack .by the Vice-President of the Executive Council (Mr Scully) on the company, and pointed out that the Government had treated it in that way.  tway as .other .importing - companies were treated. Mr AttlTH'OMT (Richmond) [4 -35] The Minister for Commerce and Agricul - members an illuminating account of the' tobacco industry, and its trials and tribulations. As one who had some experience of the industry in the early years of World War II . , I sympathise - with his ^admanistrative difficulties. He 'has confessed that in spite of everything that the Government has attempted, and the nirgent need for the production of tobacco in this country to conserve dollars, tobacco-growing has declined rapidly. According to figures given by the honourable ' .member for Indi (Mr MeEwen), seven years ago, in 1941-42, approximately 2.000,000 lb. of tobacco Was produced; today production is a mere trickle. That is conclusive proof, of proof be required, - of a reg.rettaole failure somewhere, and - if the Minister does not know where the failure has occurred or what can be done - to prevent its recurrence, the industry - faces complete extinction.' As the honor.Mfi - member for Indi has pointed out, in.ountive is an important factor. It is im'pontant in every trade and occupation. As one who has had some experience of igrc.ving various .primary products, I - appreciate that unless there is incentive - am-expectanc y not merely.of a marginal profit but of a handsome profit-grower s .will not continue their activities. I say that itbere must be a handsome profit heeause -.such a profit is - required, in some years at least, to offset losses in adverse rseasons. All .primary producers are faeed with the possibility of extremely lew incomes or evenflossesin some seasons .and they depend .upon their ""bumper"" - crops ito carry .them over -.those periods. When :an organization such as the .British^Austra-lasia-n To'bacco Company ""Proprietary Limited endeavours to reduce .prices to what it considers will provide a ueasonable profit margin in the year of production only, it is.contributing to the ultimate extinction of the industry, because growers will have no reserves to tide them over less prosperous years. Profit should be averaged over a number of years. In my electorate in the northern part of New South Wales tobacco-growing has practically ceased although a considerable - volume was produced in years gone by. L i the Tenterfield district, and along the Queensland border, can be seen disused toba.cco kilns' by the score. Former tobacco-growers-are no longer interested in the industry and have turned to some other form of primary production. They were beaten not only by unremUnerative returns for their leaf, but also by disease, insect pests, and adverse seasonal conditions. I have no doubt, however, that with the incentive of profitable prices, there would be a drift back from other industries-perhaps less important industries-to tobacco-growing. As the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture has said, tobacco production is a .highly-skilled and specialized industry. It is also a tedious industry and few Australians have had the patience to .stick to it. In areas adjacent to my - own district the industry is almost entirely in the hands of Italians. I do not intend to disparage these people in any way, but they are the only ones who are prepared to spend many hours, day and night, planting out the roots, watering, .spraying to prevent diseases and to combat insect pests and attending the drying 'kilns. Australians .certainly will not tackle this industry today when they can find much more remunerative occupations - elsewhere. Another thing that is stifling tobacco-growing, and the Minister has rightly put his finger on this point, is - the scarcity of labour. In every country - district of Australia today. it is almost impossible to find farm employees. The problem is not always the wages that are offered. Men just will not go into the country districts. They compare - country working conditions with those in more lucrative industries in the cities. They realise that by remaining in the metropolitan areas they can enjoy a 40hour week, receive higher wages, and have more opportunities for sport and recreation, so why should they go into bush? The drift from rural areas to the - cities is unchecked. Recently .1 visited many parts of the Commonwealth and - everywhere the farmers told me the same story. At Mildura, in' the electorate of the' honourable member for Wimmer'a. (Mr Turnbull), fruit-growers said that they' did not know how they were going to harvest their crops. In the past, they had been getting all kinds of. casual employees but this source of labour was drying up. Many casual fruit-pickers had come to the conclusion that the little extra they received after paying taxes was not worth the effort, and they were no longer 'interested in temporary jobs. Similar conditions exist in the sugar injur. Anthoiiy, I'ustry, as honourable members representing cane-growing districts will testify.",33
53,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Mr Olark) Order! The honourable .member must confine his remarks to the items now before the committee..,34
54,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown,"I am showing that what is happening in the tobacco industry today is characteristic of the conditions obtaining in other primary industries. The point I am making is that unless the Government takes steps to ensure that primary producers shall receive adequate returns for their labour, there will be a continued drift to other avenues of employment. It is all very well to say that tobacco-growers should offer higher wages to attract labour; but how can they pay higher wages unless their returns are sufficient to enable them to do so? ""Wages depend entirely upon the price that can be realized for the tobacco leaf. I agree with the Minister that a premium .should be paid for first-grade leaf. It is no use this country growing ten times .the quantity of tobacco that we are now producing if it is to be of a quality not acceptable to Australian smokers. When all is said and done, the man who smokes the-tobacco is the arbiter. He determines whether he will smoke Australian leaf or whether he will pay a fancy price for imported tobacco, as he is doing today in the main. Therefore, I welcome the encouragement that has been' given to growers by providing for a premium price for superior leaf. In fact, I the suggest that consideration be given to' increasing the margin payable for better grade tobacco, because the production of such leaf is considerably more difficult and more expensive than the production of lower grades. More art and more careful attention in the drying and other processes are required to produce high quality leaf, and the product is certainly worth much more than poor leaf. I view with concern the far-reaching powers possessed, by the Minister for Trade and Customs to fix the amounts payable to 'the tobacco companies under certain conditions. As 1 the honourable member for Indi (Mr. MCEwen) pointed out, he has the disposal of £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 under his personal control and subject to his personal favour. We have learned in this country that too many safeguards cannot he imposed upon the authority of Ministers to. exercise patronage through their departments. I hope that this provision which I have mentioned will be abolished. It was introduced into the legislation about the end of 1946, and I do not know to what extent the power has been exercised up to date. It would be interesting to have a statement from the Minister on that subject. While the Minister has power to distribute bonuses, or whatever one might like to call them, amounting to millions of pounds, there is a possibility of things happening of which we have seen and heard more than enough in the last few weeks. I hope that the Minister will be more successful in stimulating tobacco production in Australia in future than he has been in the past, because unless something is done soon we shall not have much Australian tobacco to worry about at all.",34
55,Mr HARRISON,Unknown,"Wentworth) [4.48]. - I have listened with a great deal of input terest throughout this debate to what honourable members on this side of the bring that about. chamber have said in their endeavour to get a clear-cut statement of policy from ber's figure is incorrect. the Government relative to the tobacco industry. I cannot blame the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture (Mr . Pollard) for not being in a position to make a statement of policy, because he is not the Minister responsible for the velopment of this industry.",35
56,Mr MCEWEN,Unknown,Yes he is.,35
57,Mr HARRISON,Unknown,"He is responsible . industry. only in part. He cannot make 'a pronouncement of government policy on the subject without securing some idea that policy from the Minister for Trade and Customs (Senator Courtice). Obthat viously there has been no liaison between the two Ministers. The Minister for have Commerce and Agriculture devoted some time to replying to the observations honourable members on this side of the chamber. What did we hear? We only a violent barrage of words which contained no statement of the Government's policy regarding the tobacco mechanization. industry. The honourable gentleman relied almost exclusively upon the tariff schedule. I think that, with a few excepalmost tions, the same duties as operated on the21st November, 1940, still operate. However, the Minister for Trade and Customs is given a certain over-riding power with regard,to the use of available Australian tobacco leaf. We on this side of the chamber are concernedwith making available the maximum quantity of good quality Australian leaf. All that the Minister for Trade and Customs seems to be concerned about is* a gradual reduction of the percentage of Australian leaf used in manufactured tobacco under the power granted to him. We want a clear statement of government policy. When the Opposition parties were in the happy position now occupied by the Government, we had a policy for the expansion of the tobacco industry. That policy resulted in widespread development of the industry within Australia. I well remember that, when the Lyons Government was in power, the production of tobacco leaf in Australiaamounted to 12,000,000 lb. annually. To-day, the outis approximately 2,800,000 lb. - annually. Something has happened to  Production amounts to about 4,000,000 lb. annually.",35
58,Mr HARRISON,Unknown,"The Minister ought to blush in correcting me, considering the figure he has stated in comparison with production when I was a member deof the Lyons Government. In those days, the Government had a constructive policy for the extension of the tobacco We should not allow ourselves to be deluded about this industry. From the of observations of Ministers and their colleagues, one might, gather the impression a. farmer can grow tobacco anywhere. Of course that is not so. A farmer must the right soil, the right rainfall, and the right' climatic conditions before he of can produce good quality tobacco leaf. Furthermore, the industry does not lend heard itself to mechanization. ",35
59,Mr HARRISON,Unknown,"The processes involved in curing tobacco leaf depend exclusively upon manual labour. Therefore, it is in the main what .one might term a peasant industry. That is why, as the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Anthony) pointed out, the industry is being gradually taken over by aliens who are accustomed to lower standards of living than Australians. These immigrants are taking over the industry because it cannot be developed under present conditions on. a basis that will give the farmer a return per acre comparable with that which .he can obtain from other crops which are more cheerfully looked upon by the present Government. This committee, will soon be considering another part of the schedule dealing with our trade agreement with Rhodesia. This contains some reference to tobacco, and honourable members will find that Australia has made an arrangement .with Rhodesia for the acceptance of Rhodesian tobacco. That arrangement was made at a time when there was a flush period of tobacco production in this country. I wonder what will be the ultimate result if we continue to develop trade agreements of this nature to the detriment of our own tobacco^growers. Although I was the Minister who negotiated that trade agreement with Rhodesia, I say that we should examine the agreement again in the light of the present situation of the Australian tobacco industry, which seems to be fading out of existence. It seems to me to be ""going down the wind "" because of the failure of the Government to encourage an industry which should mean so much to Australia at this time of dollar restrictions.  wind "" when the honourable member was Minister for Trade and Customs ",35
60,Mr HARRISON,Unknown,"But it was pretty flush in production at that time. The encouragement given to - manufacturers and importers to utilize increasing, quantities of Australian leaf by means of the ""drawback"" provision in the duty payable on imported leaf which had been blended with a sufficient percentage of local leaf, did increase the production of Australian leaf.' The industry has had . its ups. and downs, and the application of an artificial stimulus to Australian production did result in Australian tobacco gaining a bad name because vast quantities of inferior leaf were foisted upon the Australian - smoking public. I realise also that large sums of money were spent to establish the industry in this country, and ihat the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research made energetic and protracted efforts to combat the various diseases and pests which beset Australian tobacco crops, and I appreciate the splendid job done by that hody. The fact remains, however, that tobacco growing is an industry of fluctuating fortunes. If things had gone light with the industry it.might. at this time of acute shortage of dollars, have been of untold value to our national economy. Nevertheless, one cannot overlook the fact that 'because of the short-sightedness of the Government, and of the Minister .for  in particular, the industry has received no assistance, and that is largely responsible for its present condition. The treatment . meted out to the tobacco industry by the Government is in line with its attitude towards many rural industries.",36
61,Mr ADERMANN,Unknown,"Maranoa) [4.56] The further contribution which I desire to make to the debate is to bring to the attention of the committee a telegram which I have received from Mr Shorten, president cf the Southern Queensland Tobacco Growers Association, who telegraphed me after he had listened to a broadcast of the debate last night. He states that the first mOve which the Government should make is to ""improve marketing so as to assure growers' full commercial value for leaf produced "". 1 was most interested to hear the speech of the the Minister for Commerce and Agricul problems and difficulties confronting the Government in regard to this industry. However, the Minister says we have no light to use' the term "" sinister"". as applied topurchases. Mr Shorten does not employ that term, and I hesitate to use it. However, I am satisfied that growers have good reason to be dissatisfied with the methods' of marketing which have obtained in', the industry. The first sales of tobacco crops* in any season, invariably realise the best prices. It is said that the majorcomp'any buying for - all. manufacturers pays the better price, until the. demand's of the smaller manufacturers are met, when the prices have fallen. That happens year, after year-, and although growers have in many years held back samples of* the first part of' their crop sold fop purposes of' comparison with the latter part, the large companies, invariably allege that the tobacco, which they purchase is of inferior quality to. that sold earlier, arguingthat, in consequence, they are entitled to p.ur-. chase it at. a lower price. When things like that happen year after, year they cannot be due to mere coineidertce, and this is an injustice suffered by growers to which I have drawn attention many times previously. Before any otheraction is taken to improve the lot of tobacco growers that is something, which should be remedied. Mr Shorten then urges tjie payment of ""government assistance to solve production problems "". I do not know exactly what he had in mind, but frorn the latter part of his telegram I assume he means the payment of financial assistance for the purpose of combating disease and pests. Like many gphers, f believed that mould, the principal disease to which tobacco crops' grown in this country ar,e susceptible, could be overcome by spraying with ljenzo'1, but evidently that is not sp.

I disagree with that contention, because if it is capable of being mechanized at all, it could be mechanized only to a limited degree. I cannot imagine how a machine could be utilized to pick grubs off tobacco plants every morning, or to gather leaves as they mature. An entire tobacco crop is not harvested at one time, the operation is progressive. Difficulties, would present themselves to the use of machinery in several cultural operations. If this, try is to succeed we must be prepared to supply labour. I rose to put before the committee the point of view of the growers, who say unanimously that their proposals provide the solution of the main difficulties. Unless a price is given that will encourage growers to produce-no t a borderline price-w e shall never get the production that is needed.",36
62,Mr BLAIN,Unknown,"Northern Territory) [5.6] - I spoke last night upon this important industry as it affects Australia. J was surprised to hear the Minister make the best speech for the monopolist that I have ever heard from, a member of a so-called democratic Government. He probably spoke as he did because of his ignorance of the real position, but nevertheless his speech was merely a defence of the monopolist. He concluded his wandering remarks by saying, in effect, that if the quality is good the price will be right. That means the price paid by the manufacturers, hut I do not trust them any more than anyone else does on this side of the committee. The Government is throwing this industry into the hands of a foreign element. Only certain types of persons will be able to make a success of tobacco-growing in Australia and they are the people accustomed to a lower standard of living than Australians, such as Yugoslavs and others from south-eastern Europe. Some fifteen years ago the Canadians fought to save their agricultural industry and to prevent their standard of living being lowered by reason of an influx of immigrants accustomed to a lower standard than 'themselves. The same position is now arising in Australia. Honourable members on this side of the chamber want a prosperous yeomanry and not the indigent peasantry that this Government is sponsoring by its actions. It is probable that the Minister made his defence of the monopolist, as it was in effect, because he had not taken the trouble to ascertain the technique of tobacco-growing. Other honourable members have referred to it and to the patience that is required, but only in passing. I have grown tobacco from a seed bed. We used to cut whole stalks down, put two across a pole and carry them into a tobacco - shed. That was the procedure 30 years ago, but the technique now reindusquires the use of kilns. To meet the present requirements of the cigarette market, the tobacco leaf has to be stripped periodically, in other words, it is necessary to adopt the technique of the Hollanders in countries like Sumatra. Honourable members opposite would be enlightened if they visited that country and talked to the people who are making a success of tobacco-growing there. I do not wonder that the Hollanders are fighting the barbarians for their rights and for the return of their plantations. When tobacco-growing land there has bean used for five years, it is spelled and not used again for ten years. The private companies of the Hollanders, have research organizations continuously at work, but in Australia the policy is haphazard and go-as-you-please, despite the fact that we have established the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. I do not know of one government experimental farm that is assisting the growers here in the same way as the private research organizations in Sumatra and Malaya are helping growers there. The tobacco leaf grown in eastern Sumatra is produced essentially for cigar coverings and is so assiduously culled that much of it is destroyed. I was reliably informed by a Hollander that there are about 30 different classifications of leaf. There are some for length, some for colour and others for flavour width and so on. If we are to put the industry on a proper basis in Australia and to have a prosperous yeomanry rather than an indigent peasantry, the price of tobacco leaf to the grower must be guaranteed by the Government. It is useless for the Minister to. run away from the problemand to say that if the colour or the quality is right the price will be right. He criti : cized the honourable member for Balaclava (Mr White) forusing the ""word "" sinister"".' I say there is a sinister synchronization .of circurnstances in this matter. Surely that is so if the tobacco companies are to dictate the price and appoint their own appraisers. In this situation, the Minister should not take objection to the word, bad as it and loath as I am to use it . The Comhonorable monwealth Government must premiums or prizes for the superior quality tobacco so that the super-grower biggest may be rewarded. Despite the difficult Victoria. technique of tobacco-growing, there are still many Australians who are highly qualified for the task. The second-class lands in the.far north, despised by many people, will come into their own as suitsion, able areas for the growing of cotton and tobacco if the grower is guaranteed fair price for his product. I ask the vernment to see to it that 3s. 6d. per will not be regarded as the highest price for first-class leaf. At 5s. per lb., good class leaf will be produced.",38

64,Mr WHITE,Unknown,"Balaclava) [8.0] - Prio r to the suspension of the sitting, the mittee was discussing the question of verting to the pre-war duty upon tobacco. The Minister for Commerce and A g r i  the honourable member for Indi (Mr MCEwen), exhibited considerable pique, fact I was sorry to note because he was not a member of the Parliament business when this industry was established. Concountry. sequently, I am afraid that he based remarks upon wrong assumptions. I afraid that his predecessor in office, Vice-President of the Executive Council (Mr Scully), who has spoken in this debate as though he had a monopoly manufacture. of. knowledge of the industry, has misled him. The Minister should appreciate the fact that honourable members on this side of the chamber have actually grown tobacco, whilst others have discharged responsithat bilities of administration in respect industry. I am sure that, as an enthusidepartmental astic Minister, he is avid for the latest ideas concerning theindustry, because tobacco culture offers a means to this country of earning dollars. Faced, as we are at present, with a dollar strinproduced gency, that aspect should considerably agitate the Minister's mind. However, as I have said, the Minister exhibited considerable pique when replying to the honourable member for Indi , whereas he would have acted with . more wisdom had he .thanked the honourable member for his is, very thoughtful speech. Obviously, the member for Indi is an authogive rity on the industry. H is electorate includes the Ovens Valley, which is the tobacco-growing district in . The Minister would be well-advised to study the facts of the case. He admitted that a previous Labour administration made a blunder when, during the depresit placed a crude and fantastic duty upon !ohacco, with the result that specua lators found it easy to "" p a l m of f "" Goland upon which they persuaded settle™ lb. to grow tobacco. Those persons found that they could not make tobacco-growthe ing pay. As the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Blain ) emphasized, quality is most important. If , tobacco leaf of the proper grade is grown it can be sold, but it is impossible comto dispose of cabbage-leaf varieties. reOnly suitable land should be used for the production of tobacco leaf. Coarse and - dark varieties cannot be forced upon conHonorable members opposite . have thrown many stones at the Britisha Australasian Tobacco Company. It is true that that company does the hulk of the in the handling of tobacco in this However, it is equally-true that his the 'company operates with the highest am efficiency. The Government in which the I was Minister for Trade and Customs provided for the blending of an increasing percentage of Australian leaf in local During my term as Minister, I dealt with the very complaint voiced by the Vice-President of the several Executive Council when he complained that tobacco grown today in the Tamworth district could not be sold. I had complaint investigated, not by repreof the sentatives of any company, but by officers, who reported that growers in that district were attempting to produce tobacco leaf on soil which was utterly unsuitable. However, since those: days the general quality of Australianleaf has improved.

Items' agreed to. Item 180 agreed to. DIVISION 7 - OILS , PAINTS AND VARNISHES. Item ,229 (Petroleum and shale products)",39
65,Mr JAMES,Unknown,"Hunter) [8.10] - This is a comprehensive item covering naphtha, benzine, benzoline, gasoline, pentane, petrol and any other petroleum or shale spirit. I believe that the reduction of duty is not sufficient to encourage the project of the National Oil Proprietary Limited at Glen Davis. I have had considerable experience of that project, not only in my present position as a liaison between the mining unions and the Government but also as chairman of the Public Works Committee when it inquired into the project from 1943 to 1945, and even farther back than that, in connection with the American commission's proposal for a hew plant to extract oid from shale known as the Renco or Jackmani retort. The Public Works Committee included representatives of all the political parties then, represented in the Parliament. After exhaustive inquiries, the committee submitted to the Parliament certain recommendations, including one that while the committee agreed that the Pumphers\on retorts should be improved, it considered that a pilot plant should be erected to try out the American idea in order to ascertain whether we could recover from 120 to 140 gallons from a ton of shale, which, it was claimed, Lad been shown to be possible by laboratory tests. We found that the retorts had been set up in various places. The Americans claimed that the retort "" delivered the goods "", but we were not quite satisfied for we wished to see it operate on what may be termed run-of-the-mine shale instead of selected shale without the dirt that would go through with run-of-the-mine shale. That recommendation was carried out in part, but, on my recent visit to Glen Davis, I found that the plant has never been completed, let alone tested. That indicates to me that we waste money in setting up parliamentary committees whose recommendations are not carried out. The committee of which I was chairman was of the opinion that, the system should be given a fair trial, but the excuse now offered is that not sufficient shale is being mined to supply the present plant, despite the fact, that it was put to me, as a miner, that if we could induce the miners at Glen Davis to agree to a system of extraction of pillars by machinery, sufficient shale would be mined to supply not only the existing plant but also the new Renco or Jackamani retort. There must be some reason for the failure. I make it quite clear that miners fear extraction of pillars by machinery. They believe that it endangers their lives. But many of the miners have invested their life savings in homes at Glen Davis. They do not want the project to close clown as a losing proposition, as it has been for a period of years under the control of the National Oil Proprietary Limited. The project has been able to carry on only because the Labour Government has carried the losses. I was at Glen Davis only a fortnight ago and I spoke not only to the miners but also to a public meeting in an attempt to keep production at as high a level as possible. They have agreed to do so. The honourable member for Wentworth (Mr. Harrison), as a member of the Public Works Committee when I was chairman, will agree that Glen Davis is completely isolated. It has no amenities, no bathing facilities, no hospital and no hall for pictures, bar a bug and flea-ridden bag place. The people there are living in isolation trying in a period of national emergency to get shale for the nation.",41
66,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"Mr Clark) Order! The honourable member is a little wide of the matter before the committee. He is entitled to make reasonable reference to the subject he has been discussing, but the question before the Cbair is the schedule to the bill.",41
67,Mr JAMES,Unknown,"I was advised by the clerk, Mr Chairman, that I would be in order discussing this subject. If youare over-ruling him",42
68,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Order ! Chair is in complete control of the committee. If the honourable gentleman persists in his present attitude I shall ask him to resume his seat. I rule that he is too far from the matter before the Chair. I am prepared to allow him to make a reasonable reference to the subject that he has been dealing with but he is going into too much detail.,42
69,Mr JAMES,Unknown,"I shall make a reasonable reference to it and will endeavour to conform to your ruling. I know that this item is very comprehensive. It is related to item 11 and the reduction of excise from 4d. to 3d. a gallon. If we wish to help this national project at Glen Davis we should waive the duty altogether. ""We should do so if we are to make this country self-contained in regard tooil from our solids, both shale and coal.",42

72,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Order ! Resume your seat.,42
73,Mr JAMES,Unknown,Will you indicate when I may speak. Item agreed to. DIVISION 9 - DRUG S AND CHEMICALS. Item 266 (Benzol and Naphtha).,42
74,Mr HARRISON,Unknown,"Wentworth) [8.20]. - I have permitted a number of items to pass without asking the Minister for  an explanation of the variations of rates of duty, but I now consider that the time has arrived when he should give to the Committee some information about these matters, because they are of general importance to the Australian industries affected by the duties. this point, the Minister should explain the various alterations which have been mad° in the duties applicable to benzol t and naphtha. In 1933-39, the British preferential tariff was 6d. a gallon, the intermediate tariff 9d. and the general tariff 9d. On the 2nd May, 1940, the duties were increased to 9d., Is. and Is. a gallon respectively. In 1946 the British preferential tariff was reduced The from 9d. to Sd. a gallon, the intermediate tariff from Is. to l i d . and the general tariff from Is. to l i d . However, those reductions do not restore the pre-war rates. These duties, we know, - are imposed for revenue producing purposes,, although they also afford some degree of protection to our local industries. The Minister should also explain to the committee the reasons for these variations. These duties have been validated over a number of years, and honourable members will be interested to know exactly why the duties have fluctuated as they have done. A similar explanation is due to the committee in respect of item 277, carbonic acid gas. In .1933-39, the British preferential tariff was 2d. per lb. and the intermediate and general tariffs were 3d. per lb. In 1940 the rates were increased to Is. 2d., .Is. 3d. and Is. 3d. per lb. respectively. In 1946 the British preferential tariff was reduced to 2d. per lb. and the intermediate tariff and general tariff to 3d. per lb. The reason for that reduction is easily understood, but we have not been informed why the duties applicable to benzol and naphtha have not - been restored to the pre-war rates.  Commerce and Agriculture) . [8.23] The proposed duties represent an increase of 2d. a gallon on the rates in operation under the customs tariff of 1933-39. In May, 1940, the Menzies. Government increased the rates in force in 1939 by 3d. Coma gallon. The present Government reduced for the 'rate by Id. a gallon in November, the 1.946. These amendments are consequential upon the alterations of the duty on petrol. Benzol and naphtha may be used as substitutes for petrol, and in order to safeguard revenue it is necessary that the duties oh such products be,.at the At same level as those applying to petrol. The item is unimportant as a revenue producer, because importations are relatively small. In 1938-39, immediately before the outbreak of World War II . , the revenue collected was £956: in 1939 it was £1,275, in 1945-46, £7; and in 1946-47, £4.. Therefore, the 'honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Harrison) will see that the subject-matter of the item is not of vast importance as a revpnue producer or as an imposition en the consumers of this product.",42
75,Mr JAMES,Unknown,"Hunter) [8.24.] - I should like you, Mr Chairman, to inform me when I may complete the remark's which I began a few minutes ago. Item 229 is in the division headed "" Oils, Paints and Varnishes"", and contains a reference to petroleum and shale products.",43
76,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Mr Clark) Order! Item 266 is before the Chair.,43
77,Mr JAMES,Unknown,"Then you have "" clouted "" me completely. I want to know when I may complete my speech. When I began to speak on item 229, you stated that I was elaborating the subject unnecessarily and asked ine to resume my seat.",43

CUSTOMS'TARIFF (SOUTHERN RHODESIAN ' PREFERENCE) AMENDMENT (NO . 1). .In Committee of Wayn and Means: Consideration resumed from the 14th November, 1946 (vide page 262, volume.  That the Schedule to the Customs Tarifl (Southern Rhodesian Preference) 1941 be amended . . . {vide page 261).  Commerce and Agriculture) [8.29] - The Customs Tariff (Southern Rhodesian Preference) Act 194] provides for a concessional rate of duty on tobacco leaf when imported, f rom Southern Rhodesia. The description of the goods follows the wording of item 19 appearing in the Customs Tariff. As the result of the alteration of the wording of tariff item 19 proposed by the Customs Tariff resolution of the 14th November, 1946, it is necessary to make a consequential alteration to the schedule of the Customs Tariff (Southern Rhodesian Preference) Act. The alteration to which I have reItem ferred, was the provision that the minimum, quantity of Australian tobacco leaf which could be blended with' imported leaf in order to qualify the latter for concessional rates of duty, was to be varied in accordance with-the size of the Australian tobacco crop. Previously, provision was made that a fixed percentage of Australian leaf was required to be blended with the imported leaf. Honourable members will see that the proposal is on all fours with the proposal in relation to tobacco imported from sources other than Southern Rhodesia. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported. Standing Orders suspended; resolution adopted.

[REPRESENTATIVES.] TARIFF PROPOSALS 1946. EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT (NO . l ) . in Committee of Ways and Means: 'Consideration resumed from the 14th November, 1946 (vide page 262, vol.  That the schedule to the Excise Tariff 1921-193!) be amended . . . {vide page 260). Item 1 (Beer) and item 11 (Petroleum or shale products)-by leave-considere d together.  for Commerce and Agriculture) [8.33]. - The amendments now proposed to the Excise Tariff are associated with 'Customs Tariff Proposal No. 1, of the 14th November, 1946, and are designed to implement reductions of duty as part of the Government's 1946 budget .programme. The reduction of Id. a gallon, in the rates of duty specified in item 11 of this resolution is complementary to the reduction of Id. a gallon in customs duties on petrol and allied petroleum products provided for in Customs Tariff Proposal No. 1 of the 14th November, 1946. Honourable members will note from the memorandum of alterations that a number of changes in item 11 have occurred since it was enacted in 1939. First, the rates were increased by 3d. a gallon from the 3rd May, 1940, as a revenue measure. On the 21st August, 1940, the item was amended to cover coal tar and coke area distillates other than benzol, and the rates on liquid fuel produced from both indigenous shale and coal were reduced to encourage and speed up production of fuel in Australia. At the time the Menzies Government gave an assurance to producers that, provided they were in production by the 2.1st August, 1942, they would be given protection against imported petrol for a period of fifteen years. The item was worded accordingly. . War-time circumstances prevented some producers from commencing production by the date stipulated and the item was subsequently amended to remove this condition. The amendment of the 5th March, 1942, was effected to make the item more comprehensive. The definition of "" beer"" is also being amended for administrative purposes.",43
83,Mr HARRISON,Unknown,"Wentworth) [8.36]. - I am rather interested in what the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture Tariff Proposals 1946.  certain administrative changes are provided for in the proposals that the committee, is considering, but so far we have not. heard very much about them. I invite the Minister to tell the committee just what is intended, and how the changes are likely to affect tariff and excise duties generally. I take it that we are now dealing comprehensively with the entire schedule. That means that we have an opportunity to discuss, for instance, an amendment to the definition of beer. We are also able to discuss excise duties imposed upon "" Petroleum or Shale Products, viz.: Petrol, Benzine, Benzoline, Gasoline, Naphtha, Pentane."" and so on. This, of course, opens up the entire field of petrol rationing and the production of oil from shale-the matter with which the honourable member for Hunter (Mr. Jamas) was dealing so ably a few minutes ago. We are also at liberty to discuss, I take it, "" Coal Tar and Coke Oven Distillates"" &c, mentioned in item 13 (c) and ""Petroleum and Shale Distillates"" &c, mentioned in item 11 (B ) . First, I should like to know the reason for the addition of the definition of beer. This, of course, is a suitable subject for discussion on a hot evening in. Canberra, and, although, I am not one who is addicted to this beverage, I am so intorestp/1 that T should like to know the meaning of the wordsFor the purposes of this item, beer means any fermented liquor brewed from a mash of malted or other grains or extracts from malted or other grains with or without sugars or glucose or both sugars and glucose, hops or other vegetable bitters. That all sounds very nice. Am I to assume that we now have better methods of brewing? No doubt the Minister, with his vast knowledge and great experience, will be able to tell me what is meant by 'hat, definition. I come now to certain remarks made earlier in the debate by the honourable member for Hunter. It is true that' I was a member of the Public Works Committee when, in the early days of World War II . , it investigated the production of oil from shale at Glen Davis and Baerami. I was vastly interested in the possibilities of these fields, and of others including Latrobe, which we all believed, gave great liopas of the production in this country of necessary wartime fuels. In the course of our investigations we came across a retort known as the Renco retort which, it was claimed, gave a yield that was staggering compared with that of other retorts. The company interested in the Glen Davis deposits took over this retort with the idea of using it as a pilot plant, and, in the event of satisfactory operation, installing others throughout the works. It was taken up to Glen Davis. The committee saw the plant in its dismantled state where the foundations had been set for its erection. We were then told that it would be erected within a.period of ten months. The honourable member for Hunter greatly interested himself in this matter on behalf of - hi9 electorate and because of the great knowledge which he. has of the subject. As chairman of the Public Works Committee, he received assurances that the Glen Davis management proposed to go ahead with the erection of the retort. The committee was informed in evidence that great losses had been sustained in the Glen Davis field. We knew that private, enterprise was waiting to develop the ""Baerami field and was awaiting a report as to the suit-ability or otherwise of the Renco retort before setting up retorts at Baerami. However, the management at Glen Davis, for its own reasons, did not go ahead with the erect-ion of 'that retort. I am not sure, but I believe that it has not yet been installed. Itsvast possibilities have neverbeen explored. The losses, sustained by the. present method of retorting might well be reduced considerably if the Renco retort were installed and put into operation. Early reportsas to its efficiency should be tested. At, the time the Public Worksi Committee visited Glen; Davis,, it was said that the company operating at Baeramihad every intention of installing Benco retorts in .that, field if the installation at Glen Davis proved to be successful. It was claimed that the more efficient results obtainable from the Renco retort would have-paid handsomely in the early days of retorting, even at the higher excise duty applied by this Government. However, the retort is still lying idle at Glen Davis. I do not know whether it has rusted away completely, but at any rate its possibilities have not been exploited. I suggest to the Minister that action should be taken to bring that retort up to date. The results obtained from it might justify the installation of a battery of similar retorts. I shall not discuss the subject further because I know that the honourable member for Hunter wants to deal with it. Because of hisearlier difficulties in attempting to discuss this subject on another item, ' have endeavoured to give him an indi -. '-ation that he can discuss it now..",44
84,Mr JAMES,Unknown,"Hunter) [8.4-3] - I am Indebted to you, Mr Chairman, for the fact that the honourable member for"" Wentworth (Mr Harrison) has stolen some of my thunder. However, I bow to your very wise ruling. What the honourable member for Wentworth has said is perfectly true.. I was dealing with that matter when you ruled wrongly-- ",45

86,Mr JAMES,Unknown,"I withdraw "" wrongly "".",45
87,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,Order ! The honourable member must make no reflections upon the Chair. If I have any further insolence frona him I shall ask him to resume hisseat immediately.,45
88,Mr JAMES,Unknown,"Ver y well. I did not intend to say the word ""wrongly"", and I tried to make an adequate apology. I have visited Glen Davis, as the honourable member for Wentworth knows, on three occasions. I have learned that the retort mentioned by the honourable gentleman has not yet been installed although the Public Works Committee recommended to the Government that it should be erected and tested'. It has been only partially erected. When my remarks were ruled out of order earlier this evening, I was endeavouring to point out that sufficient shale could not be produced to supply the Pumpherston retorts, which are now in use. I went to Glen Davis at the request of the miners federation, to ask the men to extract pillars by machine, which is a very dangerous process. They agreed to do so in order to try and save the homes which they had established there. Other governments as well as the present Government have been interested in the extraction of oil from shale under the management of National Oil Proprietary Limited. The project has been a losing one, but we want to try to make it profitable in order that the employees who have gone to Glen Davis to live will have at least some security. These men have put all of their assets into that place, and they want the project to become an economic success. I have never known men and' women more willing to make their town a congenial place. The men are working hard in an endeavour to keep up the output of shale. Many factors contribute to the fact that the maximum possible production is not being maintained at Glen Davis. One of these is the lack of a satisfactory housing scheme. Homes are not provided for married workors. A man does not like to maintain two homes, one for himself at Glen Davis and another for his wife at Lithgow or elsewhere. The State Government has been asked to build homes in that locality in order that the population may be increased and the output of shale maintained. However, the Premier, Mr. MCGirr, has "" passed the buck"" to the Australian Government and has said that the matter is one for National Oil Proprietary Limited, which is dependent on this Government. That is what has been reported to me. I do not say that it is correct, but it calls for an answer by some responsible person. Furthermore, the State Government will not consider erecting a hospital or even a child welfare clinic. These things affect the success of the Glen Davis project. The building of houses and a hospital would contribute towards saving the money that has been sunk, or at any rate invested, in the Glen Davis proposition by this Government, and by previous governments. We want to make the project a profitable one. If my ideas, which are the ideas submitted to me by the people who live at Glen Davis, are carried out, I sincerely believe that the project can be made to succeed and the homes of the people saved. The Joint _ Coal Board would not interest itself in providing houses and amenities for the workers at Glen Davis. Mr James. It asserted that it had no right to do so, because the word "" coal"" is not mentioned in relation to the process. The Joint Coal Board, therefore, washed its hands of the matter, stating that it could, not provide the same amenities for shale workers as for coal-miners. In my opinion, it would he an easy matter for the Government to bring the employees of National Oil Proprietary Limited within the ambit of the Joint Coal Board so that they may share in the improved, amenities which are to be provided for coal-miners in the near future. Why should the sick child of a miner employed at Glen Davis have tp be transported 50 miles to Lithgow hospital? It is ridiculous that people employed at Glen Davis should he denied ordinary hospital facilities. No provision whatever is made for maternity cases, and the result is that expectant mothers often give birth to babies while PT>, route to the maternity hospital at Lithgow. It is tragic to think that people who are engaged in <i vital national enterprise should be treated in such H fashion. A erpat dp.al will have to hp done to provide reasonable amenities. The schedule under discussion specifically mentions ""beverages"", which, of course, includes beer. It is the right of a working man at Glen Davis to enjoy a drink of beer at the end of his day's work, just w black-coated workers do in metropolitan areas. But for three days in every week no beer is available, to him. What is the result? Pedlars of ""plonk"" visit the valley and. sell it to the miners. Those who consume this cheap wine and have a drink of water the following morning find themselves "" on the booze "" again.",45
89,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,"Order ! The honourable member must confine himself to the item, under discussion.",46
90,Mr JAMES,Unknown,"If there is to be .a greater output of shale there must be contentment amongst the miners. The complaints of the miners which I have mentioned contribute largely, to the fact that insufficient shale is mined to justify the operation of all the retorts. I support the recommendation of the Public Works Committee that Renco retorts should be taken into use. Although the employees at Glen Davis' have invested thousands of pounds in a co-operative society, the construction of homes, they are able to obtain building labour. Building contractors will not undertake work i the area because there is not sufficient accommodation for their employees. I company with the honourable member for Wentworth, I visited bag shacks, where the only flooring was bare earth. Yet those miners are supTests posed to work contentedly . and to it contains maintain an output sufficient meet the nation's' requirements. If we want miners to take their lives in their hands, as they do every time they down into the bowels of the earth, some amenities must be provided for them. They must he able to live a normal lif with their wives and families, not an isolated life as they do now. The summary of recommendations coal made by the Public Works Committee which visited the Glen Davis and Baerami shale oil-fields, contains certain definite proposals, some of which I shall quote. Sub-paragraph 2 of paragraph 80 recomman mendedThat the work of installing and working pilot Eenco retort at Glen Davis for trial under working conditions be completed out further delay . . . Paragraph 68 of the report states that "" When oil is recovered from shale a useless material is left . . ."" Sub-paragraph 4, of paragraph 80, Summary of Recommendations, states. '. . if the development of the Baerami field be undertaken by private enterprise, the Commonwealth Government give to the comstrongly pany undertaking the work such assistance for it. a limited period, in the form of remission of excise duty, and/or bounties on oil produced, as will enable the business to - bo conducted without loss in the developmental stage (parais graph 79). Obviously if we want to encourage a that situation to be permanent. national industry such as this, which has involved a loss of many 'thousands of pose pounds of the taxpayers money during the recent national crisis, then it is up us to remove the duty altogether. Paranormal graph 72 statesThe Committee was impressed by the information placed before it and recommends, that from the point of view of national security,,;'-.id r.s a major post-war project, hydTOgenation of black coal and the treatment of Victorian brown coal to produce fuel oil and petrol-and later, by-products-shoul given immediate and earnest consideration. for Honourable members who have been un- - members of Parliament for any length of time recognize that I have always n been interested in the coal industry, and in the extraction of oil from n shale and coal. In iny opinion there is ample scope for both industries, and in any case, there is more' coal in this country than oil shale. of Maitland coal have proved that from 12 to 15 per cent, of o i l , to - a higher percentage than is found in coal won in any other part of .the world. As the result of my recent journey through go Germany I made certain recommendations to the Government. In the preparation of my report and recommendations e 1 was greatly assisted by a Mr Beazley of Imperial Chemical Industries L t d . , an expert whom I met in Munster, whose services had been loaned to the Allied control authorities in north Germany. This gentleman advised me that the Australian Government would be well advised not to accept one or two Fischer-Tropsch retorts, but to seek the service's of Gerexperts to visit Australia and erect retorts for the extraction of oil from coal. the I felt that that would be the better course withto take. These men, who were forced to work for the Nazis, were quite prepared to give us the benefit of their experience of the plants they had operated in Gerr many and to assist in installing new plant here. To transport plant covering 5 to 10 acres of ground would require two vessels of the size of Queen Mary. I supported Mr Beazley's recommendation and .urged the Government to accept The criticism can be offered that there not at present sufficient coal to satisfy the needs of industry, but I do not believe The attempts of the miners' federation to imdiscipline in the .coal-fields will , I am sure, result eventually in an adequate to supply of coal becoming available for industrial use, as well as for the conduct of experiments designed to alleviate the present shortage of flow oil by extracting oil from solids such as shale and coal. There are greater quantities of the coal available than of shale, and it is cheaper to mine coal than shale. We are d be importing almost all of our o i l fuel. To employ our people at extracting oil from solids, even though, the resultant product may cost more than imported oil, will far better than to do what was done able to secure - during the years from 1930, almost up to the outbreak of the .last war, when paid out "" doles"" to the extent of £15,000,000 a year. In such circumit stances Australia would not be dependent upon other countries for oil supplies if another war occurs. I trust it will not, but if we make no attempt to safeguard ourselves in this way. we may be deprived entirely of oil supplies. Although there a shortage of coal, I believe it is time that we began these experiments. We should given its ruling. bring these Germans' here so that they may give us the benefit of the knowledge they have gained by operating plants .economically with coal of inferior quality.",46
91,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown,"Richmond) [9.5] -. 1 should like to support the honourable the member for Hunter (Mr James) in hi* plea for the extraction of oil from, coal; - out we should be more interested the honourable member, who represents Newcastle, could ensure the extraction of coal from the soil at the present tim«». It would be better if we got the coal fore talking of extracting oil from it. I agree that it is necessary for Government to secure, if possible, tion in the quantity of petrol used this country. Australia imports approxiinterest mately 33,000,000 gallons per month, and a few million gallons are obtained by way of extraction from shale. should be possible to reduce consumption by 10 per cent. Two cuts have already to show for it. been made, one of 10 per cent, in October last, and another of 10 per cent, in November last.. An investigation of the figures might be expected to reveal a stantial reduction in the quantity of sold by the oil companies. I have not yet been able to obtain the complete figures, but those I have show that there has been practically no reduction in petrol coneconomics sumption in Australia, despite the two cuts to which I . have referred.  has not calculated what the increase would have been if the cuts were imposed.",48
92,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown,"A report in the press today discloses one of the why such a a-eduction and consequent saving of vital dollars has not occurred. ho A youth of nineteen years of age was The - CHAIRMAN - Order ! The we honourable member is entitled to make reference to petrol rationing insofar as is affected by the duties and the excise tariff, but he is not entitled to indulge in a general dissertation on that subject.",48
93,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown,I presume the necessity for those duties is governed by is the necessity to conserve petrol. .,48
94,The CHAIRMAN,Unknown,The Ghair has,48
95,Mr ANTHONY,Unknown,"If I am ruled out, of order, I cannot proceed. I consider that I ought to be able to say that petrol rationing is necessary and show how it can be tightened up in order to conserve supplies that are available. I have perforce to accept the ruling of the Chair, and I cannot even express disagreement with it. I might be suspended if for a month if I did. An enormous siun of public money has been squandered by the Government on be the so-called extraction of oil from shale at Glen Davis. Figures issued by the Treasurer (Mr Chifley) show that since the its establishment National Oil Proa reducprietary Limited, has been advanced in £3,091,000 of public money. Including of £287,000, a total expenditure vf £3,378,000 of Commonwealth funds has been involved at Glen Davis. As the It honourable member for Hunter has pointed out, there is practically nothing I have not available at the moment exactfigures-of production at Glen Davis, subhut I believe that the total production oil would represent no more than a bagatelle so far as Australia's requirements are concerned. The cost of producing petrol at Glen Davis is out of all proportion to the of the project. It is proposed to impose an excise duty of 3d. a gallon upon production up to 10,000,000 gallons- I do not believe that anything approaching 10,000,000 gallons a year has yet been reached at Glen Davisnot and, thereafter, duty at the rate of S-Jcl. a gallon is to be applied. In any case, what is the sense of these reasons duties when all of the money involved is government money?

Ihe'..ipoint I*<emphasize is. that-within ..lasti;i>30 years noreally ""effective - attempt:-has 1 been --madeto , explore the tpos'sibi!.ities f of' the-'-shale - oil deposits - this -- at Latrobe.' l am aware'of the argument that the deposits are not large enough to make their exploitation economical and that the cost of production would be very high. Surely our need to produce petrol in this country today should stimulate the Government, if not individual companies, to explore the possibilities of those deposits. Recently, I heard rumours that the land bearing the deposits at Latrobe had been leased to an oil company for a period of 50 years. I am wondering, whether, as has often happened in respect of other promising oil-bearing deposits, an attempt is being made to discourage the development of the Latrobe deposits. To-day, for the first time in . our history, and for the reasons I have mentioned, a sincere attempt is being made to produce petrol in Australia. All shale deposits, wherever they exist throughout the Commonwealth, including the Latrobe deposits should now be genuinely tested and such efforts should not be abandoned until every possible test has been made. I repeat that no such attention has yet be>eii given to the deposits at Latrobe. Even if the field could be operated for Tasmania only, it would be of tremendous assistance, as all our petrol is imported from the mainland, and that, of course, at times causes us great concern as well as higher costs. So I put these facts to the committee in order to k«»ep the matter before us that the possibilities of Latrobe shall not he regarded as hopeless. Our Government ' should be inspired to every «.dfort, oven though there may be losses in the initial stages, to get the desperately needed petrol from our own shale deposits.",48
96,Mr RANKIN,Unknown,"Bendigo) [9.21! --1 was a member of the Public ""Works Committee that was authorized during the war to inquire into our shale deposits. We inquired into shale deposits throughout Australia. We-did not consider there was any possibility of the successful use of the Latrobe deposits. There had been at some long distant date an attempt to produce motor spirit from that shale. The deposit is slight. There are ,a-great many disabilities in its use. There is a hard pebble through a great section of it. Our opinion was that it was quite impossible to produce shale oil at a figure that would encourage any government, even in a time of war, to use it. We decided that there was a possibility of success at Glen Davis. We believed that with the use of Renco retorts there was a chance that we might be able to produce motor spirit there at a cost that, ..... * in war-time conditions, would justify the Government in spending money on it. I. do not believe that in-time of peace 'iny government is justified in spending a considerable sum. of money on any of the shale deposits. I believe that there is a. possibility that we should be justified in considering the production of oil from coal. . We have wonderful coal deposits in New South Wales, but, unfortunately, our experience has-been for the last four or five years that we cannot produce sufficient coal from the New South Wales fields to carry on essential industries-ga s works, steel works and railways. I believe that in Victoria possibly the best opportunity of producing spirit from coal is provided by the vast brown coal deposits of Gippsland, about which the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr Bowden) can speak authoritatively. When one considers that there we have deposits running a distance of 100 miles' and varying from 100 to 150 feet in depth one can imagine that with the adoption of the proper method, of hydrogenation, the, method used in Germany, there is a possibility of producing motor spirit at a cost that would justify the Government in spending money on it. I do not believe that the Government would be justified in spending money on experiments in the production of oil from the coal in New South Wales-the deposits there are too valuable from otherpoints of view-bu t the second-gradecoal of Gippsland provides justification for the Government to bring the best experts available to Australia from Germany where, owing to absence of natural oil, they were forced to produce oil from coal. The Government would, be justified in spending a large sum of money in developing the Gippsland coal deposits for the production of oil, but, as the results of the investigations of the Public Works Committee, .1 do not' believe that the shale oil deposits are worth - developing' in any circumstances, other than to meet the exigencies of war. Lame ENID LYONS (Darwin) [9.25]. - J . support strongly the remarks of the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr . Harrison) and other honourable members who have urged the necessity for experimenting with Australian shale by the use of the Renco retorts. In common with the honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Duthie), I know something of the Latrobe deposits and something of the report of the committee that investigated the whole' proposition some years ago. The honourable member said that it was 35 years since motor spirit was produced from the Latrobe shale, but I know that motor spirit was being produced from that shale twenty years ago. Bronter retort was in operation and quite a lot of fuel was produced. 1 used some of it on occasions - I can verify the honourable member's remarks about the vapours that resulted from its use. I was running a ten-year-old Hudson and getting about 10 miles a gallon. W it h a certain amount of commercial petrol in my petrol tank, mixed with the local product, I went from Latrobe to Wynyard, a distance of 40 miles, on just over a gallon. Believe it or not! Mr . ' FADDEN - I imagine the honourable member had the road to herself.",50
97,Dame ENID LYONS,Unknown,"There was no one behind me for many miles. I was not happy about the smell, myself. But the power was there, without doubt. It was an enormously powerful spirit. The one difficulty, of course, was the lack of refining, and the odor was terrific. Of - course, some damage would be done to, the car engine if one ran too long on the spirit. ' The real trouble was the sulphur content, which, at that time, .could not he eliminated. It so happens that about eighteen months ago I met , Mr George Bronter, who was then - operating the.retort. It was his father, an American, who designed' it . He has now severed all connection with that kind of work, certainly with the Latrobe field But he assures me that, as the result - of knowledge gained from recent experiments, it would now be commercially possible to undertake the refining of the - output from Latrobe. He says that, in his opinion, because of limitations of which the committee has been informed, petrol produced from Latrobe shale would never be able to compete even with petrol produced from other Australian . shales. It cannot be produced economically enough to' make it worth exporting from Tasmania. He spent two or three years on a complete survey of the field, and' he assures me that it is capable of producing sufficient petrol to meet all Tasmania's needs. The honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Bankin) said that, in his opinion, as a member of the committee that, investigated the Australian shale deposits, it would not be feasible tp produce petrol The from Australian shale, except under conditions of war. Quite obviously, you cannot begin to produce from shale under conditions of war. The foundations must be laid before the emergency arises. So. I suggest that now is the time to begin the experiments. The general situation in regard to petrol and, I say with great reluctance, the general situation with regard to war, are such that it would be wise to make whatever provision for the production of petrol within Australia we possibly can. So, I commend to the Government that it proceed with the use of theRenco retort, which has proved to be so very much more capable of results than any other retorts hitherto used in Australia. I particularly ask that in the event of any such work being carried out, the Latrobe field be examined most carefully, having regard to' the fact that, as far as I am aware, at any rate, it is the only petrol-bearing mineral in Tasmania.",51
98,Mr WHITE,Unknown,"Balaclava) [ 9 . 2 9 ] Another subject apropos this is : what is to be the fate of the power alcohol distilleries that were erected during the war to produce motor spirit from wheat? Tn an answer to a question asked by me, 1 ascertained that about £2,000,000 was expended on these distilleries and that about a dozen pints of spirit was - produced. They did not function, for what reason I do not know. In an.v event, wheat is too valuable to be used in the production of spirit. Has the Government disposed of those distilleries? One of them was placed most strategically in the electorate of W i m mera which was then represented by one no - longer with, ""us, who is the 'adm-in-istrator >of Norfolk Island now.

Mr A&B.0T.T (New England) [Q.3.6] I.desijie to makessome observations .about the production of petrol from shale in Australia, and particularly about the petrol produced by National Oil Proprietary Limited. I'.em 11 (A ) states-.that petroleum or shale products produced - by this undertaking shall be subject to the following rates of duty:(a) - For .each gallon-iiot.exaecdiiig H0,000}G00 gallons in each year commencing on the'first day of January, '3d. (6) For each gallon exceeding 10,000,000 in eadh »yeaT ..commencing ,on the first - day-of fTamiary, 8'JU. The Auditor-General's .report on National Oil Proprietary - Limited's workings at Glen iDa-vis is .one -.of the most disturbing documents 'that 'honourable members have seen for a long time. Year by - year, the expenditure of the Gommon.wenl.th .in this undertaking has been increasing. Advances-made'by the Commonwealth during the twelve months ended .the 31st December, 1946, amounted to £3S5,91S, bringing the total Common(wealth'loans at that , date to £3,291,735. Only the original advance of '£334,000 has been covered by a deed of covenant, and charge. When this undertaking first began to operate, Australia was engaged in World War II . , and it was considered that the physical - means of conveying petrol to this countryimight be. completely cut off by enemy action. That .danger does not exist today, and the question which 'honourable.members should now ask themselves is whether it is worth - while that the Australian public, who .are-sorely harassed by taxes, (should be burdened with this great incubus, of the< Glen.Da'vis project under National'Oil Proprietary Limited. Financially, the Australian GoverniwaMt, and the Goverainient of New South Wales, are heavily involved. When - we examine the AuiditorGeneral's report relating to piockiction, we find that none of the estimates of production, either at the - beginning or during, the period of the existence of this undertaking, has been realized. In particular, I dii'oct attention to replies which the Minister for Supply .and'-Shipping (Senator Ashley) gave to questions asked by ox-'Senator Eteatnd about this matter. iOn one occasion in 1945, ex-Senator iBrand asked when it w.as considered that N-artional Oil Proprietary Limited's undertaking would reach the target figure of 10,00.0,000 gallons per annum. In a most 'optimistic spirit, the Minister said that it was expected - that the undertaking would reach the production of 10,000,000 gallons in March, 1946. From an examination of the Auditor-General's report, ""I find that the company produced 1,303,000 gallons in 1944, 2,224,000 gallons in 1945 and 4,0.7^000 gallons in 19.46. I .shall be interested to hear the Minister for Com form the committee what-was-the producl tion by the undertaking in 1947, because National 'Oil - Prop-sietary Limited - is not meeting - the estimates of production that were made - in respect of the Glen Davis project. According to the Auditor General's report, the .selling price of petrol, after excluding excise, was Is. 3.42d - a gallon - in '1946, Is. 5d. a gallon in L1945, and Is. 7£d. in .19,44, and sales of petrol realized £199,720 in 1946, £127 623 in 1945 and .£80,854 s in 1M4: The losses on - operations in those years, were £301,000, -£342;000 and £303,000 respectively. .It ^seems to be extraordinarily bad ' business that in-the production and sale of -£199»OG0 worth of a product - a 'loss of £401,000 should be incurred. Is it - any wonder that the people of this country-are unable to obtain any - relief from high taxes? Is it right that this great undertaking should he permitted - tq, continue to lose approximately £500,000 - a year ? Provision has been-in a'de in the - Estimates for the current 'financial year 'for assistance to the Glen Davis - project .amounting to £239,'<300. That figure . seems very low indeed when one considers that the loss on - the undertaking has grown steadily from '£263,000 in 1'942, to £4O1,'00O in 1-9.46. I should he interested to hear from the - Minister what .loss - has been incurred in the current financial year. In - reply to a question earlier today, the honourable - member for Wimmera (Mr. Turnbull) - was informed that it was not possible to manufacture larger .quantities of wire netting, steel fencing posts, and oilier articles urgently required by the man. on the land if he is to produce the commodities that are necessa:y to alleviate the food shortage inGreat Britain. The reason given by the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture for the inability to increase production of these requirements was the shortage of manpower; yet the Government is prepared to continue to foster' a project which has proved wasteful, not only of man-power, but also of revenue contributed by Australian taxpayers. A loss of approximately £500,000 a year is not insignificant. One can only assume that with losses increasing not in arithmetical progression, but in a manner reminiscent, of steep taxation curves, this little bounc- - I moveing baby will proba.bly be losing £750,000 - or more a year in the not distant future, because, as the infant's age increases, it becomes more and more voracious in its demand upon the taxpayers of this country. Therefore, the Government might well consider whether the continuance of the Glen Davis project is jus'.ified, or whether it should be scrapped entirely, - particularly in view of its inability to produce even half the estimated quantities of petrol. The continued losses are adding enormously to the capital indebtedness of the undertaking, and the Government cannot hope to recover its investment. Abandonment of the project would release man-power for the production of essential requirements such as steel for housing. The undertaking was established purely for war purposes - It was a safeguard against the risk of Australia being cut off from its overseas oil supplies; but apparently once this socialist Government, which believes that no socialist administration ever makes mistakes in planning, starts the flywheel going, it cannot be stopped. It continues a I increasing speed, year after year, creating so many vested interests in Government departments that opposition to it is swept aside. . At Glen Davis today, petrol is being produced at enormous cost and can only be sold for much less than its real value. Again I say that the pro- ject should be. thoroughly investigated ' with a view to diverting the man-power now engaged in it to more essential occupations than the production of minute quantities of petrol. Labour is Mr Abbott. required urgently for the production of commodities, export of which willassist materially the dollar battle that is now taking place, and of food for the people of Great Britain. In addition there is a shortage of certain commodities such as textiles in this country. Throughout the Commonwealth hundreds of homes await roofs and fittings, while Australian citizens are denied their rightful inheritance. . Items agreed to.

[vide page 3373).  for Commerce and Agriculture) [9.51]. - This tariff proposal implemented the Government's decision to reduce the rate of excise duty on spirit used in the fortification of wine consequent upon the cessation of payment of wine export bounty. Under the provisions of the Wine Export Bounty Act 1939-1944, an amount of 2s. 6d. a gallon from the excise duty imposed on spirit for the fortification of wine had been transferred to a trust account from which bounty had been paid. With the cessation of the payment of bounty by the expiration of the Wine Export Bounty Act 1939-1944 it was unnecessary to transfer this amount from excise collections and it was therefore decided to reduce the rate of duty on fortifying spirit by 2s. 6d. a gallon. A further amendment to the item was the elimination of the provision for special rates of duty on spirit used in fortifying grape must prior to the 13th March, 1930. The quantity of such spirit yet to bu cleared from bond is negligible and tlucontinuance of special provision was not considered necessary. The simplification of the item results in a flat rate of 4s. a gallon being applied to spirit for the fortification of wine. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported.

TARIF F PROPOSALS 1947. CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT (NO . 2). In Committee of Ways and Means: Consideration resumed from the 14th November, 1947 (vide page 2143, Vol.  That the Schedule to the Customs Tariff 1933-1939 be amended . . . {vide page 2080).  Commerce and Agriculture) [9.56] This proposal is the first of a group of four tariff proposals which were tabled in Parliament on the 14th November, 1947, viz.:-Custom s Tariff Amendment No. 2, Customs Tariff (New Zealand Preference) Amendment No. 1, Customs Tariff (Canadian Preference) Amendment No. 1, and Customs Tariff (Exchange Adjustment) Amendment No. 1. The Government made certain decisions in respect of the basis of value for duty of imported goods which were jointly implemented by the four tariff proposals tabled on the 14th November, 1947, and I propose now to refer in detail to these decisions and allow it to serve mainly as an explanation of the associated tariff proposals, which will be dealt with later by the committee. Towards'the end of last year, Parliament approved of a bill to amend the Customs Act to provide for the calculation of value for duty of imported goods in Australian currency and to abolish the addition of the statutory 10 per cent, to the f.o.b. value of imported goods. Prior to this amendment, the Customs Act provided that all duties should be paid in British currency and that the value of goods shown on invoices should he - converted to British currency. While Australian currency was on par with that of the United Kingdom the position was satisfactory, but when Australian currency was depreciated in 1930 the paradoxical procedure arose of calculating the value for duty of goods in ' United Kingdom currency, applying a rate of duty of, say, 1.0 per cent., and accepting the resultant figures as duty in Australian currency. .A further practice which was in operation was the loading of the f.o.b. price of imported goods with a statutory charge of 10 per c u t before arriving"" at the value for duty. ""'She,-provision 'appeared in the original Customs Act-of 1901, but lost its significance in later years. Then. - -.""t of' the'amendment to the Customs Act which-'was passui t.t the-end-of last - year .was to> inorcn« - t'..:jfigure at - which thevalue ifior duty - was - expressed. IFor - exam-pie, -.a i p-revious .value for duty of :£110 sterling is now - expressed 'as-£l'2o Australian. This would have resulted in . increased duties i being : collected if the tariff iad valorem rates had remained unchanged. 'As the\amend-ment to. the Customs Act .was. purely for administrative purposes, it was;-necessary to reduce ad - valorem rates-by 12 per. cent, - to ensure that, .approximately the-same amount-of duty would, he collocted..as.previously'. If the exact 12, per cent, reduction had been applied'in all-instances, however, many ' fractional rates would have resulted and it was decided to eliminate these 'by adjusting all reduced rates to the nearest 2-J.per cent. The maximum variation from the formula is "" li per cent, increase or 'deerease,..aj]d in' most cases it-is considerably smaller. i l t was. aJso decided, consequent. upon r the. expression of .value-for.duty in. Australian, currenpy,.that it-would be. preferable to eliminate the provision for ex-change adjustment and show in"" the tariff the - actual 'rates - which are operating - un'der existing exchangc'conditions. 'For - exainple, a British'preferential tariff ""rate which - appeare'd in ' the - tariff - at 3'5 ,per cent., but which was subject to exchange adjustment 'of '25 per cent - on e 'quarter ^resulted in'a - net'Tate of '2'6^ per cent, 'being-paid.

103,Mr FADDEN,Unknown,"the Treasurer, upon notice:How many taxation assessments have not. yet been issued in respect of income derived in each financial year commencing with the year 1943-4.4.",60
104,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"Accordin g to advices received by the Commissioner of Taxa1 tion from Deputy Commissioners, the answer to the right honourable gentleman's question is as follows:Year ended 30.0.44--6.00 0 assessments. Year ended 30.6.45^-1,0,000 assessments. Year ended 30.6.46-07,00 0 assessments. The assessments still to be issued for the years mentioned fall into tw,o broad categories,, namelycases where returns have been lodged after thestipulated time, either voluntarily or its a resulti of default action by the department; and cases where the assessing process is partially completed but subsequent action is held up. for some reason, particularly cases involving, correspondence to clear up doubtful items or. reference to other returns. The unissued assessments in respect of the year ended 30th. June, 1940 represent 2 per cent. of. the total returns lodged. 1948. IMMIGRATION : AXL-PAKTT COMMITTEE OF INQUIRY.",60

Does the permit allow Charlie Tim So to bring his wife and five children? 5. Was the basis on which the application was granted, that Charlie Tim So would be- conducting an export business? 6. Will the Prime Minister ascertain whether. 16- the said export business was not in fact a fantan school formerly conducted' by his latefather, an unnaturalized Chinesein Townsville?

Will further deportations of such refugees - be held tfp (pending the results >of such investigations ?",60
106,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are follows:1. The Government considers it unnecessary .to a,p,point an all-party committee-to inquire ""into these matters. 2. Inquiries have been made into tire circumstances of the case. -3, ..4, - a, The permit was .issued by the Acting Minister during the absence of the Minister. The circumstances are as follows: :Sock iQuea .is the - son - of the late iLouie T i m - So,, a-domiciled Chinese who conducted the firm of Louie See Bros, of Townsville and had other business interests in Queensland. Tin damiai-y 'of this year application was made on bei'alf - of Louie Tim So's widow for permission for Took Quen to enter Australia in connection 'uiifh *he grant of .probate - of 1/puie Tim 'So's will 4tn4 'distribution - of his estate a:nd 'also to 'enable her - to secure'the f«d>vice and 'direction - of - her 'son in con-nexion with the 'business of l-ioui'c 'See Bros.

The Department's (file - shows that the late Louie Tim .So .had previously engaged in overseas 'tisude. It - is the rule to admit Asiatics who are in a. position to engage in overseas trade to the standard laid down in the immigration policy. In the light of the additional facts which fluid 'been placed before him .the Acting Minister, .in 'the absence-of Ithe Minister abroad, .granted approval for Yock Quen's admissionunder - exemption for t w o years on .the unidera'tanding that he - would engage 'in - such :ti;ade and that . any extension of that period .would depend on the amount of overseas trade done.

The Commissioner of Taxation, .with whom I have discussed this question, has informed me that the secrecy provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act .preclude him from divulging any information respecting the 'affairs .of a taxpayer, in .these circumstances, I .am unable to ifurnish the desired advice. 8, 9 - Presumably the honourable member had in mind certain Malayan seamen who aa-.e a'bout to be repatriated. If so, the case of these men is quite a separate matter which, has no connection whatever with Yock Quen's ad-mission to Australia. as Siuj-j-uNCi.: F::i:iCiHir SunsiuiJis-POR T DELAYS. Mr F:K.AK.OIS asked the Minister repres e n t i j ig the . Minister for T r a d e and Customs, 'upon notice I.. Is it a fact that the subsidy being paid to shippers of intra-state goods in Queensland has been withdrawn whilst the subsidy is still beiii"" .paid to shippers from other States on goods into Queensland? 2. In view of .the position whereby goods can be shipped .from, ,say„ Sydney to itockhainpton cheaper than they can faiom Brisbane to - Rockhain - p.ton, - wilJ he gave - consideration to the elimination .of this idiseivimination against Queensland shippers.? r  .and Ciustoms has supplied the following : intfoTmataon:'1.

' Mr FjtAKcas asked t'he Minister representing the Minister for i S up p l y and - Shipiping, m/pon notice. ' 1. Has he .seen 'the statement made recently by the chairman of the Clan Line of - Steamers, at - present visiting Australia, to the effect flliat, - affter Tieira (Portugese East Africa') and Buenos Aires (South America), Australian ports were the slowest in the world in 'the'handling of shipping? 2. Is it a fact, as stated by this""highly experienced visitor, that half the time of voyages of .ships on iihe Australian run is spent in port; waiting for labour and wharfs or in 'handling cargo; ""if so, will the Government cause an immediate ^investigation to 'be made into .all .shipping facilities .'in .Australian ;ports ? - 3. Wlill ""the 'Government take some definite 's'tcps to i<nsui:e Ithe more efficient .and more .expeditions handling of all 'shipping in - AusIfei'arlimi .poi'ts?",61
107,Mr DEDMAN,Unknown,"The Minister Supply and Shipping has supplied the becoming following information:.1. I have not seen the statement referred to by the honourable member, attributed to the chairman of the Clan Line of Steamers. 2. It is a fact that ships spend veiy considerable .periods in port. There is no necessity for the Government to commence an immediate investigation into all shipping facilities in Australian ports since the Government has had this matter under close investigation for some years and is stiil actively inquiring into it and taking such action as is within its power to improve conditions. The powers of the Commonwealth Government, however, have not. speaking generally, been such as enable it to deal, apart from war-time emergencies, with harbour equipment and installations, with the routing or programming of ships, nor with the transport of cargoes to and from wharfs. Nevertheless, the Government has interested itself in such matters and in respect to the port of Sydney, for exam,ple, in collaboration with State authorities, has initiated action within the last few days to e.\]>cditc clearance of cargoes from wharfs and - wharf sheds where congestion has had a marked effect in delaying ships. Similar conditions exist at other main ports in the Commonwealth and it is the function of State authorities to deal with harbours and railways serving harbours, and of private enterprise to arrange transport for clearing cargoes from port installations and to arrange programmes for ships (except ships belonging to the Commonwealth L in e ) . The Stevedoring Industry Commission, on which both shipping employers and waterside workers are represented, is in almost c6nstant session regarding the manning of the ports with waterside labour and the industrial conditions of waterside labourers. Within the last three weeks, arrangements have been made for 750 additional waterside workers to the previously existing labour level at that port, and the position in respect to labour at all ports is under continuous and close review. From the refrences made above to other factors which affect the total position in relation to turn-round of ships, it will be recognized by the honourable member that the difficulties he alludes to cannot be solved by merely adding to the labour strength at ports. 3. The Government 'will continue to take such steps as are within its power or can be achieved in collaboration with State authorities and as are from time to time recognized as necessary to improve the turn-around of ships in Australian ports. TKADE UNIONS: COMMUNIST MEMBERS.",62
108,Mr FRANCIS,Unknown,"the Minister acting for the Attorney-General, upon notice I. Has he seen the statement made by T. Dougherty, federal secretary of the Auscouncils tralian Workers Union, at the recent federal convention of that union atCoolarigatta, Queensland, to the effect that no provision' for existed under the Commonwealth arbitration law whereby unions could prevent Communists or remaining members of a union? 2. Further, has he seen the reported views of Mr Dougherty that he would be happy if a position could be created to ensure that worthwhile unions could prevent Communists from Attaining office?. 3. Has consideration .been given to the creation of such a law; if not, why not?'",62
109,Mr HOLLOWAY,Unknown,The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. Yes. 2. Yes. 3. It is considered that union members should have a substantially free right of choice from amongst themselves of candidates for office. INDUSTRIAL UNREST: STATEMENTS BY MR. FALLON.,62
110,Mr FRANCIS,Unknown,"the Minister acting for the Attorney-General, upon notice I. When Mr Fallon. Queensland secretary of the Australian Workers Union, speaking at the annual convention of the union held at Coolangatta on the 29th January, said that those responsible for the hardships - which the people of Australia are suffering today because of all kinds of shortages could definitely be regarded as guilty of treason to this country, and treachery to the working people, was heexpressing views which are synonymous with those of the Commonwealth Government? 2. ' If so, when does the Government propose to take action to eliminate such treachery and treason ?",62
111,Mr HOLLOWAY,Unknown,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. and 2. I have no information as to what Mr Fallon said at the recent conference of the Australian Workers Union. I will, however, ask Mr Fallon whether he made the statement referred to by the honourable member and will then he in a position to furnish'a reply to his question. LOCAL GOVERNMENT SERVICES : IMPORT NA  last, the honourable member for Cook (Mr. Sheehan) asked whether it is a fact that import duties are imposed on' equipment required by municipal councils in New South Wales for their cleansing services, Mr and whether, in view of the fact 'that the are not operating at *a profit and are merely rendering a public service,, would the Minister give consideration to the discontinuance of import charges on such equipment. The Minister for Trade and Customs has supplied the following information:Equipment of this kind imported by or for municipal councils issubject to the similar tariff treatment as that imported by other bodies or persons as the customs tariff does not make any distinction in this respect. Where imported equipment is of a class or kind not commercially produced in Australia, consideration is given, upon application to the Department of Trade and Customs, to the question of admission of the equipment, under a customs by-law at a concessional rate of duty - or free of duty whichever is found appropriate. If the honourable member knows of any , instances where customs duty has been levied on plant or equipment imported by a municipal - council which is of a class or kind not commercially produced, in Australia the Minister' - will have the case investigated. GOVERNOR - GENER AL : STAFF.",62
112,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"On the 3 r d December last, the honourable member for R e i d (Mr . L a n g ) asked the following questions:1.

Has his salary been increased to recompense him for the additional work? 3. If so, what is his new salary? 4. Is the Government kept fully informed .regarding changes made from time to time in the Governor General's establishment? 5. What is the appropriate tribunal for the - fixation of wages in the establishment? 0.

I now inform the honourable member as ""follows:1. Yes.. The Official Secretary assumed the - extra duties on the ].3th December. 1947. 2. Yes. 3. New salary range £888-£l,0l2 (actual £1,289). 4. Yes. 5. "" Wages for the members of the domestic staff were fixed by the Department of the Interior, the Treasury and the Commonwealth Public Service Board acting in consultation. Salaries' for' clerical staff were fixed by the Public Service Board. 6. The departmental records do not contain the information sought by the honourable 'member. ' COMMONWEALTH SUPERANNUATION ACT .",63
113,Mr CHIFLEY,Unknown,"On .the 4th December last, the honourable member for Swan (Mr Hamilton) asked the following questions, upon notice:1. Is it a fact that, by recent amendments to the Superannuation Act, retired Commonwealth officers received 25 per centum on the amounts payable to them, to off-set the increased and rising cost of living? 2. Have all Commonwealth retired officers been affected by the increased cost-of living? 3. Why were 175 officers in Western Australia debarred from the relief granted to all other retired officers? 4. Will he take action to eliminate this discrimination so that all Commonwealth retired officers will enjoy equal relief from the effects of the high cost of living? 5. Has he yet considered the claims of the Commonwealth Retired - Officers Association (Western Australian Branch) for consideration in relation to cost-of-living conditions? fi. If so, what was his decision? The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:- ,, 1. By an amendment of the Commonwealth Superannuation Act in June last, pensions payable under that act, except those payable under' section 57 of the act, were increased by 25 per cent. 2. Yes. 3. The retired officers referred to were en titled to free pensions under State law and on transfer to the Commonwealth Public Service, the pension rights were preserved by section 84 of the Constitution. These free pensions are greater than the increased pensions payable under the Commonwealth Superannuation Act. 4. 5 and 0. The matter was referred to a Treasury committee during the parliamentary reefs and a report by that committee is now covering - their receiving consideration by the Government.

In view of the urgent importance of minimizing the danger of cancer, will he explain why the Health Department has made no apparent attempt to investigate the claims of Mr Braund, of Sydney, in the matter, with a view to assessing the merits or demerits of such claims ? 3. Is the Government reluctant to investigate Mr Braund's claims by reason of the opposition of certain'eminent surgeons? 4. Will he give an assurance that the department will leave no stone unturned in order that sufferers of this dread diseasJ may find relief?",63
115,Mr HOLLOWAY,Unknown,"The Minister for Health has supplied the following information :-- 1.
