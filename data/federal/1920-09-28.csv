2,Mr BAMFOED,STATEMENT BY TEE HONORABLE MEMBER,"Has the Minister for Home and Territories seen a paragraph published in this morning's Argus, in which it is stated that the honourable member for West Sydney (Mr Eyan), in the course of a speech in Queensland, on Monday, saidThat, combined with the little piece of legislation which disfranchised 260,000 workers of Australia, succeeded in returning to power a Government in the Federal Parliament. . . . Is it correct that so many electors were disfranchised at the last general election; and, if so; will the honourable gentleman state the reason for it?  ber having intimated to me that he proposed to put this question, I am in a position to furnish the following reply:Apparently Mr Ryan has been misreported. I am not aware of any legislation which could ssibly have the effect of. disfranchising 0,000 persons. The naturalized persons - of enemy birth, not exempted, who'were precluded from voting at the elections held in December, 1919, would not exceed 20,000.",19
3,Mr GROOM,STATEMENT BY TEE HONORABLE MEMBER,For the whole of Australia.  siderably less than one-half of these persons would be workers in the ordinary sense and many of them would have voted for Nationalist candidates. WAE SEEVICE HMS. PURCHASE OF SAW-MILLS AND TIMBER AREAS.,19
4,Mr HIGGS,STATEMENT BY TEE HONORABLE MEMBER,"Has the Treasurer given any consideration to the allegations made with regard to the purchase of sawmills and timber areas by the War Service Homes Commissioner; and, if so, do the Government propose to direct an inquiry to be held?",19
5,Sir JOSEPH COOK,STATEMENT BY TEE HONORABLE MEMBER,"As promised on Friday last, when a question relative to this matter was addressed to me by the honourable member for Corio (Mr Lister), I have made further inquiries and have also consulted the Prime Minister (Mr. Hughes). In addition, I have talked the matter over with the Minister for Bcpatriation (Senator E. D. Millen). I have to say that the Minister, as does the Government as a whole, welcomes the fullest inquiry into these contracts. We have decided in all the circumstances to invite the Public Accounts Committee to inquire into the whole of the contracts, and hope that the inquiry will be as full and oomplete as possible. We have an i excellent Committee to our hand for the purpose. It consists of the honourable member for Perth (Mr Fowler), the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Fleming), the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton), the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton), the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Bayley), 'the honourable member for Swan (Mr. Prowse), and the honourable member for East Sydney (Mr West), as well as Senator Bolton, Senator Buzacott, and Senator J. D. Millen.",19
6,Mr TUDOR,STATEMENT BY TEE HONORABLE MEMBER,A good Committee.,19
7,Sir JOSEPH COOK,STATEMENT BY TEE HONORABLE MEMBER,"I do not think we could have a better one. I hope that it will search these matters to the bottom, so that we. may know what is in these whisperings and innuendoes that are going round. AUSTRALIAN-BORN WttVES OF ENEMY SUBJECTS.",19
8,Mr FENTON,STATEMENT BY TEE HONORABLE MEMBER,"I desire to ask the Prime Minister whether Australian-born women married lo Germans, Austrians, and other enemy aliens who, up to the signing of the Armistice at' all events, were deprived of their citizen rights are to have those rights restored to them? The United States of America has recently taken similar action.",20
9,Mr HUGHES,STATEMENT BY TEE HONORABLE MEMBER,"This is a question to be settled by the Nationality Bill and the naturalization laws generally. A woman takes the nationality of her husband. That has been the law for a very long time, and was not adopted, as the honourable member's inquiry suggests, merely during the time of war. It has been in operation ever since we have been here. Whether we are to alter it remains to be seen. We have on the notice-paper the Nationality Bill, but whether it covers the matter I cannot,, at the moment, say. NA NORTHERN TERRITORY.",20
10,Mr RICHARD FOSTER,COTTON PRODUCTION IN,"Has the Prime Minister noticed that the Imperial Government has recently been endeavouring to stimulate cotton production within the tropical parts of the Empire? If so, will he offer facilities for cotton production in the Northern Territory, where the possibility of growing excellent cotton was demonstrated thirty years ago?",20
11,Mr HUGHES,COTTON PRODUCTION IN,"I have noticed that the British Government is endeavouring - I hope I may say without offencemore or less spasmodically, to encourage the growth of cotton amongst other Empire products. I hardly think it would be correctto say that it is doing so as a component part of a comprehensive policy. One of the effects of its action in that direction in Egypt is that the Egyptians are giving up growing wheat and going in for cotton production. A.3 a result, I think we shall be able to sell to the Egyptian Government quite a lot of our wheat. Thus, indirectly, cotton growing is a very good thing for us, especially when it is carried on in other countries. So far as I know, there never has been any doubt that cotton can be grown here. I know that tea and coffee will also grow here, but the main consideration is as to whether we can grow cotton on a commercially profitable 'basis. To do so, one of two things would be necessary: We should either'have to pick the cottou with cheap labour, or have machines for. the purpose. We cannot get the cheap labour, and the Government would be very glad to offer an inducement.to sti-mulate the sluggish inventiveness of honourable members on both sides of the House, and that of citizens generally who are potential members of this Parliament. That, I hope, will be satisfactory to the honourable member. POSTMASTER-GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT. ALLOWANCE POST OFFICES.",20
12,Mr CUNNINGHAM,COTTON PRODUCTION IN,"the Postmaster-General, upon notice I. What is the maximum allowance that can be paid to Bemi-official postmasters and postmi stresses T 2. In view of the fact that these persons are not allowed to carry on any other business, are they entitled to share in'war bonuses the same as permanent employees of the Service T 3. If not, why nott 4. On what scale are they paid district allowances, and are they entitled to increases in view of the high cost of living? 5. In view of the increase in the price of fuel, &c., are they entitled to an increase in the maintenance allowance paid them for the lighting of offices, &c.T 6. Where offices have to be found, will the amount of rent allowed be increased in view of the considerable increase in the cost of upkeep? 7. What encouragement is given to those conducting these offices who have worked them up to the official status? 8. Will an allowance be made to them for Sunday and holiday work and overtime?",20
13,Mr WISE,COTTON PRODUCTION IN,"The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:1. The minimum payment to a semi-official postmaster is at the rate of £156 per annum (personal allowance). Payment in excess of this rate is made on the nature and volume of business handled. Each case iB dealt with on its merits. 2. No. 3. The bonuses paid to permanent employees arc by Arbitration Court determinations, and are applicable to a section of that class of employee only. 4. On the scale and conditions prescribed in Public Service Regulations Nos. 168 and 169. 5. Payment for lighting, fuel, Jtc., is regulated by the circumstances of each case, calculated to cover the maximum expenditure in thiB connection. 6. The Department makes an allowance to the postmaster in every case equal to the amount of the rental paid for the building in which the post-office is conducted. 7. A semi-official office is not worked up to official status by any' act of the postmaster. When such an office is raised in status every effort is made to retain the services of the postmaster in some other capacity. 8. Consideration will be given to the question of making such allowances.

Mr CUNNINGHAM, asked the Prime in Minister, upon notice I. Is it a fact that the Government contemu plates appointing one particular firm as sole Sydney agent for selling, purchasing, and handling goods and products of firms exproority priated in late-German New Guinea? 2. If so, will the Government, in justice other Sydney Arms, consider the advisability of distributing the agency .work?",21
16,Mr HUGHES,COTTON PRODUCTION IN,The answers to the honourable memher's questions are as follows :1. No. 2. See answer to No. 1. TELEPHONE MECHANICS: PROMOTIONS.,21
17,Mr WISE,COTTON PRODUCTION IN,"On 23rd September, the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr. Watkins) asked the following questions :1. Why are several telephone mechanics in New South Wales who have qualified for promotion as senior mechanics at an examination held before the war, viz., December, 1913, not being promoted to the positions of senior mechanics? 2. What is the object of the Department in holding examinations for promotion to the position of senior mechanic, when there are several officers who have qualified as senior mechanics in 1913 still waiting for promotion? 3. Is it not inequitable and unfair that several mechanics who failed to qualify at the examination held in 1913, but who qualified at a subsequent examination held in 1914, have been promoted over the heads of officers who qualified in 1913? 4. How will the telephone mechanics who qualified as senior mechanics in 1913' stand in regard to promotion with the mechanics who will qualify at the forthcoming senior mechanics' examination being held this month? 5. Will the mechanics who proved their competence and ability for promotion nearly seven years ago receive appointment as senior mechanics before any of the successful candidates from the previously mentioned forthcoming examination ? 6. If not, what is the reason for holding NARCOTICS. competent men back? I* promised the information would be obtained. The. following replies have been furnished by the Acting Public Service Commissioner:1. Because examinations and promotions have been suspended for five years on account the absence of officers at the war. 2. To give senior officers who were at the war opportunity of qualifying for and securing promotion before their juniors are promoted. 3. In pre-war years the examinations were held annually, and the annual examinations will now be resumed. Under an award of the Arbitration Court promotions are to be made order of appointment to the position of mechanic. If examinations were suspended n t i l all who pass in one year were promoted, the advancement of senior officers would be indefinitely postponed, and their loss of seniwould be an unjustifiable hardship. 4. Any senior who passes the forthcoming to examination will have prior right to promot i on during the ensuing twelve months, as the examination is qualifying only. 5. See answer to 4. 6. See answers to questions 2 and 3. DUTY ON WIRE NETTING.",21
18,Mr MASSYGREENE,COTTON PRODUCTION IN,"On Sth September the honourable member for D a m p i e r (Mr . Gregory) asked the following questions :In view of the urgent need by settlers of large supplies of rabbit and dog-proof netting, can the Minister supply the House with information regarding1. What firms are now manufacturing wire netting in Australia? 2. What is the estimated capacity of output in tons of the plants now operating? 3. What tonnage has been produced in Australia during the year 1919-20. 4. If sufficient supplies at a reasonable price cannot be manufactured in Australia to meet present urgent requirements, will the Minister consider the advisability of removing the heavy impost of duty ""in the 1920 Tariff Schedule? I am now in a p o s it i o n to f u r n is h the h o n orable member with the following in for m at i o n :1. Lysaght Bros., Sydney; Victorian Government, Fentridge. 2. Lysaghts, 20,000 tons per annum; Pentridge, about 500 tons per annum; total, 20,500 tons per annum. 3. Lysaghts, 8,000 tons; Pentridge, about 200 tons; total, 8,200 tons. 4. As the imports of wire netting for the year 1920 amounted to, approximately, 1,000 tons only, and there were produced in the same year 8,200 tons, and the estimated capacity for production in Australia is 20,500 tons, there is no justification for the removal of the protection afforded to an important Australian industry. NA SECOND READING . Debate resumed from 22nd September (vide page 4817), on motion, by Mr . WISEThat this Bill be now read a second time.",21
19,Mr TUDOR,POST ANDTELEGRAPHRATES,"Y a r r a ) [ 3 . 1 2 ] not be long in discussing the proposed in creases in postal rates. I admit that when I saw the Budget, and before I heard the statement of the Treasurer and that of the Postmaster-General on this Bill , I imagined that what was proposed was a transfer of the war postage of - i i . per letter or paper to the old rates. I admit that I prefer some of the proposals of this Bill to the War Postage Tax, which merely added £d. per letter or paper to the original' postage, whatever the amount of it might be. For instance, the ordinary householder sending a letter would pay I d . postage on it , and under the War Postage Tax he was called upon to pay l i d . A business house might send letters through the post upon which the postage might be 6d. or Is., and under the War Postage Tax they were required to add only Jd. more to the postage previously chargeable on the letter. I understand that what is proposed by this Bill is that a double rate shall be payable on every article posted.",22
20,Mr WISE,POST ANDTELEGRAPHRATES,Yes .,22
21,Mr TUDOR,POST ANDTELEGRAPHRATES,"So that the ordinary business house sending out. a letter on which the postage is now 6d. will , under this Bill , be required to pay postage to the amount of Is. instead of to the amount of 6 i d . as under the War Postage Tax. I think that on the whole that is a fairer proposal than was the War Postage Tax. I have received a circular from booksellers of Melbourne on the subject of this Bill. I suppose that similar circulars have been sent round in the other States. The booksellers desire to know why the book postage rate should be doubled. They sayWhy double the present rate? Is not a 50 per cent, increase enough? To increase educational facilities is the policy of all civilized countries. Free libraries everywhere aTe the embodiment of this idea. Free libraries, of course, seriously compete with the booksellers just as free overcoats would reduce the business of tailors. .Booksellers are the only traders who have Government and municipal competition, therefore, booksellers deserve special consideration from the State to help them distribute their BILL. wares. We would suggest that booksellers' catalogues and circulars, if printed in Australia, should go through the post at the rate of one half-penny (id.) for four (4) ounces. The wide distribution of these catalogues would considerably increase the postal business in books, thus materially benefiting the postal revenue at the same time. People of the "" Out- I shall Back"" certainly deserve to be treated libera-lly by the Postal Department in the way of literature; books, magazines, and papers are their' great connecting links with civilization. E. W. COLE'S BOOK ARCADE. G. ROBERTSON & Co. MELVILLE & MULLEN PTY. LTD. M. L. HUTCHINSON. METHODIST BOOR DEPOT. .BOOK LOVERS LIBRARY. AUSTRAL LIBRARY.",22
22,Mr WEST,POST ANDTELEGRAPHRATES,Thos e firms have branches in Sydney.,22
23,Mr TUDOR,POST ANDTELEGRAPHRATES,"I believe that they have branches in the other States. In . my opinion, books have a greater educational value than newspapers.",22
24,Mr NICHOLLS,POST ANDTELEGRAPHRATES,The Government bave not taxed newspapers.,22
25,Mr TUDOR,POST ANDTELEGRAPHRATES,"Yes , the proposal is to increase the postage on newspapers proportionately with the increase on other articles. Still, the newspapers have a great advantage. The postage on newspapers before the War Postage Tax was imposed was I d . for 20 ozs., and the postage now is l £ d. for 20 ounces.",22
26,Mr WISE,POST ANDTELEGRAPHRATES,Yes .,22
27,Mr TUDOR,POST ANDTELEGRAPHRATES,"I believe that it does not pay the Post and Telegraph Department to carry newspapers at such a low rate, and many newspapers do not each weigh an ounce. I certainly think' that in all the circumstances the case put up by the booksellers deserves consideration. They complain that they are in competition with the public libraries, but the public libraries obtain their books from the booksellers, and they do not get them for nothing. Lending libraries are referred to in the booksellers' circular, and these send books into the country, which have to be returned. I think that a reduction of the postage in such cases is justified in the interests of people in the country who are entitled to some consideration as compared with people in the city who have libraries practically at their back doors. If the Postniaster-General can see his way to meet the booksellers in this regard I hope that he will do so. I understand that it is impossible for a private member to move for an increase of the rate proposed on newspapers, because that would be imposing taxation.",22
28,Mr MATHEWS,POST ANDTELEGRAPHRATES,"The rate should be in creased. The newspapers are profiteering, and why should they be allowed to do so when they talk so much about others in that connection.",23
29,Mr TUDOR,POST ANDTELEGRAPHRATES,"I agree with the honourable member. He probably refers to the large proprietary newspapers, but they are not affected by this proposal to the same extent as are small newspapers like that published, for instance, by the Single Tax League. In some cases I believe that as many as forty of these small newspapers are covered by the postage charged on 20 ounces.",23
30,Mr WISE,POST ANDTELEGRAPHRATES,Yes ,23
31,Mr TUDOR,POST ANDTELEGRAPHRATES,"They cost as much to deliver as a letter, and I am anxious to know whether something cannot be done to put them on a fairer basis. I regret exceedingly that the Postmaster-General has seen fit to double the rate. The increased rate for telephone messages is not dealt with in this Bill , but will be provided for by regulation. Some honourable members, so far as the Standing Orders will allow, would' like to discuss the question of the increase in telephone rates, as well as the increase in the rate for letter telegrams, which are dealt with in this Bill . I personally held, when we introduced the lettergram, and agreed to send forty words for Is., that we were doing something which probably we would have to go back upon.",23
32,Mr BAMFORD,POST ANDTELEGRAPHRATES,"Hear , hear!",23
33,Mr TUDOR,POST ANDTELEGRAPHRATES,"The honourable member for Herbert (Mr Bamford) agreed with ane when I expressed that view. As I pointed out then lettergrams are chiefly used in big cities, giving the people in metropolitan districts an advantage not enjoyed by persons living in other parts. They are greatly used by business houses who keep their ordinary messages back to take advantage of the lettergram system. I think the Postmaster-General is .taking a step in the right direction by making this increase. However, I do not think he is justified in doubling the rate for the conveyance, of letters throughout Australia. I know that our distances are great, but. as a matter of fact, the majority of the letters posted are for delivery within a circumscribed area. I believe that 90 per cent, of the letters posted in Melbourne are for delivery within a radius of 10 uniles. If an amendment is moved to decrease the (proposed rate I shall support it . On the other hand, I consider that there should be an increase in the postage rate on newspapers in order to bring it more into line with the rates that people are called upon to pay for other postal matter. . Mr Fenton (Maribyrnong) [3.22] - I am pleased to see that the Postmaster-General is keeping in touch with the existing Act by allowing matter printed in Australia to be conveyed at a lower rate than is to be charged for books printed outside Australia. I am pleased also at the proposal to revert to 2d. postage. I opposed the reduction eleven years ago, because I considered that by charging 2d. for the conveyance of a letter considerable revenue could be raised in a very reasonable way. I do not know that the large daily newspapers will derive any great benefit from the magnanimous rates the Postmaster-General proposes fcr the conveyance of newspapers, but as large numbers of their subscribers who are not living close to railway stations are obliged to obtain their papers through the post-office, I presume that they will participate in this concession. There is a good deal of prating in the press about the voting of money by this Parliament, but I notice that the leading journals can form a very solid combine when they seek to impose fresh advertising rates on the public. In the Melbourne daily newspapers at the present time there are almost identical advertisements, increasing the advertising rates. I wonder if the proprietors of these papers consulted their clients by imeans of a referendum before imposing these extra charges, or whether they came under review by any price-fixing tribunal. At any rate, if it were possible to stop the "" s t in k in g fish"" policy adopted by one section of the Australian press in respect to Australian, interests, good vice would be rendered to Australia.",23
34,Mr MAXWE LL,POST ANDTELEGRAPHRATES,"(Fawkner) [3.25] The proprietor of a lending library has drawn attention to the fact that the postage on printed books is now to be doubled, to the great disadvantage of many people who live in country districts, and receive books through the post from lending libraries. Hitherto the postage rate upon a book sent out from one of these libraries has been 2 i d . The rate will now be 5d., but inasmuch as the same amount of postage has to be paid on the return of the book, the total cost of sending out a book to the subscriber to a library and returning it will in futur e be lOd. instead of 5d. When goods are sent out by railway, they are often returned free, and it seems to me that a similar concession a night be made in regard. to books posted by lending libraries to country district subscribers.",24
35,Mr MATHEWS,POST ANDTELEGRAPHRATES,"Melbourne Ports) [3.27] - I am very pleased that the Government propose to revert to 2d. postage. Some people may call it a retrograde step, but I hold that those who get a service should pay for ib. When Mr . "" Henniker He at o n "" Chapman Postmaster-General, he always tried to surround I d . postage with a certain amount of sentiment, but there is no room for sentiment in business matters. The posting of a letter is a business transaction. The letter is intended to convey infonmation for a certain purpose. However, now that we are to have 2d. postage, I hope that greater facilities will be provided in country districts through the extra revenue derived by the Department.",24
36,Sir JOSEPH COOK,POST ANDTELEGRAPHRATES,"There is an extra £1,500,000 on the Estimates for the Post Office,",24
37,Mr MATHEWS,POST ANDTELEGRAPHRATES,"I hope that with this money there will be no need for the ever-recurring demand from honourable members representing country electorates for the increase of country postal services. There ought to be money enough to provide those facilities, and, although I am a representative of a .city constituency, I shall do all I can to assist country members in seeing that the additional revenue derived from 2d. postage is spent on providing postal, telegraphic, and telephonic facilities in country districts. One has only to spend a holiday in an ; isolated country part to realise the disadvantages of the absence of uiieans of ser- communication, both postal and telephonic. In fact, they are so limited that one wonders how it is after all these years we have not become more civilized.",24
38,Mr HILL,POST ANDTELEGRAPHRATES,It is a wonder that any one lives in a country district.,24
39,Mr MATHEWS,POST ANDTELEGRAPHRATES,"E x a c t l y . In 1911, when Mr Josiah Thomas, the then Postmaster-General, brought in a Bill to reduce the postage rate on letters to I d . , I was daring enough to move to' maintain the rate at 2d., because I held that no rate should be imposed which might lead to a loss. At that time, the Post Office was run at an annual loss of £400,000 or £500,000, and I could not consent to a policy which meant a continuation of that loss to the advantage of big commercial houses. To-day I do not think the Government have gone far enough. There is a great deal more sentiment surrounding cheap literature. My experience is that most of the cheap literature sent through the post is not educational, but merely for amusement. I can find no educational value in the sending of cheap prints which are not really newspapers, but are principally advertising media. Coming from Sydney, was members of Parliament, like everybody else, rush to get the Age and Argus in order to see the news. The moment they read the Sydney news, they say, "" That is not the truth , anyhow,"" and they know that, because they have just l e ft Sydney. Yet they will take all the Melbourne news in those papers as gospel u n t il they reach Melbourne, and find that it is not the truth either. If the newspapers gave the truth it might be news, but they do not do so. They only tickle the palate of some people to get their paper in as an advertising medium for some city warehouse or boot shop. The newspaper proprietors ought to pay proper rates of postage. I have always been against the running of cheap trains to send the Melbourne dailies into the country. One reason is that it is done for business, and the State has no right to lose money on it. So fa r as postage is concerned, the papers should payfull'rates. That policy would have many benefits, one of which, is that it would save lies getting into the country. I remember that the Age newspaper, during the great railway strike in Victoria, would print one edition for the country, telling the men in the country that the men in the railways here were going back and scabbing, and another edition for Melbourne stating that the men in the country were scabbing. They used their paper for that purpose, yet the statements were not true. Another good effect of the change I suggest would be to give the country newspapers a chance, and encourage journalism in the with country generally, instead of it being crippled through the ability of the Melmagazines through the post? bourne dailies to reach the country towns with a lot more news and a lot more lies. The printing of country newspapers behalf ought to be helped rather than discourare aged. I have always expected some Gotion. vernment to be game enough to take in hand the task of charging adequate rates to newspapers for their transmission by post. Until the Postmaster-General or petition with the local booksellers. the Treasurer comes up to the scratch that question, he will not be doing justice to the country. There is no reason newspapers, more than any other commodity, should be carried at a loss. am sorry the Postmaster-General or the Government have not seen fit to make them pay their just dues for their transfind mission by post, as is the case with other commodities.",24

They are not asking, for very much. amount of revenue that would. be is not much, if any. In fact, there is a International good chance of the revenue being imdiscussed proved, because if their request to be It allowed to send circulars and catalogues through the post at the rate of ^d. 4 ozs. is granted, the possibility is that the volume of books and magazines ried by the Department will increase. The least we can do for the people live out of the cities is to grant the cession. A great many of them read magazines and similar literature, and this habit ought to be encouraged, because i improvestheir information and widens their literary taste. To grant the quest would at least have a considerable indirect advantage, and involve no direct loss.",25
41,Mr MATHEWS,POST ANDTELEGRAPHRATES,My experience that those who can afford magazines and subscribe to libraries can well pay the crease. [207],25
42,Mr ATKINSON,POST ANDTELEGRAPHRATES,"Yes , but that is not what is really asked for in this case.",25
43,Mr MATHEWS,POST ANDTELEGRAPHRATES,The firms are merely asking for cheap advertising.,25
44,Mr ATKINSON,POST ANDTELEGRAPHRATES,"What is wrong it , if it increases the revenue of the Department from the traffic in books and It is a fair request on behalf of the people who live out of the city radius, and also on of the booksellers themselves, who already subjected to a lot of competiA free library 16 not a benefit to the booksellers, but they have to put up with it .

45,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,POST ANDTELEGRAPHRATES,"EdenI Monaro) [3.36] - I have listened with great interest to the criticisms offered by honourable members, and am surprised to that they take more interest in the welfare of the rich publisher than in that of the poor selector and others in the - I back-blocks, who will have to pay the postage. I am opposed to an increase in the postage rate on the broad ground that it will not produce more I revenue. The history of the world shows that the penny postage is a better reproducer than the twopenny postage, in normal times. The aim of the The world is to obtain uniform postage rates. lost That is the real objective of the Postal Union, .which the matter from all viewpoints. has been proven not only in theory, but in actual practice, that per penny postage yields more revenue than twopenny postage, not alone in Britishcarspeaking countries, but all over thd world. For that reason I am not diswho posed to vote for twopenny postage conunless it can be shown to me that it is going to do some good. I deny that it> will bring in more revenue. If the hist tory of the world shows, as it does, that penny postage is the best revenue proreducer, why put this further impost on the people? A f t e r all, those who suffer most will be the people in isolated districts, far from the centres of civilizais tion, who do not enjoy many of the privileges which we in the cities have. A in - man with a family of three or four half-grown children who want to wr te letters ; will find that this increase is a heavy tax on him, because it practically doubles his postage rates.",25
46,Mr TUDOR,POST ANDTELEGRAPHRATES,"Probably the letter rate pays. If there is any rate that does not pay, it is the newspaper rate.",26
47,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,POST ANDTELEGRAPHRATES,"If the newspaper rate does not pay, why does not the Postmaster-General bring in a proposal to make it pay ? Why make the unfortunate selector and other small toilers in the country districts, debarred as they are from many of the privileges which we enjoy, pay for' the concessions given to the rich newspaper proprietors? If , as the Leader of the Opposition says, the newspaper rate does not pay, and the others do, the Postmaster-General should have brought down a very different proposal from that contained in the schedule. The people in the country are not only being penalized, but, at the same time, their privileges are being cut away. I am not accusing the present Minister (Mr Wise) of doing that, because I believe he has made a proposal to give some increase in the conveniences in country districts. Why tax those people' to pay for the extra privileges which we receive in the city ?",26
48,Mr MAXWELL,POST ANDTELEGRAPHRATES,What about up the rate on Hansard'/,26
49,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,POST ANDTELEGRAPHRATES,"I shall read Hansard with very great pleasure this week, because it will contain the record of charges which the honourable member made in this Chamber. I propose to call.upon him to prove them. I understand that he said that the vote of £150,000 for Canberra was brought in by the Government to bribe me. I shall call upon the honourable member to prove his statement, because no member has a right to come into this chamber and deliberately make assertions that are not true. Even when they are made at the dictation of the Age I cannot excuse him . Immediately one says a word in furtherance of the interest of the people outback, some honourable members, who represent metropolitan and suburban constituencies, regard it as a good joke, but they would take a different view if they lived in the back-blocks, 30 or 40 miles from the comforts and conveniences of civilization, with one mail a week. Even those who live in the cities,- and have two or three deliveries a day, with a public telephone at every corner, sometimes grumble, buttheir grounds of complaint are nothing when compared with these of the people in the country districts, with their scanty mail service and no telephone without a guarantee of revenue. This Bill appears to me to be on a wrong basis; it is in troduced for the purpose of obtaining extra revenue, but it is very much to be doubted whether that will be the result. Last year there was a surplus of £500,000 as a result of postal taxation, and it would be interesting to know where that money has. been expended. Can any country representative say that the postal facilities have been extended in his electorate? As a matter of fact, the reverse is the case, because the privileges hitherto enjoyed are being cut down. Those in charge of little allowance post-offices, who are paid £ 2 or £ 3 per year, are now receiving notices that, owing to the small revenue derived from those offices,. their magnificent remuneration is to be reduced by 10s. I protest against the proposal to increase the postal rates, because, as I have already said, all postal authorities are agreed that the cheaper rate results in the larger revenue. putting Mr RICHARD FOSTER - The present Postmaster-General has given us a better "" deal "" than any of his predecessors.",26
50,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,POST ANDTELEGRAPHRATES,"I ' am not saying a word against the present Postmaster-General, who, we know, is much hampered in his effprts by the lack of material. In any case, there is no reason why the people outback should be penalized, while all improvements are reserved for the benefit of the residents of the cities. The present Postmaster General will , probably have to be two or three years in office before he can change the parsimonious policy that has prevailed in the Department for the last four or five years. Of course, we have been living under war conditions, which excuse anything and everything. It was quite right to raise money for the one supreme purpose of carrying on the war, but, nevertheless, we should insist that further consideration should be given to those who are so badly served postally in the country districts. We do not ask for many extra country mails, but more consideration should be given to the country people, who live under very trying circumstances. There are postal in spectors all over the country, but can any country representative say that an improvement in the services has ever been made at the suggestion of one of these gentlemen or any official of the Department? I do not know of one instance throughout my own extensive constituency; and my belief is that not 5 per cent, of the improvements in the last ten years have been made as the result of any action on the part of the representatives of the Department. It should be an inspector's business to see where improvements can be made, and to make them; and, after all, the Post Office is cot what one might call a financial concern, but must be regarded as a great educator and civilizer, one of the objects of which is to bring the people closer together. I recommend the Postmaster General to alter the present policy. know that the honourable gentleman has already made efforts in that direction, and we ought to-encourage him to make more. I take it that this B i ll is only a temporary measure, for it cannot be supposed for a moment that Australia is going to fall back in the march of progress, though latterly that would appear to have been the case. If the Department cannot provide wires for telephone extension, why not t ry a wireless system? Of course, we all know that any new suggestion of that kind is always "" poohpoohed,"" ' just as was wireless telegraphy when first mooted in Australia. We in the cities have picture shows, theatres, trams, trains, and every comfort and convenience; but the people in the country are very differently circumstanced. W it h them, the arrival of the mail is an event, and it is eagerly met by men from all over the country-the very men who keep the professional men in the cities going. If a tidal wave swamped Melbourne tomorrow, it would not affect, the fertile country districts of Australia; but if these fertile districts were swamped, Melbourne would be nowhere. The present Postmaster^General has certainly tried' to liberalize the terms on which our country mails are carried; but I do not suppose that 50 per cent, of the contractors are carrying out their contracts without a loss, owing to the increased price of fodder, and so forth . I should warmly support the proposals in this B i as a means of taxation, if they would result in more revenue; but that, I feel [207]- 2 sure, would not be the case. For a month or two, more revenue may result, but the experience of the world is that the lower rate is more effective. Probably, these remarks apply,' also, to the' charges for telegrams, for the cost is the same whether a message be sent .10 or 100 miles. As I said before, the Bill , in my opinion, is on a wrong basis, and I hope that the Government will accept some improvingamendments in Committee.",26
51,Mr BELL,POST ANDTELEGRAPHRATES,"Darwin) [3.4S] - F o r much the same reasons as those advanced by the honourable member for Edei> Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman), I do not feel inclined to support the proposed in creased charges on letters and telegrams. If the increases would result in more reI venue, and that revenue were used to give better facilities in country districts, and to increase the remuneration of the keepers of allowance post-offices, they would be supported by the majority of honourable members. We have asked repeatedly for extended postal facilities in country districts, and we would be very ungenerous if we did not give the present Postmaster General all the credit due to him for the improvements that have already been made at his instance during the short time he has been in office. ' I am of opinion, however, that it is not necessary to increase the postal rates in order to effect the desired improvement to our country postal and telegraph services. B y still further cutting down the facilities enjoyed by city residents, and by due economy in the many branches of the Postmaster General's Department, we can make such a saving as will render the proposed in creases entirely unnecessary. It - cannot be denied that though the Economies Commission very severely criticised the administration of the Postal Department, and suggested where economies might be made to the amount of many thousands of pounds annually, the only recommendation of that body to which it is proposed to give effect is that increasing the salaries of the higher paid officials. I avail myself of this opportunity to bring under the notice of the Postmaster General one of the improvements which l l , may well be adopted in our country districts-a n improvement which is desirable both in the interests of rural residents and of the departmental revenuethe keeping open of our post and telegraph offices t ill 8 p'.m. This demand is being made in the country districts throughout Australia.",27
52,Mr SPEAKER,POST ANDTELEGRAPHRATES,Order ! The honourable member is getting away from the subject-matter of the Bill .,28
53,Mr BELL,POST ANDTELEGRAPHRATES,"I hope that it is permis_ sible for me to mention the fact, because the adoption of the course which I have suggested, would result in such an in creased revenue as would obviate the necessity for increasing postal rates in country districts. Our farmers are usually busy t ill late in the evening, and it is very seldom that one of them can be communicated with over the telephone t ill 6 p.m. If the post-offices in country centres were kept open until 8 o'clock each evening I am confident that the business transacted by them would be almost doubled. This matter is one which is worthy of serious icon&ideration at the hands of the Postmaster-General. I agree very largely with the remarks of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr . Chapman) in regard to postal administration, but he will not endorse my view that whilst the Government can find money to squander upon building the Federal Capital we should not support any increase in taxation.

60,Mr FENTON,POST ANDTELEGRAPHRATES,"Maribyrnong) [3.58] shillThere is a wonderful difference between the postal rates charged upon newspapers today and the rate which was operative twenty years ago. At that time, the smallest newspaper proprietor was obliged to pay \ & . postage upon each 'newspaper forwarded through the post. Now the rate is only l£d. for 20 ozs. Of course, this rate will not touch the proprietors of the great dailies, because 'they are in a position to increase the prices of their papers, and also of their advertisements.",28
61,Mr WISE,POST ANDTELEGRAPHRATES,And country newspapers cannot do that.,29
62,Mr FENTON,POST ANDTELEGRAPHRATES,"If they did, they would lose the majority of their subscribers.

I do not know if pressure has been brought to .bear upon the Treasurer by the picture theatre managers, and if he fears their influence because of their opportunities to crititise him by means of their picture films, but I feel that he would be doing a statesmanlike act if he refused to differentiate between one for m of amusement and another.

I am glad to learn, as regards first-class theatrical entertainments and concerts, that the relief is to be granted on the lowest priced tickets. My experience of theatrical shows in Australia is that they are among the best and cheapest in the - world. Upon every occasion of my r e turn from travel abroad I 'have been surprised afresh at the reasonableness of the prices charged as well as by the high standard of the talent displayed. We should do all that may be reasonably expected to encourage those people who spend large sums upon the salaries of highly talented artists, in order that Australian audiences may be provided with a splendid type of entertainment.  [4.24] - I had intended to appeal to the Treasurer to grant exemption in respect of one particular class of public entertainers, bu t I understand that the amendment of the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Tudor) will cover my purpose. I refer to country bands, and I do not know that I would press for exemption for bands in country parts alone; I would like to see exemption granted in regard to all bands. These organizations do excellent work for charitable purposes; but their general financial state, so far as my experience of country bands goes, is always more or less precarious.

If I read the schedule aright, it is proposed to exempt tickets, up to 3s., in the matter of cinematograph shows, theatre performances, concerts, &c., while the lowest priced tickets to sporting and athletic attractions, such as football, cricket, and swimming matches, are to be taxed. What is the motive of the Government in taxing a 6d. ticket issued in connection with a cricket match, and in releasing from taxation a similarly priced ticket to a oicture show ? I admit, of course, that what may be regarded as entertainment by one individual would probably be boredom to another. There does not appear to be any reason why the tax should not be similar on all classes of entertainments. We should not endeavour to discourage outdoor amusements, and confer a benefit on the many thousands who nightly patronize picture shows. If there is to be any differentiation, it should be in the interests of those who patronize outdoor amusements, which are more healthy, and certainly better for the individual. I do not think there should be any proposal to exempt or reduce amusement taxes in any direction, particularly when we are in such dire distress for revenue.",32
96,Mr BLUNDELL,POST ANDTELEGRAPHRATES,Were we not promised that this was to be a war-time tax only?,32
97,Mr BELL,POST ANDTELEGRAPHRATES,"I do not know anything about a promise; and if one was made, I am not responsible. Even if a promise has been made, I cannot see any reason why we should exempt or reduce the tax on certain forms of amusement, and continue it on others. It does not appear to me to be just.

The tax should be imposed on those who are conducting entertainments for profit. The honourable member for Maranoa (Mr .

The tax should also apply to all who conduct cinematograph shows or other entertainments conducted as a business, but it he would ought not to apply to entertainments arranged for charitable purposes. A gentleman who had been instrumental in raising over £20,000 for the charities of Western Australia by means of concerts and other entertainments some time ago failed to observe a regulation of the Department in connection with a concert that he held in one of the suburbs of Perth, with the result that he was brought before the Court and heavily fined. Representations were made to the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation, who recommended a reduction of the fine to £ 5 for each offence.

I full y realise the demands that will be made upon the Commonwealth by the timethat we have made arrangements ta honour all our promises and have provided for those who' were maimed or blinded during the war. Much still remains to be done. Heavy bills will have to be met, and I know of no better way of providing for such liabilities than by imposing a heavy tax upon luxuries and a tax on entertainments, race meetings, and sports gatherings generally. The tax should, of course, be proportionate to the charges for admission. Such taxation would tend, in some degree, to in duce the people to economize; it is the duty of the Government to not only practise, but to enforce, economy, and I would support a heavy tax on expensive luxuries-.

The fire brigade in the same town had in tended about the same time to hold a dance, but as the necessary permission had not arrived from the Taxation Department, the promoters were compelled to hold it in the fire station instead of the public hall, and to make a collection at the door instead of a charge for admission.

By means of this Bill I am really salvaging a littl e out of the wreck and r u in of the tax which was agreed to by both sides of the House. .My honourable friends, instead of asking me to with draw the Bill , ought to compliment me on my action.

120,Mr BRUCE,POST ANDTELEGRAPHRATES,"Flinders) [4.49] - I agree with the,view that it is a mistake to remove this tax. There are two* outstanding reasons .why"" it should be continued. As-1' see the position, the enormous revenue charges with-which we are faced absolutely preclude the removal, of any taxation unless it is so hopelessly just that it would be an iniquity to allow it to remain. It is difficult at this stage to make the point that is in one's mind as to the whole question of taxation. ""We have not had an opportunity to consider our present or future position with regard to our revenue as opposed to our obligatax tions; but when we do we shall have tc approach the whole matter in a very serious spirit. I think we shall be a little startled when we realise what we shall be faced with in the next financial as distinguished from the year for which we have already made some attempt provide. Another factor which it appears to me divided. must be considered very seriously is that we have no hope of making our way through our present financial troubles unless every member of the community, from the highest to the lowest, realizes how essential it is to economize. I unhesitatingly admit that this tax is most Blundell, R. P. keenly felt by all classes, and particuBrennan, F . larly by those whose incomes are small. Fenton, J . E . It is the very tax, however, that we Lazzarini, H .

J. that we can safely travel in the future. Best, Sir Robert I have a l o t of sympathy for those with Bruce, S. M . small incomes who have to pay this tax. Cameron, The cinematograph show, in particular, Cook, Sir Joseph has brought brightness into the lives of Cook, Robert many such people in this and other parts of the world. It is, therefore, to me a Foster, matter for deep regret that it should be Gregory, H . necessary to impose such a tax, or to do Groom, L .

G. necessary for us to drive home to the Makin, N . J. 0. people the lesson that they have to be Evan, T. J. taught. One other aspect of this question which ought also"" to be emphasized is that, while with one hand we are giving l i p certain revenue which has come to the Government by way of the entertainments tax, we are replacing it by f u r ther taxation upon the postal facilities of this country. That cuts the ground from.under the argument that the poor unpeople of our cities, while, this tax remains, are deprived of the facilities that were offered them before its imposition to visit a .picture show. Even if they are slightly penalized, the unfortunate residents of country districts who have no cinematograph shows which but for this they might attend, are to be penalized by being called upon to pay extra postal taxation so that city residents may have restored to theon the extra facilities for attending places of amusement which year they enjoyed before the war.

I see as clearly as does any other honourable member, and have seen for years, the tremendous difficulties confronting us in making both ends meet owing to the debt with which Australia is saddled, and I recognise the necessity of inducing every member of the community to practise economy; but as this promise was made to the country by the Government, we cannot blame them for adhering to it , and, in the circumstances, I shall vote with the Treasurer on this schedule.",35

So far as any promise with regard to the remission of this tax is concerned, I know nothing of it, and am not bound by it. Further, if the Government were pledged to the remission of the entertainments tax, they are not pledged to its remission in part, as applied to special entertainments such as cinematograph shofws, theatre performances, and concerts, and to retain it as applied to other forms of recreation and amusement. I can see no justification for what is now proposed, and I shall be surprised to hear the Treasurer (Sir - Joseph Cook) claim that the Government are adhering to the letter to the promise which has been referred to. I shall be very sorry if the Government press this schedule to a vote, as I feel sure that a majority of honourable members realise that a mistake is being made. We should eadeavour to be as consistent as possible, and if we wish to be consistent and fair, we cannot justify this proposal. I hope that the Treasurer will look at the matter from this point of view. I do not see how honourable members representing country districts can possibly vote for this schedule. People in the districts they represent have very few opportunities of enjoying such forms of amusement as are proposed to be exempted from taxation under this schedule. Apart from any question of town or country, a member of the community who likes to attend a football match on a Saturday should not, in the matter of taxation, be treated differently from another who prefers to spend a few shillings at a picture show during the week. This proposal is quite inconsistent, and I am opposed to it.",36

195,The CHAIRMAN,POST ANDTELEGRAPHRATES," I have not yet given any ruling upon the - proposal of the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory), although I stated that, in my opinion, it was out of order because it is not competent for a member of the Committee to submit any proposal which would have the effect of increasing taxation. The position is clearly set out in standing order 171, which readsNo amendment for the imposition or for the increase of a tax, rate or duty shall be proposed by any non-official member in any Comr i g h t ; all mittee on any Bill . But when I expressed my opinion upon the proposal of the honourable member for Dampier I overlooked the fact that we are not now dealing with a Bill , but with a resolution in Committee of Ways and Means. T. am, therefore, obliged to recall a ruling which I gave in the first Parliament of the Commonwealth, when the first Tariff was under consideration. Upon that occasion a has non-official member of the Committee sought to increase a rate of duty, whereupon I ruled that at that stage, and at that stage only, it was competent for au honourable member to move in the direction indicated. I then gave my reasons for that ruling. A very long debate ensued, in which the greatest constitutionalists of that day, including the late Sir George Reid, the late Mr Alfred. Deakin, and a number of others took part. A f t e r I had given my ruling, the to matter was referred to the late Mr . Speaker Holder for his final decision. He - listened attentively to the debate which followed, and, in a very lengthy ruling, stated that, much against his wish, he had to confess that the ruling which I had given was in order, and that, therefore, it would stand. Having ruled in the way that I did upon that occasion, I must give a similar ruling now.",42

(o) For every pound sterling of the income of a company distributed to the members, shareholders, or stockholders of the company who are absentees, and of interest paid or credited by the company to any person who is an absentee in respect of debentures of the company, or on money lodged at interest with the company by such person, the rate of tax shall be Eightpence. n This Bill imposes the rates of income tax for the f in a n c i a l year 1920-21. As I in dicated in the B u d g e t speech it is the in t e n t i o n of the Government to propose a general increase in the income tax r at e of 5 per cent, on the rates of the preceding year. I find that that announcement is misapprehended in many quarters. People imagine that we are imposing a new rate of 5 per cent, on the total income of the people. That is not so. It is a 5 per cent, increase on the rates of last year; that is to say, a person who paid £ 1 0 0 in taxation last year will pay £ 1 05 under this proposal. The proposed rates represent an increase of 70§ per cent, over the rates originally fixed in 1915. It will be remembered that those rates were first increased by 25 per cent, in 1916, and in 1918 the rates then in force were further increased by 30 per cent. This increased the original 1915 rates by 62£ per cent. The present proposal means an increase of 5 per cent, on the 1915 rates, plus 5 per cent, on each of the latter increases mentioned. The first, second, and third schedules of the Bill are on the same basis as those of the original Act . It is not considered desirable to revise the schedules so as to embody the proposed rates of tax, as it would be necessary to so revise them as to set out the curves of the second and third degrees increased by that percentage. Such schedules would be complicated and cumbersome, and I therefore propose to leave the curves alone for the time being.",43
200,Mr JAMES PAGE,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,Kee p to straight; never mind the curves.,45
201,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,But the curves remain in the Bill .,45
202,Mr WEST,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,"The Treasurer does not understand them. Sir JOSEP H COOK - No , and I am sure the honourable member does not. The better method for the present is to retain the original schedule, and.to provide in the substantive portion of the A for the addition of certain specified percentages to the amounts as calculated under the schedules. Although the desirability of abolishing the schedules in the present form, with a view to the substitution of a simpler form, has been considered, it is not deemed desirable to alter the present method, pending the report of the Royal Commission on Taxation, which is now beginning its investigations into the whole incidence of taxation, Federal and State. All previous collections of income tax have been made on the basis of those schedules, and, consequently, the additional amount of tax to be derived from' any percentage of in crease can be calculated with accuracy. If these schedules were cast aside, and some simpler method were introduced, it could not be guaranteed with any degree of certainty that the incidence of the rates would remain the same, and that the desired amount of tax would be collected. A very difficult process of adjustment. would be entailed. The curves would require to be examined and mathematically drawn again; therefore, it is better, on the whole, to leave them alone for the present. In connection with the 5 per cent, increases, one or two litle anomalies occur. For instance, as regards the rate on cash' prizes in lotteries, the rate last year was 13 per cent., and as a 5 per cent, increase on this would give only a fractional increase on the previous rate, for simplicity of calculation the rate has been increased to 14 per cent. Similarly, in the case of companies, as the exact 5 per cent, increase would make the rate on undistributed profits of a company 2s. 7 ^ . , it has been decided to fix the rate at 2s. 8d. This will make for simplicity of calculation in the assessment, and, in addition, the Department will get an extra *d. in the £ 1 .",45
203,Mr TXJDOR,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,"Y a r r a ) [ 6 . 1 9 ] - I am the sorry that we have not before us the In come Tax Assessment Act, which fixes the amount of general exemption and the amount to which a parent shall be entitled to deduct for each child. The Federal Act is much fairer in that respect than are some of the State Acts, which give no exemption for children. I have said on each occasion when the In come Tax Bill has been before Parliament during the last two or three years, c t that the exemption of £ 1 56 is not of anything like the assistance that it was when it was fixed in 1915. The (purchasing power of money today is much less; £ 3 per week then had probably a greater purchasing power than £ 4 has today. The amount of the general exemption should be increased. The increase in the rate of tax which the Treasurer is proposing is more than 5 per cent. If a man was paying £ 1 0 0 in income tax in 1915, he had to pay under the 1916 Act £ 1 2 5 . Since then, we added the supertax of 30 per cent., not on to the £100, but on the £ 1 2 5 . . This would represent £ 3 7 , which, added to the £ 1 2 5 , would bring the amount to over £ 1 6 2 , really more than is estimated under this measure. Taxation Department officials use a ready reckoner, which shows what each £ 1 of income is liable for under these curves. They merely added the 25 per cent., then - the supertax of 30 per cent., and now they will add this proposed 5 per cent, increase.",45
204,Mr FENTON,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,"When these resolutions are submitted, it would be much better ir we had a simple illustration of what an ordinary income would be called upon to bear.",46
205,Mr TUDOR,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,"That would not be a bad idea. On page 20 of the Budget papers there is set out a table showing that individuals and companies with in comes of £1,000 and upwards paid over £9,000,000 out of a total of £10,800,000 income tax collected last year, but if we look at the percentage of total tax assessed, we find that the only substantial increase is in the case of incomes of £10,000 and upwards. Since 1915-16, they have increased 6.9 per cent. The percentage of total tax assessed has in creased, in the case of incomes below this amount, from about i per cent, to 1 per cent. I agree with the Treasurer that the Taxation Commission may be able to throw some light upon the incidence of taxation, but Parliament must take any responsibility for altering the exemption limit , and of deciding how the tax shall be borne by the community. When the  was Acting Treasurer last year, in the absence of Mr W at t , I brought under his notice the fact that, while an exemption is granted in the case of unmarried persons who may be supporting relatives, a married man who may also be contributing to the support of relatives does not enjoy this relief. This, I think, is a matter which might well be inquired into by the Taxation Commission. I have no objection to the Bill at the present time. tion adopted. I understand the Treasurer is anxious to get these taxation proposals through in order that they may become operative for the current year, but I think we oug^ to deal with the question of raising the exemption in the Income Tax Assessment Act .",46
206,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,"The Commission will inquire into the incidence of the income tax. Mr TUDOR , - It is all very well for The the Treasurer to say that. The Commission will, no doubt, look into the incidence of the tax, but if we allow the present exemptions to stand the Commission will not be able to do anything in that direction. In sub-paragraph b of paragraph G, it is provided that the tax payable by any personwith a gross income of not less than £100, or in the case of a person carrying on a business.in Australia, with an income from the business of not less than £100, after making allowable deductions under the Income Tax Assessment Act, shall be taxed £ 1 . But that does not affect the exemption of the ordinary citizen.",46
207,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,"We are not proposing to alter that in any way. Mr TUDOR , - I know that. The only - alteration is this 5 per cent, increase, and it will operate in the case of a person winning Tattersall's Sweep, which is about the only lottery in Australia.",46
208,Mr MATHEWS,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,No . There is a lottery in Queensland.,46
209,Mr TUDOR,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,"Yes. The Queensland lottery, I understand, is called the Golden Casket. We have been told that the undistributed profits of companies will now be taxed to the extent of 14 per cent., the rate, I understand, 'being increased from 2s. 6d. to 2s. Sd. I repeat that I am anxious to increase the exemption of ordinary incomes, which was fixed in 1915-16 at an average of £3 per week. The Treasurer, no doubt, is quite right in endeavouring to get his taxation proposals through, but we .did not expect to deal with them today, and when we enter upon the discussion of the Budget the new imposts will be operative.",46
210,Unknown,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,"Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 8 p.m. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported. Standing Orders suspended; resoluOrdered prepare and bring in a Bill to carry out the foregoing resolution. Bill presented by Sir JOSEPH COOK, and read a first time. SECOND READING . - Motion (by Sir JOSEPH COOK) proposed - That this Bill be now read a second time. - Mr TUDOR (Y a r r a ) [8.4] - Since this is not a'machinery Bill , I take it that the House will not be free to deal with various phases of the levying of income taxation, such as have already been indicated and discussed in this Chamber. The honourable member for Lilley (Mr Mackay) introduced motion some months ago which was agreed to, I understand, without division, and which was to the effect that the , Government be recommended to introduce the principle of assessing the income of primary' producers upon an average taken over a period of five years. That is something different from any procedure hitherto followed with respect to taxation in Australia. The idea is that if 2>rimary producers 6uffer from a bad season they should be able to spread its effects over a five-year period; or, that if there are four bad seasons among the five they should not be asked to pay income tax separately upon that prosperous fifth season, but should be assessed upon an average covering the whole period. I understand from - the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) that this inatter is among those submitted to ths recently appointed Royal Commission.",46
211,Mr MACKAY,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,The House was promised that that would be done.,47
212,Mr TUDOR,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,"I take it , then, that we must wait u n t i l the Commission has presented its report. I do not know whether' the Commission will be free to report generally, also, upon the matter of exemption. I desire that the matter of exemption shall be reviewed, both in respect of married and single persons. The levying of a tax of £ 1 upon people in receipt of incomes of £100 will h it certain grades of school teachers very hard. Numbers today are receiving £ 1 0 0 , and, what with the ever increasing cost of living, they are finding it more and. more difficult, year by year, to live. Their salaries have not increased proportionately to the cost of things, so that they will not be in a position to meet the demands of the Taxation Commissioner. It is my intention, in Committee; to move for the insertion of a new clause to raise the exemption not - only in respect of single persons, but also with the object of making the general exemption higher than £ 1 5 6 . Wages in various industries have been increased on account of the. cost of living, but men today are finding themselves worse off at £200 per annum than when their pay was £ 1 5 6 , prior to the war. Knibbs points out that the increase in the cost of most of our necessary staples of food and clothing amounts to nearly 100 per cent.",47
213,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,"That is on some a things. ' Mr TUDOR - Practicall y everything required in an ordinary home has doubled in price. On most articles of wearing apparel that is certainly the case; while in regard to food and groceries the increases are, according to Knibbs, between 60 and 70 per cent. Sir JOSEPH C o o K . ^ And the total in crease in the cost of living, so Mr . Knibbs says, is about 40 per. cent. '",47
214,Mr TUDOR,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,I am surprised to hear that.,47
215,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,So was I .,47
216,Mr TUDOR,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,"I think the general in crease will be found to be much more than 40 per cent.; but, even if such were the case, and taking that percentage as a basis, the exemption should be raised to £218.",47
217,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,"That is a curious kind, of reasoning.",47
218,Mr TUDOR,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,"At any rate, I shall endeavour, in Committee, to secure the raising of the exemption.",47
219,Mr JOWETT,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,"Grampians) [ 8 . 1 1 ] - I do not seeany reason for delaying the assessment of income tax over a five years' average u n t i l the report of the Taxation Royal Commission shall have been presented. Honourable members have' fully discussed and unanimously agreed' upon this method, and the Government must have accepted it as. a very strong recommendation. From the inception of ' the Country party, the principle has comprised one of the most i m portant planks in our platform. Many other honourable members, beside those in the Country party, strongly favour the granting of this just and equitable concession. As for the argument that it has not hitherto been tried in Australia, 'we need not go further for - precedent than to examine the history of income taxation in Great Britain. Practically, since the levying of taxation on income was first adopted, the method of averaging on a basis of three yearshas been practised. It has always been recognised in England, at any rate, that to levy separately, from year to year is grossly unjust to those engaged in somewhat hazardous and precarious pursuits. Seeing that the system has been long tried, and is unquestionably accepted in the Mother Country, where seasons are not so precarious as in Australia, it is only right that the Commonwealth Government should adopt a like procedure. However much seasonal conditions may vary in Great Britain , the variation in Australia is considerably more marked, and the difficulties of those engaged in the primary and secondary industrieswhich are closely allied to our primary industries-ar e immensely greater than in the Old Country. 1 do not intend to labour the question; but I ask the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) even if an amendment be not moved when the Bill is in Committee, to give the House some assurance that this matter will be taken into full and adequate consideration, and that an opportunity will be given to enable this House to come to a decision. I hope it is not the intention of the Government, upon this point at all events, to wait until the whole matter has been threshed out by a Royal Commission. The question at issue is of vital importance to those engaged in country districts, and particularly those connected with our primary industries. Our primary producers are unanimously i u favour of the proposal, and I feel so strongly on the subject that I . again ask the Treasurer to give the House some assurance that the Government will not wait until the report of the Royal Commission is furnished befcrs taking action, but that he will make an endeavour to bring the change into operation as soon as possible.",47

When the motion was before the House the then Treasurer promised that the question would be referred to a Royal Commission, which was to be appointed to go thoroughly into the question of taxation, and, personally, I . have every confidence that that will be done. I feel certain that it would be practically impossible to immediately bring this reform, which is generally regarded as a very necessary one, about. I can see that it will take considerable time before it can be successfully brought into operation, and it is, therefore, likely that some time must elapse before a scheme that will be generally acceptable can be introduced. I cannot think that the honourable member for Grampians (Mr Jowett) is really in earnest when he asks the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) to give a definite promise to introduce the reform forthwith.",48
221,Mr JOWETT,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,I am quite in earnest.,48

233,Mr GREGORY,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,I realise that; but in discussing measures of this nature other questions relating to taxation naturally arise.,49
234,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,But they cannot be dealt with on this Bill .,49
235,Mr GREGORY,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,"I understand that, the and it was my intention to draw the the attention of the Leader of the Opposito tion (Mr Tudor) to that fact. Nevercover the less, ""honourable members generally no consider that when a measure of this show character is before the Chamber they have an opportunity of drawing the attention of the Government to certain specific in the hope of obtaining promises that legislation will be \brought forward give relief where they consider it necesare sary. It was my intention to deal with the question of exemptions, which has already been mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition, but I can see that there is no opportunity to do so on this occasion. I may say, however, that I am a great believer in every one paying something, have lost. however small, in the form of direct taxation, because it helps people to become better citizens and to realise their responsibilities when selecting their political representatives. In view of the great increase in the cost of living think it would be wise for the Governaged ment to give consideration to the question raised by the Leader of the Opposition, but the better way would be relieve is taxpayer according to the family he has to support, instead of increasing the exemption. If such posal were submitted to the House i would have my support. Some time various matters were brought before the surer (Mr W at t ) . Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook), and a Royal Commission has been appointed to make full inquiries. I was out of the Chamber when the Treasurer delivered his speech, and I would, thereducers, fore, like to ascertain whether we are likely to have the report of that Commission during the present, session, and whether it will be possible to give effect to its recommendations if the Government approve of them.",49
236,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,"I hope so. an Mr GREGORY - The matter is of great importance, and I have received communications from all parts of the country. Here is one from the Producers Association's Central Council of New South Wales, which readsFor some years past, it has been very apparent that the system of taxing the primary producers upon the results of each individual year's operations has proved most inequitable and unfair owing to the extreme fluctuations that come from seasonal conditions. One year taxpayer has to pay upon a large profit, am', next year he may have a huge loss owing drought, and it may take him years to rehis position; but, except that he pays no tax on the year of his extreme loss, he gets other relief, for, as soon as he can again a profit over working expenses, the Taxation Department is down upon him again, though his previous year's loss may have only matters been covered in a small degree. That is apparent to every man who goes to on the land. Periods of severe drought usually followed by exceptionally heavy rains and floods, and it often happens that thousands of head of stock are destroyed. Many poor devils who have been contending against drought for years lose their stock when heavy rains f all, and are frequently called upon to pay taxation upon the value of the stock they Surely there"" is something grossly unfair which compels these people to pay taxation upon the value of stock which they have lost, after having spent considerable money in an endeavour to keep them alive. In Great B r it a in . the I income of a primary producer is averover a period of three or five years.",49
237,Mr JOWETT,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,Thre e yearb.«,49
238,Mr GREGORY,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,"Then I think the to same principle' should apply in Australia. We have passed some very unfair taxation proposals in this Chamber, a proand I am never likely to forget the t amendment of the war-time profits tax, ago brought forward by the late TreaA n y one who realizes the huge expanse of territory we have in our back country, and who knows the vicissitudes and hardships experienced by many of our primary procan realise how unfairly the wartime profits tax haa affected many of. fchem. They have had to contend against difficulties and dangers year in and year out, and surely, when it comes to a question of taxation, .they are worthy of some consideration. on previous occasions, referred to a man who had invested £17;000 in the back country, and who, for seven years prior to the war, showed a loss. In the first year after the war he showed a profit of £1,200, and in the next year £4,800, but after paying land tax and income tax on that £4,800, which was a book profit only, as he might lose the whole of it the next year, he was asked to contribute £2,750 as a war-time profits tax. On the other hand, a man may remain in the city and place a similar amount of capital out on mortgage, which would give him an assured income without the slightest risk. The man on the land had to pay £2,750 on an income of £4,800, but the man who had money out on mortgage would not have to contribute a single penny, even if he in the same period earned £50,00 0 or more as a commission agent, because he made his income with his' brains. That is a grave reflection on the laws of this country, and such a provision is gmgsly unfair. I have also heard of another man who, in 1911, showed a lossof £ 8 4 0 : in 1912 a loss of £ 6 2 3 ; in 1913 a loss of £ 1 2 6 ; in 1914 a profit of £ 2 8 3 , and in 1915 a profit of £158I n . 1916 he made a loss of £ 3 3 . He had a large amount of capital invested, and after battling* in the bush, against nature for all these years, he showed a net loss of £1,18 1 up to the 30th June, 1916. For the year 1916-17 he showed a book profit of £ 3 , 0 3 5 , and for ,the year 1917-18 a book profit' of £2,506. In respect of those two years, after paying land and income tax, he was called upon to pay £1,703 by way of war-time profits taxation. words, this man, allowing'for his losses, was asked to pay to the Commonwealth by way of taxation 70 per cent, of his actual income. ""No one will say that that is fair.",49
239,Mr BRUCE,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,It is all due to the fact that an averaging clause was not inserted in the original Bill .,50
240,Mr GREGORY,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,That does not apply so much to the war-time profits tax.,50
241,Mr BRUCE,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,"It does. Such a provision was inserted in the British Act, but it was omitted fro m the Commonwealth Act.",50
242,Mr GREGORY,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,"In connection with the war-time profits tax, we gave pasI have, toralists the right to average their in come over a period of six years.",50
243,Mr BRUCE,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,Accordin g to the pre-war standard.,50
244,Mr GREGORY,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,"Yes . U n for t u nately, while it was agreed that their war-time profits taxation should be based on their average profits for six years prior to the war, the House refused to insert in the original Bill a clause suggested by me under which the pastoralists would have been allowed 10 per cent, on their capital', and would have been taxed on all income in excess of that amount. I should have been satisfied with such a provision. I mention these matters, not because they actually come within the scope of the Bill before us, but to show how necessary it is that the Government should review as quickly as possible their whole system of taxation. Every honourable member, no matter on what side of the House he sits, desires that something like fair play shall be meted out to all sections of the community. Income tax based on book profits may be all very well in the case of the ordinary business man, who is permitted to make a reduction in respect of bad debts, and whose stock is such that it will be of value in the succeeding year; but it is not apfighting plicable to those engaged in primary pursuits. It may not work any serious injustice in the case of pastoralists in Victoria, where a drought rarely occurs,but it is wholly unjust .in the case of men who take up country that is subject to periodical droughts. It should be our object to help and encourage such people. The more wealth they can produce, the In other better for the country. The man who can m'ake huge profits should certainly be compelled to pay income tax upon them, but the taxation should be based, not upon his book profits, but upon his actual earning."", and when the opportunity arrives I shall strongly press for an amendment in this direction. Here is yet another fallacy associated with the Income Tax Department. The taxation authorities require of every grazier a complete balance-sheet, and they value every lamb and calf produced upon his jiroperty and tax him accordingly, although, he may not have realized upon them.",50
245,Mr BAMFORD,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,Stoc k increases do not necessarily represent income that has been realized.,51
246,Mr GREGORY,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,"The Department holds that they do, and it requires graziers to pay income tax upon the value of every lamb raised on their holdings.",51
247,Mr TUDOR,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,"That taxation, however, is based upon a value of about 10s. per sheep.",51
248,Mr GREGORY,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,"The valuation varies j it is less in the north than it is in the south. I know of a man who bought a station in the northern part of Western Australia, on which there were a number of cattle. Desiring to convert it into a sheep-station, he sent 400 head of cattle down south to Cue. I dare say that those cattle in ordinary circumstances would have been worth from £ 1 2 to £ 1 5 per head, but after allowing for the cost of droving, selling, and losses en route-owin g to the drought there was lack, of water on the route, and nearly every head of cattle was lost-the owner of this station made an actual loss of £120 on the sale, when he lost all his cattle, and £ 1 2 0 in addition. Extreme difficulty was experienced in inducing the Taxation Department to believe that loss .came within the scope of the section in the Ac t which provides for deductions in . respect of losses due to drought. It was said that the drought had not occurred on the station property, and that, therefore, the case did not come within the 1 meaning of the Act. I cite this case with the 'object of emphasizing the point that a man should be compelled to pay income tax , only upon the profits actually realized 1 1 by him. Sooner or later a grassier must realise upon hisstock, and when he doe - whe n he secures payment^-h e should be taxed. Honourable members would not think of paying taxation in respect of salary which they had been promised but had not received. In the case of the primary producer income tax should be levied on the average basis, and should be collected only in respect of profits actually made. Another point is that the income tax assessment fonms should be simplified. It ought to be possible for the Department to prepare a form compelling taxpayers to furnish all the information required, and yet so simply framed that the average man would be able to f ill it in without having to seek the assistance of agents. The Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) has promised that the Taxation Commission will be asked to make recommendations for the simplification of income tax forms, and I hope that when those recommendations are made they will receive treatment different from that meted out to those previously made in connection with other taxation proposals. Some time agoa Conference of the Federal and State Commissioners of Taxation was held, and one of the most important decisions arrived at. was that the profits of companies should be taxed at their, source. In other words, it was decided that companies should be compelled to pay income tax on all profits that were apportioned to shareholders. Had that recommendation been adopted, the Department would have received, from companies every penny payable by way of income tax on their dividends. At the present time they collect the tax from . the individual shareholders who receive the dividends. Some people who receive only small dividends .might forget to include them in their returns.",51
249,Mr BRUCE,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,But in many cases the tax payable is on a much higher basis where it is collected from the individual.,51
250,Mr GREGORY,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,"That matter was discussed and threshed cut on a previous occasion. The companies should, be compelled to pay the taxation on the basis laid down by the Income Tax Assessment Act. Under the system recommended, if a man had an income of £1,000 per year, one-half of which was derived from dividends, on which, let us say, Is. 6d. in the £ 1 had been paid by way of income tax, whereas the rate of tax on the s total income of £1,000 was 2s. in the £ 1 , the Department would surcharge him to the extent of 6d. in the £ 1 in respect of the dividends amounting to £ 5 0 0 , on which Is. 6d. in the £ 1 had been paid by the company from which they had been received. On the other hand, it would make a rebate where the amount paid was in excess of the rate in respect of which the taxpayer was liable.",51
251,Mr BRUCE,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,"That is being done in Britain today. There they have taxation at the source, and a super-tax is paid by the individual.",51
252,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,But there they have a huge Inland Revenue Department.,51
253,Mr GREGORY,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,Nothin g of the sort would be required here. This systemwould very much simplify matters. The Commonwealth and State Commissioners of Taxation unanimously agreed to the recommendation.,52
254,Sir ROBERT BEST,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,I do not thin k the Commonwealth Commissioner of Taxation agreed to it .,52
255,Mr GREGORY,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,He did ; I have no doubt on the point.,52
256,Mr BRUCE,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,The States are adopting that system.,52
257,Mr GREGORY,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,"That is so. Another reform that is urgently needed is the institution of one collecting authority and one for m of taxation for 'Commonwealth, and municipal land taxation. as many people think that on applying to be enrolled for a State electorate they will also be enrolled for a Federal electorate, or vice vend, so many people are greatly confused by the varying forms of Federal and State land taxation. We should endeavour to adopt as quickly as possible a uniform system that would give relief to the taxpayers, and earn for us their gratitude and respect. Under th. present systemwe have a conglomeration of returns which have to be sent in to the Federal and State authorities, and huge expense is unnecessarily incurred in their printing, distribution, collection, and examination. I believe that the additional labour, cost of printing, and loss of time involved must represent something like £750,000 per annum. I hope we shall be able to obtain from the Treasurer an announcement that he will make a special effort to bring the States into complete harmony with us in this regard, and that we shall have very soon a measure providing for simplicity of taxation forms and one collecting agency for the Commonwealth and the States.",52
258,Mr BLAKELEY,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,"Darling) [ 8 . 4 5 ] atm extremely disappointed that the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook), in submitting this Bill , has made no provision for increasing the amount exempted from income tax. The sovereign of 1911 is now worth no more than about 13s., but the present high cost of living has not been taken into consideration as it ought to have been. I think that some relief should be given to taxpayers by the increase of the amount exempted from taxation to more than £156.",52
259,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,Suppos e that wages have increased to the same extent as the cost of living? In that case a man would be as well able to pay the tax now as he was before. >s,52
260,Mr BLAKELEY,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,"Different Commissions that have investigated the question from time to time have found that the increase in wages has not kept pace with the increase in the cost of living. So far as I can learn, the Basic Wage Commission will shortly recommend a basic wage of £6 per week, and I have no doubt that its decision will be based upon the evidence collected by it .",52
261,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,"That will mean State, more taxation, will it not? Just Mr BLAKELEY - It is very clear that present rates of wages are insufficient to cope with the increased cost of living.",52
262,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,"The honourable member is telling us in one breath that we should have fewer persons liable to taxation and less taxes, and in the next that our people should receive higher in comes.",52
263,Mr BLAKELEY,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,"My complaint is that no allowance has been made for the depreciation in the purchasing power of the sovereign, and it is because of that depreciation and because wages have not increased in anything like the same ratio as the cost of living, which will be proved conclusively when the Basic Wage Commission issues its report, that we believe that the amount exempted from income tax should be increased. I intend when the Bill is in Committee to move to in crease the exemption to £200, and I hope that the Treasurer will be satisfied with that proposal.",52
264,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,We cannot do that.,52
265,Mr BLAKELEY,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,"The question of - I assessing the incomes of primary producers on a five years' average has been discussed in this House before, and a majorit y of honourable members have decided in favour of it . It seems to me that the Treasurer might have taken the trouble to give effect to that expression of opinion by honourable members.",52
266,Mr JOWETT,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,It was unanimous.,52
267,Mr BLAKELEY,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,"I believe that the decision was a unanimous one. It is undoubted that a majorit y of the members of this House are i u favour of the adoption of that method of assessing such in comes, and the Treasurer should meet the wish in that regard that has been expressed. In some parts of New South Wales, in 1915, people had a good year, but in 1916, 1917, 1918, and 1919 the residents of those parts experienced bad years. They paid on their incomes in 1915, and in some cases they had a good season in 1916, and paid on their in comes during that year. At the present time they are mortgaged up to the hilt , and I have had applications from graziers, selectors, and farmers to obtain for them time with in which to pay their taxation. They have had to spend the incomes of good years in the purchase of fodder to carry them over bad years. They are now head over heels in debt, - and although they will in all probability have a splendid season this year, all that they will make will have to go to pay off debts contracted during the last three or four years. In the circumstances, it is, I think, clear that the average income over a period of five years is the fairest basis of assessment for taxation. On the question of the simplification of the income tax schedules, I understand that a new?' form of schedule has been drafted, and has been submitted to the State Governments. It is to be .hoped that they will agree to adopt the common form proposed, and that in future the Commonwealth will be the only authority collecting this taxation. The simplification of the schedule is highly desirable, especially in the interests of those who do not reside in the towns, where accountants may be employed to assist taxpayers in filling up their schedules. 'believe that, the Government should take early steps to raise the exemption to £ 2 0 0 , though, personally, I should like to see it raised to £250. Mr NICHOLLS . ' - I should like to see it tion. raised to £400.",52
268,Mr BLAKELEY,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,I personally have no objection to pay income taxation. I wish that I were paying considerably more income tax than I am paying today.,53
269,Mr LAVELLE,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,On the honourable member's present salary he would like to pay a higher tax ?,53
270,Mr BLAKELEY,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,"No , but I should like to be paying the present tax on a salary of £2,000 or £5,000. I urge upon the Government the desirability of adopting the five years' average in assessing the primary producer's income, the in crease of the exemption to £ 2 00 or £ 2 5 0 , and some expedition in the adoption of the new method of taxation, and of one form of income tax schedule for Commonwealth and State. Sir . ROBERT BEST (Kooyong) [8.54] - I agree with what has been said as to the necessity for greater simplicity in the form of the income tax schedule. I go further than some honourable members, and urge that there should be infinitely greater simplicity in the method adopted for arriving at the amount of tax to be paid in respect of any income. I venture to say that there is not an honourable member present who has the remotest idea of what is meant by the mathematical conundrum set for t h in the schedule to this Bill . Indeed, the Treasurer has no idea what it means.",53
271,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,I certainly have not.,53
272,Mr WEST,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,Can the honourable member suggest any better method.,53
273,Sir ROBERT BEST,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,"I can suggest the method adopted by the State Governments. They do not resort to abstruse mathematical problems for the purpose of fixing the amount of tax. I welcome the appointment of the Taxation Commission. I realise that there are anomalies connected with our system of taxation to which attention should be drawn, and which should be rectified. The Taxation Commission should be greatly assisted in its investigation by the labours of the British Commission, composed of financial and taxation exI perts. This Commission secured the assistance of the best intellects of the Old Country in arriving at a decision as to the best form of machinery and manner of assessment to recommend for adop*,",53
274,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,Does the honourable member believe that the Taxation Commission will secure any more information than the Department has already in its possession.,53
275,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,I think so.,53
276,Sir ROBERT BEST,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,"I realise that in our present system there are many anomalies which ought to be adjusted, and it is with a view to the rectification of these anomalies that the Commission has been appointed. Originally, the Wartime Profits Tax Bill introduced in this House contained a clause providing for the averaging of profits and losses over a period of years, but that provision was deliberately omitted from two subsequent measures of the same kind which were introduced. On two occasions fought strongly for the reintroduction of that provision, but it was resisted by the Government of the day, because, it was said, it would involve a dislocation of the finances. It was of no use whatever to direct attention to the fact that the finances of the Mother Country were colossal as compared to those of this small community, and my request for the reintroduction of the provision I have referred to was successf u l l y resisted. The result has been to bring about anomalies which have worked gross injustice. For one or two years, I also strongly urged greater consideration system of taxation at the source, a system which is adopted in the Mother in the State of Victoria, and, to the best of my knowledge, also in the State of New South Wales. There is recommend this system . of This is a matter which received rvery close attention from the expert mission in the Mother which I have referred. I read a portion of the report of that Commission, particularly that portion taxation at the source. The Commission, after taking a great 'volume of evidence on the* subject, and assessing the value that evidence, came ito the that taxation at the source was> the rect system to adopt',, as it was just fair: The system: which obtains Australia received' full but, after a thorough of the whole subject by this Commission, they wound report by recommending system of taxation at the which had obtained in the Country, should be continued. system is deserving of by the Taxation Commission here, and I hope it will it - The objection urged to is that we have a. graduated with which the system of taxation at the source is inconsistent. Under our a company pays dividends in cash in Sir Robert Best. ordinary way, or bonus shares, and. so soon as the cash or shares are received by the taxpayer they are taxed in his hands. They are not taxed in the hands of the company, but only when they are distributed to the shareholders. In that way the income of the shareholder is as I sessed, and is taxed according to the graduated scale. I submit that taxation at the source is quite consistent with the system of graduated taxation, because it would be quite possible to give credit for the amount paid by the company on behalf of each taxpayer receiving dividends. I hope that this phase of the question will also receive consideration. As to the Bill before us, the necessity for this taxation is, no doubt, a cause of deep disappointment and regret to all of us, and of bitter resentment to a great many, because it is, to some extent, brought about by the waste and exfor the travagance of the Government in other directions. However, there appears to 'be Country, no doubt that the majority of honourable members are determined to pass it , so we must submit to the inevitable. But what much to is the position? Upon the original tax taxation. we added 25 per cent. Then we proceeded to add another 30 per cent.,, and then a Comsuper tax of 5 per cent. To-day it is proCountry to posed to add still another 5 per cent. That is to say, on to the original tax 70 per cent, and will have been added. When we were dealing with told that incomes were to be taxed by a super tax of 5 per cent., we innocently believed that it was a tax merely on the of original income. But such is not the conclusion case. Much more than 5 per cent, is to corbe added to the income tax payable in and order to produce the £600,0.00 the Treain surer requires. It is practically a tax consideration; added to a tax already added to and to a investigation super-tax previously imposed. expert up their Sir JOSEPH COOK - But still it is 5 , that the per cent. source, Sir ROBE RT BEST - But not on the Mother original income. That Mr Bruce - It simply means that the consideration individual will pay 5 per cent, more than appointed he paid last year. receive Sir ROBE RT BEST - That is the it here position. The general idea was that it tax, was merely to be 5 per cent, on the original income tax. This increase of 70 system per cent, on the original tax is most rethe grettable, but I suppose that we must accept it for the present. have no alternative, but I do so distinctly under strong protest.",53
277,Mr LAZZARINI,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,"Werriwa) [ 9 . 4 ] am not concerned so much about the 5 per cent, which is to be added to ""the income tax. To my mind, the increase is too small in the case of large incomes, which, I think, ought to pay an additional 20 per cent., so that wealth may be called upon to do something which, we were told it-was to do, and which it ought to have done, in order to help to' meet the national obligations. I rise to say a word or two upon the penny-wiseand-pound-foolish principle of maintaining the flat rate of £ 1 on all wage earners with an income of £ 1 0 0 , and keeping the exemption at £ 1 5 6 , with £26 for each child. The burden which this tax represents today, with the present high cost of living, and the economic position of the workers, is much greater than a 20 per cent, increase would re-' present on large incomes. The fundamental principle of income taxation is that each man should pay according to his income, the individual with the biggest income paying the biggest tax ; but that principle does not apply today. The exemption should be raised to £ 2 5 0 , and if it were so graduated that the man with a wife and three or four children could be exempted up to £ 3 0 0 , it would be little enough. The deduction of £ 2 6 allowable for each child is too small, and should be increased to £ 5 0 , which would only make it equal to the exemption allowed by the New South Wales State Act.",55

The honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert .Best) hopes that a Royal Commission will take the incidence of this taxation into its consideration. But is the trouble with the Federal ment today. It decides nothing.

H a l f the time the people do not realise that they are being put to this extra expense, and that the Government are shelving their responsibility in this way. I have already said that' the fundamental principle of the income tax is that a man ought to pay according to his income, but the p r i mary producer of Australia is in a unique position as compared with persons on fixed salaries or in business. Industrial troubles may dislocate a business undertaking for a few weeks, but it is very seldom affected by such things as floods, droughts, or bush fires. A commercial man's income may fluctuate a little, but, as a rule, it is fair l y steady, and one year'3 return is a.fair criterion of what he will receive year in year out, making allowance, of course, for any extensions. On the other hand, the farmer may devote to his work the highest intelligence and the greatest industry possible, and he may slave, morning, noon, and night, but if the rain does not f all , he has no crop, and if it falls too heavily he may lose the result of all his labour through rust. He may make £2,000 in one year,'and may lose £1,500 in the next year. For two years he may do well, but for the following three years he may be crucified and practically compelled to leave his farm . Is it right to make him pay income tax on £2,000 for one year, when he may suffer a loss of £1,500 in the next year?",55

Every man should pay income tax according to his ability to pay it , and there is no reason why a person with an income of £150 should not be called upon to pay his proper share of the taxation; but when we realise that there are only 371,580 individuals in the Commonwealth who pay income taxthat is, one out of every fourteen persons - it must be admitted that there are manv persons with incomes over £150 who are not paying income tax. It may be that many thousands of people are not rendering returns, or that because the exemptions already provided for are so generous they are not called upon to pay the tax.",56
285,Sir JOSEPH COOK,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,It is due to both causes.,56
286,Mr BELL,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,"I do not intend to enlarge upon what has been said by honourable members with regard to the proposed system of assessing incomes over a period of years. Honourable members generally agree that it is the most equitable method to adopt, and I see no reason why it should not apply to business men as well as to farmers. No doubt it is the only just method of assessing a farmer's income. The primary producer appears to have a lot of friends in this Chamber. I am extremely .pleased that he has so many, and for that reason all his troubles should be put right in the very near future. I know only too well that the farmer, at the present time, pays taxes several times over, whereas the man in business or the man who derives his income from mortagages, dividends, or Government securities pays only once. There certainly should be a readjustment of the principles of taxation, but I am afraid we are not going to derive much benefit from the report of the Commission which is about to sit and decide as to the best or fairest method of applying taxation. We have had a number of Commissions, but my experience is that we have not acted upon many of their reports so far. There is not much doubt in any honourable member's mind as to - I am in the most fair and equitable way of adjusting taxation. We do not need a Commission to tell us that. I am afraid it is not a question of what is most fair and equitable, but rather a question of expediency with the Government when they have to decide who shall pay the taxes. We had an example of that this afternoon. There is not the least doubt ; that the reason why the Government decided to exempt amusements, such as picture shows and theatres, from the entertainments tax was"" that many hundreds of thousands or people would benefit, and that, therefore, the move would be very popular, as compared with the few people that attend athletic sports, cricket matches, and other such gatherings, and who will stiU have to pay the tax even on 6d. tickets, while tickets up to 3s. at picture shows and theatres wil l be exempt. I am, therefore, very much afraid that any inquiry we may have, or any report that the Commission may make, will lead us very, little further than we are at present. I am not in favour of increased taxation at the present time. I can see no necessity for it . What we want is economy in administration. The honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best), in his closing remarks said that the Government was guilty of great waste - and extravagance. He - was opposed to the increase in the income tax, but was afraid that we should have to put up with it for the time being. I cannot view the matter in that way. I will not use the words "" waste "" and "" extravagance,"" but I am convinced that when we can spend money as we are proposing to do, on such enterprises as were passed last week-withou t mentioning any namesi t is not necessary to impose increased taxation to fulfil those so-called obligations. For these reasons I am compelled to oppose the increase in the income tax by 5 per cent, at the present time.",56

Why cannot we have a sensible proposal for income taxation?

I doubt if many of them could tell us offhand what the curve business means. The officers do remarkably well. That is my experience, at any rate, and an the absolute faith that the people have in them is complimentary and striking. We had a practical Committee of the officers of the Federal and State Departments meeting in conference. That was much better than the proposed Royal Commission. They not only went into these questions, but practically agreed on a line of policy, and if my memory serves me right, a Bill was actually prepared. What has become of it?

324,Mr WEST,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,"East Sydney) [9.35] The honourable member for Eden Monaro (Mr Austin Chapman) says that no one is satisfied with our income tax system; but did any one ever know a taxpayer who was satisfied ? It is necessary to introduce a Bill of this character every year in order that the income tax be collected, hence the measure before us. I must say, however, that I do not think the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) has taken much interest in the question of taxation. He knew that he had to do does something, and he has introduced a mea. sure which he thinks will prove plausible at to some people at any rate, but the result can only be to create widespread discontent. If the Treasurer were really in e n earnest, he would make himself a student of taxation principles, and adopt the best the means of removing. the incubus on Australia. There is one point to which I would like to refer, namely, the tax im^ the posed on the incomes of public companies. I am Someyears ago there was some trouble at in Sydney in connection with this matter, and it was decided that public companies should pay at the rate of 2s. 6d. on all profits. My opinion is that to the late Commissioner, who was then in office, had no idea of the extent to which proprietary and part proprietary businesses were being turned into public companies in order to take advantage of that rate of 2s. 6d. What these companies are doing is to take the undistributed profit of one year, and with it to water their capital, and this to their great pecuniary advantage. So widespread is this practice that I doubt whether there is one company which has not doubled its capital, and which should pay a much larger rate than 2s. 6d. On more than one occasion I have suggested that in this regard we should follow the example set by Great Britain when large sums of loan money were in circulation during the war.",59
325,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,Why did you not raise your voice about it ?,60
326,Mr WEST,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,"I did, but, unfortunately, the press of Australia, in the interest of public companies, take care that no words of mine shall go beyond this Chamber. The honourable member who has just interjected has advocated one uniform system of collecting this taxation, and that suggestion has been made frequently. It has not been acted upon simply because during the last few years we have had no one in the position of Treasurer strong-minded or courageous enough to deal with the matter; indeed, if there had been a Treasurer desirous of doing so, he would not have obtained the support of his Government. In order to have one uniform system' we must either take away from the States the right of direct taxation, or out of the income tax collected return to each State a per capita amount. This is an arrangement that could be easily made, with the result of of exemptions. rendering our taxation much more equitupon able than at present.",60
327,Mr AUSTIN CHAPMAN,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,W i pledge yourself to do that when you Tr&&sur6r ?,60
328,Mr WEST,PERSONS NOT MARRIED AND HAVING NO,"I will if I have the opduce portunity. We must remember that, although this is a National Parliament, there are many honourable members who have not sufficient national spirit to fight the State-righters in the State Parliaexemption ments, and who are willing to do an i justice to the people of Australia in to keep a Nationalist Government i power. When an appeal was made to the country in 1910, there was a desire on the part of the Fisher Government the party behind it to get r i d of the "" Braddon Blot, "" which had been in serted in our Constitution in the first instance merely as a temporary expedient. The late Lord Forrest favoured achieving this end by agreeing to refund to the States 25s. per head out of our Customs and Excise duties in perpetuity, whereas the Fisher Government desired to l i m it that payment to a period of ten years, and this was approved at the elections. At a later stage Mr W at t , who was then Treasurer in the present Government, attended a Conference of State Premiers, at which he proposed that the States should be annually deprived of 2s. 6d. per capita u n t i l the amount being paid at present had entirely disappeared. I was absolutely convinced of the late Treasurer's sincerity in this matter, and was firmly of opinion that his proposal would have been adopted. But the Government had not the courage of their convictions, and just before the last election, the Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) publicly announced that he was not in agreement with his own Treasurer upon this matter. Consequently the reduction of 2s. 6d. per capita did not materialize. My own idea is that the National Government should have exclusive control. of the revenue derived from indirect taxation in the form of Customs and Excise duties. But nobody upon the Treasury benches has the courage to give effect to that programme. Ministers think more of their political skins than they do of the adoption of right principles. To-night, my Leader, the honourable member for Y a r r a (Mr Tudor) invited our attention to the question But his appeal fell deaf ears. Very few members in deed exhibited the slightest interest in l l you his remarks. Most of them walked out are of the chamber, whilst the Treasurer, with a bland smile, endeavoured to in us to pass the Bill . The honourable member for Yarra stressed what must be perfectly obvious to every man who, gives the matter a moment's consideration, namely, that if £ 1 5 6 was a fair general in 1911, and if £ 1 3 was a n - proper deduction to allow for children order under the age of sixteen years, those n amounts need to be considerably in creased today owing to the greatly reduced purchasing power of the sovereign. and I need hardly remind honourable members that Great Britain has adopted ex- emptions very much larger than are our own. There this question has been very closely investigated by a Royal Commission, which in its report saysOur proposals will have the following results :No wholly earned income will pay tax if it does not exceed£150 in the case of a bachelor. £250 in the case of a married couple without ohildren. £350 in the cans of a married couple with three children. No wholly earned income will be charged at more than naif the standard rate of tax if it does not exceed£400 in the case of a bachelor. £500 in the case of a married couple without children. £600 in the case of a married couple with three children. No wholly invested income will pay tax if it does not exceed£135 in the cage of a bachelor £235 in the case of a married couple without children. £315 in the oaee of a married couple with three children. No wholly invested income will be charged at more than half the standard rate of tax if it does not exceed£360 in the case of a bachelor. £450 in the oase of a married couple out children. '£540 in the caae of a married couple with three children. Then, examples are given as to how these payments pan out. That Commission was composed of men who possess an intimate knowledge of income tax matters- a much greater knowledge than we can possibly possess, seeing that the first British income tax was imposed as far back as 1842. The income tax was originally imposed in Great Britain as a war tax, and, although it has never been entirely repealed, it has been altered from time to time to meet the circumstances of the Treasury. At times the rate of tax was small j at other times, when the need for revenue was greater, as for instance during the period of the Boer War, a considerable sum was raised by this means, of paying the cost of the war. The Government would be justified in increasing the exemption. nately, the matter of imposing taxation is entirely within the hands of the Government. That is an old constitutional practice, established no doubt as a safeguard against any crank reducing the amount of tax, and thus leaving the Government with insufficient funds with which to carry on the administration. A w in Government, however, will raise [209] only sufficient money as is necessary to carry on the affairs of State. A Government which raises more money than is necessary shows that it does not understand the principles of finance, because it is extracting, more money from the people, by way of taxation, than is justified. That policy is not conducive to the well-being of the country. For some time past honourable members have been asking the Treasurer to explain the curves of the second and third degrees. These curves were brought under the notice of the British Taxation Commission, and also an American Commission. Both admitted that this is the most just system of levying taxation. Under the system first adopted by this Parliament, and still in operation in the States, a man is taxed, say, eightpence in the £1 on an income of £700, and if hie income is a few pounds in excess of that amount the rate of tax is increased a penny. That system is not just. The British Commission admitted uiat, although the curves were not understood with- by the ordinary citizen they worked out with absolute accuracy and justice to the taxpayer. They represent the most equitable system of arriving at the proper amount of taxation to be paid by each individual. Reverting to the matter of exemptions. In the United States there is a general exemption of £500. On incomes from £500 to £1,000 the rate is increased on. a gradual incline. On incomes above £1,000 the incline becomes steeper, and on incomes above £5,000 the rates rise very suddenly. That is a good way of levying taxation. The citizen should be allowed an income free from taxation-- . except Customs and Excise duties-suffi cient to buy for himself anil family the necessaries of life. I notice that the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr . Greene) told a deputation, a few days ago, that the present tariff is designed for revenue-producing purposes rather than as a protective medium. That Unfortu- affords me a further justification for endeavouring to get the amount of exemption increased.",60
