2,Mr COSTELLO,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"'-The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) is the principal bill of this package of taxation bills before the House. The measures contained the other four bills in the package mostly follow up on changes to be enacted by the primary bill. The Income Tax (Former Comtax plying Superannuation Funds) Bill imposes tax on the net previous income of superanthat nuation funds that change their status from complying to non-complying. The Income Tax (Former Non-resident Superannuation Funds) Bill imposes tax on the net previous taxpayers. income of superannuation funds that change their status from non-resident to resident. The Income Tax Rates Amendment Bill office amends the Income Tax Rates Act 1986 to reduce the threshold at which the income a medium sized credit union is subject to tax. This bill enacts a small technical cQtrection. Section 23(6) of the Income Tax Rates Act 1986 limits the amount of tax payable medium sized credit union. This is calculated by reference to a threshold amount currently set at $50,000. This bill reduces this amount to $49,999 to bring it into. line with the threshold for medium credit unions which is set out in the Income Tax Assessment Act. The Income Tax (Deficit Deferral) Bill imposes a deficit deferral tax designed to pick up tax that the amendments to the imputation provisions contained in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) would otherwise allow to escape. There are a number of positive developments in the Taxation Laws Amendment.Bill (No.4) which the coalition endorses. The coalition welcomes the move to provide a deduction for successful cash bids for offshore and onshore mineral exploration authorities and mining authorities, and for onshore petroleum exploration permits and production licences. The coalition supports the government's move to relieve from a higher tax impost income derived from the investment of property transferred to a child as part of a legal settlement in relation to family breakdown and the move to tighten up the antiavoidance provisions in relation to children's income in situations of family breakdown. We also support the move to pay interest on the overpayment of income tax and the early payment of income tax. Since I became shadow Treasurer, I have in been inundated by letters from irate self-funded retiree!!,,, who pay provisional tax and have had their overpayments of provisional retained by the Taxation Office as tax credits instead of refunds. I sincerely hope these measures will prevent this situation from occurring in the future. The current arrangements have allowed the tax office to be provided with an interest-free loan from I want to take this opportunity to commend the Commonwealth Ombudsman and her for their work which has contributed to bringing about these amendments and some of justice for taxpayers. The Ombudsman's office has provided considerable assistance to persecuted taxpayers dealing with zealotry in the tax office. On the subject of the Commonby a wealth Ombudsman and her recent annual report to parliament, I sincerely hope that the government will initiate legislation to change the current practice in the tax office of ing in delayed tax assessments or amended assessments consideration of existing HECS liabilities for income years prior to com-, mencement of study. Contrary to interpretation of the Higher Education Funding Act by the Commonwealth ombudsman, the tax office believes that it does not have any discretion on whether to make an assessment of HECS. If this is indeed the case, I hope the government will shortly take action to remove this inequity. The coalition does not oppose the measures contained in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) relating to credit unions, pooled development funds, research and development activities, the rates of interest for calculating the superannuation guarantee charge, and the development allowance. The deficit deferral tax imposed by the Income Tax (Deficit Deferral) Bill is a consequence of changes to the instalment arrangements for the payment of company tax. The arrangements are complex and may well give rise to technical problems. However, some mechanism is needed so that the introduction of this system does not open a hole in the tax system. Apart from these measures, however, there are a number of disturbing features contained in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4) which are a matter of grave concern to the coalition. The bill proposes to amend section 82AAQ of the Income Tax Assessment Act so that an employer who has obtained deductions in respect of contributions to a superannuation fund on behalf of employees is taxed on any amounts that are repaid by the fund as surplus. It is understandable to tax as income the return of moneys for which a tax deduction has been obtained. However, the amendments are proposed to apply from 1 July 1988. Retrospective taxes are odious and, in principle, wrong. The government has displayed masterly inactivity on this issue. If this loophole has existed since 1988, it is culpable negligence to have left it until 1994 before rectifying it. It is the government's inaction, despite its clear knowledge of the loophole, which has necessitated measures being imposed retrospectively. The government deserves the includ- strongest condemnation for allowing this situation to develop and allowing it to fester so long. However, without these amendments it would be the case that payments of these moneys would have attracted a tax deduction, but repayment would not be assessable. This would be one-sided tax treatment. It appears that there may be considerable amounts involved. We do not excuse the government. On this occasion it will pass, but with the strongest possible condemnation. I say this to the negligent government and the negligent administrators of the tax laws in this country: do not push your luck on this kind of situation again. The provisions contained in the primary tax bill relating to non-complying superannuation funds are a significant improvement on the government's original draft legislation. Although the proposed new section 288A will go ahead in its original form, the government has made two significant concessions. The Superannuation Industry Supervision Act will be amended to make it much harder for a fund to lose its complying status. Essentially, there will have to be a deliberate contravention on the part of a trustee of a fund, connived at by some or all of the members, before the Insurance and Superannuation Commission will be able to withdraw a fund's complying status. The other concession made is that the implementation of this measure has been delayed from 1994-95 to 1995-96. The coalition has some concerns in regard to the proposed changes to superannuation as they relate to overseas employees. The bill does not address the issue of transfers to overseas funds. This aspect should be covered by legislation. The bill exempts from the fringe benefits tax contributions to overseas funds by employers for an employee working in Australia on a temporary entry permit of less than four years. The exemption, however, is restricted to employers who are Australian residents. But there may be a period after arrival when that is not the case. The bill makes contributions from employees of non-Australian residents non-deductible, which offsets a large part of the benefit of the exemption from FBT and retains much of the anomaly the FBT exemption was intended to remove. However, the coalition does not intend to oppose the government's proposed changes to superannuation at this stage. Clearly, this issue will have to be monitored. I now turn to the government's proposed changes to the provisions governing employee share acquisition schemes. It is somewhat ironical that, in the same budget in which the Treasurer (Mr Willis) announced the government would be undertaking a review of the fringe benefits tax compliance costs in the light of concern expressed by employers, the government also decided to widen the fringe benefits tax net to include employee share acquisition schemes. This shows the hoax of the proposed review. This bill will add another 28 pages of legislation to the FBT A.ssessment Act. Apparently, the first step in simplifying an act is to add another 28 pages and to extend the net before you ever get around to simplifying it. In the case of these proposed amendments, the government appears to be introducing more legislation which it eventually will refer back to the simplification committee as soon as it is enacted. Be in absolutely no doubt, this is an atrocious piece of added complexity which not in the slightest contributes to simplification. The most telling commentary on the fringe benefits tax of late has come from former deputy commissioner of taxation, Mr Ray Conwell. In August this year Mr Conwell said that the fringe benefits tax had become 'a monster'. He criticised the government's approach to fringe benefits tax by saying: So much for Government rhetoric about the desire for Australian business to be internationally petitive. Actions speak louder than words. And with tax laws like this, we must be the laughing stock of most of our competitors. When FBT was introduced in 1986 it raised $535 million. In the 1994-95 year, it is budgeted to raise $3.2 billion. I will say that again. When FBT was introduced inl1986 it raised $535 million. In the 1994-95 year, it is budgeted to raise $3.2 billion. It must be said that in some areas the FBT has proved quite a disappointment. The government expected to raise $90 million from FBT on parking. In fact, it will raise only $32 million. Apparently there are now moves afoot in the Treasury to abolish FBT on parking. We will support any such moves. The proposal to impose FBT on employee share acquisition schemes is being justified on the basis that some existing schemes are illegitimately avoiding tax. Let us note in passing that the taxation treatment of these schemes has been specifically provided for with its own separate tax regime under section 26AAC of the Income Tax Assessment Act. Let us also note that the current act provides far-reaching anti-avoidance provisions in part IVA. Let us suppose that the government got it wrong on both counts by developing a separate regime under section 26AAC and by allowing it to prosper outside part IVA. Even in these circumstances, circumstances which cannot be shown to apply, there would still be no warrant for attacking all employee acquisition share schemes. The government has decided to punish all schemes for what it says· are the sins of a few. In his press release of last Tuesday, the Treasurer said: Many of the existing schemes are no more than executive remuneration packages designed to convert salary into shares or share rights. What did the government's own expert on national saving-, the highly respected Dr Vince FitzGerald, say on the subject of tax abuse and employee share acquisition schemes? In his report on employee share schemes for the remuneration planning corporation entitled Saving through the firm, Dr FitzGerald said: ... overwhelmingly, existing Australian employee share plans have patently been set up for legitimate com- and positive purposes. That is quite a contrast with the Treasurer's wild assertion. The difference is that Dr FitzGerald is telling the truth. However, this government has made an art form of ignoring the advice of Dr FitzGerald. On budget night the government's propaganda machine went into overdrive as it presented its changes to employee share acquisition schemes, not as a mechanism which would close down such schemes but as a proposal to encourage them with a tax exemption on up to $500 of share remuneration per year or deferring tax for up to 10 years on up to $1,500 of share remuneration per year. The fact is, however, that despite the propaganda machine the government proposal was to make the schemes far less attractive for employees and to make them much more expensive for employers-taxing companies for the privilege of allocating shares to employees. Unlike the government, the coalition believes there should be incentives to employees to achieve excellence and to reward them for their hard work. Employees should be able to reap the benefit of working hard and of the prosperity and the success of the businesses they work for. Employers should be able to reward employees who have made that commitment to the companies in which they are employed. The morning after the budget the headlines heralded a great marketing triumph for the government. The headlines trumpeted: 'Workers encouraged to buy shares', 'Share scheme for benefit of workers' and 'Benefits for employees in new share plans'. One poor journalist was so badly misled by the budget night propaganda that he wrote, 'The government has decided to clear the way for wider use of employer share ownership schemes, stealing elements of the policy the coalition took to the last federal election.' That shows how effectiv- government propaganda can be on journalists working to deadlines on budget night. The propaganda was a hoax. The coalition will not allow the operation of existing employee share acquisition schemes to be effectively destroyed by drawing them into the labyrinth of the fringe benefits tax. This is the plan. This will effect of the government's legislation. So what is the government's rationale for imposing the fringe benefits tax on employee share acquisition schemes? It is the outcome of the review of the taxation treatment of employee share acquisition schemes which was announced in the 1993-94 budget. In his press release on budget night announcing the new regime, the Treasurer justified the new measures on this bl;lSis: . . . the emerging exploitation . . . of the existing legislation which allowed tax deferral on remuneration channelled through employee share acquisition schemes without any limit on the amount or time of the deferral. The Treasurer was at it again on Tuesday talking about open-ended tax deferral opportunities. Surely, it would have been better to tackle any identified problems which are proven to escape the current tax net, but the government prefers to wipe out the whole garden of employee share acquisition schemes rather than direct its attention to the garden weeds. The government could have addressed the problems, if need be, by amending section 26AAC of the Income Tax Assessment Act, which currently deals with the schemes. The government could have imposed a dollar limit on employee share acquisition schemes. The government could have imposed a limit on the period over which the liability fell due. Of course, such solutions would have been far too simple and far too logical for this government, which is overzealous in prosecuting fringe benefits tax as a milch cow to cover its own wanton expenditure and its own failure to control its own budget deficits. The government could have taken the advice of Dr Vince FitzGerald in his report Saving through the firm when he said, 'There is more than adequate scope to address blatant abuse through the use of part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act.' The Treasurer, in his press release on Tuesday, was back at it again. In response to my public comment that the coalition would oppose the government's legislation on employee share acquisition schemes, the be the Treasurer said-to his shame-'It marks a return by the Liberal Party to the days of protecting the tax avoidance industry.' I think it is a little sad that the Treasurer cannot even remember events which he covered in the days when he was the shadow Treasurer, before he was dumped. It was the Fraser government-which introduced part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act and which is responsible for the most comprehensive antiavoidance provisions in this country's history. The Treasurer's claim was fraudulent. The coalition will refer this matter to a Senate inquiry to examine whether tax avoidance is occurring through employee share plans and whether separate new tax treatment to prevent such abuse is needed and how it can be introduced, if needed, without destroying existing plans. I note in passing, somewhat ironically, that the President of the ACTU has endorsed new generation plans as the preferred vehicle for employee share acquisition, schemes. In the ACro publication on employee share acquisition schemes, Handle with Care, the President said: In considering employee share ownership there is a preferred plan. It involves ownership of shares a democratically controlled trust or company, and no financial risk for the employee. It is known as a New Generation'Plan and it'is our view the way of the future for employee share ownership plans. It may well have been the way of the future before budget night. By making a statement like that, the President of the ACTU now invites the Treasurer to call him a tax avoider as well. We will be waiting for the Treasurer's statement on how the ACTU is engaged in massive tax avoidance on this matter. It may well have been the future before budget night but, with this misconceived, misguided, sledgehammer to try t9 crack a nut approach, to try to eke out every last do.llar, to try to cover its wanton spending plans, this government is threatening all employee share acquisition schemes as they currently operate. Dr Vince FitzGerald, in his report on employee share schemes, said: A very substantial consensus has arisen, involving peak union, shareholder, director, employer and institutional investor interests in favour of key attributes of the 'new generation' type of plansseen as facilitating common purpose and better performance in the enterprise, and helping raise national saving. Is it not ironical that it is the Keating Labor government which has decided to try )0 break this consensus. The government's move to extend the fr}nge benefits tax to employee share acquisition schemes places in jeopardy enormous benefits in national savings. In, fact, the government's desire to shoot from the hip in this instance could actually come at a cost to government revenue, economic growth and national savings. Mr Michael Whalley, a partner with Minter Ellison Morris Fletcher, has estimated that the government's decision to extend FBT to employee share ownership schemes could actually remove $30 million per year from the Australian economy. One leading company, TNT, has already announced its intention to freeze its plans to widen its employee share ownership option scheme because of the government's move. In the letters page of the Australian Finanin cial Review the week before last, the Group Human Resources Director for Cadbury Schweppes, Mr Richard Stradwick, announced that the company would be suspending its employee share plan for its Australian employees because of the government's legislation. I have also received representations on behalf of numerous other companies, which would have suspended their employee share acquisition schemes if this law is passed. The good news for these companies and their employees is that the coalition will vote against allowing it to pass. In his Tuesday press release, the Treasurer made the wild assertion that 'employees are generally not <""offered the opportunity to participate', when he was trying to claim that employee share acquisition plans were only a perk for executives. The Treasurer should try telling that to the 56,000 employees of Coles Myer who participated in an employee share ownership plan and to the 45,000 employees of BHP who participated in that company's scheme. The Treasurer might be so out of touch as to think that Coles and BHP between them have 100,000 executives on perks. But he is wrong-dead wrong! I wonder whether the government remembers its report on national savings by Dr Vince FitzGerald. In discussing the role which business can play in promoting national savings, the report' extols the virtue of employee share acquisition schemes as one of the vehicles through which to encourage and assist employees to engage in regular contractual saving. In his report for the Remuneration Planning Corporation, Dr FitzGerald estimated that employee share ownership plans could raise national savings by about half of one per cent of GOP, or around $2 billion in today's dollars, by the end of the decade and increase annual tax revenues permanently by more than $500 million in today's dollars in seven to nine years time. However, the government's moves in extending the FBT to employee share acquisition schemes would destroy the realisation of these potential benefits. I notice that one journalist at the Australian Financial Review has written that the rejection of this measure could cost up to $100 million a year. But even the government's own explanatory memorandum on the bill says: The nature of this measure· is such that a reliable estimateof increased revenuecannot be provided. The government is not factoring in any extra revenue from this particular measure. If the government is successful in imposing FBT on employee share acquisition plans, it will be the biggest lemon in Australian tax history. The government's measure will come at an eventual cost to revenue as it wipes out existing schemes. The coalition supports moves to crack down on abuse and evasion of tax, but that is not the purpose of this bill. This bill's purpose is to impose a fringe benefits tax which will wipe employee share acquisition schemes from the Australian corporate landscape. The coalition believes that there are enormous industrial relations and productivity benefits to be achieved through the extension of employee share acquisition schemes, which are threatened by this legislation. We believe that it is important to give employees a stake in the enterprise they work for, to provide them with encouragement and an incentive to excel in their job and to provide them with an incentive to increase overall productivity. In the Australian Financial Review of 28 October, the respected finance journalist and commentator Barrie Dunstan wrote as follows: There is now little doubt that the Federal Government has made a real mess of its legislation on employee share schemes. I could not have summed up the situation any better. For all of the reasons which I have outlined-that, if there is abuse, it should be targeted: if you have a hole in the tax net, you go out and fix the hol- and catch .the sharks but you do not haul m the dolphms; that employees ought to be given a stake in their business; that existing plans currently cover wide swathes of Australian employees; that companies are already announcing that this proposal will lead to the stopping of their schemes; and the difficulty in amending international schemes, which might be applying right throughout the globe but which have a separate tax system regime imposed by fringe benefits tax here in Australia and which will need to either excise Australia from those schemes or amend the trust deeds to bring them in, which will see that Australian employees are disadvantaged when compared to employees participating in the same company schemes on an international basis-the federal coalition will not stand by and let the government engage in this ill-considered, misconceived, poorly thought out, messed up, hopelessly inadequate tax proposal. I foreshadow that the coalition will move an amendment to eliminate schedule 6 from the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.4). We will do what we can to defeat these illdirected and ill-natured proposals in the Senate. We will stand up for the thousands of employees of Cadbury Schweppes, Coles Myer and BHP, and the employees of Australia who want a stake in corporate Australia. We will defend methods of promoting industrial harmony. We will encourage national savings. To the government, which is b-nt on more cumbersome and costly tax comphance, we will send a message. We will continue to fight for a better, simpler and fairer tax system. Debate (on motion by Mr Les Scott) adjourned. ANL GUARANTEE BILL 1994 Consideration resumed from 22 September. Second Reading",11
3,Mr GEAR,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of the ANL Guarantee Bill is to ensure that ANL is able to continue to trade in an orderly fashion, especially during the restructuring process in which the company is currently involved. On 22 August 1994, immediately following the receipt of a due diligence report on ANL which revealed the company was in a difficult financial and trading position, the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) announced measures designed to restructure the company and provide it with the opportunity for a viable commercial future. One of the measures taken was the appointment of a new board with the specialised skills necessary to undertake the reconstruction task. Another important measure was the announcement, which the Treasurer (Mr Willis) confirmed in writing to ANL, that the government intended to guarantee all existing debts of the company and any further drawdowns required on its promissory note facility. It was recognised as critical to the reconstruction exercise and the company's ongoing operations that ANL's financiers could have complete confidence that their dealings with the company were secure and that the company's operational lines of credit should be maintained. This legislation achieves these objectives providing the Treasurer with the power, required to satisfy section 70B of the Audit Act 1901, to make determinations guaranteeing payments in respect of loans to ANL. Consistent with the announcement of the Minister for Transport, it is envisaged that exercise of these powers would be limited to guaranteeing ANL's existing debt and promissory note facility. While the legislation does not specifically address the issue of loans to ANL from international financiers, it is intended that this legislation should also enable the provision of guarantees il)respect of any such loans. I am confident that, in underpinning the restructuring process now under way, this legislation will assist ANL to become a viable, commercial operation. The government appreciates the important contribution an efficient and competitive ANL, and Australian shipping industry as a whole, can make to the Australian economy. In this respect, ANL will be particularly well placed to benefit from initiatives being explored by the government and the maritime unions to improve the competitiveness of Australian shipping by reducing costs and improving efficiency. In taking such action, the government is continuing to build upon the very successful program of consensus reform that has occurred since the 1980s. The government remains committed to the development of a competitive and viable Australian shipping industry operating safe and efficient ships under the Australian flag, with Australian crews and Australian award conditions. I commend the bill to the House.",17
4,Mr SHARP,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"I am speaking on the ANL Guarantee Bill on behalf of the opposition. It is a very interesting piece of legislation because it is absolutely and totally unnecessary. It is not only unnecessary but a symbol of the way in which this government has been able to, over the course of the last 11112 years, make a complete and utter mess of the management of Australia's national shipping line-our Australian flag carrier-ANL. ANL has never been able to operate properly, like a normal company or in a fashion that one would call by sensible and commercial, because this government, over the last 11112 years, has not been able to stop sticking its nose into the business of this commercial enterprise. As a consequence of the involvement of this government and in more recent times the the current Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), ANL which is wholly owned by the government' of Australia, the taxpayers of this country, is now in a most parlous state and probably the worse position it has ever been in. The jobs of those people who work for the company are in severe jeopardy and Australia's reputation as a reliable and competent shipping nation has been severely harmed. As a consequence of all of this, we now have this bill before us. The bill is before us because this government is incompetent in handling a major commercial enterprise such as ANL. The· opposition will not be supporting the bill, not because we do not want ANL to prosper, not because we do not want ANL to continue to operate and the people who are employed within it to continue to have a job, but because the bill is totally and utterly unnecessary. The Commonwealth, through this bill, claims that it is guaranteeing the company, ANL. The fact is that the Australian government currently owns every one of the shares in ANL. As a consequence of that, it is implicit that any debts that as a company clocks up are therefore debts that this government is responsible for. Purely and simply, the fact that the Commonwealth government owns every single share in ANL is sufficient to guarantee the debts of ANL. We do not need this legislation in order to guarantee the debts of the company. Indeed, this legislation is a complete nonsense. This legislation is again further evidence of the failure of this government to properly handle the affairs of Australian National Line, our national flag carrier. This situation finally reached the pinnacle of mismanagement over the last few months when the Minister for Transport went out and held a press conference and said that ANL, which this government had been trying to sell over the last three years, could not be given away. Here is a government trying to sell a wholly owned company and in the process of trying to sell it tells the people of Australia and every potential buyer that you could not give this company away, that the company has a net value of between negative $70 million and negative $117 million. This is sheer lunacy. This is the pinnacle of incompetence and mismanagement of ANL by this government-something that we have become used to. The problems of ANL are well known to anybody who has had an interest in it. Everybody knows that because it has been wholly owned by the federal government it has been starved of capital. One of the problems that has faced over the years has been that when capital injections were required this government was loath to provide them. The question is: what would have been the case if the government had sold ANL some years ago and allowed a private sector owner to own and operate ANL? If that had been the case I dare say ANL's position today would be a dam sight more secure than it currently is. I dare say ANL, which has been traditionally starved of capital over the last 10 or 12 years, would have found itself in a much better capital position with its private sector owner all the debts of and operator. All of these things would have happened if this government had done the right thing that ANL it tried to do back in November, I think it was, 1991 and actually sold off ANL. Indeed, it would have been in a far better position again if the government had done the right thing many years before that and sold off ANL back in the 1980s when you could sell companies like that fairly easily and quickly. So everything that we see before us today in the bill presented by the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Oear) is a living example of how this government cannot properly manage a commercial enterprise. It is simply wrong of the Minister for Transport to go out there and state that you could not give away ANLsimply and utterly wrong to say it. It is wrong because it immediately diminishes the· value of ANL in the eyes of any intending purchaser and it is also wrong because ANL does have a positive value, as I will demonstrate later. Over the course of the last few years this government has been making some rather substantial U-turns in its approach to the management of ANL. I mentioned a few moments ago that back in 1991 the government decided to privatise ANL. Initially, it was to sell 49 per cent of the shareholding of ANL. Between 1991 and August of this year the government changed its position several times on how it would privatise ANL. Orie minute it was going to be 49 per cent, the next minute perhaps 100 per cent, the next minute it cannot be sold to a foreign buyer, the next minute it can be sold to a foreign it buyer. Now we see yet another variation. Each and every· time the government has stuck its nose into the affairs of ANL it has done it harm. If it had gone out there and made a sensible decision and stuck to it, ANL would be in a much better position today. Indeed the board of ANL, which was given the responsibility of managing this business on a day-today basis, was not lacking in competence but was dealing with a - ost difficult situation. It was confronted WIth a government,· the owner of ANL, that kept on changing its mind. The consequence of that for ANL as a commercial enterprise was that its customers started to wonder what on earth was going to happen with it. And not only were its customers starting to wonder its creditors were also starting to ask questio'ns. Customers were saying, 'For goodness sakes, what on earth is happening with ANL? Is it to be sold or is it not? If it is to be sold to whom? A foreigner, an Australian, or 'is it to be broken up? What is to happen to it?' So traditional customers of ANL started to look elsewhere for their shipping services. They realise- - at if t?ey had to sign a contract for a shlPpmg freight rate for the next 12 or 24 months, there was not much point trying to do business with ANL because it may not be in business in a year or two years time. It would be better to get in ahead of the - s- an- negotiate business with another shlppmg hne. Of course, this trickled through to the creditors of ANL. The bankers of ANL started to express severe concerns. All of this caused the board a great deal of angst. Over a period of time the board wrote to the various ministers for transport-ministers keep coming and going-expressing their concerns about the privatisation process for ANL. Notwithstanding that, the government could not make up its mind about what it was going to do. Finally, it said, 'We are going to leave this whole decision about ANL in the hands of the ALP conference,' which was held in Hobart in September of this year. So we have yet another variation in response to the' concerns of the board of ANL, another variation as to the future of ANL. It was to be left in the hands of aatorganisation-the Australian Labor Party-to judge the future of ANL. We must remember that 60 per cent of the voting delegates at the ALP conference were trade union representatives, not parliamentary. representatives or members of the Labor Party pure. So all of a sudden this government is handing over one of its major commercial enterprises and its future into the hands of these people to make a judgment. The future of ANL was again left swinging in the breeze. In the process of trying to sell ANL, the government had a number of reports on. the valuation of ANL undertaken by vanous firms. Each of those firms produced different results. In fact, it is quite extraordinary when we look at the different reports that were undertaken by the various financial organisations to see the variation in valuations. Price Waterhouse and Potter Warburg gave ANL a positive value of anything up to $179 million. Arthur Andersen's valuation, which was commissioned by the board of ANL, gave ANL a positive value of up to $30 million. The board itself was of the view that ANL had a substantial positive value. To justify the claim that the minister made that we could not give ANL away, he chose to select the one and only valuation of ANL which was totally negative-that is, the Price Waterhouse and Salomon Bros report. It indicated that ANL had a value between negative $70 million and negative $117 million. We have different positive reports from firms like Afthur Andersen and Potter Warburg and our own Auditor-General, who in the previous October described AN- - a going concern, yet the one that the mmlster seizes upon is the one that gives the worse possible value for ANL-between minus $70 million and minus $117 million. We have to ask why, when the minister had so many different reports to choose from, did he select this particular one which was by far the .worse valuation prepared for ANL? The SImple answer is that the privatisation of ANL had become a flag issue for the ALP. ANL, for whatever reasons, has become a holy grail amongst sectors of the Labor Party. I am sure the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) would agree that the privatisation of ANL is a most significant symbolic event for Labor Party people. As a consequence, the issue of the privatisation of other federal government facilities like the Federal Airports Corporation has been clouded. The privatisation of ANL started to cloud the build-up to the ALP conference in September of this year. It appeared that the Minister for Transport and the government were going to get a pasting on the floor of the conference if they tried to sell ANL in the manner they had been trying to do. So the Minister for Transport looked for the most expeditious way out of this political problem. The way he did that was to find an excuse to pull ANL off the privatisation agenda. What better way to do it than to find a report which stated that ANL could not be given away and, therefore, obviously the right thing for the minister to do was withdraw it from the privatisation debate, remove the potential political embarrassment on the floor of the conference, keep calm those people in the Labor Party who value these things very highly and ensure the passage of other aspects of government privatisation policy such as the privatisation of the Federal Airports Corporation. That ultimately did not go through the way the minister would have liked it to. The minister chose the most negative report about ANL's value to solve, for very shortterm reasons, a political problem. In the process of doing that, he has diminished the value of ANL irretrievably in the eyes of any intending purchaser. He has diminished the long-term job prospects of those people who work for ANL. The seamen, the clerical staff and the support staff who are part of the ANL organisation have had their long-term job prospects diminished because the Minister for Transport has diminished the value of this organisation and made it less saleable-and, if it is saleable, certainly less valuable. The employees have lost something and the taxpayers of Australia-who are the ultimate owners of this enterprise-have lost something because the value of this organisation has been diminished. We see again the Labor Party engaging in an exercise of interfering in the affairs of this commercial enterprise wholly and solely for the purposes of shortterm political gain. In the process, of course, we had a major maritime strike-a wharfies strike. This strike cost this country tens of millions of dollars. Varying estimates of $50 million to $60 million was the value of the strike that was engaged in by the Maritime Union of Australia over the Minister for Transport's handling of this important issue. Not only have those people who work for ANL had their long term job prospects diminished, not only have the taxpayers of Australia had a major government enterprise devalued by several millions of dollars, but also all of us have had to wear the cost of the minister's mishandling of this issue in the form of that unnecessary, prolonged and expensive wharfies strike which has cost so many people so much money. But it does not stop there. We suddenly found that in the process of trying to retrieve the situation the minister had appointed a new board. He has sacked the old board-it is obviously iricompetent, it does not do the right thing, as far as the minister is concerned-and has appointed a new board. Guess who appears on the new board! None other than the mates of the Minister for Transport, including Neville Wran QC, former Premier of New South Wales and the former boss of the Minister for Transport when he was a member of the New South Wales parliament. Indeed, the Minister for Transport was a protege of Neville Wran when he was the Premier. It was always expected that the Minister for Transport would succeed Neville Wran when he stepped down as Premier of New South Wales. But Laurie has not forgotten his mate. Neville Wran QC, with no shipping experience whatsoever-I dare say he would not be able to tell the bow from the stern-has been dredged up as the new chairman of this board. He is being paid handsomely for his troubles-in excess of $150,000 for about a day a . week for six months to try to pull ANL out of the problems that the minister has helped get it into. So this is a pretty handy lurk for a few of your mates. That other well-known mariner, that well known shipping executive, Mr Malcolm Turnbull, is one of the other four members of the board. Malcolm Turnbull, I dare say, would be in a similar situation to Neville Wran when it comes to running shipping companies. He would not know the stem from the bow either. But these alleged experts are being brought in at huge expense, ultimately to the taxpayer, to try to solve the problems of ANL. It is an extraordinary scam. It is costing people in this country a great deal of money, and I think it is one of the most brazen exercises in looking after your mates I have ever seen. However, the story does not finish there. We then discovered that one of the jewels in the crown of ANL-that is, its 25 percent shareholding in Australian Stevedores, the waterfront operator-had suddenly been sold to Jamison Equity, run by Mr Chris Corrigan. We hear it has been sold for $28 million. Many people in the marketplace say, '$28 million sounds pretty cheap to me considering the return that it is getting from the profits Australian Stevedores; it seems awfully cheap.' But that story does not stop there because we discovered, courtesy of Laura Tingle in the Australian of last week, that, according to her and other people who observe these things, in the process this company that we are told is technically broke, that you could not give away, has turned around and lent $22 1/2 million to the person who has purchased the shares of Australian Stevedores from ANL. It is an extraordinary set of circumstances. We heard in the House last week from the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) that this was a handsome deposit and the rest was just a normal process of settlement at a later date. It is extraordinary that, when Jamison Equity paid its deposit of about six-and-a-bit million dollars, it got the seats on the board of Australian Stevedores straight away, yet the other seller of shares in Australian Stevedores, Howard Smith, did not allow Jamison Equity to take its seats on the board straight away. It waited until the final payment by Jamison Equity had been made to Howald Smith before it allowed Jamison Equity to take the seats on the board. We gave away our seats on the board. We gave 100 per cent control of our shareholding to Jamison Equity merely for the payment of a deposit. It was an extraordinary commercial arrangement. . . Laura Tingle asked in her .article in the Australian today what return, what interest payment, what dividend was paid by Jamison Equity to ANL for the loan of $22 1/2 million that ANL made to Jamison Equity for that period. There was no answer from the government on this issue. The Minister for Finance was asked to give us an answer the other day and refused to do so. This raises many questions, but the principal question is: why is it that this'governrp.ent has interfered so much over the years in the management of ANL, to the point where today this company is in very serious trouble, to the point where today the board has had to be sacked and, in effect, almost to the point of liquidators being put into try and take of over the running of the company over the last few months? Why is it that the management of this company, which has been interfered with so much by the government, has caused one of Australia's major maritime strikes costing. this nation many tens of milnons of dollars? . As you read in Laura Tingle's article in the Australian of last week, it is all about politics-short-term politics at someone else's expense. That is the reason so many people in the commqnity today are concerned about the way in which this government has gone about the process of privatising ANL, selling off some of the principal assets of ANL in the process and giving some of its mates a really handsome job for a few months at very handsome pay rates to try and allegedly pull ANL out of the difficuJties it is in. We have a situation which causes many people concern. The opposition is concerned. That is why we are opposing this bill, which has been put forward today by the Assistant Treasurer in the parliament. We are going to oppose it. We believe that if people really want to do something about fixing up the Australian shipping industry there are ways it can be done. There are ways you can make ANL more valuable by further reform of the Australian shipping industry. For example, company employment would add value to ANL. Another example is that of a second register. I know that this is a controversial issue within the industry and I dare say the honourable member for Throsby, who is following me, will oppose that view. But there are people around Australia today who would argue very strongly, as indeed the Shipping Industry Reform Authority has-it is an organisation which has been set up to try and help companies like ANL become more profitable-that if you implemented a package of reforms, one of which included the establishment of a second register, you could save $2 million per vessel per year in operating expenses. If you multiply that saving by the number of vessels ANL operates that fall into that category, then you can suddenly start to see that ANL can become quite a profitable company and, as such, have quite a good value as a business when put up for auction in the marketplace. If you want to do the right thing by ANL, you do not go out there and hold a press conference and say that you could not give this thing away. You do not go out there and give a couple of your old mates a handsomely paid for job. You do not go out there and, for short-term political expediency, change the whole direction and nature of the company. You go out there and reform the shipping industry and, in the process of reforming it, you help to make ANL a more profitable company. In the process of reforming it you ensure that the people who work for ANL ultimately have a long-term job with prospects that they can continue to be employed by this company. At the present time, I do not think there are a lot of people who work for ANL who have a great deal of confidence about their future under the current administration. So you have all these things that can be done if you are genuinely interested in trying to make ANL a decent, commercial, marketable company that has a real and long-term future. We in the opposition have said for years that ANL should be privatised-100 per cent of ANL. I have been saying for years, as have many of my colleagues, that if you do it right there is nothing stopping you from selling ANL to an existing major transport operatorcertainly I hope it would be an Australian transport operator, and there are Australian transport operators who would be interestedwho could bring in-house customers straight into ANL. The biggest problem that ANL really confronts, apart from the government's interference, is that it does not have an inhouse customer base, unlike BHP, our biggest shipping company in Australia, which has its own in-house customer that funnels in a guaranteed amount of custom every day. If you gave ANL a new owner, a major transport operator, then you would find ANL would have very good long-term prospects; the people who work for it would have a long-term prospect of a job and a good career. This is what the opposition has been saying for a long time now. It has taken the government a long time to wake up to that. In the process, in true Brereton style, the government has done many backflips on this issue. The sum consequence of all of that is that ANL is in a parlous state today because of the mismanagement of this government, the interference by ministers of transport over a long period. As a result of that, we are faced with this legislation. As I pointed out earlier when I commenced to speak in this debate this afternoon, this bill is totally unnecessary. The sheer fact that the Commonwealth owns 100 per cent of the shares of ANL should be sufficient to guarantee the debts of ANL anyway. We do not need special legislation. We do not need the time of the parliament to be taken up debating this bill. The debts of ANL are guaranteed because the Commonwealth owns it-1oo per cent of it. You do not need to have special legislation to say the obvious. For that reason, we will be opposing the bill. All this bill is about is short-term political expediency on behalf of a meddling and interfering Labor government that has no commercial nous whatsoever and that does not take into account the long-term interests of the people who work for ANL or the long term costs of the government's mismanagement to the Australian taxpayer. Certainly we w-ll be opposing this bill, because, if anything, the way this government has managed the affairs of ANL is typical of the way it has managed the affairs of this country. It cannot make a good commercial decision. It cannot do things without bringing short-term politics into it. For all of those reasons, we will be opposing this bill. People wanting to consider what the opposition would propose as an alternative have only got to look at our policies over the last few years and at speeches that I have made on behalf of the opposition on these matters over the last few years. I know that people in the Seamen's Union today would agree that many of the things that I have said would be a good solution to the problems of ANL. The bill is not a solution to the problems of ANL. This is the living evidence of gross government mismanagement, with this Minister for Transport taking short-term, politically expedient decisions, the cost' ofwhich is being paid for by the people who work for ANL and by the taxpayers of Australia.",17
5,Mr HOLLIS,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"I am pleased to speak on the ANL Guarantee Bill and to follow the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp). I am a little surprised that the honourable member for Hume has announced on behalf of the opposition that it will oppose this bill, and perhaps that is why it was not debated in the second chamber. I understand that the bill was listed on the Notice Paper last week for debate in the Main Committee room but, as usual, and totally understandably, those opposite want to score a few cheap political points and direct a bit abuse towards the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton). I guess that having the debate in the House will take their weary minds off the leadership demon that never seems to leave the Liberal Party these days. The honourable member for Hume said that this bill was unnecessary. It is a very necessary piece of legislation. As a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, I am aware of the deficiencies in the Australian transport system. I am arso aware that as an island nation Australia is much more dependent on shipping for its imports ,nd exports than are most other nations. I make no apology for the fact that I have always supported the view that the Australian National Line should be kept in Australian hands, should be Australian crewed and Australian flagged, and should provide wages and conditions which are comparable to the rest of Australia. The purpose of this bill, as has been said, is to allow the Treasurer (Mr Willis) to guarantee certain debts of ANL Limited. ANL and its troubles have been regularly examined in most of the media outlets over recent months, and that attention has reached fever pitch over the last few weeks. In the last week, the Australian has had two feature articles on the troubles of the ANL. The honourable member for Hume made much of the fact that the ANL is important to the ALP. Of course it is important. It is important to people like me who represent ports, it is important to Australia and it is important that it be kept within Australia ownership. Why is that? The reason is that Australia, as a maritime nation, is, like most of the maritime world, going to be faced over the next 10 to 15 years with a serious shortage of shipping. Even if they started building ships tomorrow at a rate of knots, we would still be facing a shortage of shipping. As well we will be facing a shortage of properly trained crews. It will be a worldwide phenomenon that we will be faced with a shortage of officers and qews. That is one of the reasons I have always strongly argued that we should keep an of Australian shipping line. Granted, the Australian shipping line carries very little of Australia's actual trade-only about five per cent. Nevertheless, it is important that that small amount of trade as it is be kept within Australian hands, if for no other reasons than strategic reasons. It would be a very bad decision by any government that would see our shipping line sold off overseas, crewed by foreign crews and officered by foreign officers. We would lose the control we have. I am the first to agree that governments of all political persuasions have made very poor decisions when it comes to ANL. The Hawke government pledged a $100 million grant to recapitalise the ANL in 1989. That injection was to allow ANL to restructure and purchase new vessels. As a result, the ANL had to enter into some very complex financial arrangements-which even a master of business administration from Harvard would have great difficulty in understanding-including the sale of vessels to keep afloat when the government stopped the grant. Another example was the construction of the River Tamar which was under way in Newcastle. However, when the shipyard went into receivership, the $10 million that was promised as a capital injection to complete the construction of the ship never came about. Over a decade ago, ANL was on its knees but the government of the day refused to allow the write-off of its debts. Instead, the ment decided to convert the debt into government equity in ANL. Since 1983 the Commonwealth has invested $100 million into ANL. In return, the employees and the management have increased the net worth of the company by about $450 million. Australian seafarers have been committed to ANL and industry reform. The Maritime Union of Australia has shown its commitment, and that of its membership to ANL, by making the line more efficient and viable. The financial difficulties which ANL faces, which government has contributed to consistently, are not from anyone source, but rather a number of sources, each of which must be addressed urgently to ensure that ANL survives as an entity and that its vessels continue to sail the seas with Australia's export cargo. Because it is Australian owned, the Australian people own it; it is our shipping line. While ever I remain standing, it will remain that way-that is my commitment, which I know is shared by many of my colleagues on this side of the House. The government and the new board of ANL along with the Maritime Union of Australia must work together to allow ANL to trade out of its present difficult state. I do not know why the honourable member for Hume made so much of the fact that Neville Wran and Malcolm Turnbull had no seagoing experience. He said that they did not know very much about the shipping industry. Both know quite a lot about business. What they are doing, in a six-month period, is bringing a business focus onto that line to bring it out of its present economic problems. The government, the Maritime Union of Australia and the ACTU have negotiated a package which I believe provides the foundations for ANL's survival. The negotiated package, which was concluded on 13 September 1994, includes that the Commonwealth will guarantee certain debts of ANL. This measure is given effect by this bill. It provides an exemption from income tax for international seafarers, the benefit of which will be passed on to the employers. This income tax measure, which as usual has been governcondemned by the opposition, will save employers 27 per cent on wage costs. It is amazing when the opposition here starts to wax lyrical about this exemption from income tax. I suspect that the opposition thinks that the money is going to the seafarers. It is not going to the seafarers; it is a measure that has been discussed and encouraged in shipping circles for some time. Rather than the benefit going to the seafarers, it goes to the employers. This was one of the factors I referred to earlier when discussing the financial plight of ANL. The consensus amongst most analysts is that the taxation regimes imposed on local shipping operators have affected the trading performance of ANL. But when the government enters into a straightforward measure which saves the employer 27 per cent on wage costs the measure is roundly condemned by the opposition. It is the first time. I have ever heard members of the opposition oppose-this is what makes me think they did not really understand it-and be so critical of something that goes to the bosses. We are used to those opposite giving us a serve when there is something going to the workers. That is something about which they stand up and wax lyrical, but this time there was a little bit of a gift to the bosses. I thought they would have supported it, but it has been roundly condemned by them. The government also increased the depreciation rate on new efficiently operated ships from 20 to 30 per cent. The Maritime Union of Australia agreed to urgently consider negotiating an industrial package for the industry covering such things as reducing crew size, the crewing factor, changing the existing employment arrangements so that overall costs equal those obtained under company employment, negotiating a long-term wage agreement, and reducing the training cost to the community level. By any standard, this commitment by the Maritime Union of Australia is significant. The industrial agenda it has negotiated with the government is ambitious. But, in keeping with its commitment to ANL and the Australian shipping industry, I have no doubthaving worked at very close quarters with union officials in Sydney and in my own area of Port Kembla-that it will come up with a very enterprising package. I am also pleased that the existing cabotage arrangement will continue to apply. I have often said in this chamber that it would be economic folly for Australia to rid itself of cabotage. Usually, the greatest champion within the print media of getting rid of cabotage is the Australian Financial Review. In past years there has been a feature article by journalists at three-monthly intervals calling on the government to abandon cabotage. The theme line usually followed up with a trusty editorial saying, 'Australian shipping has not achieved international standards of efficiency. It is a view that is very easy to rubbish, especially when one has seen, as I have, the condition of many foreign ships which frequently dock at our shores. The Ships of shame report, which I have mentioned before in this chamber, documents case after case of substandard foreign shipping. If we were to lift this policy of cabotage, which, as I have said, has been reinforced by this package, these ships, which are an international disgrace, would be able to come on to the Australian coastline and be a danger to it and seafarers in general. What really amazes me is that the opposition, which continually waxes lyr-al about the Australian tourist industry, is quite prepared to put our coastline in danger by even tpnsidering the taking away of cabotage. The danger is that, if cabotage is lifted and these foreign, substandard ships are allowed to operate in Australian waters, it will have a dramatic impact on the Australian tourist industry. Those tourist operators, which the opposition seeks to claim as its own at every opportunity, will be left with nothing except polluted beaches if cabotage is lifted. It is not alatmist to say that great tourist attractions along the east coast of Australia, such as the Great Barrier Reef, would be under great threat from substandard shipping if cabotage were lifted. I am also pleased that the negotiated packages reject the Taylor inquiry's recommendation that a second register of Australian owned vessels be established. I notice that the honourable member for Hume again raised the question of a second register. What do we mean when we talk about a second register? All we are talking about is people evading tax. The French have a second register of their ships in the Kerguelen Island in Antarctica. No-one visits the island; it is inhabited by penguins. In Norway, which established a second register, the International Maritime Union is threatening to black-list it because of the condition of the ships. The opposition wants to bring into this country a second register of Australian shipping. As I said, the only reason people want to bring in a second register is to avoid ' paying tax ancl to bring in substandard conditions. We do not want substandard shipping around the Australian coast. It shows the contradiction of the opposition. If it is so keen to have a second register, why was it so critical of the government when we gave some tax exemptions to the shipping industry? It was critical of that, yet it is in here today talking about a second register. We must always reject the idea of having a second register established in Australia. We do not carry a lot of cargo in our ships. What we do carry should continue to be carried in Australian owned and Australian crewed ships. It is interesting that the opposition is in here today criticising this measure. The proposal has the support of the peak industry employer group, the Australian Shipowners Association, which has welcomed this plan. Talk about a repeat performance. It reminds me of the legislation concerning the Coal Industry Tribunal that came into this House and to which I spoke. At that time, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), via a press statement, condemned the government action of integrating the Coal Industry Tribunal into the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. The opposition attacked the measure, while the Australian Coal Association, the peak employer body, welcomed it in glowing terms. The opposition again seems to be out of step with the rest of Australia as it has been for the last dozen or so years. We saw last week that it condemned a package of measures for the coal industry which the employers welcomed. One would think the opposition would at least check, by a simple telephone call, what the employers were going to say before it started busily putting out press releases. The national interest requires that Australia rebuild ANL. It requires that Australia maintain an adequate supply of shipping to transport our export cargoes. ANL has 14 shipping vessels, all of them in tiptop condition. It between 700 and 800 seafarers. ANL covers key world trading routes in Asia and Europe. It is Australia's largest employer in overseas trade. It is our guaranteed seat at the conference tables of the world dealing with international shipping issues. I think that is a very important issue because, especially in the past 12 to 18 months-since the Ships of shame report came down-Australia has been listened to in the international councils dealing with shipping and indeed at the IMO. We can have that voice, in my view, in the international shipping community only if we have our own shipping line. ANL is the standard bearer for what ships should be: safe, reliable and environmentally sound, with trained and decently treated mariners. Essentially it is a model for international shipping. ANL is too important to be opposed or to be made the issue of cheap political point scoring. There is indeed a long, hard road ahead to make ANL a financially viable shipping line. For all of the reasons I have outlined today, the guarantee of ANL is only a small part of what Australia owes to the shipping industry. I must say that I find it amazing that the opposition will oppose this legislation. I have to ask myself: why is it going to oppose this legislation? The only reason I can think of is that it sees within this legislation the opportunity to score a couple of cheap political points. One would have thought that, if opposition members had the interests of this country and the shipping industry at heart, they would have joined with the government on this issue to make sure that ANL is a viable shipping line. One is also somewhat surprised when those opposite talk about issues which would diminish shipping in Australia-issues such as a second register. It has been shown that wherever a second register has been established the only thing it guarantees in the shipping industry is substandard shipping and poorly paid and poorly trained crews. That is what a second register guarantees. That is what the opposition is proposing. What we need are Australian trained crews and Australian personed ships flying under the Australian has flag to ensure that the shipping industry, especially ANL, remains a viable part of the Australian economy. I commend the legislation to the House.",23
6,Mr MOORE,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"The member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) has a reputation for areas of shipping, and his quoting of the Ships of shame report gives him some credibility when he speaks about shipping matters. I was particularly impressed when he said he thought the ANL Guarantee Bill was to be debated in the Main Committee, where things can be hidden and where not many people turn up. We have to read about it in the back pages of Hansard-not up the front. Instead, we and the member for Throsby have been forced to discuss here the question of why this bill is here in the first place. I have no doubt at all that, when the member for Throsby looked at this bill, he must have realised with some horror what was going on. The reason we are here today is to vote for or against-in our case, against-this government guarantee. It is a government guarantee which has been brought in here because of the mishandling and mismanagement of the issue. It has been mishandled by the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), and there have been years of incompetence in managing this shipping company. For the 12 years that the government has handled and had the responsibility for this corporation it has totally failed to fund it. It has been warned time and again in the annual accounts of ANL that something must be done. So we in the opposition looked around at a number of government enterprises to see what ought to be done. We produced a booklet called Privatisation-the Australian way. It listed a number of corporations which ought not to be owned by the government, and ANL was one. That was in 1988. I am sure the member for Throsby, being a good member of the Left, would have been full of horror and scandalised by the thOl}ght we were going to sell all these corporations .. Remember what happened with the Commonwealth Bank in 1990? The union was told by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), 'No, we won't sell you.' It even gave a $300,000 donation to the ALP fighting fund. Within six months of the return of the government, what happened? It sold 25 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank and subsequently followed that up with a few more sales. That is the background of the government's approach to these things. It has misled the unions, its mates. In this particular case, the government vehemently denied that it would do nothing about it. But, in 1991, it announced to the horror of many around the place that it was going to sell a percentage of ANL. I refer to the annual report in 1992-93, one year after the decision was made to sell 49 per cent of ANL, which reads: Formally proposed by the Government for the first time in the 1991 budget papers, little progress has been made on the introduction of private equity to date, and the constraints arising from the need to rely solely on debt continue to inhibit the growth of the business. The uncertainty arising,from the lack of progress on the privatisation of the company, both within the ANL itself and in the wider commercial community has had, and continues to hive, a deleterious effect upon the company. That was in 1993- We then had some changes in the ministry. There was continuing uncertainty as to what was really going to occur. Were we going to sell the lot? Were we going to sell some to foreign trade? Were we going to keep it all in Australia 'shands? Then came the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith, the Minister for Transport. He was going to really cut a swathe through transport. Into the ANL he hops and decides that, on reflection, after he had a report prepared in this area, he probably ought to declare it an insolvent corporation, a company which has no value whatsoever. . On the basis of this pronouncement, the minister then hops into the operation to try to get some rationalisation. To do this, one of the first things he manages to do is to fire the board and to replace it not with people from the industry itself but with an adviser, Mr Turnbull, who was advising the board prior to its dismissal. He was joined by one of the great Labor mates, Neville Wran, and a couple of other commercial people. They went on the board to try to sort out the problems. The board made recommendations very quickly that the corporation should not sell the stevedoring industry shares and that it ought to have time to think about what to do in terms of working out a corporate plan for the rehabilitation of the Australian National Line. The adyice given by the board was totally ignored by the government. We rushed into a series of alarms on the day the board was dismissed. The secretary of the ACTU wrote to the minister on that very same day. . His letter reads: The Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) in consultation with the maritime unions strongly believes: 1. ANL should be maintained and re-established as a viable economic enterprise operating under the Australian National Flag with full Australian crews under national maritime award conditions. 2. The ALP policy should not be an irnpedirnent to achieving that 'objective, provided there is consultation and agreement between the Government, ACTU and maritime unions. 3. The Government should consider a number of changes that will give the industry the opportunity tp operate viably in a competitive environment. 4. The Shipping Industry Reform Authority should continue as the main industry forum. Having received that letter and the board of ANL having just been fired, we proceeded with great haste to sell its best asset. The best asset going for it is its shareholding in Australian Stevedores. Those shares were held in a joint venture capital company through Howard Smith. Howard Smith had been made an offer for purchase in a complicated commercial deal under which both shareholdings were bought. Howard Smith accepted the offer for a shareholding in the joint company. The same offer was made for Australian National Line's holding in the joint company. No response was received by the offerer. Indeed, the offerer considered it highly likely that that meant the government would not sell and had proposed in its own way that maybe that was the best option-to keep the government in for its 25 per cent interest in this area. Straight out of the blue, unknown to ANL-and it was not aware of the Kelty letter-it had a telephone call from the minister direct to accept the offer. The $28 million deal was accepted and the payment for it then became the subject of some concern. As was related in an article I read, the minister was attending a funeral. The car phone went beep, beep, beep, and Malcolm Turnbull was on the other end saying, 'We have to find a way to fund the share deal.' A deposit was taken of roughly 20 per cent, $28 million, and the rest was to be paid on completion. At the same time the directors responsible for the ANL shareholding resigned from the company, and the ownership of those shares was transferred to the buying corporation. That is a highly unusual commercial transaction. You do not give up your rights to ownership without good reason, certainly not before you have paid for it and certainly not without a lien on the securities involved. That was a very unusual operation. payment came. From the payment of the 20 per cent deposit to the final payment-which occurred towards the end of October, roughly world a period of two months-an amount of some $22 million was outstanding. The Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) said in response to a question in the House here that the corporation had to draw down some bank bills to pay its way in that time because it did not have the money in from the sale of these shares. Presumably, the implication of the answer of the Minister for Finance is that no interest was paid. If I ask the member for Throsby what the interest is on $22 million at 10 per cent for two months, he will probably tell me the answer is half a million dollars. That is what the government gave up by mismanaging this whole affair. What is the haste? The Minister for Transport wanted this deal done before the ALP conference so he could sell the Left out. He did not have to worry about that. He went down there to make some big deals and there were all sorts of talks. The member for Banks (Mr Melham) was talking about what the numbers were and how they are going to stop this privatisation. But the minister got in under its neck, sold the Left out and did not worry about the nicer points-$400,000 or $500,000 in interest commitment. The company could go and draw down some bank bills to pay its way until it got some money in. But the minister got his way. It really was one of the poorer operations I have seen take place in the management of a government debt. Can I pass from there to an even bigger area of amusement. Not only did the company get control of the asset for a deposit, paying the rest later, but also, on hearing that the shares had been sold to Chris Corrigan's corporation, Kelty rang the minister and said, 'I will buy the shares back from you.' But the minister decided he had too good a deaf and would stay with the shares. That must be one of the great sagas; the member for Throsby must be wondering what went on. The government gave away half a million bucks, gave away control of the shares, and got·out from underneath the whole The time for ANL privatisation before the Labor Party conference. When Kelty caught up with the fact that the minister had dealt him out, despite the fact that he had written to him, he rang up the purchaser and said, 'I'll buy the shares back from you.' That is not bad stuff. Anyone in the Labor Party who thinks that was an unusual operation would be well advised to think that that is totally correct. The proposition now coming forward is based on the fact that the government has now indicated that it is prepared to sell 75 per cent to the maritime unions. I am sure the member for Throsby thinks that is a wonderful idea. The trouble is that ANL is an ongoing loss maker. This bill is an open-ended bill which guarantees all the debts of ANL as an ongoing operation. So it currently has 25 per cent of the action or the equity. The trade union is proposing to have 75 per cent of the equity. Presumably, some breakdown in government ownership will go on. But while the government has a minority interest, or even a majority interest, it has 100 per cent of the debt risk in accoraante with this bill. The taxpayers of Australia underwrite all the loans, all the losses, irrespective of who happens to be the owner of this corporation under this bill. If that is not enough, look at the total discretion, the open-endedness of the bill, in which the Treasurer has complete authority to do what he will under the guarantees that are offered, despite the fact that the government has indicated that it will be a partial shareholder in this new corporation. I find that degree of commercial incompetence rather stunning. I find the ability to be trodden on by the unions quite remarkable. Do honourable members remember the great sea strike, when they eventually caught up with the fact that the minister for transport had sold the shares, and Kelty could not buy them back? So all of a sudden we had a strike. The minister was in the snow fieldsthe modern day snow bunny. He was a real bunny on the waterfront, so he hopped off to the snow fields. He could not be found. He kept out of the road because he knew the reason for the strike was wholly because of his actions-his actions in decflving the unions and his fellow members of the ALP who were going down to Hobart to talk about the ANL sale and privatisation generally. So this big thunder, this big proposition, came up and we all met down here in Canberra-the Prime Minister; the trade unions and Kelty. He could not have been terribly pleased with the boys by then. He had written to them and told them not to sell the shares. They sold them. He tried to buy them back and could not do so. So we have a strike, and down we come to fix the strike. The media said, 'It will be all over in half an hour. The station is not switched on.' It went on and on. I bet the language was pretty good-those guys, the members participating, have nice fluent tongues. The language would have been immense. The result of that was a great backdown, a concession in the PAYE tax. Despite the fact that the member for Throsby thought that was an unusual way to go about it, it was a distortion. in payment. If that was applied evenly to the rest of Australia, it would have an enormous impact. But we have this little impact here, this little give-away to the mates. It is a softener-'Have a jujube' or somethingMr HolIis-It went to the bosses.",26
7,Mr MOORE,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"No, it did not. The boss happens to be the trade union, because it is buying the equity. Mr O'Keefe-Twenty-five per cent.",29
8,Mr MOORE,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"The government is the other partner. The.tmember opposite should not think the government is going to stay stuck with that. Ultimately, the government's arm is going to be twisted further on this one. There are a lot more twists coming down the track. At the end of the meeting, after all the hot language and abuse that would have been used, the strike was stopped. Millions were lost to the consumers of Australia, the operators of the wharves of Australia, the housewives of Australia and the businesses of Australia. It was all stopped. Kelty had got some revenge. He was still not too happy, but he got something out of it. The trade unions had stopped the sale, and a few abusive words had turned a loss-making corporation into a very profitable one with enormous potential. ANL had gone from something we could not give away to a great asset after a couple of hours of abuse in the cabinet room. We now have a situation where the government presents a bill to guarantee the debt down the trail. The government will not own all the shares, but it will take the risk for all the debt that comes down the trail. I find the whole proposition quite preposterous.",29
9,Ms HENZELL,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"Capricomia) (2.11 p.m.)It is a great pleasure to follow the member for Ryan (Mr Moore), who I suspect is a real asset to the conservation movement in this country. After all, he is the ultimate recycled product. I think in these days of recycling and environmental care, we should be grateful to have the member for Ryan back on the front bench. He just carried on the story of his colleague the member for Hume (Mr Sharp)and this is a general discussion that we get from the opposition-about how the Minister for Industrial Relations and Minister' for Transport (Mr Brereton) is caving into the unions. I quote Kenneth Davidson on this issue from the Age on 17 September, which states: The tax concessions-accelerated ship depreciation, exemption from PAYE tax on seamen operating outside Australian waters, and rebate of fuel excise-are concessions to ship owners that ultimately pass through to exporters and importers using Australian ships, not gifts to Australian seamen. The concessions are necessary to create a ""level playing field"" for Australian vessels operating in international waters. Do we want an international shipping capability or not? That is the real issue the Government and the Opposition That is the point. The resolution of this difficulty with ANL has principally been about a decision by the government to support the need for Australian involvement in international shipping, and therefore I commend the second reading speech of the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) in which he said: The government appreciates the important contribution an efficient and competitive ANL, and Australian shipping industry as a whole, can make to the Australian economy. In this respect, ANL will be particularly well placed to benefit from initiatives being explored by the government and the maritime unions to improve the competitiveness of Australian shipping by reducing costs and improving efficiency. That has been one of the great microeconomic reform issues of the Labor government since 1983. The member for Ryan also talked about the differing financial assessments of ANL, which have been the subject of much controversy. I quote again from Kenneth Davidson's article in the Age in which he refers to the former chairman of ANL, Mr Bill Bolitho: According to Mr Bolitho, the method used to value the ANL by Price Waterhouse/Salomon Bros ""was inappropriate in relation to ANL and its circumstances, and if any of the leading companies in Australia were to be valued and treated in a similar manner, I suspect the same results could be obtained"". Mr Davidson further notes: According to Mr Bolitho, the ANL had been valued at between $56 million- $90 million by management, assisted by the ANL auditors, Arthur Andersen ... He quotes Mr Bolitho as saying: ""... I am quite certain that if anyone had bothered to ask the opinion of the auditor-general they would have received a somewhat similar view"". This difference in the valuation of ANL was also raised and accounted for by Bob Walker, the Professor of Accounting at the University of New South Wales, whom Kenneth Davidson also quotes in his article. He says that Professor Walker explains the difference as follows: Taxpayers asking ""how could ANL's audited $158 million shareholders' equity turn into negative for $118 million in just 10 months ... (should realise) that there's a difference between a balance sheet prepared on a 'going concern' basis and one prepared on a 'forced sale' basis"". Plainly, the report from Price Waterhouse and Salomon Bros, which had been commissioned by the Finance Department asset sales taskforce, valued ANL's assets and liabilities on the basis of a forced sale. So there are very many reasons why there have been these major differences in the valuation. I am delighted that, in spite of this controversy, the government has agreed in negotiations with the Maritime Union and the new board of ANL to work very solidly towards restructuring the company so that we can keep a viable shipping entity. On 27 June, in a speech on a private member's bill in support of my good colleague the member for Throsby, (Mr Hollis) I said: It is absolutely vital that we maintain our shipping 1988. industry, jobs and commitment, and not cede sovereignty to other nations. This is a crucial industry for this country. It provides $7 billion worth of shipping in imports and exports. We to maintain the value of this industry in try. Any minor savings that may be made would fully offset by our balance of trade in terms shipping costs. It is vital for the standard of crewing that maintain an Australian presence in this industry. That is absolutely vital for the protection of Australia's coastline, from an environmental point of view and also in terms of our own national sovereignty. I pay a tribute to the Maritime Union of Australia, w:hich has taken this issue. to the people of this country. Once again, as opworld posed to my colleagues opposite, I want pay tribute to the unions of this country which have always been prepared not only to fight for the jobs and the security of their members but also to look at the bigger picture and the future economic benefits to this country. I want to quote from a research document prepared by Mick Patten and Michael Carmen from the public sector research centre, University of New South Wales, entitled Paying the price ofprivo,tisation published in August of 1994 because I believe it gives a useful history of the ANL and decisions about moving towards privatisation and so forth. The first point made under the subject heading 'Research into ANL showed it to be vital and strategic asset' says: In the year to 1993, ANL employed 3,118 people, generated revenue per employee of $144,000, and a revenue per vessel of over $32 million. As an island continent, Australia depends on shipping. ANL's objectives when it was set up nearly 40 years ago were to provide efficient coastal shipping services, dispose inefficient vessels obtained by the government during the war and to prepare an Australian merchant fleet to meet national needs. It has since expanded its operations into the internaqueue tional shipping .arena, containerisat-n, management, stevedoring and door to door services. Since 1989 it has operated as a wholly owned government trading enterprise. I note that the member for Ryan indicated that the opposition was gung-ho to sell it back in The federal government announced its intention to privatise 49 per cent of ANL in need 1991. The process of due diligence to prepare the counANL for sale was commenced in February be 1994 and the line was placed under the of government asset sales task force in March 1994 as a prelude to privatisation. I believe we this had some negative impacts on the perception of its viability within the industry. During the period of this government since 1983, under the SIRA program, with the cooperation of the maritime unions, crew levels on Australian ships have been reduced to 17.97 per cent, significantly lower than the average of 23.8 per cent. Indeed, the to shipping reforms that have been undertaken have been very significant to bring us to a position of relative competitiveness in what is own undoubtedly a highly competitive international trade environment where we are having to compete against countries that use very poorly paid non-trained crews, as you, Mr Deputy Speaker Hollis, have mentioned on numerous occasions in relation to the Ships of shame report. It is forecast that ANL will sustain a loss of over $11 million in the 1993-94 financial year but return to profit in 1995-96. Over the 10 years from 1983 ANL returned a net profit after tax in seven of those years totalling $23.5 million. Despite this, ANL has coma pleted a $400 million re-equipment program with the result that its fleet age averages eight years compared to World Bank estimate of 17 years as the average age of the world fleet. In fact, I think it is true to say that the former chairman has suggested that, over that period of time, our government has ultimately put in a lot less than the amount of its commitment of of something around $10 million. So I think ANL has done a remarkable job, given the constraints under which it has been operating. A Lloyds shipping economist talks of a of interested parties lined up to invest ship in ANL, saying that in buying ANL a purchaser would be acquiring ships with an average age and efficiency to match local and international competitors. I am very concerned that, following the moves to develop a consortium, it is vital that ANL be maintained in Australian ownership for all the reasons that have been previously discussed-the importance of maintaining our own flag ship, and so on. It should be remembered that Australia depends on its national trade and spends over $7 billion each year on imports and exports. There are only three operators of Australian flag ships in the international liner trade to Australia of which ANL is a major player. In total, Australian flag ships carry about eight per cent of Australian exports and nine per cent of Australian imports. ANL makes a vital contribution to Australia's international trade development using Australian flagged and crewed vessels. This is of maximum concern to the Maritime Union of Australia. I think we should reflect on the terms of agreement that were negotiated in September with the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the ACTU and the Maritime Union of Australia. The first thing that is said in this agreement is: The Government and the unions are committed to a viable Australian flagged shipping industry. The Government's intention is not to liquidate ANL but to restructure ANL as an economically viable enterprise. It is recognised of ANL and other Australian international shipping operators depends on a range of factors, including taxation and industrial arrangements, arid that the future of ANL is linked to government policy. Accordingly, for the Government's part, it will urgently consider exempting from income tax the salary and wage of international seafarers and other fiscal measures contained in the Taylor Report. So, in implementing this taxation arrangement, we were picking up on one of Ray Taylor's recommendations. The union, for its part, was prepared to consider a number of issues which included further reducing crew size and other crewing factors, passing on the PAYE tax to employers, changing existing employment arrangements, negotiation of a long-term wage agreement, reducing training costs to a level no higher than community standards and entering into an industrial peace accord. So the idea that somehow we have just capitulated to or been run over by the trade union movement is another fairy tale that it pleases the opposition to continue to trot out. Part of the agreement that I think is most important is: The Government reaffIrms its commitment that a sale would be conditional upon retention of the Australian flag, Australian crews and Australian award conditions. The government remains committed to supporting existing cabotage arrangements and the existing single voyage permit system. It is going to be a major challenge to develop a consortium and make sure that the investors in the proposed redevelopment of ANL retain it in Australian hands. I believe it is vital that we meet this challenge for the future welfare of this country. I will return to the consultancy performed by the Public Sector Research Centre of the University of New South Wales. In sum, research disclosed that: ANL plays a highly strategic role for Australia as an effIcient shipping line which provides a window into decision-making processes in the shipping industry which impact on Australia. It is a positive contributor to Australia's balance of payments, expanding and developing Australia's trade links with the rest of the world (Asia in particular), and provides support for national security endeavours. These issues are ultimately worth millions of dollars to the future of this country. The executive summary continues: Prospects for ANL are bright, with the world moving out of recession, container freight rates rising, and the dynamism of the newly industrialising economies providing a ready-made market for quality, integrated services such as those supplied that the competitiveness by ANL. One of the tasks that the new board has announced is that it will be reviewing the current shipping routes on which ANL is operating to make sure that we are working in those areas where we can make a profit. That is obviously an important issue for any company to be looking at. The summary continues: ANL must remain an intact entity to be able to capitalise on the high growth markets that are emerging from Asia, as preferences for shipping requirements shift from mere price factors to broader concerns such as the provision of integrated door to door transport services. ANL is strategically placed for development by its involvement in freight forwarding, shipping and stevedoring. ANL should remain in all these operations to gain maximum competitive advantage. I believe that this bill, which will provide further economic security for ANL as it goes through its current restructuring, is necessary. It is important to make sure that, at the end of the day, we have an Australian owned shipping line that can provide a window into the international shipping arena. We will have to face very strict competition from other countries. I do not believe that this country should be about surrendering our sovereignty and allowing ill-trained crews on poorly' maintained ships to ply the trade and, essentially, take from us foreign exchange earnings that a viable, competitive Australian owned shipping company can contribute to this country. It will not only maintain jobs for maritime workers but also contribute immensely and increasingly to the future economy of this country. I believe it would not be in our interest for a shorHerm advantage to surrender our future sovereignty in this way. I wholeheartedly support the bill before the House. I am disappointed that the opposition is taking the view that it is- I congratulate Minister for Transport, who has continued on many difficult agendas to demonstrate that he is prepared 'to negotiate with the trade union movement of this country, as is the government, to provide successful outcomes to what are very important restructuring issues in this country.",30
10,Mr WAKELIN,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"The ANL Guarantee Bill, which the opposition opposes, is a highly dubious and very regrettable affair. We know that the potential liabilities are between $70 million and $117 million, that the government has poured $160 million in over the last three years, that there is to be $20 million per year of tax forgone on employees' salary, that the government has been trying to find a private owner since 1991, and that the trade union movement was deceived by the government and took action which forced the government to bring this guarantee bill into the parliament. At the end of the day it is the inconsistency which is of greatest concern to the nation. If home buyers were losing money be¢ause they had a debt on their houses and came to the government and said that they wanted an act passed through parliament-as thelgovernment is trying to do for ANL-the government would laugh at them. The fact that the taxpayer is expected-as has been the case for many years-to not only pick up the losses of the past but also pick up unspecified losses for the future must be of great concern to everybody. Let us go back to home buyers. If they get into strife because they are in difficult circumstances the government will laugh at them. If people are in a small business the government will laugh them out of court. I was with a senior banker yesterday who said it is expected that 15 per cent of farmers will be leaving the land in the foreseeable future. That is not something that I particularly enjoy hearing. I do not suppose anyone takes great enjoyment out of that fact. Part of the reason those farmers are being forced off the land is the costs that are generated by organisations such as ANL and the policies this government has developed, encouraged and overseen. If I were to bring in a wheat industry the guarantee bill or a wool industry guarantee bill, it would not even get past square one. But here today we have, by the admission of the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) himself, a bankrupt shipping line still looking for more money and coming in for more guarantees. But it does not stop there. If we go back a few years and look at the pilots strike, we not only had a very strong response from the government but we also forced many of our pilots overseas. We brought in the defence forces and, as a country, we crushed that strike. We.., showed the pilots a thing or two. But the inconsistency is still there. Let us come to the $20 million tax forgone on employees' wages. The member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) mentioned the bosses earlier. I wonder what the government would say if the boss were going through a rough trot and the employees decided that they really wanted their jobs and sat down with the boss and said, 'We had better work something out here. What we'll do is go to the government and we'll tell the government that we won't pay our income tax for a while. That should help the boss out; that will get us through.' We do not have to be geniuses to work out what the government would say. We have this inconsistency all through this. Those who have the power and the capacity to twist the government's arm have this ability to win these sorts of concessions which are right out of court with just about every other sector of the Australian economy. The member for Ryan (Mt Moore) made the point that this was a highly unusual financial transaction. Last week an article on the front page of the Australian described how this secret deal was done. I seem to remember the Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) denying, in response to a dorothy dixer, that that was the case. Every stage of the whole affair is shrouded in mystery and deceit. The government is struggling to come to terms with what is in effect a broke business. It is trying to come to terms with it for only one reason-the power, and the threat of the use of that power, of the maritime unions. I have developed a very healthy respect for the union movement. I have said in this place before that I am a member of a union. The union to which I belong is not of the variety that perhaps the ACTU would approve, but I am, nevertheless, a member of a union. I think unionism has taken many positive leads in this country. It has a proud tradition. But this is just the ugly face of unionism which surely this country cannot abide. Surely, if we are going to say that we must be consistent, fair and reasonable across the board to everybody, this is exactly the sort of thing we on this side must oppose-in fact have a responsibility to oppose-because it brings out, as I keep coming back to, this total inconsistency in the treatment of groups. I have touched on some other sectors in the community. I have touched on the effect of inefficient components of Australia's economy which have a knock-on effect. I cannot stress strongly enough that, if we are to have an internationally competitive and effective economy, this sort of thing cannot go on. It must make us an absolute laughing stock. If you were to go to the Grains Council of Australia, as some wheat growers no doubt will, and say, 'It is time we had a wheat guarantee fund and a guaranteed price for wheat,' even the Grains Council, I think, would dismiss it out of hand because we have moved on so far from that. If you were to go to the wool industry and say, 'I think it is about time we had a reserve price for wool,' most wool growers would say, 'You'd have to be joking. We have been there and done that.' But here we are bringing in an ANL guarantee act. We talk about nationalism-a wonderful term-and the need to have an Australian shipping line. I understand that Australian shipping handles something like five per cent of Australia's trade. That figure may be a little ambitious. But I also understand that BHP is among our largest shipping owners. What can be more Australian than BHP, the 'big Australian'? Before we get too carried away with our nationalism, let us look at what BHP is doing within the shipping industry? It no doubt has a different market and a different focus for its particular shipping business. If we are going to spend taxpayers' money in the name of nationalism, we have to ask ourselves: where do we stop? If we think that we can spend taxpayers' money in the name of nationalism, then why do we not abolish unemployment? We are going to spend something like $6 billion on Working Nation over the next four years. Why do we not just pass an employment guarantee act and spend enough money so that we abolish unemployment? That is where I think this kind of legislation is so foolish. I have no doubt that the proposed act has made some people who work within the maritime industry, within ANL, very happy. I am glad for them that they will have secure employment, hopefully for some time. But how do you explain it to the nearly one million people who are unemployed as a result of the recession we had to have-many of whom were made redundant from the 135,000 small businesses that went broke in that period. How do we explain this? How do we justify it to the rest of the community? I come from the state of South Australia and we had a bank once, known as the State Bank. As a former bank clerk, it struck me to the core when I realised that that once proud institution had been allowed to lose in excess of $3 billion. It struck me to the core. It is said that South Australia, in many ways, is in the hands of the receiver because .of the special deal the Commonwealth brokered with the state government, to which certain conditions apply. The federal Labor government has been trying to find a private owner for the ANL since 1991-about the same time that our State Bank in South Australia went under. If you are going to run a country like this, if you are going to dabble and fiddle, how in the blazes can you expect the economy to maximise its potential? It is the same kind of management, the same kind of nonsense which occurred with the State Bank of South Australia which has become symptomatic of the problems we are facing with the economy. The other issue is inconsistency. Neville Wran has been employed on the new board. Much has been said in this place, particularly by those on the other side, about corporate salaries. I, quite frankly, am reluctant even to talk about them. I seem to recall that even the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), unlike some of his colleagues, has said that when you get to this higher level corporate sector you are dealing with an international marketplace and perhaps the rates will be different for the salaries of corporate executives. I understand that Neville Wran is being paid-I will stand corrected if I am wrong-the equivalent of $750,000 per annum. Mr Ronaldson-How much?",33
11,Mr WAKELIN,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"I understand that it is $750,000 per annum. He may well be worth it-I am sure some would say that he might be; perhaps they would be from the Labor Party-but you cannot have it both ways. You cannot on the one hand condemn people for earning high salaries-the Prime Minister seems to have a bob each way on this onewhile at the same time pay one of your own mates the equivalent of $750,000. I understand that it is $150,000 for two days work per week for six months. We are back to this inconsistency business again. The challenge for the government is to govern for all Australians, not just for unionists, the ANL or vested interests. There has been some discussion in recent weeks about the privacy legislatiol'l in Tasmania. Following this bill, there will be debate on the racial vilification legislation. will not give my views on it because I believe that I might be ruled out of order. But, if we are going to talk about these trifling issues and the government is going. to use them only as distractions from these hard, main core, centre of economic activity issues such as the ANL Guarantee Bill-if they are being used only as smokescreens-let us show them for what they are. We all agree across the parties that ultimately, at the end of the day, Australia's future depends on efficient, effective, internationally competitive industry. So why do we have this sort of legislation coming into the House? Why do we have this sort of legislation, which makes a mockery of the Labor government's claim, firstly, to govern for all the people and, secondly, to run an economy which is to be internationally competitive?",35
12,Mr CADMAN,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"I would like to briefly look at the Labor Party's whole privatisation program and the farce and failure that it has been. The ANL is no exception to that process. The ANL is a company which should be liquidated-its current chairman, Neville Wran, said that when he took over-but the government will tip money into it and allow a union to use its members' funds to support a bankrupt industry. If a private entrepreneur wanted to use superannuation funds to do anything like that, he would be banned by current legislation as cherry picking. We had legislation dealing with that issue passed through this House three years ago because some private entrepreneurs were doing that with their employees' superannuation funds. Here we have a government allowing a union to use the same process of tipping down the gurgler union funds, gained by superannuation and savings, to bail out this ANL outfit because the Labor Party conference said that that is what should happen. Let me go through the record of the government on privatisation. It is a shocking and deplorable record. The first case that I would like to deal with is Qantas and Australian Airlines. I will read to you, Mr Deputy Speaker Hollis-you rightly know this-from I the ALP policy headed 'Relevant platform extract'. It states: . . . and acknowledging that deregulation of the domestic aviation market questions the need for a publicly-owned domestic airline to protect against the emergence of a domestic aviation monopoly, no longer requires the airlines remain in full public ownership. That is in relation to Australian Airlines. The document continues: Any sale should include an arrangement-a) in the case of Australian Airlines, the Australian government may sell up to 100 percent equity; b) in the case of Qantas, its status as a national flag means the Australian government must retain 51 percent equity and control and that this be tively guaranteed; c) no more than 35 percent of Qantas may be sold to foreign interests. Here are the actual ALP initiatives following its stated policy. In June 1992, the government announced its decision to sell Australian Airlines to Qantas and to sell 100 per cent of Qantas by trade sale. In March 1993, the government sold 25 per cent equity in Qantas to British Airways and effected a recapitalisation of the airline. Subsequently, the Minister for Finance announced that the remaining 75 per cent equity would be sold by public float but that this would be deferred until the benefits from the Australian Airlines-Qantas merger and British Airways link was apparent. The government is planning for the float to occur dl,lring the 1994-95 year. That statement says, 'We're going to stick out and hold Qantas as a national flag carrier.' That is the government's policy: it is going to sell it. The government dudded the Australian public. It believed the government at the last election. Nothing the government promises the Australian people can be believed. I refer to the government's stated policy on ANL. Here is another ripper: The heavy capital burden associated with maintaining an internationally competitive shipping line, and the fact that ANL requires enhanced commercial flexibility if it is to retain its place in world shipping, no longer require that the shipping line remain in full public ownership. The government's statement infers that it is going to flog ANL. It continues: . . . any alteration in the ownership structure of ANL will be implemented by way of the expansion of the capital base of ANL Limited and will not involve any reduction in ANL's Australian staffed vessels, but rather will be directed of ANL's share of the carriage of Australia's physical exports and imports. In the 1991-92 budget, the government announced its decision to sell a substantial part of ANL. At the time of the 1993 election, there had been no move to implement this decision. At the recent national conference in Hobart, the conference agreed to the sale of a majority stake in ANL Limited to a consortium led by the Maritime Union and funded carrier by members' superannuation funds. The proposal also details the company retaining legisla- PAYE instalments that would have been deducted from seafarers' wages and the workers would be exempted from income tax. The cost of these concessions has been reported to be about $28 million per annum. In addition, the Commonwealth would provide for accelerated depreciation for new efficient ships run with small crews. On 22 September 1994, the Senate passed a resolution requesting the Auditor-General to examine the financial position of ANL before it is sold. There we have it. The government's policies cannot be believed. When the government does set out to implement a policy, it allows unions to use superannuation funds, the stored up savings of members of that union, to purchase a bodgie business. Neville Wran said that it should be liquidated. That is what the government has done. I cannot believe that a government which claims to stand for the workers of Australia could fiddle and play with the lives and the future of those workers in the way that it has with the ANL deal. The Federal Airports Corporation was another privatisation movement by the government. The government is completely inconsistent in all of its policy statements. It does not matter whether it is taxation, the economy or privatisation. We are looking at privatisation. Let us consider what the government said on 18 April 1994. The Minister for Transport and the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Brereton) has all of this stuff. I do not know how the minister comes to get into so much trouble. He just seems to get into one bit of strife after another. In regard to the expansion to air safetyMr Ronaldson-He is incompetent. That is why he gets into trouble.",35
13,Mr CADMAN,INCOME TAX RATES AMENDMENT,"He is incompetent. I am starting to get the picture and I believe the people of Australia are starting to get the picture too. The minister appears to be a slow learner in some of these areas. On 18 April 1994 the Minister for Transport indicated: . .. his own preference was to move towards competition in the management of Australia's airports ... this would involve a initial sale private sector of a limited number of airports. He is staking out the ground. The government's Working Nation white paper of May 1994 announced that a scoping study would be undertaken into the possible sale of the corporation's airports. The government indicated a preference to sell these airports individually, subject to the outcome of that study. The ALP's national conference resolved that the policy of maintaining airports in public ownership be maintained. So, in one instance, policy can be reversed, turned over. Nobody can believe it. In relation to the Australian Industry Development Corporation, AIDC, Labor Party policy states: Labor will seek to promote Australian established and new industries by . . . retaining the AIDe in majority public ownership, consistent with capital adequacy. The government has flogged it. It has gone. Labor Party policy said that AIDC was going to be kept, but it has flogged it; it has gone. The recent ALP National Conference approved the sale of the Commonwealth's remaining equity in AIDC. The Labor Party policy in relation to the National Pipeline Authority states: Recognising the importance of a domestic oil and gas industry, Labor will . . . retain the National Pipeline Authority in government ownership ... The govenunent announced in the 1992 budget that it was proceeding with the sale of the pipeline. There is no policy platform in relation to CSL, but the government commenced selling that on 2 May 1994.)On the Commonwealth Bank, apart from the Labor Party's grand statement about all the things it wants to socialise, there is no mention of the Commonwealth Bank in its policy platform, and it proceeded to publicly float it anyway. Time and again the govenunent has promised things but has broken its promises. The government has dudded the people of Australia. Nothing could be worse than the way the govenunent has handled the sale of the Australian National Line. The current chairman-this man, Mr Wran, being paid a record amount of money-said that he believes that to the it is a bankrupt organisation. Minister Brereton claims that he knew a lot about how it was being operated. When asked on 16 September by Monica Attard and Jim Gale whether he was aware of the discrepancy in the various valuations of ANL, Minister Brereton said that he was aware of a lot of things. He also said: I was certainly aware that the board had consis.. tently and persistently said that the company was travelling quite well. He claimed on 16 September: I was aware of the fact that ANL had budgeted in 1993 for a $2.4 million loss and it's coming in at $23.5 million. I was aware that it's lost between $20 million and $30 million each year over the last four years. I was aware of the fact that the net debt of the company had reached $180 million, and even if we had picked up the tap for all of that debt and eliminated its servicing responsibilities, the company would still be going backwards. There we have the minister responsible admitting that ANL, the Australian National Line, was banlfrupt, that it had lost $20 to $30 million a year over the last four years and that the debt of the company had reached $180 million; yet he was prepared to allow the Maritime Union of Australia to sink its members' funds into this company. The savings of its members, the superannuation funds of that union, have now been invested in a company that has lost a total of $180 million. That is the standard of management of the Australian Labor Party. Those are the processes it has used for the sale of ANL. It has used those processes all the way through its privatisation program. It promises one thing and does another. I draw the attention of the House to the comments of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in regard to Minister Brereton. The Prime Minister was asked on 12 September whether Minister Brereton had been rolled in regard to ANL. He responded: Mr Brereton played an absolutely tip-top role through this and stood his ground right the way through, and added confidently to the various proposals and fashioned and re-fashioned them needs be. That is the Prime Minister's regard for Minister Brereton. Every day that goes past, Laurie sinks deeper into the mire. Nothing could be better raised as an epitaph on a tombstone over Laurie Brereton than the way he has dealt with the funds of the maritime unions and ANL.",37

15,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. Is the Treasurer aware that industrial action by the Transport Workers Union will have a potentially devastating effect on retail sales in the lead-up to Christmas? Is the Treasurer also aware that industrial action by the Transport Workers Union will restrict the capacity of farmers to move fodder for starving stock during one of the worse droughts in Australia's history? In the light of these consequences flowing from the industrial action of the Transport Workers Union, how does the government propose to bring this dispute to an end? Does the government now accept that it was a mistake to repeal secondary boycott legislation? Will the Treasurer, as the minister responsible for economic management, urge his colleagues to reintroduce secondary boycott legislation to deal effectively with actions such as these?",38

On wages and on time lost on industrial disputes, this government has produced infinitely better outcomes than its predecessor. In respect of. the transport workers claim, which is the nub of the question, the union obviously has a substantial claim out there, which has been the subject of quite a bit of discussion already. I have already indicated that a claim of some 15 per cent would need to be backed by very considerable productivity increases, even though spread over two years, if it were to be sustainable within the accord and sustainable within low inflation outcomes.",39

43,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The action the Transport Workers Union intends to take in relation to pursuing this claim is unclear at thii}l stage. People make all sorts of statements. What they will in fact do, of course, is another matter. Obviously, we would not want to see industrial action taken in pursuit of this claim. We believe that the union ShOllld be working with the employers on an enterprise to enterprise basis to bring about an enterprise bargain and to develop a mutually satisfactory arrangement which produces real wage increases based on increased productivity. That is what our wages policy is about. If the union pursues its claim in that way, there will be no problems whatsoever. If it seeks to pursue claims in a way which involves use of industrial disputation in a way which is against the law, then obviously the law is there to be used, as the Minister for Industrial Relations said yesterday. It is not as though there are no constraints on industrial action. There are such constraints within the law, and I understand that the union has said that it will certainly pursue its claim within the law. We certainly expect it to do so. National Competition Policy",39
44,Mr STEPHEN SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer advise the House whether the Commonwealth is committed to implementing national competition policy by mid-1995. If that is so, can the Treasurer inform the House how the Commonwealth intends to achieve this.",39
45,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is important that we pursue the national competition policy. It has beenMr Cadman':::"""" Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. The Treasurer was asked a question about the implementation of policy. He was asked to explain the policy and its implementation. He cannot do that during question time.",39
46,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In response to the honourable member's point of order, ministers know that they cannot announce policy in this House, and I am sure that the Treasurer is guided by that.",39
47,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am not announcing policy; I am simply explaining what the government is doing to implement its national competition policy. It seems that, from some of the comments that are being made, it is not well understood either on the other side of the House or more widely in the community. This government drove the national competition policy. In 1991 we put it to the states that we wanted an effective national competition policy, which would inevitably mean that we would have to get into some areas in the jurisdiction of the states to improve our level of competitiveness. It was jointly agreed that there should be an inquiry into this matter. The Hilmer report was eventually brought down in August 1993. We have attempted to pursue the cooperative implementation of that report with the states since that time. Both Hobart at the beginning of this year at the COAG meeting and subsequently at Darwin in August the· federal government pursued this matter with the states. Indeed, the whole of the COAG meeting in Darwin was devoted to this issue. At the Hobart meeting, we were told by the states that, although they agreed in principle with this, they were concerned about the need for compensation for the loss of monopoly rents of their government enterprises which would be open to competition for the first time. In Darwin the states added to that a concern that they share in the benefits they saw coming to the federal government from increased levels of economic activity as a result of the implementation of these reforms. They wanted their fair share· of that. That was an additional request and, as an outcome of the Darwin meeting, it was agreed that we would conduct an inquiry through the Industry Commission to assess the likely benefits of the Hilmer and related reforms and the basis of getting a fair share of those benefits as between the governments. The Industry Commission has been given terms of reference for such an inquiry. The draft report will be available by 30 November. It will go to governments for consideration before Christmas. We expect a final report near the end of January, which will be available for full consideration at the next COAG meeting in Adelaide. Asa result, we expect to have a basis upon which we can move to implement the Hilmer reforms in agreement with the states, hopefullyon the basis of the report being able to agree on what appropriate shares are. We are in the somewhat ludicrous position of having to argue about sharing the benefits of the reforms before the reforms have ever been implemented. It seems to be putting the cart before the horse to some extent. But that has been the demand of the Liberal states, so that is the course we have been forced to go down. We are also pursuing the national competition legislation. A draft of that legislation has been available for some time. The government in has had all sorts of responses from variouinterested bodies. We will finally put that legislation to the parliament next year and that legislation will then be passed in time for us to get implementation by the middle of 1995. So we do see the Hilmer report recommendations as being capable of being put in place by the middle of next year. So long as we do not get Liberal state governments continuing to block these reforms and preventing Australia from developing a more competitive economy, then we will be in a very good position to have these sweeping reforms, which will certainly produce considerable benefits for the Australian economy, well on the way to implementation from the middle of next year. Income Equity",39
48,Mr DOWNER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is also directed to the Treasurer. Is it a fact that today Labor Party members of parliament refused to accept the Prime Minister's recent false explanation of the fact that, under this government, the rich have got richer and the poor have got poorer? Is it a fact that government ministers have been told to prepare some concocted figures which might give Labor Party MPs some hope of defending the indefensible?

Will the Treasurer guarantee to table the documents in the parliament so there can be a full examination of the figures and a full debate on what is becoming a focal point of the government's failure?",40
51,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There certainly has been a lot of discussion about this issue in recent times. I think it has been made very clear, particularly by my colleague the Minister for Social Security, that the allegations coming from the opposition about some incredibly inequitable distribution of income in Australia compared to most other countries and coman pared to our past are utterly wrong. Ido not intend to reiterate all those statistics today, but certainly it is the case that the government strongly refutes the opposition's argument that there has been some us to produce a less equalitarian society and in particular that people at the bottom of the ladder have not been looked after. As everyone knows, there have been very large real increases in income for people on welfare benefits-aged pensioners, sole debate; parents and the unemployed. For those latter today. two groups, they have had substantial real increases under this government, as distinct from what happened to them under the Fraser government when they went backwards. We certainly refute that argument. We believe that, if you are going to do this kind of analysis properly, then you need to include in the analysis all of the relevant data, which includes all of the redistributive This - means you have to take into account not just gross incomes but also taxes, as they are part of the redistribution process, and noncash benefits, which often do not get taken into account in these analyses. Things like Medicare and child care are very important redistributive elements. I am sure a full analysis would support what we have been saying. Ann Harding, whose work has been used a lot in this respect, has certainly agreed that there has been a strong improvement the position of people at the bottom of the ladderMr Costello-Keating is disputing her figures.",41

53,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am just saying what she has said. She has said that people at the bottom of the ladder have had.substantial real increases in benefits. She has also said that any proper analysis needs to take into account non-cash benefits as well as the other elements. So it is a nonsense argument. Of course, the great irony is that all this is being raised by opposition which at the last election put forward $10 billion of expenditure cuts, much here of which was in the welfare area and would have made this a much less egalitarian society. It is incredibly ironic that we have it move by making these allegations today. I am not going to talk about what happened in the caucus meeting; that is not a matter of public comment. But, certainly, the government strongly refutes the allegations of the opposition. We are quite prepared to have that I understand it is going to be on later Unemployment",41
54,Mr HOLLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. I refer the minister to the also government's program for assisting unemployed Australians into work. What action is being taken to ensure that regionally based Australians share in the employment opporelements. tunities now being created? Mr CREAN'-I thank the honourable member for his question. I had the opportunity to visit his region recently, as indeed I did yours, Mr Speaker. The government is committed to regional Australia because of not only the contribution that it has made to our economic development but also the great potential that it holds in sustaining high economic growth. Working Nation also places in great importance on actively involving the regions in ensuring that they do have a slice of the larger growth that is occurring. Getting local industry and communities together in identifying opportunities and accessing the benefits and programs that Working Nation is an important part of this strategy. It is about forging partnerships between those who know their strengths and putting them in touch with the programs and resources. The structure to essentially achieve this is the network of area consultative committees, 60 of which are to be established across the country; 33 have already been announced and next week, in a visit that I will be undertaking, more will be announced. Essentially, the area consultative committees are jobs teams working in the community together with the CES to create jobs. On the trip that I recently took when I visited the honourable member's electorate, I also visited the Riverina, the Hunter and Orana regions, as well as the Illawarra. Mr Bruce Scott-Any marginal seats.",41

These meetings with them have resulted in a much better understanding as to what Working Nation has to offer as well as putting them in touch with the people that can implement the programs. What we are seeking from them is a commitment to work with us. Next week I will be visiting regions in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland. On this occasion, I will be doing so with Mr Lindsay Fox and Mr Bill Kelty, who have been strong proponents of regional development. I believe that we will be able to get a much stronger commitment from those regions to work with us. Essentially, what we will be about is showing how Working Nation can work for their regions. I am sure that they will respond because, in all of the discussions that I have had with the regions, they see this as a government committed to ensuring that their region grows. They see within Working Nation a commitment to resources, support and partnership. What I urge them to do, like all regions across the country, is to get involved in the partnership. Unemployment",42
58,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. In light of the minister's response to the last question from his own side, I draw his attention to the most recent Australian Bureau of Statistics survey which found that an estimated 24 per cent of all families had no family member employed; that there were 102,700 two-parent families with dependants where the husband was unemployed and the wife was either unemployed or not in the labour force; that there are 1,152,300 people in families where no member of the family is employed; and that there are 808,700 dependants in families where no parent is employed. Is it not a fact that the government's higher interest rate policies will mean that more Australians will live in families without a breadwinner? Does not your support for the government's current economic policies inevitably mean a sacrifice of future jobs growth and a widening gap between rich and poor in this country?",42
59,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, it does not. I was interested the other day to read the survey that the member refers to and reports in the paper, I think last week, that said, 'Both parents jobless in 10 per cent of traditional families.' The shadow spokesman's question assumes two things. Firstly, in relation to the circumstances where both parents are without a job, the question ignores the fact that they are on some form of social security other than unemployment benefitMr MCGauran-What about jobs?",42
60,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Just let me finish.,42
61,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The question has been asked. Listen to the answer.,42
62,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Because the 9.9 per cent-I know the Leader of the National Party has referred to this-includes many people not on unemployment benefit. The other assumption that is made in the question is that all families must have both parents in the work force. It is true that we have made conscious decisions to encourage many more women into the work force. That is demonstrated through the participation rate. But we say it should be a choice for the family as to whether both parents are in the work force or one of them. That is why we have introduced notions such as the parenting allowance. , It is interesting to go to the statistics breakdown of the statistics shows that the total number of couples with children is 1,960,000. The number of couples where neither person is employed is 194,000-that is the 9.9 per cent. But the breakdown of that shows that where both parents are unemployed-that is, looking for work and cannot get it-and therefore on unemployment benefit, the proportion is 1.3 per cent. The rest of the 9.9 per cent is made up of one unemployed and one not in the work force or both not in the labour force. In other words, they could be people on disability pensions. They could be pensioners-people who by virtue of their age are out of the work force. I would suggest to people on the opposite side of the House that ther Il).ake a proper analysis of the figures. The final point I would make to the honourable member for Goldstein is this: what we can see from the calculation on page 6 of the publication, table 1, is that couples with dependants had a lower unemployment rate than the aggregate for the economy. If you go to the figures in that table, you will see that couples with dependants registered 7.3 per cent unemployment versus 9.6 per cent for the rest of the nation. I am not saying 7.3 per cent is a great figure; it is not. Neither is 9.6 per cent; neither is 800,000 still out of work. But the fact of the matter is that this government has created 404,000 jobs since it was re-elected to government. Going into the election, we said we would create 500,000 jobs, which was ridiculed by the other side. The fact of the matter is that we have reached 80 per cent of the target in a little over half the time. The other thing we have done is to ensure that the long-term unemployed are not left behind. As a government over the past 11 years, as has been indicated by the Treasurer today and the Minister for Social Security previously, we have ensured targeted""lassistance through transfer payments to help families, particularly those on low incomes and particularly those experiencing difficulties in getting jobs. That is a commitment that we will continue, but it is a commitment that is already bearing significant fruit. I must say .. A that commitment would have been wiped out had those on the other side of the House been elected at the last election. Thank goodness for those families they were not. Australia Post",42
63,Mr HARRY WOODS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Minister for Communications and the Arts. Can he inform the House of the new indicators of the efficiency and effectiveness of Australia Post since its corporatisation? Is he aware of alternative proposals put forward for reform of Australia's postal services? Is the government considering their implementation? ,43
64,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You might be Bad Boy Bubby from Adelaide. I thank the honourable member for Page for his continuing interest in postal reform. Mr Bruce Scott-Speak into the microphone. We cannot hear you.,43
65,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister will proceed. Mr Bruce Scott-He has nothing to say.,43
66,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You might be another Bad Boy Bubby from Adelaide.,43
67,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The member for Maranoa has already been asked to restrain himself once today. .""",43
68,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The first point that has to be made is that the honourable member for Page has done more than any other member in this House to ensure that the needs of rural and provincial constituents are looked after in the debate on the future of Australia Post. I will demonstrate that in a few minutes. Every time members of the National Party write to me about the reform of Australia Post I send them speeches given by the honourable member for Page about the great job he is doing in protecting the interests of rural residents. He has certainly. done more than National Party members, that is for sure. The reforms that have taken place in Australia Post have meant that the performance of Australia Post has improved dramatically. Its revenue is up six per cent this year to $2 112 billion. It has made a capital repayment to the Commonwealth of $200 million and the dividend this year was a record $90 million. Labour productivity is at an all-time record high, due mainly to the fact that the management of Australia Post, the unions and the work force are working together to improve its productivity and provide a better service to customers. These benefits are not just restricted to the organisation or the shareholder; they are also being delivered to the people who use the postal service. Australia Post has frozen the 45c standard letter rate until 1997-a total freeze period of five years. With the passage of the Australian Postal Corporation Amendment Bill through the House yesterday, Australia Post will be facing increased competition. The minimum rate which can be charged by a competitor for Australia Post will drop from 10 times the standard letter rate to four times the standard letter rate. This will expose Australia Post to more competition. At the moment about 40 per cent of Australia Post's revenue is open to competition, and as a result of the bill passed by the House that will increase to 55 per cent. The second part of the honourable member's question concerned what other proposals are around for dealing with the postal service. I did go looking through The Things That Matter to see if I could find what the opposition's view was on Australia Post. I wondered whether opposition members followed the British Conservative Party's line of privatising the postal service. You have to look pretty hard because you will not find any mention at all of postal services in The Things That Matter. You then have to tum to speeches given by the shadow minister for communications and the arts, Senator Alston. What was his view on the government's reform measures? In a speech he made in the Senate in August about dropping the rate from 10 times to four times the letter rate he said: ... it is a Clayton's cut which is most unlikely put any significant pressure on the current monopopolicy.' ly. So Senator Alston is arguing that we should have total open slather competition for Australia Post. Mr Downer-That is not what he is saying at all. Mr MCGauran-You have missed the point.",43
69,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I will read it to you again. He said: ... it is a Clayton's cut which is unlikely to put any significant pressure on the current monopoly. This is from the opposition spokesman for communications and the arts. My office is deluged by letters from members on that side of the House complaining about any rumoured closures of post offices in their electorate. Some members of the opposition front-bench just crossed their legs and arms because they are getting a bit nervous and worried about letters they might have sent to me expressing concern about post office closures in their electorate. Mr MCGauran-Name them.,44
70,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The honourable member for Gippsland has asked me to name them.,44
71,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If there is any naming to be done, I will do it.",44
72,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will not name the honourable member for Gippsland but I wiIllet the House reach its own conclusions. I think this is just another example of the opposition's latest tactic. It was let out of the bag by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. He said that their views on the racial vilification bill would be explained to the public through narrow casting-one view given to those people who support the bill and another view given to those who oppose the bill. National Party members run around their electorates saying that they want to protect the post office, that they want to stop any future closures, and the Liberals run around all the meetings with the business community saying, 'We think the government has not gone far enough in the reform of the postal service. We think the government has not to gone far enough in reform on competition It is all about narrowcasting. The opposition wants to give one message in the bush and another message to the business community when it is meeting it. Do we know whether the honourable member for Bennelong is giving narrowcasting advice when he meets with the Leader of the Opposition? Is he giving one view to the Leader of the Opposition and another view to all the people he meets late at night in all those restaurants throughout Canberra? Income Equity",44
73,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Is the minister aware that the 1991 census figures show that in my electorate of Gwydir more than 25 per cent of families have annual incomes below $16,000 while here in Canberra just 6.7 per cent of families fall into this category? Is the minister further aware that the 10 most disadvantaged electorates as measured in these terms are in rural and regional Australia while the 10 most affluent are in metropolitan Australia? Does the minister agree that these figures, obtained prior to the devastating drought, highlight an alarming income gap between the urban rich and the rural poor?",45
74,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am not in a position to refute the figures given by the honourable member. It may well be the case that what he says is the truth, but I am not quite sure what he then deduces from that. We all know that people in the rural areas have from time to time done things very hard and obviously that is the case at present. They are essentially price takers and, therefore, they are in the position, in terms of most of the goods they produce for this country, where the prices cannot be set by them; they have to be set by world markets. In those circumstances, they have to take what the world markets dictate. It is obviously important in those circumstances that they have low costs and that they have maintenance of low inflation. It is a major policy ambition of the government, having achieved quite low inflation by historic standards, to maintain low inflation. That is something which I would have thought the rural sector would be very much in support of. Clearly, maintenance of low infla)ion will be of major benefit to people in the electorate of the honourable member and in other rural electorates. Low inflation has various other things going for it, but for people in rural electorates it is a most important policy de:Velopment. We now have inflation of around two per cent. We had inflation in the period of the Fraser government of, on average, 10.7 per cent. So, quite clearly, in terms of relative inflation rates, we are doing infinitely better now than at the time of the previous coalition government when it was supposed to be producing policies which were conducive to the interests of rural people. It is important for us to keep low costs. It is also important that we assist people in rural areas when they are in difficulty. That, clearly, has been done with the drought where there is a very substantial package available to people there. The government will continue to provide assistance. In relation to interest rates, it is also the case that those who are in the most drought affected areas and in extreme difficulty are 100 per cent protected by the package that was announced by the government from any interest rate increases. They are, therefore, fully protected-100 per cent protected-from interest rate increases that occur. That was an important part of the package of assistance that the government produced to assist people in rural areas. Women in the Work Force",45
75,Mrs EASSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. What impact has Australia's education and training system had on creating new work opportunities for women?",45
76,Mr FREE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Lowe for her question. It is gratifying to note that women are sharing in the employment growth which has been brought about by the policies of this government. There are now more than 3.4 million women in jobs, well above the peak levels of 1990 and 122,000 more than there were 12 months ago. That is a growth of four per cent over the year. The figures show that women are gaining an increasing share of both part-time and full-time work. The reasons for the increasing proportion of women in the work force are various. They include the groWth of job opportunities in the service sector, greater employment of part-time workers or workers with flexible hours in those industries, improved access to child care and active labour market programs, which have replaced welfare benefits, with incentives to work. Underpinning these is the range of opportunities being offered to Australians to increase their skills and meet the challenge of work in an increasingly competitive world economy. . Australian women-young women and women seeking to re-enter the work forcehave taken the opportunities that have been made available. For example, a significantly higher proportion of young women, 81 per cent, stay at school to finish year 12 than do young men. The percentage of undergraduate places at university filled by women has, since 1977, exceeded the percentage taken by men. One reason that girls stayed at school longer than boys in years past was that more boys left to pursue training through apprenticeships. But, as technology in the workplace changes at an increasing pace, formal training is seen as more desirable and more women are pursuing vocational training through the TAFE system. For example, last year about 57 per cent of TAFE students were women. Women tend to choose training in areas which allow maximum career flexibility, such as service areas. Their qualifications, consequently, mean that they can leave and re-enter the work force or take up part-time work. Employers in these areas are often looking for someone other than the nine to five worker. Flexibility is a key word. If the flexible and qualified people are women, then women are going to be filling those jobs. The development of workplace training has also been enthusiastically accepted by women. In 1993-94,64 per cent of the trainees undertaking their training in the workplace were women. The emphasis in the Working Nation statement on this type of entry level training appears likely to attract more women into vocational training devised by and suited to the needs of particular industries. Since 1983 we have witnessed the rise of the opportunity society. Women have responded enthusiastically to the opportunities which have been made available by this government. As a result, women have not been left behind in the strong job growth which the economy is now experiencing; indeed, they are filling the greater proportion of new jobs. This government's policy of creating more places in education and new training opportunities is clearly having a major and positive impact on the capacity of women to fill the new jobs that are emerging in this strong economy. Interest Rates",45
77,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Treasurer. The Treasurer will be aware that this week's Economist shows that Australia has the highest bank prime interest rates in the industrialised world. He would also be aware that the Access budget monitor released yesterday warned that, if the government perseveres with current fiscal policies, fiscal policy will remain too loose and 'interest rates will once again be the overutilised ""swing"" instrument'. How high do interest rates have to go for rural battlers, how much pain must Australian home buyers endure, and how many Australian families have to be driven into the Labor-made underclass of working poor before he admits his policies are wrong and before he changes them?",46
78,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Listening to the opposition, one would never think we have an economy that has one of the fastest rates of growth of any country in the Western world. Mr Costello- Mr Speaker, I table the Economist, which shows that we have the highest bank prime interest rates in the industrialised world.",46
79,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No. Resume your seat. That is the second time that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has tried that. You know that if you want to table something you must seek leave to do so. I am sure that he will do that now. Mr CostelIo-1 seek leave to table the Economist, which shows that Australia has the highest bank prime interest rates in the industrialised world.",46
80,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You will also wait for the call in future. Is leave granted?,47
81,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,No.,47
82,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Leave is not granted. Resume your seat.,47
83,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I was saying, listening to the opposition, one would not think we have an economy which is growing at over four per cent per annum. It is one of the fastest growing economies in the Western world. It produced 300,000 additional jobs in the last 12 months with inflation at two per cent. If that is an economy that is not going well, I do not know what we are supposed to do. That is obviously an extremely good economic performance, particularly as it is accompanied by rising real wages and rising real household disposable income. In other words, people generally are becoming better off. More of them are geuing jobs, and the unemployment rate is coming down. We have strong growth in the overall economy and we are doing it with low inflation. What else are we supposed to do? That is an outcome which most Western developed countries would give their right arm to achieve, because they are nowhere within that ballpark. Most of them are not growing at anything like that rate. Of course, many of them are only just now starting to pick up their game a little. It is the case, therefore, that all these questions about interest rates and so on have to be put in the context of what we have: an economy which is going exceedingly well. In the context of having that economy going exceedingly well, it is obviously",47
84,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,47
85,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We have an idiot interjection about the drought, as though the drought is the government's fault. Are you saying that it is our fault there is a drought and that we should have somehow affected the weather patterns and prevented the drought? Is that what it is coming down to? Are we now to blame for the drought? The fact is that we have growth in the economy of well over four per cent dtspite a severe drought. If it were not for the drought, it would probably be somewhere near five per cent growth. The fact is that we have extremely good outcomes. Obviously, in those circumstances, it is important for us to try our best to maintain those good outcomes. As I have said previously, that will not be done simply by keeping policy appropriate to what it was in the context of recession or very slow growth. In that context, we have had to adjust both fiscal and monetary policy, and it is appropriate that we do so. The adjustments that have been made to monetary policy have been modest. They certainly give us a level of mortgage interest rates which are well below the average of the 1980s, which was 13.25 per cent. The mortgage interest rates are now between nine and 9.75 per cent, which is far below the average of the 1980s. Housing remains highly affordable. We are still very high on the housing affordability index. The proportion of take-home pay-of disposable income-that people need to acquire housing now is less than it was several years ago, despite some increase in mortgage interest rates. So it is an absurd argument from the opposition that says that any increase in interest rates is ipso facto bad. In other words, having got interest rates down to very low levels, we should never have increased them. Mr Costello-Do you want some more? They are the highest in the world.",47
86,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me put into some context this bysiness about their being the highest in the world; Our long-term bond rates have increased considerably this year. But these are market driven rates. Those market driven rates have increased in all countries, following the increase in the United States.",47
87,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,They are up there. Mr Downer-They have not increased as much as they have here.,47
88,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Will you shut up!,47
89,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Leader of the Opposition will stop interjecting across the table.,47
90,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The increase that has occurred in most countries does bear some relationship to the historical record of inflation. When I was in the UK recently, I went to the Bank of England. The Governor of the Bank of England showed me a table done by the bank which fits the increase in interest rates that has occurred in long-term bond rates in various countries around the world against their historical inflation performance. It showed that there was a clear correlation between the increase in long-term bond rates that had occurred from the time when the US increased its official rates at the end of January this year and the historical inflation record over the previous 10 years. Australia was not on that graph, but we would fit in with that correlation. What flows from that is that, if there is any rationality in what is happening in the bond markets, it is that they are looking back to historical inflation performances and saying, 'That's the sort of thing that's likely to happen again in the future.' I strongly refute that. It is certainly something which the government is determined not to do. Having got inflation down to levels of about two per cent, we have quite clearly said that we are going to adhere to policy that keeps underlying inflation in range of two to three per cent. That is also the Reserve Bank objective. The markets will accept that only by the outcomes that are produced. In looking at what has happened in countmost ries generally-not just Australia-there is belief that the past gives a clear likelihood the future. I think that is wrong of many countries, and I certainly think it is wrong Australia. OQr policy is to maintain low inflation. We will certainly policy to bring that about. We will not go back to the higher inflation performance we had in the 1980s. It was even worse much of the 1970s. As I have said, in the period of the Fraser government the average rate of inflation was 10.7 per cent. That what we picked up when we came into office-double digit inflation and double digit unemployment. That is what this government inherited. We have now got inflation down levels of two per cent. We will not go back to those higher levels of the 1980s. The markets should understand that and start to bond rates in that context. Defence Force: Spouses' Unemployment",47
91,Mr DODD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel. Members will be aware of the difficulties that spouses of ADF personnel have in seeking employment. What action has been taken by the government to assist these Australian Defence Force spouses in their search for employment?  Leichhardt for his question and for his interest in this issue. As he said, it is quite right that spouses of ADF members do have particular problems in gaining employment. The best and most recent statistical comparison that we can find on this is that the general rate of unemployment for those people is at about 10.25 per cent compared with an unemployment rate for females of about 8.8 per cent. In addition, some honourable members would be aware of the ADF's family mobility and dislocation study that was released earlier this year. It highlighted the problems of ADF a spouses in trying to get employment amidst that frequent moves, mobile lifestyle, the geographical location of postings, the length of postings and the basis and the type of employment that they seek in reference to their previous careers. All this means that ADF spouses are, as the honourable member says, disadvantaged in not only getting but a also maintaining paid employment. They also of face restrictions in terms of career job opportunities and some of the niceties that many of of us take for granted, such as superannuation and the social benefits that accrue with continue to pursue regular work. Having recognised this, on 2 November on that behalf of the government I was pleased to for launch an ADF spouse employment trial in the neighbouring electorate of the honourable member, the electorate of Herbert, as part of was the ADF's International Year of the Family program. This will seek to do a number of things. It will provide information to spouses on employment services that are available into the community to which they are moving; provide local job market information to them prior to posting; raise the awareness of emset ployers of the benefits of employing ADF spouses; enhance the job readiness of service spouses through access to workshops and information sessions on topics such as job search techniques and writing CVs before they go to these posting centres; and also develop a register of service spouses in particular localities. The idea is that this will be run by an employment facilitator-in this case, in Townsville, from the CES-who will work 'with local commanders of the ADF and the spouses themselves to identify needs. Once the. Townsville trial is completed, we will examine the options of trying to extend such assistance nationally. However, I do say that this is a very difficult task and I do not expect instant results overnight. No-one can ever be guaranteed employment, but we do believe that this is a first step, a practical stepsomewhat overdue-in attempting to address the problems of ADF spouses and their families.",48
92,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Treasurer. Mr O'Keefe-Speak up so we can hear you. Ask a good question.,49
93,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Burke.,49
94,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I refer the Treasurer to the growing concern throughout rural Australia that the looming budget deficit crisis will prompt yet another increase in fuel tax. Given the precarious nature of the drought ravaged rural economy, can the Treasurer give the people who live and work in rural Australia an assurance that fuel tax will not be raised yet again during the term of his government?",49
95,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I think this talk of a budget deficit crisis is rather absurd. We do not have a budget deficit crisis. What we have is a budget deficit which is coming down considerably. On the projections and the forward estimates, it will be less than one per cent of GDP by 1996-97. I notice that even Access Economics is now accepting that, this year, the budget deficit will actually be le- than we actually projected it would be. It is saying that it will be some $400 million to $500 million less than the budget deficit figure that we announced. Obviously it will have different views in the out years, but this year it is accepting that we might even do better than we forecast. I think that Access Economics might be too pessimistic about that; we might even do better than that. In terms of the future for the budget, we will be making our decisions as we come to put the budget together for May of next year. Mr MCGauran-So, you don't rule it out?",49
96,Mr WILLIS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am not going to start ruling out anything at this stage. Of course, this fits in with the silly questions that we keep getting from the opposition. The opposition says, 'Rule out an income tax increase; rule out this increase, rule out that increase.' We are not going to be ruling out anything, I assure the opposition, but it should not necessarily read anything into that. We will not have a budget produced by the Fuel Tax process of ruling out any particular item. We will, however, bear in mind the concern of the opposition to see the deficit tightened. We expect that, if we were to do anything of that kind, the opposition would obviously support it wholeheartedly, because it is so concerned to see the deficit reduced. If we were to take some action, such as to increase fuel taxes or anything like that, we would expect the opposition-concerned as it is about the national good and the need to reduce the budget deficit-to be wholeheartedly, 100 per cent, in support of it and not to do its normal thing of saying, 'We support budget deficit reductions, but we oppose all the individual items that might go into making up such action.' As the Minister for Finance said here yesterday, you are deficit Daleks in this House and you are deficit junkies in the Senate, because you keep opposing all of our measures to reduce the deficit. Even quite minor items are opposed on a routine basis by the opposition in the· Senate to reduce our capacity to reduce the deficit. So I find it quite ironic that we have this continuous barrage of questioning about the need to reduce the deficit and even to reduce it by way of reducing expenditures and then, when particular measures come up and go into the Senate, they are opposed by the opposition. It simply cannot pursue a consistent policy approach. The policy that it pursues at a micro level is almost 100 per cent different from that which it pursues at the macro level in saying what should be happening to deficits overall. Trade Practices Act  with the opposition. My question is directed to the Assistant Treasurer. What effect have last year's amendments to the Trade Practices Act had on business behaviour? Can the minister advise the House what benefits consumers can expect from the proposed amendments which are now available for public comment?",49
97,Mr GEAR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. Last year's amendments served notice on the business community that the government is serious about using competition law to protect the rights of consumers. We tightened the merger rules to prevent takeovers that might substantially lessen competition, and we increased penalties-in some cases as much as 40 times. The courts have recognised the tougher approach in a series of decisions and awarded record penalties-in some cases as much as $61f2 million in penalties and costs against TNT and Ansett Transport Industries for operating a price fixing and market sharing cartel. They have also been successful in prosecutions for price fixing and market sharing in the Brisbane concrete market. Just last week two companies and their representatives were fined over half a million dollars price fixing and a collective boycott in the scrap metal market. Courts see breaches of the competition law as serious offences and, after the TNT case, I am sure that all firms are aware of this. While the courts are now imposing maximum fines for each offence, business should be aware that the new prosecutions have much higher fines. Maximum fines have been increased from $250,000 to $10 million. Fines have an important role, but that is not the only approach. The Federal Court recently endorsed a settlement between the Trade Practices Commission and a firm reselling mobile phones. The company had failed to reveal the true price of its phones and had breached the third-line forcing provisions by insisting that phone buyers sign up to a specific phone company. The settlement between the Trade Practices Commission and the company requires the company to give consumers the full story. Companies must write to all customers telling them that they are not bound to one phone company. They have to develop a compliance program for the industry to ensure that consumers' rights are properly protected into the future. There will be more of this consumer protection program when we bring in national competition policy and establish the Australian competition commission. In the meantime, the Trade Practices Cortunission will continue to enforce the law vigorously in the interests of consumers. When it is incorporated in the Australian competition commission next year, consumers will have further protection by the extension of the act to the activities of all businesses, including state government firms and professions. Firms now know that they have to compete on price and quality. Relying on market power and rigging markets is very much a thing of the past. Arts: Mr Geoffrey Tozer",50
98,Mr NUGENT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Communications and the Arts. I refer to the decision by the Australia Council to renew the creative fellowship for awarded to Mr Geoffrey Tozer. In the guidelines it states 'in exceptional circumstances a new Fellowship may be granted at the end of the first' where 'a Fellowship proved to be especially rewarding for the artist and the community'. Given that Mr Tozer failed in one of the activities upon which he was awarded his first creative fellowship in 1989-namely, to work towards the establishment of a school of musical excellence specialising in piano-when he sold his property in Queanbeyan last year for $305,000, what exceptionalcircurnstances were there to award Mr Tozer a second fellowship?",50
99,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Mr SPEAKER ,51
100,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The Prime Minister answered this a couple of weeks ago!,51
101,Mr LEE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As the Minister for Finance interjects, this is the same question asked of the Prime Minister a couple of weeks ago. Not only is it a repeat of the question to Prime Minister; it is not a question about creative fellowships announced a month ago but about a creative fellowship that was awarded a year ago by an independent advisory committee and determined by the Australia Council, which makes decisions independent of the government. Law of the Sea",51
102,Mr CLEELAND,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Resources and concerns the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the development of our resource base. What are the implications for Australia's resource development of the declaration of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea? What is the government doing to ensure that the mineral resources on our continental shelf are identified, effectively managed and developed?",51
103,Mr BEDDALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for MCEwen for his question. Tomorrow the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea comes into force. The convention provides the legal framework for nations to exercise exclusive economic rights over the continental ocean and seabed within a 200 nautical mile limit and to lay claim to those parts of their continental shelf extending beyond 200 nautical miles. As a consequence, tomorrow 8.6 million square kilometres of ocean and seabed, and all the resources they contain, will be added to our existing land mass of 7.8 million square kilometres. Under the convention, Australia can also claim jurisdiction over an additional four million square kilometres approximately of seabed on our continental shelf beyond the 200 nautical mile limit. This seabecVarea of about 12'12 million square kilometres is 1'12 times Australia's current land mass and is likely to be the largest claimed by While there has been exploration for oil and gas in some areas of our continental shelf, most of this vast area, including the deeper seabed, is unexplored for energy and minerals. The Australian government, on behalf of the Australian community which owns the resource, has the responsibility to ensure that the these potentially very rich resources are the identified and, if viable, developed. In particular, the government has a responsibility to substantiate Australia's claim over those areas of our continental shelf beyond the 200 mile limit. To do so, we must gather geological information on the extent of our continental margins and lodge our claim with the supporting information within the next 10 years. As a consequence, the government has recently reaffIrmed its support for the continuation of the $20 million continental margin program which, unfortunately, when the userpays charge was rejected by the Senate, placed AGSO operations in doubt. The government has decided that this program is fundamental to the law of the sea convention, so AGSO will receive full funding-without any help from the opposition-and it will be its main priority over the coming years.",51

I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",53
126,Dr KEMP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"During question time the government was asked on several occasions about the growing social crisis that is being experienced in this country at present. It is' clear from the answers received that a huge gap is opening up between the fantasy land in which the government lives and the realities of this country. There is no doubt why this is occurring: the government is led by a Prime Minister who is dramatically out of touch with the lives of ordinary people in Australia. I do not believe there has ever been a government which has been so out of touch with what is happening in this country. Today we have the· Prime Minister (Mr Keating) grandstanding in international for., urns. He drives around this country in his big cars with the windows wound up. He moves from his increasingly sumptuous residence in Canberra to sumptuous international guesthouses where he mixes with the world's greats. He told us on Burke s backyard last week that when he goes to bed he browses through the catalogues of Christie's or Sotheby's wondering where his next antique is going to come from. Out there, beyond those cars with their wound up windows and beyond the walls of those sumptuous residences, hundreds of thousands of people are wondering where their meals are going to come from during the week. This country is facing a crisis which threatens its future foundations. This crisis goes to the very heart of the foundations of Australia's family life. The tragic social consequence of this government and its accord has been the widening gap between the rich and the poor and the growth of an underclass of people locked out of jobs and trapped in poverty. The government does not like to hear the statistics: Let us just hear them again: real wages for the bottom 10 per cent of income earners have fallen by five per cent since this government came to power while incomes for the top 10 per cent have gone up by seven per cent over the same period; the top 10 per cent of Australians now get 261f2 per cent of household income while the bottom 10 per cent get 11/z per cent; 78 per cent of those in poverty are families and 64 per cent are families with children. We are told that this is all statistical manipulation. This is the problem: something is wrong with the statistics. Let me therefore quote from the Salvation Army's report Generations of Caring. The Salvation Army from day to day.has to face the reality in this country. That reality is: As Australia starts to emerge from the recession run the risk of a significant proportion of our population becoming entrenched in poverty due to their increasing marginalisation in the employment market and an increasing polarisation in our community between an affluent majority and an impoverished minority. This growing gap between rich and poor is not some statistical artefact; this is the reality that helping organisations of this country face every day and every week. It is time that the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin), who is at the table, and his leader got out there and started to see what is really happening in Australia today. Let there be no doubt that the most damaging failure of this government has been its inability to provide enough work for people who are desperately looking for opportunities. There is a huge unmet demand for work in this country. It is a tragic fact that, despite four years of the slowest economic recovery since the Great Depression of the 1930s, more people are unemployed in Australia today than there were at the peak of the last recession in 1983. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) never tires of telling us about the white paper, but the number of long-term unemployed people in Australia today is higher than it was at the peak of the last recession. This is despite all the government's efforts to hide these long term unemployed in its short-term training and subsidised jobs programs. But, in addition to the people who are unemployed, there are 147,000 discouraged job seekers who are not included in the statistics; there are 700,000 other people who would be available to start work within four weeks if there were work for them; and there are 559,000 people who have some work but want more, who are underemployed or who cannot get the work they want. What does that add up to? It adds up to over two million Australians in Australia today who cannot get the work they want because of the economic policies-the totally misguided economic policies-which this government has put in place. . In 24 per cent of Australian families there is no-one employed, and there are over 800,000 dependants in families where no we parent has a job. The social consequences of this are horrendous. Let me quote to the minister again from the Salvation Army. These are not things that the opposition is saying; these are things that the caring organisations of this country meet with day after day. The Salvation Army states: The symptoms of unmanaged social change include family violence, family breakdown, issues of public safety, inequitable geographic and socio-economic distribution of long-term unemployment, growing homelessness, a rise in mental illness, the emergence of a ""new poor"" and generational poverty. In Australia today, the elderly people in families suffer an increasingly dangerous existence and experience as a result of these failures. We heard the Minister for Employment, Education and Training say today, 'Well, a lot of these people are on welfare; we've got programs to help them.' The first point to make about this is that these people want jobs: they want real opportunities; they want the chance to get out and do something for themselves. They are fed up with their dependence, in poverty, which the minister seems to take such pride in having created. There are people in this country who are, believe it or not, now third generation unemployed. There are young people who have never known their parents to have a job and who have never seen their grandparents in work. I have heard this as I have gone around every state talking to the caring organisations. They say that it is unbelievable that there are people now who are com-letely locked out of the Australian economy and locked out of opportunity by that culture of dependence which the government's economic and welfare policies have created. These people are trapped. They are trapped by this culture of dependence and by their shattered self-esteem. Let me tell you, Minister-and pass this on to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training-that the 1liz days casework a year that he is promising these long-term unemployed people are not going to serve to get them out of this cycle of poverty. Mr Richard Evans-It's a hoax!",53
127,Dr KEMP,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The white paper is a total hoax. It is time the government faced up to some of the realities. The failure of the and economic policies from this government is across the board. It may interest you, Minister, to know that 26 per cent of women say the reason they are not actively seeking work is that they cannot get child care. After 11 years of your government, child care is a hopeless mess. Your tax system discriminates against families at those very moments in the life cycle when families need that recognition which is most important to the futdre health and growth of their children-that is, when their children are young. When children are rder five, the great majority of families in this country have one parent at home caring for their children. Yet these are the very people who are disadvantaged by your government's home child-care allowance which, as you know, is half the level of the cash rebate for working parents. People know that this home child-care allowance is a farce. It is not new income. There is hardly any new money in it. It was introduced in such a rush, as you know only too well, Minister, that some of the most needy families in this country were left out the unemployed families. Had it not been for the activities of the coalition in the Senate forcing you to face up to the defects in your legislation on this, no action would have been taken. If the coalition had not stood up for these families, they would still be left out of any help from this home child-care allowance. The pressures that your policy failures are imposing on families are immense. Family breakdown measured by the divorce rate has reached a lO-year high. Family breakdown costs this country $3 billion a year. Over 45,000 children go through the pain of family breakdown each year, and suicide amongst Australia's young people is now the highest in the world. The International Year of the Family has not brought relief to Australia's families. It has not meant a change in the government's thinking about how to deal with this mounting social crisis in this country. It has not brought any practical solutions; it has brought a torrent of words, empty rhetoric and ill-thought-out measures in a desperate effort, as the election approaches inexorably, to persuade the people of this country that social something is actually being done. Four years into this recovery-as I say, one of the slowest recoveries since the Great Depression of the 1930s-economists are already predicting the next business downturn in 1996, if not before, and unemployment is still over nine per cent. There is a growing recognition in this country that your leader's well-known medicine of boom and bust is back with a vengeance. The question that they are all waiting to see the answer to is whether he is going to race under the wire to an election to escape the full anger of the Australian people. Australian families are now well and truly back on the rack of rising interest rates. This means rising mortgage rates for them and more money out of their very squeezed family budgets. Since August, official interest rates have risen 13/4 per cent. The typical home buyer is already facing rises of $50 per month in interest repayments on the family home. Let me remind you, Minister, of what the latest Access Economics monitor for November this year said when it identified who were the big losers from your rising interest rates. It said: The young married couple, with two kids, earning $800 per week, aged 25 to 34, with a mortgage, car and private health insurancethe people who live by the rules, the people who try to do their best for the community, the people who try to bring up their children the way they really want to, the people who try to make a contribution to this countryare the worse off of any group, having had the fastest actual rise in prices. The thing that hits you most about this situation is, its unfairness. Under the Keating government, the light on the hill has really gone out. What we have now is a government which is trying to get away with empty rhetoric and trying to shut its eyes to the crisis which its policies have caused out there in the community. What happens when the next business downturn comes? It is going to. Not even you claim to have abolished the business cycle. What happens as unemployment ratchets up again? What happens as job opportunities shrink again? What happens to these families and these children on which Australia depends? The vicious circle of rising interest rates and job destruction which led to the worse recession in 60 years is cranking itself up again. What this country needs is a national government which puts families first. There is only one political grouping in this country which has so far put forward a national family strategy to help families. The first element in that national family strategy is the creation of jobs. It is to get out there and help small business employ people. The vast number of jobs which this government brags about are part-time jobs and casual jobs. Full-time jobs are too difficult for small business in this country to create because of the government's industrial relations laws, its unfair dismissal laws and its complex taxes. The government is destroying job opportunities in this country. Until we get a responsible job creation policy in place, we are not going to see a change and we are not going to see this social crisis addressed. This government is not concerned with families. It is not concerned with the realities in this country. It is concerned with its mates and with preserving its own power. (Time expired)",55
128,Mr BALDWIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,How edifying it is to see our old friend Count Yorga emerge from his coffin to shed a few crocodile tears on behalf of Australian families. The last time. I had to debate against the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) was when he was opposition education spokesperson and he was planning to assist Australian families by introducing a full fee regime for university students. Dr Kemp-That is a lie.,56
129,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr Jenkins)Order! The minister will resume his seat. The honourable member for Goldstein will withdraw. Dr Kemp-I withdraw that. It was a complete misrepresentation..,56
130,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Order! Without qualification. Mr Costello-Well, what about this 'Count' stuff? Are you going to let him go on with that?",56
131,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Order! The deputy leader will resume his seat. Mr Costello-No. I will make a point of order. You have asked for a withdrawal of something the member for Goldstein said. In the most childish abusive language, defying every parliamentary requirement, this speaker got up and talked about 'Count' something or other. Do you think in the interests of fairness you ought to ask him to withdraw as well?",56
132,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The deputy leader will resume his seat. The honourable member for Goldstein has. withdrawn. The minister will refer to members by their appropriate titles. Mr Costello-Withdraw.,56
133,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The deputy leader will resume his seat. Mr Costello-I would like you to rule on whether this is unparliamentary language.,57
134,Mr BALDWIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I am more than happy to withdraw any suggestion or inference that the member for Goldstein is some kind of flesh-eating creature.",57
135,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Order! The minister will continue with the matter of public importance.,57
136,Mr BALDWIN,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The subject of the matter of public importance is 'the damage and distress caused to Australian families by the government's mishandling of the economy'. Interestingly enough, the opposition saw fit to quote selectively from the set of economic statistics in the current edition of the Econoseven mist. I refer honourable members to the current edition, which is the edition for 12-18 November 1994. Page 126 contains a table of some of the most reputable economic forecasters in the world and their projections for 15 developed countries. It shows quite clearly that both for this calendar year and for the 1995 calendar year Australia is projected to have the strongest GDP growth of the 15 OECD countries surveyed. Of course, this growth is under the mismanagement of this government. At the same time, we have seen extraordinarily strong employment growth. There is no doubt, as the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) said today, that unemployment remains too high and that the bringing down of unemployment has to remain the central priority of this government. Since the government was re-elected in 1993, and since the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) announced that the government would not be leaving the unemployed behind, we have seen employment growth of around 1400,000. Contrary to the claim made by the member for Goldstein, the bulk of that growth was full-time employment. Just before I came down here I had a calculation done on that, and between July last year and September this year part-time work accounted for 32 per cent. In other words, the rest was a growth in full-time employment. Whichever way we slice it we are looking at a very strong situation in terms of employment. We now have eight million people in work in this country, which is the highest number on record. We are also seeing significant and important inroads into the number of long-term unemployed-that is, people whose duration of unemployment is longer than a year. That number is down 87,000 since February. During the recovery from the 1982-83 recession we saw a number of years of very strong employment growth, but the negative side was that it was not until towards the end of the 1980s that we started to see major inroads into the number of long-term unemployed. This time we are seeing a quite different pattern. In that previous recession, around per cent of the jobs were going to long term unemployed people and now the figure is around 22 per cent. That is no accident; it is the consequence of deliberate application of labour market programs targeted at those most disadvantaged in the labour market and designed to ensure that we do not have a group of people who are left behind and trapped in a situation of intergenerational unemploymel)t, long-term unemployment or permanent exclusion from the labour market. A very major part of the white paper measures is the job compact, the increased spending on labour market interventions and the redesign of the social security system to maximise incentives for people to participate in work. We have done all this with the objective of ensuring that the benefits of employment and economic growth were equitably distributed and that the long-term unemployed and the disadvantaged in the labour market would not be left behind. Today's matter of public importance refers to the government's management of the economy. Yes, we have had a severe recession-as have most of the countries in the developed world-which has produced a wide range of adverse effects. We have seen put in place a range of policies designed to maxipolicy mise the speed of recovery from that recesto sion and to ensure that the benefits of recovmade ery are distributed as widely as objective statistical evidence is that those policies are having a major beneficial effect. What would the opposition have done? The key point in all these debates is not to look at the situation we have but to really ask questions about what the impact of different policies would be. At the last election the opposition proposed a goods and services tax which, according to Access Economics, which the honourable member for Goldstein quoted today, would have had a depressive effect on the economy and would have ensured that output and employment would have been greater lower than they would otherwise have been. The very Access Economics those opposite choose to quote when it suits them reached the conclusion that their policies would have darkened significantly the prospects of the unemployed. That is the whole issue of employment. The government has put measures in place in recent times to assist families. We have gone through a very difficult transition period in the structure of this economy. We have, like most other developed countries, had recession. We have also seen, as is the case in most of the developed world, significant increases in inequalities in market incomes. That is true. Most serious analysts of that situation have pointed to a number of factors operating throughout the whole developed world econinadequacies omy, including the globalisation of the econgive omy, which is tending to mean that we are operating increasingly in a global market where those who are unskilled are increasingly finding themselves effectively competition with people in developing countfunded ries. We have seen the impact of technology, which means that the disparity between the market value of the work of people with skills and education and that of people without skills has increased. There is a range of factors at work there. . That is a serious issue and must be a serious concern. But the important question what has been the impact of government on that? Has government policy acted mitigate or diminish those effects or has it things worse? That is the issue we have possible. The to consider here today. I refer honourable members to an excellent article by Ross Gittins which appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald yesterday or the day before. He made it very clear that, while· increased disparity of market incomes has occurred, as it has in just about all other developed countries, changes in government policy, both in terms of the social security transfer payment system directed to those particularly on low incomes and the impact of changes in the tax system, have clearly acted to reduce that underlying trend towards inequalities in market incomes. That is very clearly shown in the table accompanying that article by Ross Gittins. He also refers to the work of Ann Harding, whom the opposition occasionally likes to selectively and misleadingly quote. There is no doubt that government policy has had a benign impact. But even Ross Gittins's analysis does not tell the whole story, because it does not contain the key social wage improvements that we have seen a implemented over the term of this government. It does not, for example, take account of the introduction of universal health insurance through Medicare. It does not take account of the massive increase in child-care provisions. The member for Goldstein criticised us for in child-care provisions. Let me the honourable member some figures on that. When his party was in office, there labour were-from memory-46,000 Commonwealth-funded child care places available. in There are now 240,000 Commonwealthchild care places. So there were 46,000 available under the opposition when it was in office and there are 240,000 available now, and the opposition has the hide to come in here and complain about the inadequacies in child-care provisions. That is an absolute joke. That huge increase in the number of subsidised child-care places is one is: key element of those improvements in the social wage which I referred to. There are a range of these measures. Over the course of this government, we have had an explicit trade-off between money wage increases and improvements in the social wage. Any sort of analysis that focuses solely on market incomes, wages and salaries or even analyses which take into account improvements in cash transfers through social security do not tell the whole story. Factoring all these elements in is not an easy thing to do because it is quite a difficult piece of analysis, but it has been attempted by some people. Peter Whiteford is a senior research fellow at the University of York who has just published a comparison between this country and the United Kingdom in terms of trends in inequality over the course of the 1980s. This is particularly important because the policies of the United Kingdom government in many ways mirror those advocated by the opposition, particularly in the areas of wholesale deregulation of the labour market. He has tried to do the sort of comprehensive analysis that we need if we want meaningful information in this sphere. It is not good enough to just concentrate on money incomes. His article appeared in the publication Policy and Politics Volume 24 No.4, 1994, under the heading 'Income Distribution and Social Policy under a Reformist Government-the Australian experience'. He said: In tenns of the criticisms of the Australian Government policy in the 1980s, the conclusion of this article is that rather than substantial increases in poverty, falls in living standards, and increases in inequality, living standards were higher and inequality slightly lower in 1990 than when Labor took office. If poverty is measured by reference to a constant real poverty line, then poverty had fallen substantially. He further contrasts the situation here with the United Kingdom, which has pursued policies with large elements similar to those advocated by the opposition. He said: Whatever the caveats that must be attached to these comparisons, it is difficult to accept that the of these governmentsthat is, Australia and the UKare similar. The UK figures suggest - dramatic widening in income inequality. The Australian figures suggest a slight narrowing in income inequality. He went on: Clearly, important trends have not been incorporated in the microsimulation, and the results are partial. Nevertheless, the analysis is significantly more comprehensive than that of the critics. He sums up the whole record of this government in a very good paragraph. He said: It seems fair to sum up the ALP's record as combining egalitarian social policies with economic policies attempting to enhance efficiency, within the framework of a consensual incomes policy. That is the record of this government. I will now say a few things about assistance to families. The opposition again accuses us of discriminating against single-earner families. It also accuses us of a sleight of hand with the introduction of the home child-care allowance. It is interesting that when legislation goes into the Senate, the opposition, which is constantly saying that we have to tighten up on fiscal policy and contain the cost of things, time and again imposes amendments that force the cost of it up. The opposition says that we have to make sure that we provide recognition of the child-care responsibilities of people whose youngest child is 24. This is the sort of absurdity that the opposition goes on with. The fact is that the home child-care allowance directs the assistance directly to the carer. It is not a sleight of hand; it costs $230 million more than the old with-child dependent spouse rebate, which it replaces. It is a clear and unambiguous improvement which produces major gains for some families, particularly those with a carer who, throughout the course of a financial year, enters and exits the work force. Some of those people are up to $800 a year better off as a result of the home child-care allowance in comparison with the with-child dependent spouse rebate. As I indicated in question time the other day, the increase in assistance, such as the additional family payment, which has increased by 100 per cent in the case of chilrecords dren in the 13to IS-year age group under this government, has been massive. The great bulk of that assistance-around about 80 per cent because it is targeted at lower income families-goes to families with a single earner. Most families with two earners have incomes which are too high to get the full benefit of AFP. So it is highly targeted and very much focused on low income families. Asa result, most of that goes to single income families, and most of that goes to families where the youngest child is between the ages of zero and five. Since the government has been in office, the improvements in rent assistance, pensions and family assistance have been dramatic. (TIme expired)",57
137,Mr LLOYD,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This matter of public importance is about the damage and distress caused to Australian families by the government's mishandling of the economy, and was ably moved by the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp). The evidence of the impact of the government's mishandling of· the economy on families is apparent, it is depressing, and for the governdefinitions-they ment it· should be both embarrassing and humiliating. I remind honourable members of the facts. In June 1994, an estimated 24 per cent of all families had no family members employed. There were 102,700 couple families with dependants where the husband was unemployed and the wife was either unemployed or not in the labour force. In 53 per cent of these families the husband had been unemployed for 52 weeks or more. Neither parent was employed in 10 per cent of couple families with dependants. There were 1,152,300 dependants in families where no member of the family was employed and there were 808,700 dependants in families where the parent or parents were not employed. Still more depressing is that there were even fewer full-time jobs in October 1994 than in January 1991; a typical award wage buys 12 per cent less than it did in 1985; and World Bank figures suggest that Australia has one of the most unequal distributions of income in the Western world-I think only Great Britain is worse. Ann Harding, whom both sides quote, said that the top 10 per cent of Australians now get 26.5 per cent of household income while the bottom 10 per cent get just 1.5 per cent. If you want to go on from that, the top 20 per cent get 42.1 per cent and the bottom 20 per cent only 5.4 per cent. Three groups face both the highest poverty risks and make up the largest groups of poor in Australia-sole parents, younger single adults below retirement age and couples with children. That is particularly so in rural and regional Australia. One more depressing fact which shows how Labor's economic policies have been to the disadvantage of families in this country in its 11 years in power is that for the top 10 per cent of income earners in this country real incomes have risen by seven per'cent since 1983 and the incomes of the bottom 10 per cent have fallen by five percent. Just think of those facts and what that has meant for families in this country. It is getting worse. As the honourable member for Goldstein and others have pointed out, it is getting worse. Look at the government's own are very generous-of who is employed in this country. One acknowledges that the higher the number employed or the lower the unemployment level there is a reduction in extreme poverty, but there is not necessarily a reduction in the gap between the rich and the poor, depending upon income distribution. Even taking the government's own glowing descriptions of how the economy is going, real employment cannot increase much more. For example, even for October-the figures came in just a week ago-on a seasonally adjusted basis, actual employment in this country fell, particularly for full-time employment. In spite of our supposedly leading the OECD countries, as the minister said at question time, our unemployment level is far higher than that of the United States, Japan or New Zealand, with all that means for those families that are facing this terrible spectre of unemployment and lower real incomes. Each time there is a boom-bust cycle with this government, the percentage of people unemployed gets higher and the percentage of the long-term unemployed-that is, those unemployed for more than 52 weeks-gets greater, with all of that impact on families. An increasing percentage in part-time employment is included in those employment figures. Since 1983, full-time employment is up 14 per cent while part-time employment is up 70 per cent. That makes a mockery of the minister's statements about the jobs that have been created for families and other workers in this country in the time that Labor has been in power. Thirty per cent of the eight million people in employment in this country are now part-time workers. I acknowledge that some of them want to work part time, but the majority want full-time work because it means real money and real income. That is one reason why we have a terrible income distribution gap in this country. As the honourable member for Goldstein said, that employment figure includes thousands of people on trainee wages, which would reduce the unemployment figure. I have heard those training schemes defined as the government trying to make a high level of unemployment more palatable to the electorate at election time. It is apparent that the lower the unemploygreatest ment level the lower the extreme poverty. But, even if we get some fealincrease in real employment in this country, as we are seeing at present, it is not improving that income gap. Many families are trapped at the lower end of the income scale. Part of that is due the government's own policies of a rigid labour market and no incentives for productive investment to create real jobs in this country. A few minutes ago, the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) said, 'That's fine, but you have forgotten all about cash transfers and the social wage.' Somehow or other that magically changes the situation. All one can say about cash transfers and the social wage is that they have slowed down that widening of the income gap between rich and poor families. But they certainly have not stopped it. The government says, 'Well, we've reduced tax for those on a lower income.' People on a lower income logically say that the tax for those on a higher income has been reduced even more. The government says, 'We increased the tax threshold from $4,750 to $5,400.' Compare the inflation rate over 10 years with that increase in the tax threshold. That is another depressing factor gf>verning economic policies which is creating poverty for more and more low income families in this country. This is particularly so in rural and regional Australia, which suffers from all of the problems that have been mentioned so far. But, generally to a greater degree, unemployment is higher. There is a greater percentage of aged people, and many of them do not get any age pension because of the government's policies. There is also a higher percentage of self-employed people. Because more export oriented industries are facing international competition, their net incomes are lower. In question time, the Deputy Leader of the National Party (Mr Anderson) referred to the Parliamentary Library's 57 comparisons of the 1991 census characteristics on Australia's 147 electoral divisions. It has sometimes been called the Heinz study. The proportion of families with an income under $16,000 is in the rural and regional electorates. Starting from the bottom, the lowest income electorate in Australia is Wide Bay. There is then Cowper, Lyne, Fisher, Barker, Gwydir, Grey, Richmond, Wakefield, Page, Gilmore, Parkes, Fairfax,· Maranoa and, finally, Port to Adelaide. Only five out of the bottom 20 electorates with the lowest incomes in Australia are in metropolitan Australia. The. top starts with the highest incomes. One has to get down to No. 35, Kalgoorlie, before a regional electorate is picked up. Contrary to the government's boast, its social wage and cash transfers are actually disappearing ill rural and regional Australia. Look at the assets test and what that has done for all the non-incorporated businesses in town and on farms with regard to their not being able to obtain any age pension benefit, unemployed benefit or Austudy. The new child-care allowance impacts dramatically on rural and regional Australia. Look at the boast of the government about free education as part of its social wage while fewer and fewer country people are able to afford any education for their children. Look at the percentage in tertiary education. The government's drought policy in 1992 was supposedly its great policy. Two years later, there are still no qualifiers. It has had to tinker with the criteria to get any qualifiers. For the first time in modern Australia there is no safety net for all Australians. What does that mean for rural and regional families? Those rural and regional families are not covered. One can go on about taxation costs, fuel increases and even a possible tax on kit homes, which are important for country people. There is a downward spiral with regard to families and their well-being in this country. What a farce it is for this government, at the end of the International Year of the Family, to be facing this very sorry and humiliating situation which is terrible for the families involved. (Time expired)",60
138,Mr MARTYN EVANS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"If we are to examine this matter of public importance in a real way, we have to take it in the context of the reality of the economy as we now find it. I think any sensible and sustained analysis of that economy will show that it is one enjoying substantial levels of growth. Indeed, they are levels of growth which are unparalleled in the DECO. The reality of this debate as we find it today is that economists are estimating that this economy will enjoy the strongest growth not only in this financial year but also in the financial year to come. That is the real situation in which we now find ourselves. But it is not only in a strong growth context; it is also in a low inflation context. We have a low inflation rate, which this government is committed to maintaining. It has seen a very different economic mix to the one which we may have had in the past. It is one which has given us a strong and rising employment base, a faIling level of unemployment and a strong level of investment in the context of having one of the lowest levels of taxation in the DECO. Let us examine the proposition before us in the context of an economy which is enjoying those benefits. It obviously brings with it problems that have to be managed. I certainly agree that the government has to be committed to bringing down the level of unemployment much further than it already has. It is certainly our most serious issue and a difficult one to address, but one which I believe this government has done very well to face. Look at those levels of growth in the low inflation context and the rising level of employment that we have seen. For example, over the last 12 months or so, there has been an increase of 400,000 positions. In that same time, unemployment has fallen since September 1993 to just over 800,000 in October 1994, which is the lowest level since May 1991. If we are going to examine this issue of income distribution and the proposition that there are growing inequalities in the way that income is distributed in this country, we have to do so in a much more serious context. We need to be a little more academic about the proposition. I certainly agree with the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) that the article by Ross Gittins in last Saturday'S Sydney Morning Herald must be studied very carefully by all honourable members, particularly the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) if he is to bring into this House propositions such as this one today. A more serious and academic study of the proposition of inequality in income distribution leads us to a different conclusion from that which the opposition would have us draw. While it is certainly true that on a base level of simply looking at income distribution there has been an increase in the level of inequality, we have to look behind that and find out just what the underlying factors and reasons are for those changes in the last 10 years. We also have to look at the way in which that has impacted on individual Australian families and at the way in which the make-up of Australian families has changed over that period. Quite clearly, the changes which must be made to the basic market income figure, as Gittins points out, are very different. While there may have been some increase in inequality at that level, we must modify figures; we must adjust those figures to reflect the reality of Australian society and the Australian economic position. Finally, when we analyse those figures in the complex way in which this article doesand I will not attempt to repeat them in the few minutes available to me in this Housewe find that the adjusted equivalent disposable income has changed far less than the base figures would have us accept. It has done so for some very important reasons which are underlying the changes in employment which have occurred across the OECD and the Western world in the last 10 years. We have seen the impact of technology reward increased skill levels. We have seen the formation of knowledge based industries. We have seen a dramatic increase in service industries in OECD economies. Those changes have led to greater and greater rewardsdisproportionate rewards in the case of this analysis-for those with higher levels of skill. I would have thought that all honourable members would agree that the level of skill should be rewarded in the marketplace. That is an appropriate thing to occur. But it has some elements of the work force behind in the way in which that income has been distributed. That change has been brought about by changes in the market forces. This government acknowledges the need to accept the discipline of the marketplace. As we speak in the House today, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is in Indonesia at the APEC meeting of leaders, ensuring as he has in recent years that we become more a part of a global economy. It is this government which has presided over the deregulation of many overregulated parts of the Australian economy. It is this government which has taken us into the world, particularly the Asian economic zone. It is this government which will lead that charge in South-East Asia and in the APEC region as a whole to ensure that free trade is the order of the day in the century to come. That will continue the process of opening up Australia's economy. In that process, we have to accept that there will be consequences of that market imposing its discipline on the Australian work force, as it has done to shift the emphasis in favour of those knowledge and skill based industries and those workers who are part of that knowledge and skill base. It is this government which has recognised that problem. It is this government which has said, 'If those are the fundamental changes which are occurring in the economy, then we must respond to them and recognise the importance of them and their impact on Australian families.' That is the reality debate. We have accepted the discipline of market forces in the world economy. We have seen that change Australian society. This government has responded to those changes in a very practical, immediate and meaningful way for the benefit of Australian families. That is a very important distinction between the actions of this government and those of the opposition. We have recognised those changes and we have responded to them in some very positive ways. I would like to canvass some of those ways. The reality is that the Working Nation statement is a $10 billion commitment to human resources in this country which will ensure left that we see a very significant trend towards improving the knowledge and skill base of Australian workers and which will ensure that training becomes part of the fundamental culture of this country and the economy and that business accepts its liability to train and improve the knowledge base of its work force. Those are very important responses to the underlying changes we have seen in the OECD and Western countries. That is an investment which this government is prepared to make on behalf of the Australian people, yet it is an investment which the opposition has rejected. Its lack of support for Working Nation is very evident in this place and throughout the country. That is a fundamental condemnation of its attitude in this place. The opposition fails to recognise the importance of those underlying structural changes and the need for government to respond to them. It is one thing to accept the discipline of the market, but it is another thing to overlay that with important social programs and policies, like the social wage which the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) dismisses so lightly, like Medicare which honourable members opposite would have tom apart over the last few decades if they had been given that opportunity and like the improvements in education, superannuation, child care, student allowances and all those very fundamental changes which this government has presided over in response to the underlying changes in our markets. We cannot ignore those changes. That of this would be fatal. That would be the worse aspect of National Party agrarian socialism which we saw in the 1940s and 1950s and which left the economy of Australia in such a parlous state in order to address these changes in the 1970s. We have moved beyond that. We have accepted the need for the market to determine in many ways the direction of our economy in a world context and in an Asia-Pacific context. We have devised and implemented the very massive at times social changes to our legislative and training infrastructure which are necessary to address that problem. While the Gittins article is very important, as the Minister for Social Security indicated, it does not address all of the issues in this area. The changes to the social wage, which includes Medicare, a very important part of our health care process, are not included. If we look at the impact on families after taking into account the social wage changes such as health, rental subsidies for low income families, family allowance and child-care payments, the provision of child care, the broadening of the base of superannuation, the importance of allowances in education and student training, and the investment which we have made in tertiary education, we see that those are the very important changes which this government has made in response to that underlying change in the economy. They are far more important than any other analysis which we could do. The importance of that social component, the importance of the social wage, cannot be understated. If it were a matter for the tion, we would have had the changes in the marketplace without the very important and vital changes to the social programs which this government has brought about and implemented.",62
139,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Jenkins)Order! The discussion is concluded. NA Message from the Governor General reported informing the House of assent to the following bill: Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.4) 1994 NA AMENDMENT BILL (No.2) 1994 First Reading Bill received from the Senate, and read a first time. Explanatory memorandum presented by Ms Crawford; ordered that the second reading be made an order of the day for the next sitting. NA Public Works Committee Reports",64
140,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,"On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the 11th and 12th reports of the committee for 1994 relating to the development of the 2nd Field Hospital at Enoggera, Queensland, and the housing development, Bligh Park, New South Wales. Ordered that the reports be printed.",64
141,Mr HOLLIS,COMMITTEES,"by leave-The first report which I have tabled involves the recommendation for the development of the 2nd Field Hospital at Enoggera, Queensland, at an estimated cost of $29.2 million. This hospital will replace present inadequate facilities at the 1st Military Hospital at Yeronga, the 2nd Field Hospital at Kelvin Grove and the Enoggera Medical Centre. When inspecting the current facilities the committee was impressed by the dedication of the staff at Yeronga and Kelvin Grove. These personnel are presently working in old timber, opposimetal and asbestos-clad buildings which provide inadequate working conditions and lead to operational inefficiencies. A need therefore exists to replace these substandard facilities with a modem hospital capable of providing medical and dental services for personnel of ·the Australian defence forces. This will be achieved by building a modem purpose-built hospital at Enoggera. The new facilities will include accommodation for an operational army hospital with a 50-bed capacity. The proposal will also include the provision of logistic, administrative, training and live-in accommodation. The proposed hospital will be in close proximity to the units which it will support, as well as being in a location convenient for visiting civilian medical specialists. The second report which I have tabled recommends construction of a housing development at Bligh Park, New South Wales, for defence personnel at an estimated cost of $8.5 million. Some 450 service families are presently living in sub-standard accommodation in the Richmond-Windsor area-the majority being at Hobartville. The Defence Housing Authority proposes to provide suitable accommodation for some of these families by acquiring between 50 and 65 housing lots in a new stage of a residential subdivision-precinct 29 at Bligh Park, New South Wales. The Bligh Park estate will eventually comprise about 2,225 dwellings. The Defence Housing Authority currently has 92 properties on the estate for service families. The Defence Housing Authority intends to acquire these additional residential allot- development. ments and construct houses on them in a planned extension to the estate. The site is well located for housing for service families because of its proximity to RAAF Base Richmond and existing and proposed schools, shopping and recreational facilities which have been established over past 10 years. The proposal will provide defence personnel and their families with good quality housing and services consistent with community standards. I commend the reports to the House.",64
142,Ms DEAHM,COMMITTEES,"by leave-I would like to make a short comment on the second report which deals with the defence housing at Bligh Park, which is in my electorate. I support the Joint Committee of Public Works in approving the housing at Bligh Park, which is an extensive housing. estate in the south Windsor area. I would like, however, to make a comment about the substandard housing at Hobartville, which the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) mentioned. It is older housing, which is of the style of the former state department of housing type. The Defence Housing Autholity had planned to spend some money on minor repairs, painting, landscaping and so on and then to sell these properties. However, the local government authority, the Hawkesbury City Council, in conjunction with a local developer and, I understand, a bank, is keen to redevelop this area because of its close proximity to the township of Richmond. This would be in line with the government's better cities program and also with the urban design task force of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). Currently negotiations are under way between the parties concerned. I put· on record my gratitude to the Defence Housing Authority for its patience and forbearance in that time. It is proposed that the houses should be demolished and that more medium density housing of a good design be erected, with narrower carriageways and appropriate landscaping. The Defence Housing Authority has said that it would be willing, subject to approval of the design and approval of the defence personnel in the area, to take approximately 30 per cent of these houses in the new The issue at the moment obviously concerns the Defence Housing Authority'S need to make a commercial arrangement and for the joint venturers to be able to raise the holding funds in order to facilitate this development. the I hope that this proposal can take place and I thank the Defence Housing Authority for its cooperation to date.

144,Mr JENKINS,ATION TO FRANCE AND THE EUROPEAN,"I thank the House. Standing order 101 sets out that the discussion of committee and delegation reports should be concluded no later than 1.15 p.m. This allows 45 minutes for discussion of committee and delegation reports. In considering the program of business for Monday,S December, the Selection Committee was presented with requests from three delegations and four standing committees to present their reports. This is indicative of a log jam in getting these reports down before facili- the end of the year-5 December being the sector last sitting Monday of the year. The time sought for presenting these reports varied between 10 minutes in three cases and the full 45 minutes for two committees. Whilst some of these requests may have been of the nature of an ambit claim, the Selection Committee considered that the problem it was presented with was rather serious. As a compromise, the committee allowed each of the delegation committees to table its report and allowed five minutes for a tabling statement. It assumes that, at the end of that five minutes, the committees will ask that a motion be moved 'that the House take note of the paper'. The Selection Committee has asked me to suggest to the House that, given the short amount of time that we have been able to give to these seven reports, perhaps those who decide the business for the Main Committee might have a look at placing those seven reports on the Notice Paper for the Main Committee; that might allow those members from the various delegations and committees a chance to make their contributions on the tabling of those reports. As I said, this is perhaps just an indication that, as we get towards the end of the year, we have some difficulty in allocating the time. Also it is an indication that the 45 minutes set down for delegation and committee reports does not give the Selection Committee much flexibility. I believe that, the way the Main Committee has been working, with the assistance of the Chief Government Whip and his colleagues on the other side of the chamber, perhaps some time might be found that will allow further discussion of the reports being submitted by the parliamentary delegations and committees.",67
145,Mr LEO MCLEAY,ATION TO FRANCE AND THE EUROPEAN,"by leaveMr Deputy Speaker, with your indulgence I might say a couple of words on what the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) has just said. The government would be quite happy to pick up that proposal and maybe run the Main Committee for a few extra hours in the week that we come back-maybe even on the Tuesday, if that suits the arrangements that the clerks can organise for us. There is a fair amount of legislation that we want to send to the Main Committee in a few moments. One of the things we want to ensure is that we do not have too many late night sittings like that which we are having tonight. We hope this might be the only one we have in the next few weeks. We also want to ensure that we do not end up having to sit much later or have a guillotine. It is our intention to try to facilitate what the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) has proposed; that is, run the Main Committee a bit longer in the week that we come back. The only thing that might hold us up a bit is the staffing arrangements of the Department of the House of Representatives. If that course is possible, we are happy to facilitate it. Also, the family law committee will introduce its report in the week we come back. Committee members raised with me the idea of having only the chairman and deputy chairman speak to the report here; then we might refer the report to the Main Committee so there can be some discussion on it. I think that will be timely. A lot of work has been done on that report by members of the committee. I am looking to find a way to facilitate that discussion as well. NA Delegation to Hong Kong and the People's Republic of China",68
146,Mr HICKS,DELEGATION REPORTS,"by leave-I present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to Hong. Kong and the People's Republic of China of 4 to 17 July 1994. It was a privilege and great learning experience to be the deputy leader of the Australian parliamentary delegation that visited Hong Kong and the People's Republic of China between 4 and 17 July this year. This report was presented to the Senate on 10 November by Senator Nick Sherry, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. I would like to congratulate him on his leadership of what I believe was a very successful delegation. I will not name delegation members because they are listed in the report which I am sure most honourable members will read with interest. It is enough to say that all delegates and their partners formed a close-knit and united Australian group. However, special mention should be made of the secretary to the delegation, Ms Andrea Griffiths, from the Department of the Senate. Ms Griffiths did a sterling job for the delegation, and her efforts went a long way toward making the visit of the delegation the success it was. Many Australians visit Hong Kong for holidays, but I would be surprised if most were aware of its present importance as the great contact point between the rest of the world and the People's Republic of China. It appeared to me that most of the expatriate business people I spoke to utilised contact people within the Hong Kong business community to make contact with business leaders within the People's Republic. There are a large number of Australian citizens living in Hong Kong, including business people, lawyers, accountants, doctors, hoteliers, lecturers-to name a few of the professions represented-and all of those are no doubt a sample of the wider group of Australian expatriates. A visit to the Hong Kong Legislative Council was very important, and I am sure most of the delegation would agree with the importance of maintaining links between the Australian parliament and the Hong Kong legislature, especially as we move toward 1 July 1997. Informal discussions with the legislative members were most informative. The Hong Kong authorities were very open with us when we visited one of the refugee detention centres that house Vietnam refugees. A humane repatriation program has been put in place that has seen 24,000 refugees return to Vietnam in the last four years alone. Many quotable quotes have been engaged in by a myriad of writers when they write of China, but one that fits what I am about to say I happened to hear a few days ago. The commentator said that China was like a huge economic locomotive that would, in a short period, pull the carriages of the rest of the world's economies along behind it. I can believe this. Having previously visited China in 1985, I was absolutely astounded by the development that has taken place since that time. Places like Beijing, Shanghai, Xian and Guangzhou seem to be exploding with buildings and civil construction works, including roads, bridges and railway networks. There appears to be an aura of development, certainly in the major centres that we visited, and hopefully this soon permeate into some f)f the poorer, less developed regions. With a possible market of 1.2 billion people, the opportunities seem boundless. One example we witnessed which I would say is representative of the situation concerns one of the members of this chamber, the member for Isaacs (Mr Atkinson). Several years ago the member for Isaacs introduced his company to Guangzhou and joined a Chinese partner. It was the intention of that company, the G.C. Lightburn Electrical Appliance Company, to build a simple washing machine for the Chinese market. A shed was erected for the production plant, and local Chinese, seeing the shed, asked the company to build one for them. For the past few years, the company and its Chinese partne-s have been busy building sheds, mcludmg some large projects. When the delegation visited the production site, no washing machines had been produced. Upon seeing that the company had a lathe and grinding equipment, another Chinese person asked whether the company could turn up about 500 motor bike crankshafts. The company obliged. A few months later the same person asked whether the company could provide another 5,000 cranksh,afts. The company agreed, although it was putting a strain on the limited equipment that was installed. A few months later, the same gentleman asked whether the company could provide two million crankshafts. This has resulted in another Chinese-Australian business commencing in Guangzhou. The leader of the delegation, Senator Nick Sherry, has commented on a number of items which I do not wish to repeat. There is one matter I would like to raise, and that is the smuggling of priceless Chinese artefacts from the country-a practice that is widespread. When the Kuomintang left the mainland they ca-ied with them many artefacts, ma-y of which are carefully housed in Taiwan. Unfortunately, during the Cultural Revolution, many other treasures of China were destroyed. Now we have a situation where large sums of money are changing hands with the smugglin- of artefacts, many of them apparently obtamed by grave robbers from ancient will Chinese tombs. The practice is hard to stop, and I saw at first-hand the problem that exists. These historical, priceless treasures are not only part of China's rich cultural history !'ut also part of o-r total human heritage. It is Important that thIS not be lost to the scholars of the world or to those who simply appreciate human genius. Finally, I would like to pay tribute to the calibre of Australia's diplomatic corps both in Hong Kong and in China, a number of whose members are named in the report. Many of these are gifted linguists and students of Chinese history. From speaking to high ranking ChineSe officials, we learned of the high regard the Chinese people have for our diplomatic representatives. I am sure I would be speaking on behalf of all in this House when I thank them for the service they. are performing for their country in strengthening Chinese-Australian relationships. . NA NA",68
147,Mr LEO MCLEAY,COMMITTEE,"I ask leave of the House to amend notice No.1, government business, relating to the referral of matters to the Main Committee, by adding the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2) 1994.

ANL GUARANTEE BILL 1994 Second Reading Debate resumed.",69
148,Mr VAILE,COMMITTEE,"An interesting debate has taken place in the chamber today with regard to this Labor government's wasting taxpayers' money in propping up the ANL and certainly in trying to prop up the reputation of the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton). The ANL Guarantee Bill 1994 enables the Treasurer to guarantee certain debts of ANL Ltd. ANL was established as a company under the ANL Act 1956. Section 70B of the Audit Act 1901 states: ... a guarantee of the due payment of the whole or a part: (a) of the repayments of principal moneys required to be paid under the terms of an agreement for the loan of moneys; or (b) of any interest required to terms of such a loan; shall not be given by or on behalf of the Commonwealth unless a provision of an Act ... expressly authorises: (c) the giving of the guaranteeThe provisions of this bill authorise the Treasurer to guarantee payments under a loan agreement in order to help ANL to continue to trade in an orderly fashion or restructure its business interests. Would there not be thousands of businesses right across Australia today that would appreciate this sort of assistance from the government after already dropping about $180 million into that black hole called the ANL? We have seen the government hurtling down the privatisation path and the assets sale path in a lot of areas in recent years using the excuse that it is not core government business, it should not be involved in these activities, therefore, it is selling them. It is selling what it says are Commonwealth assets, but they are really the assets of the Australian taxpayers. But this is not so with ANL. At one stage the Minister for Transport was saying that we could not give ANL away; it was not worth tuppence. And here he is pouring millions of taxpayers' dollars into the coffers of ANL. Why? Because once again the unions in Australia-the ACTU and the Maritime Union of Australia-have ganged up on the minister, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the government of this nation and told them what they are to do. The unions have given them their riding instructions on how they will run this nation and how they will spend the taxpayers' dollars in this nation of Australia. We have before us today a bill to provide for the guarantee of loans made in relation to ANL Ltd. In what has become one of the great jokes of this parliament, the guess who is at it again minister, the monkey on the organ-grinder minister, the hello sailor minister for transport, has continued his true tradition as far as negotiating a deal goes. He has somehow been allowed by his uniun mates to sell ANL to itself. I do not like stealing headlines, but this bill proves only one thing and that is that the danger man is be paid under the truly ANL retentive. I smell a new carcass swinging in the breeze, yet this is a different carcass compared with the more environmentally friendly carcass of the former minister for sports rorts. This carcass has a distinctly fishy smell. This carcass has been to the bottom of the harbour and back, or has it been swimming with our national seamen for too long? To emp,hasise my point about how much this miriister likes seamen, I ask members to recall, the pilots strike of 1989 and compare it to the recent strikes within the Maritime Union of Australia. The difference in the way this gove-ent treated both strikes is clear evidence of where the Labor Party's money is coming from and where the support for this Labor. government is coming from. The 1989 pilots strike was met with brutal retaliation by the Hawke government, which brought in pilots from overseas and used the air force as strikebreakers. The justification for this, and it is still very relevant today, was that the pilots were trying to hold the country to ransom with their-wait for it-wage demands which threatened to trigger a national wage breakout and destroy the accord. What about the Seamen's Union? It 'shut down our nation's shipping ... It shut down our nation's ports. It did irreparable damage to our already shaky international reputation and imposed a cost. of millions of dollars on Australian busUiesses and households. Surely, in anyone's language,it also held the country to ransom. So one c()uld, therefore, expect similar treatment to that handed out to the pilots. in 1989. But, no. What this government and this minister were able to do within 48 hours was to give life to any future delays in parliamentary legislation. Within 48 hours this minister had announced. an extremely generous package of subsidies and tax concessions to look after the strikers' jobs and their wages. It certainly does not take, much brain power to work out for whom the Maritime Union of Australia will be door-knocking during the next election campaign. It will be exactly the same people it did it for during the last election campaign. Unfortunately, that is the whole point of this deal that the Minister for Transport has broken, regardless of the enormous burden it places on .the taxpayers of Australia. Like many other members in this place, in my electorate over the last couple of-ears I have had any number of representations, but three come to mind. Companies in my electorate, because of the economic circumstances, have fallen foul of the Australian Tax Office because of their lateness of payment of group tax or their non-remittance of group tax. They would have loved the federal government to step in and say, 'We'll save your employees' jobs. We'll save your organisation. We will waive the group tax'-exactly what has been done with ANL. But, no, the full weight of. the Commonwealth, through the Australian Taxation Office, was thrown at those companies. They were ,put through the courts, criminal charges were laid, the companies were bankrupted and the jobs of those people in those organisations were lost. But not for the ANL. Why? Because the Maritime Union of Australia has kicked the,can for the Labor Party for years. It provided them with campaign funds. It goes door-knocking for the Labor Party when it comes time to campaign. So what does the ministe- do? He was going to sell this outfit. He was going to get rtd of it to the highest bidder. It was not worth two bob. But all of a sudden the Maritime Union of Australia and the ACTU came knocking at the door saying, ' Mr Minister, you will do as you are told; otherwise we will not ,be there to help you in the next federal election campaign the way we did at the last one when we bankrolled the Labor Party.' Remember the words of Jennie George that will go down in the history in this nation. She told the people of Australia, 'You have to remember that "",the union movement bankrolled and got this Labor government back into power and now it is time for it to repay the debt.' This is the Labor government repaying the debt to the unions. The handle that has been put on the Minister for Transport is Mr Danger Man. He is Mr Danger Man all right. Let us look at the second part of Mr Danger Man's deal-the guaranteeing by the Treasurer of the debts of ANL Ltd. Members should think about this. It isa big decision to put your name down as a guarantor on any item for any person. It is not something that is done lightly and done every day. Yet what this ANL deal is saying is that you and I, our children and our children's children will act as guarantors for debts of this shipping line, which to date has shown itself to be unprofitable. What this bill is saying is that we in Australia will pay not only the principal debt but also the interest on the net current debt of $180 million. Interest payments start as soon as this bill gets royal asset. Unless the Prime Minister has been able to strike a low interest repayment similar to his pork barrel pig farm, the Australian public can be looking to pay back around $18 million per year-that is $18 million just taken away from the Commonwealth coffers, out of revenue. We have not heard anybody ask the government: who is funding this? Was this in the budget? Is this off-line? Where is the revenue coming from to pay for this $18 million? This bill will not solve the problem in the slightest. Ultimately, this outfit is going to have to sold because it is going to be a continual drain on the taxpayers of Australia. Let us not forget that this is Australia's national shipping line. These are already the taxpayers' ships. So for the government to argue that the extent of the current liability of $180 million is secured against assets of the company is almost ludicrous. Let us get one thing straight. ANL is a public company with one shareholder-the Commonwealth of Australia. To use public owned assets to try to write off a public owned debt is surely not doing anything. So for the minister to try to argue that the $180 million current net debt is significantly reduced as existing liabilities are secured against assets of the company is a joke. The final line of the financial impact statement on this bill sums up the foolhardy approach this minister has taken on this matter. It states: The successful restructuring of ANL will further reduce exposure. I gather then that the government has put Australian taxpayers into debt up to our armpits in the belief that what it has recently done to ANL is a successful restructure. This is a joke. It is joke legislation. It is joke restructuring. As for Mr Danger Man-well, he is the biggest joke of all! Mr Deputy Speaker, you mayor may not be aware that the Joint Committee of Public Accounts over the past 12 months has been conducting an inquiry into the appropriateness, effectiveness and efficiency of the commercialisation of government business enterprises. It just so happens that one of the government business enterprises that was the subject of that inquiry was ANL. The Public Accounts Committee has not yet reported to the parliament on this inquiry into commercialisation. As a member of that committee, I had the opportunity to sit in on a public hearing in Sydney when all the high rollers from ANL were giving evidence. The Managing Director, Mr MCGuiness, the General Manager Group Finance and Administration, Mr Corney, and the corporate business manager from ANL all gave evidence on that day. I refer to some of the evidence that was rebe ceived at that very interesting meeting of the Public Accounts Committee. Mr MCGuiness said in his opening statement: Thank you very much. Mr Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, I am here today to give evidence about ANL Limited, Australia's major international container shipping line. ANL is a public company with one shareholder: the Commonwealth of Australia. ANL was corporatised in 1989 and has operated for all of its history in highly competitive, domestic and international markets, without subsidies or other assistance on a purely commercial basis. I am therefore happy to talk to the committee about the commercialisation of public sector operations from an ANL perspective. The important point to note is that Mr MCGuiness said that ANL is operated purely on a commercial basis with no subsidies, yet the government has been weighing in millions of dollars to prop it up. Later in evidence Mr MCGuiness was asked a question by the chairman: CHAIRMAN-Are you subject to the accountability and ministerial oversight arrangements for Commonwealth GBEs? Mr Corney-No, I do not believe so. CHAIRMAN. I got the nod from the Department of Finance then. What mechanism do you have, as far as your accountability back to the government is concerned-to your shareholder as the Commonwealth? Mr MCGuiness-Our accountability, primarily, is to the Companies Act. ANL has the same responsibility that other directors of public companies have and that is to operate the business with propriety, as far as the shareholders are concerned, to protect the interests of the shareholders. We have to bear in mind that the only shareholder in ANL is the Commonwealth of Australia or the taxpayers of Australia. What propriety has been shown in the protection of the interests of the taxpayers of Australia? Mr MCGuiness went on to say: We operate totally under the Companies Act and all of the requirements of the public companies sections of the Companies Act in terms of reporting, style of reporting, nature of reporting, ness of reporting. In addition to that, the er does require that we provide, on an annual basis, a strategic plan which sets out budgets and forecasts. I think that the shareholder also exercises some control via other agencies that we are forced to work through, such as the Loan Council et cetera. But primarily the shareholder being the government is predominantly invisible in terms of our operations. I inform the House that at that public hearing on that particular day the- ·shareholder-the government and its representative, the Minister for Transport-were not too invisible. At the public hearing of the Public Accounts Committee one of the minister's advisers was sitting immediately behind Mr MCGuiness telling him what he could and could not answer and how he should answer. That was an absolute farce. This hearing was conducted in the middle of the due diligence report being prepared on ANL. It was a very sensitive time-and a very sensitive time for whom? For the Minister for Transport. The minister had one of his goons sitting right behind the General Manager of ANL instructing the General Manager how to answer the questions, and what questions to answer and what questions not to answer. That shows how invisible the minister was at that stage and how responsible he is. As for the reform of ANL Ltd, I will be interested to see how the company operates. I understand that before the minister's so called reforms were introduced ANL lost $8.3 million in the previous year. Mr MCGuinness, the General Manager of ANL, argued that the strategic direction being taken at that stage would mean that this year will be Il}llch the same, if not a little worse. And the minister wants the taxpayers of Australia to pour more money in. I wonder what the minister can really do. Despite perceptions, I understand ANL Ltd has the largest market share of any shipping operator between Australia and Japan, Australia and Korea, Australia and Taiwan, Australia and Singapore, Australia and Malaysia and Australia and Indonesia. I understand that, due to restructuring over recent years, crew sizes have come down from 33 to 21. There have already been massive productivity timeli- improvements on ships. As well, Jamison shareholdEquities, who now owns Australian Stevedores, has rationalised from nearly 9,000 to 3,800 employees in the last few years. Considering all these improvements and considering the fact that the company is still losing around $8.5 million a year, one wonders what the minister can do. It is no wonder that at the recent Australian Stevedores shareholders conference at the MLC Centre in Sydney on 9 September that the assembled group were laughing at the irony of the situation. After all, the minister had said what a financial wreck ANL was and how it could not be given away. It is now ANL itself that is lending Jamison Equity the money to complete a deal to sell part of itself so the government can be off the board before the Maritime Union of Australia discovers what the minister has done. No amount of spin-doctoring will let the government get away from the fact that it authorised ANtto provide $22.4 million as a loan. Between 9 September and 9 November, ANL had neither the shares in Australian Stevedores nor the $22.4 million. It had simply lent the money to Jamison Equity. I refer to an article by Laura Tingle headed 'Shareholders have a good laugh' in the Australian of 9 November: At least some of those present at the meeting recall a loan document being drawn up, and being signed on ANL's behalf by Malcolm Turnbull. Howard Smith by comparison, remained represented on the board of Australian Stevedores until settlement last Friday. At market rates of around 10 per cent, the cost of that sort of money in most situations for 60 days would be just under $400,000. The handling of Australian Stevedores was one handled in haste for political reasons, with few signs of due process and probably at a cost to both ANL and taxpayers. It was inconsistent with the minister's previous statements about his plans for ANL with the advice the Government had been given on the matter by both past and present boards of ANL that it should actually buy 100 per cent of the stevedoring company. According to Beazley yesterday, however, nobody ""with any common sense would seriously suggest the Government ought to have done that."" If that is the case, why is the Government paying Neville Wran and Malcolm Turnbull, as board members of ANL, $151,000 and $150,000 respectively for six months' of advice so apparently lacking in common sense? It is unbelievable that the government has continued to head down the ridiculous path that it has when the weight of opinion from political and economic commentators across Australia flies in the face of what the government is doing. Some headlines have been: 'Dithering leaves ANL in dry dock', 'Government adhockery over ANL threatens to further undermine the value of the already diminished national asset', 'Beazley defends ANL funding'-of course he had to; the decision had already been made and he had to stick with his mates-and 'Secret funding deal in ANL sale'. What did the Australian Taxpayers Association have to say in this regard? It stated: The ANL deal holds the Nation to ransom. The Federal government has signalled that the use of industrial muscle is a legitimate tactic and will be rewarded. Taxpayers are the big losers in this deal because the government has committed all other taxpayers (especially workers paying PAYE) to subsidise the ANL. There is no guaranteed end date and it commits all taxpayers to subsidise ANL for over $20 million per year. Under the deal, the company gets to keep the PAYE instalments ... No other companies in Australia are entitled to those instalments. If they took them they would be dragged into the courts by the Australian Taxation Office. In my electorate, I know of three companies in the last year that have gone bankrupt because the Australian Taxation Office has taken them to court for exactly the same thing that this minister and this government are condoning with ANL. Companies around Australia are being sent bankrupt by the Australian Taxation Office for doing exactly the same thing. This government is gratuitously giving these instalments to ANL and the Maritime Union of Australia employees that work for ANL. It is a disgrace. It is disgusting. (TIme expired)  p.m.)-I would like to say much more than I will be able to say in the time available to me in this debate, which is limited because of the time by which we need to get the ANL Guarantee Bill through. Listening to the member for Lyne (Mr Vaile), I grieve: will there ever be an occasion in this place when people on the other side of this House have anything to say in support of the Australian shipping industry or the Australian aviation industry? Last week it was the tum of Australia's aviation industry to be bagged; this week it is Australia's shipping industry. I could understand if some criticism were made of some point, but all I have been listening to is the same old ritual. We are the fifth largest shipping market in the world on a cargo-distance carried basis. Would people not think that at some stage it would occur to the minds of those who sit opposite that that is not a bad sort of a base to be looking at to see if we can get into the international markets and build up an industry? If there are problems-whether in respect of capitalisation, corporations, distortion of subsidies paid by our competitors or the use of virtual slave ships-could those problems not be addressed? I would love to hear that kind of comment coming from those opposite. But, no, they bag the unions, they bag ANL. But they do not bag the oil companies. The financial measures that were announced by the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) on 13 September apply to all Australian flagged ships that spend more than 50 per cent of their activity in the international trade. That is not ANL. It is utterly dishonest to listen to speaker after speaker on the other side of this place carrying on as if those measures were exclusively to the benefit of ANL. Why did you not mention Caltex, my dear colleague? Why did you not mention Ampol? Why did you not mention the great multinational Shell? All the vessels of those companies will benefit from those financial measures. Why did you not mention BHP? It will benefit from those financial measures, those tax concessions. Those measures are put there for one very good reason: if our shipping fleet is to participate and compete in world markets, we want some sort of equity, we want some sort of fair start. What do we do? Out there on the other side of the world-whether they have ships with incompetent crews or exploited and deprived crews, or ships that are operated with very generous special taxation benefits, whatever they are-they are laughing their heads off when they pick up the Hansard of this place and read what the opposition in the Australian parliament has to say. Can you not just once act like Australians? If there are problems, define them ljJ1d. confine your remarks accordingly. But, no, you bag just one. The union hatred keeps coming through over and over and over. I dare say that, back in the electorate of Lyne and in a number of north coast electorates, seafarers reside. How do you think they feel when listening to what you have just been saying, my dear friend? They do not deserve the kind of comment that has been coming from the other side of the House this afternoon. We as a nation ought to be looking to expand and develop our shipping industry. That is what the minister's agreement and that range of measures are about. They are about trying to get some sort of taxation equity in this whole system. The concession, the exemption of PAYE tax, does not go to union members; their net return, their net wage, is unchanged. It goes to the shipping company. BHP, Shell, Ampol or Caltex, whatever the company is, gets that benefit because it is matching the benefit being given by some of our shipping competitors. The benefit does not go to the crews. I tum to the other issue of changes to crew numbers. Yes, that is part of the pajlkagethat unions and employers look at crew numbers and at reducing crew size. They have done fantastically over recent years, without any problems whatsoever, in going to general purpose crewing. That has all been part of the overall package of trying to .make the shipping industry more efficient. But that cannot be done when there are seafarers who are paid, if they are paid, $100 a month and who are not fed, or seafarers working on ships where the shipping companies are exempt from any form of taxation. That is what the government is trying to address here. Yes, there have been problems with ANL. But ANL is like all other major shipping businesses. Have a look through the performances of all the major Japanese shipping lines over the last six years and see how they have got on. There has been the collapse in international trades because of the international recession. The conference lines are the area where a major part of ANL's troubles have occurred-the conference line to Europe and the conference lines to north Asia. Look at the inroads made by the Chinese shipping firm casco, which is one of the organisations which is simply buying foreign exchange, not trading commercially. You come in here and want to apply to the Australian shipping industry a commercial regime. At the same time you want to shut your eyes, close your ears and remain totally unaware of the fact that the people you expect to compete with do not operate commercially. That is one of the market problems we have. It is not new;'''it happens with products, it happens in the primary sector-it happens in a number of areas. But as Australians let us be honest about it and try to address it. Let us say, 'All right, what can we do in these areas? What other kinds of measures can we employ? Can we try to balance that off? Can we concentrate on special services? Can we use our expertise as we do with the Japanese coal trade where difficult cargoes go on Australian ships?' Where there is more than one drop or more than one type of coal on board the vessel, the Australian company, BHP, will get that job. Where there is one cargo, one coal, a drop in one port, it is more likely to go to a foreign flag vessel. But let us concentrate on those areas. The other issue is a proposal to increase depreciation rates which also goes to the issue of trying to put our shipping industry on a more competitive basis. It is not accurate to say that the people working in the industry have not tried. They have made their contribution, as have those in other sectors of Australian industry generally. Sure, industry has made its contribution to becoming more competitive and increasing productivity. But, again, it is a moving feast. Industry understands that, and we understand that. But we have to be in there encouraging it. What the ANL issue is really about-and this is why I get so angry when I hear what is repeatedly said opposite-is the future of the Australian shipping industry. What these measures which have been agreed are about is the future of Australia's shipping industry: how we can become competitive; how we can find shares in the market; other trades we can specialise in-and I believe that we can be competitive and that there are other areas we can specialise in. The industry wants these issues to be dealt with. You may have noticed the comment that came from Lance Hockridge, Group General Manager of BHP Transport, who operates the BHP fleet. BHP has welcomed the range of measures which have been bagged by the opposition today. But it has welcomed them because it recognises the difficulties which it faces and that these measures will help it to become more competitive. I refer honourable members to a two-day seminar that was held in Launceston over 17 to 19 August last. At that seminar, which was attended by over 100 delegates, there was a unanimous decision on support for the Australian shipping industry. It is not just a shipping industry; it is shipping services industry. Norway made the mistake of letting most of her fleet go offshore. When most of it went offshore, what went with it? The classification society, the freight forwarders, the insurance, the clerical tasks-all the shore based activity associated with the shipping industry. They very quickly realised that they had to do something about it-and they did do something about it. In this country I want to see us talking about the shipping services industry, the total transport journey, the total and integrated transport tasks-all of those operations. I will conclude with these words: the marine insurance industry, which is able to be competitive in this country, does not get a look in on insuring Australian iron ore to Japan because Japanese companies, including Nippon Steel Mills, have decided that that market is reserved for Japanese marine insurance companies. So, even when we can be competitive, it is difficult to break into the market. I support the bill and recommend its provisions to the House.",70
149,Mr TUCKEY,COMMITTEE,"O'Connor) (5.49 p.m.)The contribution of the member for Shortland  preselection is showing. We have heard him before-I do know of his personal commitment to Australian shipping and have supported him particularly with regard to the environmental aspects of rust buckets-but he brings a most uncompelling argument to the parliament today. Initially, the ANL Guarantee Bill is to give almost unlimited guarantee capacity to the Treasurer to pass on to lenders who wish to lend money to a bankrupt organisation known as ANL. That is fundamental to this debate. It is a much bigger debate than the future of the Australian shipping industry. If Australian private enterprise wants to go into the investment area of shipping and bring to Australia needed foreign revenue plus competition, the coalition would be very supportive of such a proposal. What we are talking about is propping up a dog in any economic or business terms. The  Morris) should have it all burned on his memory because he used to be the Minister the for Transport. Mr Deputy Speaker, you and I would well remember when he came to this parliament and told us he had the complete solution: he was just going to throw $160 million worth of taxpayers' money at ANL, and from there on in it would be an example to the rest of the world as to the capacity of Australian shipping to compete. At that point, he did negotiate. Again, he had to go cap in hand to the trade union movement and offer $160 million worth of Australian taxpayers' money with the purpose of reducing manning levels. In those days, as we flew back and forth across Australia with the privilege of our class seat, you and I from time to time might have found ourselves sitting next to seamen. They used to travel first class, too. It did not matter where their six weeks of duty ended; they were immediately flown home first class. I do not say over a long journey they should be entitled to any less than us, but some of them were quite illuminating. They used to tell us how things went. One fellow happened to own a couple of cray boats and he was going back to drive one of those during his six weeks off. He was battling a bit. He was telling me how they still had a butcher on their boat but they were served TV frozen meals. There was no carcass on board, but there was a butcher. And we wonder why Australian shi{tping is in the state it is today! The member for Shortland was absolutely true in saying one thing. We are an island nation, one of the greatest producers in the world of bulk minerals and other bulk commodities, including wheat and other products. We hear constant talk about value adding, and one of the simplest concepts of value adding is to ship your own product out of the country. When you talk to some fellow in a foreign country about buying a product, he is not interested in f.o.b. prices; he is interested in c.i.f. He wants to know what it is going to cost him just before he puts the product in the blast furnace or grinds the wheat into flour. When we say, 'We can ship it in an Australian ship, if you like,' admittedly they play rough pool, too. They say, 'We are buying your product. We want to use our ships.' We have proved with gas shipping and a few other things that you can negotiate if you have a product that is in demand. This fellow says, 'I want to know how much it is going to cost me landed in my country.' If you cannot be competitive in a world market, do not give us crocodile tears about the rights of Australians. We can /do that within our country, to some degree, and we have learnt the price of that from time to time in the potential of jobs for our children. The simple fact is that overseas consumers will not buy. Yet we have had this head in the sand, lemming approach fmm the various first seamen's unions to drive away business by demanding certain rights and a monopoly on shipping. That is an extremely selfish attitude. As I have said from time to time, since the good Lord produced the miracle of feeding the multitude with, I think it was, three fishes and five loaves of bread, nobody else has been able to repeat the trick. If you want to have a totally inefficient shipping industry, someone at one end or the other will pay. We cannot manifest money. So if you accept the principle of an inflated shipping market through, for instance, the process of cabotage, what is the result? It is here for us all to see today-a drought stricken eastern seaboard and a relatively good harvest in my electorate of Western Australia. It is cheaper to bring the grain from North America; in fact, the freight rate of bringing grain from North America is about half that of buying it off Western Australians. If the truth is known, Western Australian grain growers would be more competitive in Europe, North America or South America with their product once freight is added on than they would be in South Australia. We know that it costs more to ship things across Bass Strait. That is the issue. The first issue is: why would you prop up something thatv is admittedly broke? Why, then, would you pass that debt guarantee on to some future shareholders? Apparently the Seamen's Union or the maritime unions, as they are now known, are the only ones interested. Why would you do that as a government? More importantly, why would you tolerate an industry where arrant selfishness of a few has been so damaging to so many: consumers and producers, both ends? We have made ourselves totally uncompetitive for years in New Zealand and we have not changed. The New Zealanders told us years ago that they did not want any more of the accord that says only Australian and New Zealand crewed ships can go backwards and forwards to New Zealand, but it happens. There have been some very corrupt practices associated with that. I well remember not that long ago somebody else tried to get into the business and c<;>mpete with the then pliable owners-I think it was the Union Steamship Co. It met all the union demands and its prices were outrageous. Someone said, 'Look, I can.make a big quid competing with it. I can undercut its prices.' But that person forgot one little thing-the corp.pany w,as never allowed to sail. It had an Aussie ship and. an Aussie crew, but every time the ship pulled into. the wharf the 'wharfies would not load it. They were a bit busy that day, having a stop-work meeting. The unions crucified that competition, notwithstanding the company was Australian owned and might have been the answer to our developing the first little stage of a competitive industry which, r am the· first to admit, Australia desperately needs. All that freight comes in the invisible sector of our current account. Of course we should own ships. Of course it should be a major value adding industry for Australia. But· if we are not prepared to run them. competitively, we just kill the exporter. We kill the consumer. Why would you do that? It.is just ridiculous. The shipping industry of Australia has basically always survived on one form of cross-subsidy or another. Somebody else has had to pay. The government was lecturing us today at question time about its competition policy. The government thinks it is a great idea that New South Wales Pacific Power should compete with the Victorian energy board, or whatever it is called, and I agree. But; if that is the case, why are the same principles not applied in our shipping industry? Why do we stand by cabotage? Why do we prevent farmers in New South Wales being able to buy grain from Western Australia? Why do we put up a barrier for that? We know why. As has been clearly pointed out, the maritime unions are calling the shots. But if we are going to have competition policy, surely it is in all areas of competition, not just those that suit the government from time to time. It is just outrageous. I was reading an article by David Trebeck the other day in the Australian Farm Journal. He pointed out his experiences of time gone by when he was a negotiator on behalf of producer organisations. He said: For 10 years} sat opposite ANL representatives in various freight rate negotiations, mainly for wool and meat to Australia's major export destinations. Let us face it, we are not the only producers of wool and meat in the world, as we have been well reminded from time to time. He went on to say: At every turn, I have concluded that ANL was part of the problem, not the solution. The initial logic for a government-owned shipping line was to provide a ""window into the conference""-that supposedly murky organisation which acted as a (legally sanctioned)and it is time we gave up on thatcartel to rip off Australian exporters. My experienc;e did· not bear out this lopsided view at all. He points Qut that it was when they could point to some non-conference operative that would carry the freight that the conference line started to sharpen its pencil. He said: The emergence of new shipping lines in the Asian trades in the late 19708/early 19808 posed a more serious challenge to the status quo. Again, shippers benefited, although for a while ANL was successful in blunting the competition by lobbying the government. When the competitive price came along our government shipping line was in there saying, 'Don't you dare give a fair break and a competitive advantage to our viable exporters within Australia.' David Trebeck then said: Two conclusions stand out clearly in my mind from this period. First, although we never received individual company data, it was clear that ANL was always the highest cost conference member. If ANL were breaking even or better, the more efficient conference members were doing nicely, thank you. They were doing nicely just exporting out of the country. He continued: Second, succ-sive governments-via the Department of Transport-were far more oriented to their interests as a shipping-line owner than a supporter of exporters trying to become more competitive. So much for the window into. the conference. He went on to criticise the situation that still exists on our trans-Tasman routes-it is just dreadful. Of course, the member for Shortland and Mr Trebeck make note of the outrageous decision-I see the minister responsible, the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), coming into the chamber-that one segment of Australian industry no longer deducts PAYE tax from its employees. The member for Shortland is quite correct. That is of no direct benefit to the seamen; their take-home pay will be the same. But considering that they receive what are pretty high levels of wages-enough, as I pointed out, for one bloke to buy two cray boats-the shipping companies' costs have been dramatically reduced. Some of those wages would attract a marginal tax rate of 45 per cent. If that is to be a policy of the government and it is going to treat one business in that way, it is time we looked at a few others. I have already mentioned the drought. The government seems to be totally blind to the circumstances of small businesses in our drought areas, in our regioHal.cities. Aflybody who has had only the slightest contact with the rural communities knows that when the rural industry is under pressure the first thing farmers do is get the stapler out and staple up the cheque book. They will sustain their flocks if they can, they will feed their families, they might even-with a bit of lucksend their kids off to university, but they do not repair the tractor, they do not replace the header, they do not maintain their fences to the same degree; they do nqt make any decisions of a capital nature' whatsoever. So they are not making those sorts of purchases in the rural towns, and that means the local small businessmen are sitting there with their staff and no customers. What are those businessmen confronted with? They are confronted with sacking their staff. If this government through its drought policy were to apply the same niles to those small business proprietors as they are applying to shipping companies, then perhaps those small businessmen could keep their staff on; they might not have to retrench them. That might be reasonable social policy as well as keeping people in business, but is anybody suggesting that? I have not hear- suc- a suggestion-not a word. The simpi'e fact is that this government has no intention of helping any of those people or their wage earning employees who might be able to be retained in that way. I do not believe either pmposal is proper. While for small businesses in the country the fuel tax has risen-a very significant factor in their operating costs-it is going to be reduced for the shipping industry. Clearly, there was some benefit in that, particularly when we are told that all of the savings that the local shipping industry had achieved through the reduCtion in manning levels was gobbled up in one dose of government fuel taxes, of which there was not one mention before the election. Governm.ent members are squealing here today about us blocking their tertiary education proposal to raise some more money. They would have had support for that if they had got a mandate for it at the last election. They did not,. any more than they got a mandate on this occasion to bail out ANL again, as they are now proposing, in what is a very unsavoury fashion, because they are setting something up to let one of their union mates buy it with the aid of government guarantees. I could tell members that a lot of small business people around Australia would be delighted to think they could buy an ailing business with a government guarantee for the borrowing. Finally, I want to address the circumstances associated with the current board members. It is a pretty interesting situation that.we have a couple of banisters who have been elevated to the status of experts in shipping. I have had a few remarks to make on shipping today, but I would hate to think that I had been given the job of trying to turn a business like ANL around-and at least I had had about 30 years of actual business experience before I came here. I do not think Neville Wran has had any. He is a lawyer. I used to say of lawyers that they do not even run their own business; they leave that to some administrator, usually a mature woman who does it extremely well on their behalf. They are not noted for their administrative capacity,' and I 'could not believe for a moment that a-ybody in his right mind trying to resurrect the shipping industry would go and employ a couple of lawyers, notwithstanding that at some point in time they gave themselves the' label of merchant bankers and they seem to do very well out of government work. If you were going to try to save this industheir try, it would not be a bad idea if you went and got some experts. Of course, the government did have some. In David Trebeck's article, to which I have already referred, he made some response about the capacity of some of the people who were sacked compared with the people who have now been employed. It is outrageous: $150,000 each for two lawyers to resurrect the shipping industry. I do not know how much contact Neville has even had with the shipping industry other than probably to go down for a few donations. I do not know whether or not he picked up the brown paper bags at the Maritime Union, but I have had a couple of interesting stories told as to how much trust he had own collectors. I was told first-hand about day he knocked on some door and the bloke handed him some money-for the good cause of the party; I am not saying it was dishonest-and he said, 'And where's the rest of itT and the fellow went back and got some more. That is a true story. Anyway, that would be about the closest contact he has ever had with that industry. He has no qualifications for this task, and at the end of it all the simple fact is that he will come up with some warm and fuzzy political solution aimed at convincing people that more assistance should be given to the line and its intended purchaser, the maritime unions. It will be interesting in only one regard. I would be quite supportive of this thing if it were not for the fact that we were going to pass on a taxpayer funded guarantee, a WA Inc. style deal. The linkage with this is obvious. That is exactly what these people's pals did in Western Australia when they set out to bail out Rothwells bank. They came out with a guarantee of $150 million and then saw it dissipated. So to protect themselves from embarrassment they turned around and created a mock company called the Petrochemical Pickle and borrowed another $450 million. And the taxpayers lost the lot because those people would not even admit to the thing they had done wrong. This has got all the same implications. It has got a Labor lawyer running it when in fact there are competent people in Australia who could have given the government good advice, based on long experience in the shipping industry.

150,Mr GEAR,COMMITTEE,"in reply-In summing up on the ANL Guarantee Bill 1994, let me thank all members who participated in the debate. There are a few points I would like to make, basically in response to the member for Hume (Mr Sharp). He said that the bill was unnecessary because the government is the sole shareholder and therefore implicitly the government will guarantee. I can say that he is wrong on both counts. The ANL is a public company, set up by the ANL Act of 1956. It is not a statutory authority and, therefore, in his under normal principles of company law, the shareholders' liability is limited to the shareholding. Therefore, without a specific guarantee the Commonwealth is under no legal obligation to guarantee any debts. We accept the member for Hume's good wishes for the future of ANL, and that is why the guarantee is being given now. Legislation is necessary also because of specific requirements in section 70B of the Audit Act 1901. The bill will also guarantee all debts. The bill does not guarantee all debts of itself, but authorises guarantee of repayments of principal and interest under loan agreements. Due to the specific restrictions imposed by section 70B of the Audit Act, other debts and liabilities do not need legislation but may be guaranteed by executive action of ministers without the need for specific legislation. The honourable member for Hume talked about market confidence in the company. I would just say to him that, by opposing the bill and opposing the measures I have outlined, the opposition is doing more to shake market confidence than anything the government is doing. What we are doing is actually guaranteeing the debts of ANL and lifting market confidence. The honourable member for Hume said also that ANL has been starved of capital. Since 1983, the government has provided equity amounting to $160 million. In five of the past seven years the company has experienced operating losses before interest and tax, and the company would still be making a significant loss even if it had no debts. I tum to the ANL and Australian Stevedores. There has been a lot of nonsense about this following a story in the Australian last week. I think it was dealt with fairly comprehensively by the Minister for· Finance (Mr Beazley) in answer to a question in the House on 8 November, but for the record I reiterate that there was no secret funding deal or Adams, D. questionable commercial practice involved in Beazley, K. C. ANL's sale of its 25 per cent shareholding in Bevis, A. R. Australian Stevedores to Strang Patrick Brereton, L. J. Holdings, which is owned by Jamison Equity. Cleeland, P. R. On 9 September 1994, ANL agreed to accept Crean, S. F. an offer made on 2 September by Strang Deahm, M. J. Patrick Holdings to purchase ANL's shareDuffy, M. J. holding for $28 million-the same price as Easson, M. was accepted by Howard ""Smith Ltd for its Evans, M. 1. shares. The structuring of the sale agreement Ferguson, was handled by ANL representatives and Gibson, G. D. ANL advised that the sale included a 20 per Griffiths, A. G. cent deposit of $5.6 million paid on 9 SepHenzell, M. M. tember, with the balance to be paid within 60 Hollis, C. days. There was no cash transfer from ANL Howe, B. L. to the purchaser. ANL's security for the Jenkins, H. A. transaction between 9 September and compleKerr, D. J. C. tion on 4 November was a mortgage over the Latham, M. W. shares, which were registered with the AusLee, M. J. tralian Securities Commission, and possession MCHugh, J. of the share certificates. ANL representatives Melham, D. remained on the board of Australian SteveMorris, P. F. dores until settlement on Friday, 4 November. Price, L. R. S. The real issue in the sale of the interest in Sciacca, C. A. Australian Stevedores was whether the government would allow itself to be forced to move from 25 per cent to 100 per cent ownership and become the sole proprietor of Australia's biggest stevedoring company. Such a decision would have involved the Commonwealth in a total financial commitment of approximately $280 million in share purchases, contingent liabilities and capital expenditure. Even if the government had acquired 100 per cent of the stevedoring business, this would not have cha-ed the fundamental fact that ANL's shipping businesses were unprofitable even before interest and tax. .

151,Mr LAVARCH,NOES,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. Next year will mark the 20th anniversary of the passage of the Racial Discrimination Act. The act was the first specific Commonwealth law on human rights. It was based on the fundamental belief that all Australians irrespective of race, colour or national or ethnic origin are entitled to fair treatment. In this country, we take pride in the community's consensus that everyone should be able to advance through life on their own efforts NOES abilities; that it is wrong to judge anyone on the colour of their skin or the sound of their accent. Lieberman, L. S. Be it under a law, or in employment or the provision of services, or access to f-cilities and accommodation, discrimination based on racial prejudice and intolerance is addressed by the Racial Discrimination Act. The law provides a remedy to those who have experienced discrimination. It exists because even with general community tolerance, we'know racism exists. And racism leads to discrimination. The Racial Discrimination Act does not Vaile, M. A. J. eliminate racist attitudes. It does not try to, for a law cannot change what people think. But it does target behaviour-behaviour that PAIRS causes an individual to suffer discrimination. The parliament is now being asked to pass a new law dealing with racism in Australia. It too targets behaviour-behaviour which affects not only the individual but the community as a whole. The Racial Hatred Bill is about the protection of groups and individuals from threats of violence and the incitement of racial hatred which leads inevitably to violence. It enablethe H-m-n Rights. - d Equal .Opportunity CommISSIon to conclhate complamts of racial abuse. This bill is controversial. It has generated much comment and raises difficult issues for the parliament to consider. It calls for a careful decision on principle. I wish to address the issues most consistently raised in the public debate and then examine the provisions of the bill in detail. The bill is intended to close a gap in the legal protection available to the victims of extreme behaviour. No Australian should live in fear because of his or her race, colour or national or ethnic origin. The legislation will provide a safety net for racial harmony in Australia, as both a warning to those who might attack the principle of tolerance and an assurance to their potential victims. Three major inquiries have found gaps in the protection provided by the Racial Discrimination Act. The National Inquiry into Racist Violence, the Australian Law Reform Commission Report into Multiculturalism and and the Law, and the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody all argued in favour of an extension of Australia's human rights regime to explicitly protect the victims of extreme racism. The 1992 report of the national inquiry into racist violence found that while state and territory criminal law punishes the perpetrators of violence, it largely is inadequate to deal with conduct that is a pre-condition of racial violence. The report documented 60 such incidents. The Law Reform Commission report and the royal commission also dealt extensively with examples of extreme racist behaviour. Since then there has been an upsurge in the activities of extremist racist groups which have resulted in harassment and intimidation of individuals. As well, public gatherings of ethnic communities have been disrupted, sometimes violently. In Sydney, police are investigating seven arson' attacks on synagogues in less than four years. In Melbourne, there have been reports of teenage gangs targeting Australians of Asian background. While these incidents are not everyday occurrences, they tear at the fabric of our society and cause immense concern to many of our . citizens. Racism is often a by-product of ignorance, and education is an essential part of any response. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has a number of programs which target racism in schools, reinforced by a variety of programs run by educational authorities. The commission also provides resources to help employers deal with racism in the workplace. The commission will also be conducting a public education program to promote this legislation upon its passage. Racism should be responded to by education and by confronting the expression of racist ideas. But legislation is not mutually exclusive of these responses. It is not a choice between legislation or education. Rather, it is, law. in the government's view, a case of using both. There is no doubt that the Racial - iscrimi­ nation Act has been a powerful influence on the rejection of racist attitudes over the past two decades. It has forced many people to confront racist views and have them debunked. It can be compared to the contribution of the Sex Discrimination Act over the past 10 years to improving the way women are treated in our society. This bill has been mairily criticised on the grounds that it limits free expression and that to enact such legislation undermines one of the most fundamental principles of our democratic society. Yet few of these critics would argue that free expression should be absolute and unfettered. Throughout Australia, at all levels of government, free expression has had some limits placed on it when there is a countervailing public interest. Laws dealing with defamation, copyright, obscenity, incitement, official secrecy, contempt of court and parliament, censorship and consumer protection all qualify what can be expressed. These laws recognise the need to legislate where words can cause serious economic damage, prejudice a fair trial or unfairly damage a person's reputation. In this bill, free speech has been balanced against the rights of Australians to live free of fear and racial harassment. Surely the promotion of racial hatred and its inevitable link to violence is as damaging to our community as issuing a misleading prospectus, or breaching the Trade Practices Act. The bill places no new limits on genuine public debate. Australians must be free to speak their minds, to criticise actions and policies of others and to share a joke. The bill does not prohibit people from expressing ideas or having beliefs, no matter how unpopular the views may be to many other people. The law has no application to private conversations. Nothing which is said or done reasonably and in good faith in the course of any statement, publication, discussion or debate made or held for an academic, artistic or scientific purpose or any other purpose in the public interest will be prohibited by the It is worthy of note that New South Wales has had similar legislation for five years and yet no-one has seriously argued that free speech has been curtailed there. Nor has it been unduly limited in any other Australian jurisdictions where similar legislation exists. But perhaps most noteworthy are the experiences in other liberal democracies throughout the world that ban racial hatred and violence. Free speech is a constitutional right in Canada and many European countries, yet the highest courts in these countries have held provisions which ban racist hatred and violence in public to be reasonable and necessary. In fact, in 1989 the Canadian Supreme Court upheld Canada's anti-hate legislation. Recently the Australian High Court has established the existence within the constitution of an implied guarantee of free expression. The High Court decisions have been closely examined and the government is fully convinced that the bill does not infringe on the principles developed by the court. Clearly then, while these are important issues, the Commonwealth parliament is not the first Australian legislature to grapple them. Criminal laws dealing with the incitement of racial hatred operate in New South Wales, Western Australia, Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory. Civil provisions are also in place in each of these jurisdictions except Western Australia. New Zealand has had laws of this nature since 1971. Along with Canada, Great Britain and a number of the states of the United States also have specific laws on racial hatred. The principle of legislating to deal with racial hatred has for some time enjoyed the support of the leadership of the federal Liberal Party. The former Leader of the Opposition, the member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), in an address to the Zionist Federation in May 1992, said national antivilification legislation would be a worthwhile initiative in Australia. The federal coalition's commitment to such legisiation was reconfirmed with the release of the Liberal and National parties' 1993 Fightback law and justice policy by the then shadow AttomeyGeneral and now the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, the member for Higgins (Mr Costello). The Fightback policy document stated unequivocally that inciting fear or damage to people or their property on racial grounds should be prohibited. The member for Higgins reaffirmed this commitment in a letter dated 8 February 1993 to Mr Mark Leibler which said of the 1992 draft legislation: We accept the principles underlying the first part of the Bill, which is designed to prevent intentionally stirring up racial hatred, fear of violence or injury to person or property. As recently as May this year the coalition again publicly endorsed the need for such legislation when its then spokesperson on these matters, the member for Tangney (Mr Williams), said: The opposition recognises the need for the legislation and, in principle, we accept that legislation should provide criminal sanctions for racial violence and hatred. The current Leader of the Opposition has also publicly recognised the need for racial hatred legislation and committed himself to supporting such action by this parliament. Only four months ago, in a wide ranging interview with reported in the Australian Jewish News, Mr Downer said: Where there is incitement to violence or to damaging property on the basis of race, then there is no question that should be a criminal offence. You obviously have to find a balance between free speech, on one hand, and ensuring that there isn't incitement to racial vilification in our society. However, the opposition is not supporting this bill. It has been advanced that the bill restricts freedom of speech and that a model based on the New South Wales Anti-Discrimination Act 1977 would allay opposition concerns. Let me now detail the provisions of the bill and where appropriate make comparisons with the New South Wales legislation. I believe a fair assessment is that, while the New South Wales law is a perfectly workable model, the bill before the House overcomes some deficiencies in the New South Wales act and is consistent with the Commonwealth's own human rights regime. In outline, the bill amends the Crimes Act 1914 to provide for three criminal offences and amends the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 to provide for a civil prohibition. The criminal provisions do not attempt to replicate the general criminal law which deals with physical violence and the dam-ge to property. Rather the provisions centre on the precursors of actual violence; that is, the incitement of racial hatred and threats made to a person or persons or property because of race, colour or national or ethnic origin. The bill seeks to close a gap in the operation of the current laws by protecting people confronted by situations likely to lead to fear and racist violence. The three criminal provisions to be inserted in the Crimes Act 1914 are set out in clause 4 of the bill. The first two offences deal respectively with threats, done because of race, colour or national or ethnic origin, against people and property, while the third prohibits acts done, otherwise than in private, with the intention of inciting racial hatred. I shall speak about each provision in tum. Proposed section 58 is quite simple in its terms - it creates an offence which requires a person to threaten another because of their race, colour or national or ethnic origin. While the general law affords protection where a person is the s'llbject of physical threat, proposed section 58 will expressly cover such a person where the basis of the threat is the person's race, colour or national or ethnic origin. Perhaps, more significantly, it will also afford protection throughout Australia in cases where there is no single person threatened, but a group of people identifiable by their race. This offence of threatening physical harm to people is based on an assault-type provision-although it does not cover actual battery. The concept of threatening physical harm has been considered judicially on many occasions, and requires that 'the person to whom violence is offered, to whom the threat is made, must ... believe that violence is to be feared'. Proposed section 59 is similar, except that it is directed at cases where a person's properwhich ty, rather than their own physical safety, is threatened with damage or destruction. Given the serious nature of the conduct to be dealt with by proposed sections 58 and 59, I believe that there is a strong case for including these provisions in the Commonwealth's criminal law. Proposed section 60 creates aI criminal offence in relation to the intentional incitement of racial hatred. There are four elements t the offence. First, the offence will only arise in relation to an act done otherwise than in private. I draw the House's attention to proposed section 60(2), which· provides a definition of what acts are taken not to be done in private. Secondly, such an act must be. done with an intention to incite racial hatred-that is, the offence contains a subjective test. Thirdly, the act must be done because of race, colour or national or ethnic origin. Fourthly, the act must be one which is reasonably likely in all the circumstances to incite racial hatred-that is, the offence contains an objective test. The term 'incitement' is to be regarded as referring to a conscious and motivated acthence the inclusion of a subjective test as an element of the offence. The travaux preparatoires to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination refer to 'incitement' in the sense of provocation. The travaux also refer to 'provocation to violence' against any race or group of persons of another colour or ethnic origin. The travaux do not define 'racial hatred' but it may be inferred by analogy to article 1 of the convention that the term 'racial hatred' simply means hatred based on race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin. Thus, the United Kingdom Public Order Act 1986 states that 'racial hatred' means hatred against a group of persons defined by reference to colour, race, nationality-including citizenship-or ethnj- or national origins. As used in proposed section 60, 'hatred' carries its ordinary meaning indicating intense dislike or enmity. It is instructive to compare the use of 'hatred' in this bill with section 20D of the New South Wales Anti-Discrimination Act, refers also to inciting 'serious contempt for', or 'severe ridicule of', a person or group. This seems to indicate that that act's use of the terms 'incitement of', 'serious contempt' or 'severe ridicule' makes that act in some ways br()ader in scope than the bill, which - ses the term 'incitement to racial hatred'. In considering whether a particular act, which in other respects satisfies the various elements of the offence in proposed .section 60, 'is reasonably likely in all the circumstances to incite racial hatred' , a court would have to have regard to all the circumstances surrounding the case to determine whether that objective test has been satisfied. Section 20D of the New South Wales Act specifies two things to be included in the means used to incite, namely, where a person threatens physical harm to a person or property, or incites others to so threaten. In this bill, such activity is dealt with by proposed sections 58 and 59. However, it should be noted that if those threats do not incite hatred, either because there is no third party present or that person is not incited to hate, there can be no offence under section 20D of the New South Wales act. This is a serious shortcoming. Among other things, proposed section 60 would deal with those cases where a person's acts are reasonably likely to incite, against persons of a particular race, colour or national or ethnic origin, intense racial enmity of a kind which is likely to lead to physical harm to persons of that group or damage or destruction of their property. In other words, a person does not necessarily need to actually threaten physical harm to persons or property . to commit an offence against section 60. It needs to be recognised that racial hatred does not exist in a vacuum or for the intellectual satisfaction of those feeling it. Racial hatred provides a climate in which people of a particular race or ethnic origin live in fear and in which disciimination can thrive. It provides the climate in which violence may take place. It is of itself a threat to the well-being of the whole community as well as to individuals or groups in the community. It needs to be conf.ronted. The kind of behavioUr that proposed section 60 is designed to adc:h'ess has been made the subject of criminal sanctions in similar legal and social systems. 1 refer members to section 319(2) of the Canadian Criminal Code; section 63 of the Human Rights Act of New Zealand; and section 1& of the United Kingdom Public Order Act. The bill provides a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment for the offence in proposed section 58 of threatening to harm a 'person, while the offences in proposed sections 59 and 60 of threatening to damage property and incitement to racial hatred, respectively, carry a maximum penalty of one year. I should explain that imprisonment is by no means the only sentencing option available to a court where a person is found guilty of one of these three offences. Where a person is found guilty of any Commonwealth offence, including those which the bill creates, the starting point for a court is found in section 16A of the Crimes Act 1914, which sets out the matters a court must have regard to when sentencing and requires the c(mrt to impose a sentence that is 'appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence'. To determine the most appropriate sentence, a court is provided with a full range of options, such as fines, bonds or community service orders in addition to imprisonment. For example, section 4B of the Crimes Act provides a mechanism by mealls. of which a term of imprisonment can be converted into a ·fine. Commonwealth legislation will be amended following enactment of the bill to provide that, where a person or corporation is convicted of a criminal offence under the bill as enacted, that person or corporation will not be \:?ligible to receive a government grant or subsidy. For example, a company convicted of disseminating literature which was found by the court to be reasonably likely to incite racial hated would not be eligible to receive an export market development grant from the government. So, inesseIlce, the difference between the Commonwealth bill and the NSW AntiDiscrimination Act in criminal matters turns on the· offence of the incitement of racial hatred. The New South Wales law does .not crimimilise as such the making of a threat on the grounds of race, but rather covers threats only where they are means by which racial hatred is incited. In contrast, this bill provides that the making of threats on racial grounds is an offence of itself. Threats may often be associated with the incitement of racial hatred. However, in the government's view, a threat to violence is of sufficient concern to be a specific criminal offence even when it is not a factor in the incitement of racial hatred. The bill also provides for a civil regime by the amendment of the Racial Discrimination Act. Section 18C will be inserted in the act to make it unlawful for a person to do an act, otherwise than in private, if: (a) the act is reasonably likely in all the circumstances to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate another person or group of people; and (b) the act is done because of the race, colour or national or ethnic origin of the other person or of some or all of the people in the group. A number of initial points need to be made. First, the provision is civil and not criminal in effect. That is, the process will be initiated by the victim of alleged unlawful behaviour via a complaint to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and not by police investigations. Secop.dly, like all complaints under Commonwealth human rights laws, the commission will endeavour Jo resolve the matter by private and confidential conciliation. Only if conciliation cannot resolve the matter is there a public hearing and a determination by the commission. The commission can immediately dismiss frivolous or vexatious complaints. The format of the civil provision is similar to the model used in other Commonwealth human rights legislation such as the Sex Discrimination Act. It is based upon the availability of a remedy in specified circumstances, judged against the objective criteria of what is reasonably likely in all the circumstances to give rise to a valid complaint, and limited and targeted through the use of exemptions. The requirement that the behaviour complained about should 'offend, insult, hu-iliate or intimidate' is the same as that us'eo to establish sexual harassment in the Sex Discrimination Act. The commission is familiar with the scope of such language and has applied it in a way that deals witly serious incidents only. The bill' requires an objective test to be applied by the commission so that community . standards to behaviour rather than the subjective views of the complainant are taken into account. The exemptions are broad and cover acts done: in the performance, exhibition or distribution of an artistic work, in the course of discussion or debate for an academic, artistic or scientific purpose or other purpose in the public interest, and in making or publishing a report or comment on a matter in the public interest. Under proposed section 18E an employer may be vicariously liable for the unlawful acts of an employee. However, the employer has a complete defence if it is established he or she took all reasonable steps to prevent the employee from doing the unlawful act. This provision is in terms similar to section 106 of the Sex Discrimination Act and section 18A of the Racial Discrimination Act. The terms of section 123 of the Disability Discrimination Act achieve the same result. The NSW Anti-Discrimination Act also contains, in section 20C, a civil prohibition of the incitement of hatred towards, serious contempt for or severe ridicule of a person or group on the ground of race. The provision is likewise qualified by exemptions, and vicarious liability was extended to employers by an amendment to the act this year. The difference between the Commonwealth and NSW provisions turgs on the description of the conduct giving rise to a potential complaint and the extent of the exceptions. It is arguable whether these differences would greatly alter the work of either the Commonwealth or NSW human rights bodies. In the government's view, this bill is to be preferred over other models because it represents the sum of experiences in these jurisdictions. There are procedural defects in the New South Wales legislation and the allied system of administration required by the law, particularly the procedure for referring civil complaints to the Director of Public Prosecutions without the benefit of any criminal investigation. The Commonwealth bill reflects the input of public comment on the 1992 draft bill. The bill is simpler, more focused and easier to administer. It targets circumstances which are preliminary to violence. It does not attempt replicate laws dealing with actual violence. has a clear distinction between civil and opposition. criminal prohibitions. It fills a gap in our laws and enhances the social compact which underpins racial· harmony in Australia. Australia has a very proud record of tecting and promoting human rights. This parliament, as it should have, has led the nation in legislating to protect and enhance all Australians' human rights. The legislative regime, including the Racial Discrimination Act, the Sex Discrimination Act and the Disability Discrimination Act passed by this parliament, is a clear demonstration of Australia's commitment to basic human it rights. We are fortunate in that Australia has a stobd. significant degree of social cohesion and racial harmony. This bill is an appropriate measured response to closing the identified gap in the legal protection of all Australians from extreme racist behaviour. It strikes a balance between the right of free speech the other rights and interests of Australia and Australians. It provides a safety net for harmony in Australia and sends a clear warning to those who might attack the principle of tolerance. And importantly this bill provides Australians who are the victims of racial hatred or violence with protection. I table the explanatory memorandum for the bill, and commend the bill to the House.",82

A three-year plan?",88
153,Mr RUDDOCK,NOES,"It is a matter in which the government, if it had a three-year plan proand if it were seriously contemplating a bipartisan approach and seriously working to develop it, should not have left the disclosure of the bill and its terms to a day or so before the bill was publicly released. I have worked over a long period of time with ministers who have been anxious to achieve a bipartisan approach to legislation. I can tell honourable members the way in which they try to carry out. They do not try to carry it out by way of ambush. Let that point be clearly underIf the government had had a demonstrated and commitment to deal with this bill by way of consultation and negotiation, one might well have seen a different outcome. But the fact is that the legislation goes well beyond legislaand tion which already exists in New South Wales. We believe that this bill in its terms is racial divisive and unnecessarily restrictive. The coalition is currently in the process of drafting its own bill, which will be based substantially on the model of the New South Wales act. That bill will be introduced to parliament at a later date, following consideration by the joint parties and the negotiation of the bill through our normal processes. The is also committed to the introduction It of a $10 million educational package to assist opposition is in combating racism. The Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) picked the words of some of my colleagues in all observations that were made, before we saw any detailed bill, on our commitment to racism in any of its manifestations. In particular, I refer to the statements made In by the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party (Mr Costello), who used the very words 'intentionally stirring up racial hatred'. The bill that we are debating does not deal with people intentionally stirring up or inciting racial hatred. In section 60, it says: person must not, with the intention of inciting racial hatred against another person or a group of people, do an act, otherwise than in private, if the act: (a) is reasonably likely, in all the circumstances, to incite racial hatred against the other person or group of people . . . What the government has introduced is not a test of intention but a test of some other person's view of what is reasonably likely, in all the circumstances, to incite",88
154,Mr LAVARCH,NOES,Two tests.,89
155,Mr RUDDOCK,NOES,"Yes. It is a test in relation to that person's intention and it qualifies that person's intention, as I read it. I want to make my comments about racial vilification clearly and unambiguously to this parliament. The Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party are totally opposed to racism in any and all its manifestations. We have a proud record-second to none, I believe-of combating racism in this country. In 1966, the coalition, under Harold Holt, abolished the White Australia policy. I remind honourable members that that policy had been kept in place by the Australian Labor Party for a long time. We do not often hear people repeating the comments of the former Labor leader, Arthur Calwell-comments which I found extraordinarily insensitive-such as, 'two Wongs do not make a White.' When Malcolm Fraser was Prime Minister, Australia accepted an influx of refugees, particularly from Indochina. Large numbers of people were settling in Australia at that time. The trade union movement and its leadership were arguing for the restriction of that inflow. Some Labor politicians at that time were regularly rounding on the Fraser government. They considered the approach that was being taken to accommodate Indochinese refugees in particular as a criticism of their involvement in the tragic war that took place in Vietnam. Australia is blessed with a multicultural society. It is one of the most diverse, tolerant and cohesive societies in the world. That can only be achieved with bipartisan sup¢rt. That means a commitment from all the people in the Australian community to the maintenance o-,this multicultural society. In my view, the way in which we as politicians debate and discuss these issues and the support we give are far more instrumental than any legislation in relation to those sorts of questions. The extent to which in our own communities we are welcoming and accommodating is of particular importance. The problem with this bill is that, by endeavouring to extend extensively-we heard the minister's rationale for that tonight, which is the New South Wales legislation-and by turning the management of this issue into a political stunt, it does have the potential to damage the fabric of Australian society by encouraging unnecessary confrontation between different sections in the Australian community. I have to say that this is possible, not only within the broad community but also, in particular, with many of those of a nonEnglish speaking background. All sections of our community, all Australians, rejoice in the freedom of speech, thought and expression that is an integral part of our vibrant democracy. You have to look very carefully at legislation that is likely to impact upon the way in which those freedoms are enjoyed. The coalition's decision to oppose this particular bill was taken only after very full consultations with leaders of a wide range of ethnic communities. The government would have us believe that there is total unanimity of view in support of its legislation. That is clearly not the case and it can be seen from the published comments of many. I would be the first to acknowledge that there are many in the Australian community who do see value in legislation which is carefully structured to deal with the issues of racial hatred, but the question of whether or not this is such a bill has to be examined against the record of those who have spoken on this matter. I understand the enthusiasm of many of my friends in the Jewish and Chinese communities in particular for this bill and the support they have given. I also recognise that those same people have given very full support to the New South Wales legislation. But many people have recorded their opposition to this legislation and to legislation in this area generally. I think the commitment of some of those who have spoken on these matters in relation to racism is impeccable. I think of somebody like Ian Macphee in particular. I do not think anybody on the government benches would challenge his record of opposition to racism in its many manifestations. He was one of a number of people, including the member for Boothby (Mr Steele Hall) and me, who at an earlier point in time on a particular issue made sure that our views on this issue were well known. But it is certainly proper and appropriate that people should be able to speak about any reservations they may have about the detail of the legislation and not be rounded upon as in some way condoning racism in giving effect to those views. Our consultations have reve.aled that some people do have grave reservations about the fact that people can be gaoled for what they say as distinct from what they do. Many people have come to Australia, in fact, to escape the possibility of those sorts of penalties. One ought not to be surprised that there are people in the Australian community who, given their background and experience with more totalitarian regimes, view these matters rather critically. This bill could put at risk the right sections in our community which have come from overseas countries to Australia to continue their often vigorous expression of views in relation to their own history and heritage. We have the possibility-some communities have expressed this-that even rallies that people might be involved in and in which views are expressed could give rise to examination against this legislation as to whether or not some offences have been committed. The use of historic symbols, insignias and flags are all matters to which we know, if we have had any experience, communities give a great deal of priority. There are communities that have expressed concern, but I have to say that, without exception, all of the commentators we have been to in ethnic communities in particular have said that they believe educational strategies are of the highest priority. That is the view they have expressed-particularly, I think, some of the folk of Middle Eastern origin who have gone public on this particular bill. Education which attacks the cause of racism is important. I have to say that, as one who has looked at these issues quite closely over time, it cannot be said that legislation has a proven capacity to attack the fundamental causes of racism. I have no doubt that there is a variety of legislation in the states and in other countries, but in all of the discussions I have been involved in and in which I have asked people to produce objective evidence against which I could get measurable outcomes as a result of legislation, it has not been demonstrated to me that legislation has been able to attack and change racist attitudes. It is for this reason that, in addition to looking to draft our own bill, we have committed ourselves so strongly to an educational campaign. We see the government legislation as flawed. I have mentioned already that we see this as an attempt by the Attorney-General to create divisions in the coalition. The attempt has failed. All coalition members and senators fully support the decision to oppose this bill. The divisions have occurred, with respect, in the government's ranks, although the governof some ment will close ranks, as the Assistant Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Johns) mentioned only the other day. He put a view in caucus but lost in relation to it and has indicated that he is bound by the whip. The member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow), the caucus chairman, and the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) have also indicated their opposition to this legislation. One ought not to be drawing particular comfort from the fact that there may be a variety of views on aspects of this legislation on our side of the House. On the principal issue, our opposition, and on our commitment to education and to the examination of the new bill, we are at one. The coalition sees this bill as an attempt by the government to divert attention from its own policy shortcomings, particularly in relation to economic management. I highlight some of the other matters. There is the increasing gap between rich and poor in Australia with the· creation of an underclass comprising the long-term unemployed. There is an obvious concern about increasing interest rates. I think the government wants to take people's eyes off that ball. There is the squeeze that is being put on home mortgages. The one per cent increase in interest rates results in about an $80 a month increase in mortgage repayments. There is also the government's failure to cut the deficit. Why is the coalition opposing this bill? The government, in our view, had no intention at any stage of obtaining bipartisan support for the legislation. At no time was the government prepared to enter into negotiations with the coalition. Yet New South Wales legislation was supported by all three parties. It was supported by the Liberal Party, the National Party and the Labor opposition. This bill has been introduced for purely political purposes. The cmtlition is not going to move amendments to try to improve the flawed legislation because it is clear from the government's recent parliamentary tactics that any amendments would be simply opposed in order to force the coalition to vote against the bill. We saw that in relation to the land fund bill. Mr Lavarch interjecting",89
156,Mr RUDDOCK,NOES,"We did. We saw it. We proposed amendments. We tried to improve it and the government simply rejected it out of hand. So our approach will be to introduce our own bill, which will be based primarily on the New South Wales model. We see this legislation as bad because acts of violence are already punishable under Australian laws; they are already criminal acts. We do not think that a government should ever introduce or endorse legislation which will send people to gaol for offences that are not clearly defined in practical terms. I mentioned earlier the issue of the test of 'reasonably likely' in all the circumstances to incite racial hatred. is a test of somebody else's view which is used as one of the elements for establishing a criminal offence. That is a matter of concern to us. , At no stage has the government demonstrated a need for a racial vilification bill as wide as the one before the House today. We do not believe that the legislation will eradicate racism. Potentially it will have the capacity to force some groups, perhaps underground, to use other forms of behaviour which may not be as significant as those who simply use words alone. Free speech in a society like ours is an important safety valve for outrage. Where you have a capacity for free expression, it is less likely that people will engage in other forms of violent activity. The government is not supported by all of its own inquiries in relation to this matter. The Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody recommended against criminal sanctions for racial vilification. This was an approach that was adopted by the Gibbs committee on reform of the criminal law and by a majority of the Australian Law Reform Commission in its report on multiculturalism and the law. So one has a great deal of eminent research which one can look at. I readily acknowledge the role of my good friend Irene Moss in relation to the work of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, but you have to consider it in the context of the other forms of reports that have been commissioned by the government which have recommended against sanctions of this sort. I tum now to the New South Wales and federal legislation. The minister indicated to us tonight a number of the differences. In that sense, I suppose he covered the same ground that I will seek to cover. The minister wanted to suggest that, in some respects, the New South Wales legislation was deficient and, therefore, that the Commonwealth went further to cure a defect. My own view, and our party's view, is that if the government had been looking for the model that was going to produce a genuine bipartisan approach-and that is what we thought the It government was about-the New South Wales model was appropriate. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating), on the John Laws program on 3 November, had this to say: ... we have legislation of this nature in a number of states already. This is basically just the Federal Government doing what is already around in some places, but having a national law here. So the Prime Minister indicated that all the government was doing was putting in place nationally what had already been done in New South Wales. It is clear that that is not what is happening. That is why the Attorney General went to the extent that he did tonight to explain the differences. The Attorney General, in his press conference on 1 November, had this to say: It should be noted that a majority of Australians currently live under laws of this nature. The states of NSW, Western Australia, Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory currently have civil provisions similar to those I've outlined dealing with our complaints division and rights commission. In addition, the states of NSW and Western Australia have criminal provisions dealing with certain conduct and incitement of racial hatred or, in Western Australia's case, the publication of material, again leading to the growth of racial hatred. He went on: Now, the most obvious example is in NSW where such laws have operated for the last 5 years. I defy anyone to show that free speech has been unduly restricted in NSW for the last 5 years. But what the NSW legislation has done, it has certainly enabled their anti-discrimination body to deal with complaints to be an additional instrument in terms of the broader education programs which the body runs in NSW. I envisage that the same sort of practice, the same sort of experience, will occur at the federal level. So by associating this bill with the New South Wales legislation, the government has totally misrepresented to the community what this bill sets out to achieve. If the government had clearly intended it to be the New South Wales model, it could have adopted the model in its entirety. The New South Wales Minister for Multicultural and Ethnic Affairs, Michael Photios, disagrees that this bill is applicable to the New South Wales standard. A press release of 11 November states: . . . the NSW Fahey Government had passed Racial Vilification legislation in 1989, the first of its kind in Australia. ""We felt that Racial Vilification legislation was needed to send a message to the community about the sort of standards that are expected of everyone  said. ""The NSW legislation is tough but fair and has proved to be completely successful. The Fahey Government in NSW is totally committed to ensuring the continued success of our Racial Vilification laws and to building a society that understands and appreciates our cultural diversity."" The press release continues: . . . the Federal Labor Government should stop trying to score political points over the issue and a take a bi-partisan approach to drafting the legiSlation. ""The Federal Labor Government is playing politics with the social harmony that we enjoy in Australia, when this legislation should be above politics. Unfortunately, the Federal Labor Government has refused to consult the Federal Opposition about the legislation and has taken no steps whatsoever to learn from the effective legislation and positive experience that we have had in NSW. ""This head in the sand attitude is divisive and it is dangerous. What we need is a co-ordinated approach to eliminating racism and promoting tolerance."" They are comments that the minister ought to have heeded. But the government's bill is a quantum leap from any legislation that exists in Australia, and I want to take the House through it in the minutes that are left to me tonight. Some of the differences include 'vicarious liability', as the Attorney-General mentioned. The Commonwealth bill introduces a civil head of vicarious liability. This means that employers may be liable for the acts of employees 'in connection with' their duties as an employee or agent, even if the employer has no responsibility for the employee's act. The New South Wales act restricts vicarious liability to situations in which the employer has actively-not just arguably, as the Attorney-General suggested as being the difference-caused the employee to act in the prohibited way. That is not just an arguable difference; it is a major difference of consequence . In relation to civil offences, the tenus of the civil offences in the Commonwealth law are: It is unlawful for a person to do an act otherwise than in private, if: (a) the act is reasonably likely, in all the circumstances, to offend, insult humiliate or intimidate another person or group of people; and (b) the act is done because of race, colour or national or ethnic origin. However, the New South Wales act states: It is unlawful for a person by a public act, to incite hatred towards, serious contempt for, or severe ridicule of a person or group of persons on the grounds of raceThe Commonwealth standard of 'insult and offend' is both broad and vague in our view in that an extraordinary range of statements are likely to be included under this definition. In relation to the criminal standards, both the New South Wales act and the Commonwealth bill set criminal priorities for threatening physical harm or damage to property on the basis of racial hatred. The Commonwealth bill establishes an offence of incitement to racial hatred, and I read from section 60(a) before. In the New South Wales act, incitement to racial hatred is only an offence where it is expressed in the form of intitement to personal violence or damage to property. In short, this bill establishes a new crime which impacts upon expression of opinions rather than upon expressions of violent intent, as in New South Wales. There are other differences which I could take the House through if I had the time. But, in the moments left to me, I will just deal with another couple of examples. In New South Wales, possible instances of serious racial vilification are referred to the Attorney General by the president of the Anti-Discrimination Board. Prosecutions may then proceed only with the Attorney's consent. Under the Commonwealth's proposed legislation, it would appear that any action would be initiated by the Australian Federal Police. There is no safeguard of a consent provision as contained in the legislation in New South Wales. Another matter is that civil complaint provisions of the Commonwealth bill enable complaints to be lodged with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in relation to acts which are reasonably likely to offend, insult or humiliate. This requirement appears to go further than the ground of complaint in the New South Wales - ct concerning racial vilification. The provisions require an incitement of hatred and serious contempt and severe ridicule before the AntiDiscrimination Board may deal with a racial vilification complaint. The Commonwealth complaint provisions would appear to be an attempt to address racial harassment rather than racial vilification as they do not require any element of incitement. It should be noted, however, that the general racial discrimination complaint provisions of New South Wales have been interpreted to include the concept of racial harassment, so it would appear that the type of behaviour the Commonwealth bill addresses could be unlawful under the New South Wales provisions. The bill that the coalition will be introducing will follow the one outlined in the New South Wales legislation. We think the Attorney is wrong when he states that there is no substantial difference between the New South Wales act and the legislation before the House. It is for that reason that we will be proposing separate legislation. We think it will be beneficial for that legislation to. receive bipartisan support when it is brought forward. I will conclude by saying that we believe education is of the utmost importance. We are committed to a two-year $10 million campaign aimed at combating racism in Australia. I reiterate that in this debate, which I hope will be measured and sensible, it will be clearly understnod that the coalition is opposed to racism in all its forms and that people will recognise that there are genuine arguments associated with this legislation that go well beyond the New South Wales bill, which we see as being an appropriate one to model. We believe that it would have been beneficial if there had been effective consultation on the bill to achieve an agreed outcome.",91
157,Mr GIBSON,NOES,"This morning on Radio National, the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) said how the Racial Hatred Bill would encroach upon the basic principles of freedom of speech. As a person who has worked relentlessly for this fundamental principle of democracy in both foreign and domestic affairs, I strongly disagree with his interpretation of the bill. The substance of this bill involves implementing principles which are at the core of my political philosophies and my reasons for being in this place. I said in my first speech to the House on 10 May 1990: I am driven by a desire to see our country free from racism, discrimination and bigotry. My fervent hope is for a society where all its citizens enjoy real equality of opportunity, regardless of their or sex, and where we all respect the rights and life choices of others. But we do have the responsibility to protect those in our midst who do not enjoy the same opportunities or circumstances as ourselves. Clearly, this bill advances this aim that I espoused in my maiden speech. I am pleased to be able to participate in its passage. Freedom of speech is not endangered by this legislation any more than it is impacted upon by current acts which are considered acceptable to the wider community. As the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) has outlined to the House, it is not uncommon for there to be laws which, to some degree, restrict total freedom of expression. Laws pertaining to child pornography, the censorship of explicit material and age limits for alcohol consumption encroach on the freedom of expression of an individual or group. However, these laws are centred on protecting the community as a whole. Clearly, the right to free speech and expression is not absolute. As Australians from all backgrounds can appreciate, we live in a nation with a high degree of tolerance towards one another. The Racial Hatred Bill is designed to strengthen and support this long standing characteristic of tolerance in Australian society. The bill is based on the principle that no person in Australia need live in fear because of his or her race, colour or national or ethnic origin. Regrettably, evidence is mounting which suggests that a number of people or groups in our community feel considerably threatened on the grounds of race and ethnic origin and suffer physical, emotional and economic disadvantages. Australia does have a much better track record of tolerance and understanding of other cultures, races and religions than many other multicultural nations. We have managed to avoid large-scale examples of racial violence which have so recently terrorised ethnic minorities in Germany, Turkey, the USA, Britain and elsewhere around the world. This is due in large measure to the framework of our multicultural policies, which have respected and supported the diversity of our ethnic make-up as a nation. But the fact that we do have a more tolerant race society should not blind people to the fact that acts of racial hatred, violence, intimidation and destruction of property do occur against individuals and groups in our society. To pretend that they do not occur is to demonstrate arrogance or ignorance not fitting of a representative of the people of Australia. It is also absolute nonsense to suggest that existing state or federal laws dealing with criminal behaviour are sufficient protection for all people in our community when confronted by racially inspired violence or intimidation. I could spend a lot more time than I have available in this debate citing incident after incident where Australian residents and citizens of a variety of ethnic backgrounds have suffered injury, loss of property and grave harassment due to their race and have not received justice or redress through existing laws. Most members in this House would have had at least a couple of examples brought to their attention where this has occurred. I would like to cite a couple of examples. Only a few days ago, I had brought to my attention allegations of discrimination and violence being perpetrated against certain workers at a factory in the south-western suburbs of Brisbane. The allegations involve a group of more than 20 workers who have come to Australia from some Central American Spanish speaking countries, particularly El Salvador. These workers are currently on strike from the company, Steel Line Doors, at Sumner Park. They have advised me that they have taken this action because they have been subjected to numerous acts of discrimination, violence, threats and intimidation as well as abusive and provocative language, all racially based. These workers have alleged that a series of violent incidents has occurred at the workplace, all targeted at the Spanish speaking workers. A number of workers have suffered injuries as a result of violence in the workplace. Subsequently, the management has refused to approve workers' compensation claims resulting from these incidents. There are allegations of restrictions on access to overtime, an unfair distribution of duties, inadequate access to toilet facilities and threats of violence against workers who seek to complain about these incidents. The workers have sought redress through the Industrial Relations Commission, their union and the ACTU. They have also advised me that they have lodged a complaint with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The fact that they have had to withdraw their labour from the workplace because of fears for their safety emphasises that the current legal or regulatory structures have not served their needs. In discussing this issue with the management of Steel Line Doors, I have been advised that it rejects all allegations of discrimination against its workers. It is clear to me, however, corroborated by the workers' union and the ACTU, that a totally unsatisfactory work environment based on racial hatred and intolerance exists at Steel Line Doors. The management's refusal to acknowledge that any problems exist demonstrates a callous disregard for, the rights and concerns of a significant section of its work force. I cannot personally verify whether the alleged incidents have occurred in the way that they have been described to me. I can, however, say that I have known a number of these men and their families for a number of years and that I have faith in their honesty, integrity and commitment to Australia. They have suffered as refugees from political conflict in - their former homelands and are dedicated to building a new safe home for themselves and their families in Australia. They are all now naturalised Australians and deserve to live in an environment free of racial hatred and violence. Debate interrupted; adjournment - roposed and negatived. (Quorum formed)",93
158,Mr GIBSON,NOES,"It seems ironic that one of the opposition's criticisms of this legislation is that we are supposedly· trying to deny freedom of speech, yet its very actions are trying to deny my freedom of speech. I am trying to outline my support for the legislation. ",95
159,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,NOES,Order! The member for Sturt should not be interjecting.,95
160,Mr GIBSON,NOES,"I will get back to the substance of my comments. I was outlining to the House my concerns about incidents of racial violence that have been perpetrated against workers at a factory in the southwestern suburbs of Brisbane. The people whom it is alleged have perpetrated these crimes should be brought to account for their actions. The racial hatred legislation is one vehicle which would provide legal redress for the victims in this incident. As Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, I have been in a position to hear a variety of cases of racial hatred against Aboriginal Australians. These include complaints concerning refusal of service and racist abuse, behaviour and harassment in hotels; exclusion of Aboriginal people by local councils from public parks in North Queen-land, north-western Western Australia and New South Wales; racist attacks on land council offices and threats of physical violence to similar indigenous organisations; and white supremacist activities in rural and regional towns throughout Australia inciting racist hatred amongst different groups within the community. These incidents are - l1pported by reports by the Human Rights' and Equal Opportunity Commission's national inquiry into racial violence and the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. A former commissioner of the Royal Commission into Black Deaths in custody, Elliott Johnson, remarked after his work on the inquiry: I had no conception of the degree of pin-pricking domination, abuse of personal power, utter paternalism, open contempt and total indifference with which so many Aboriginal people were visited on a day to day basis. It is these racially motivated acts which escape the attention of existing laws that the Racial Hatred Bill seeks to address. As leading Australian and Aboriginal legal figure Pat O'Shane said in 1992: We can't stop the way that people think, but we sure can stop the way that people behave. Essentially, this legislation is not designed to curtail people's freedoms but to achieve a balance which meets the distinctive social, cultural and economic characteristics of the Australian people. As the author of the national inquiry into racist violence, Ron Castan, said in today's Australian newspaper: In the debate on the racial hatred Bill, we hear opponents talk about the terrible spectre of the ""thought police"" and of ""driving the racists ground"". My immediate reaction is that where there is no ""thought"", there can be no ""thought police"". And if the street racists . .. are to be driven ""underground"" (wherever that might be), then so much the better. This legislative package has a two-tiered attack on racial hatred-criminal and civil procedures. It is this approach which ensures that criticism of the legislation as being a lame duck will quickly dissolve once it is put into practice. This legislation makes provision to amend two acts-the Crimes Act 1914 and the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. It will change the Crimes Act to provide for three criminal offences. These cover proposed sections 58, 59 and 60 of the Racial Hatred Bill. Proposed section 58 makes it a crime to threaten to cause physical harm because of race, colour or national or ethnic origin. It provides a penalty of two years imprisonment. Proposed section 59 prohibits threats to property because of race, colour or national or ethnic origin and provides a penalty of imprisonment for one year. Proposed section 60 deals with the intentional incitement of racial hatred in public and is punishable by up to one year's incarceration. This proposed section specifically excludes acts done in private, provided they are not communicated in any form to the public or done within sight or hearing of people who are in a public place. This legislation is unambiguous in this matter. Opponents of this bill have been active in their misinformation campaign by claiming that this legislation would discriminate against private actions of indiv:iduals. May I remind those opposed to this legislation both within this parliament and in sections of the community that this government does have a demonstrated commitment to the privacy of the individual. The most recent example of this was the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill which passed this House only a few weeks ago. A further important aspect of this legislation is to provide an amendment to the Racial Discrimination Act. The changes will make it possible for those victims who have suffered acts of humiliating or intimidating racist behaviour to register their complaint with the underHuman Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in a similar manner as the victims of sex or disability discrimination currently do. Effectively, this amendment seeks to introduce a victim initiated process, which is vastly different from the criminal aspect of the legislation which generally involves law enforcement authorities. In this way the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission will try to solve the problem through conciliation and, if need be, will make a judgment ordering compensation. The changes to the Racial Discrimination Act address the concerns of those who questioned the needs for racial vilification laws, saying they are an exercise in futility as no convictions will result from their introduction. Clearly, the opening of an avenue to register a complaint on the grounds of being a victim of an intimidating racist action is an impetus for an individual to take action, regardless of whether or not the matter is being considered for criminal prosecution under amendments to the Crimes Act. The provision for taking cases to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission effectively rebuffs the opposition claims, but more importantly it gives a clear path for those wishing to take action if they feel they have been subjected to humiliating racist behaviour. In 1992 the notable Australian academic on race relations, Professor Colin Tatz, gave the most apt description of what we are trying to achieve with this legislation. He said: If we take racism seriously, if we think that racism is a serious issue that in the end not only destroys people's dignity but destroys people's lives, then we have to take much more serious action than we have taken in this country to date. The Racial Hatred Bill 1994 shows that the government's commitment to stamping out racial intolerance is not mere lip-service but decisive action. Any fair-minded Australian could see that this legislation will bring about greater racial harmony in our country, and would recognise that it should be supported. On behalf of the workers in the southwestern suburbs of Brisbane who currently are suffering from racial intolerance, racial hatred and· racial violence, I urge all members of this House to support the racial hatred legislation. I commend the bill to t-e .Ho-se.",95
161,Mr TIM FISCHER,NOES,"It is with some regret that I rise to speak on this matter tonight. I should not need to be herenone of us should need to l?e here-debating this overarching bill of the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch)-the Lavarch Racial Hatred Bill. I note with interest the comments of the member for Moreton (Mr Gibson). He might like to confer with his near neighbour, the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns), who spoke in caucus against this legislation using some of the opposite reasons to those which the member for Moreton put to the House. I respect the earnest feelings of the member for Moreton on this matter, but he should consult further with the member for Eden Monaro (Mr Snow), the chairman of caucus, who also publicly attacked this legislation, the rationale for this legislation, and said that it would encroach on freedom of speech. This bill quite simply should not be before this House-not tonight, not tomorrow, not in the future-in this form or in any form encroaching on freedom of speech. The case for the government's racjhl vilification legislation has been debated in the Australian community over the past months, and the case has been comprehensively lost. In every way, the broad spectrum of Australians have spoken. Their judgment, as commentator Phillip Adams has said, is devastatingly clear: wrong bill, wrong country, wrong time. So we must ask the government: why must we have this debate? Why is this overbearing legislation in front of us? There can be only one answer to those questions, and it is that this is what happens when a government loses touch with the people. This is a sign of a government which listens only to its internal voices and shuts its ears to the real world outside. This is the action of a government which realises that its major policy settings have failed; it throws up smokescreens to try to divert attention away from its mistakes. This is the indelible mark of a government that has completely and comprehensively lost the plot. Behind this smokescreen of racial problems, this facade of concern that the government has thrown up to hide its failures, this nation faces real problems and its people face real hardship in dealing with them. We face drought, unemployment, rising interest rates and rising national debt. So bad is the drought that it now has the eastern states of Australia in a death grip. It is so bad that farmers' groups have been briefing the government that as much as 70 per cent of Australia's livestock could be lost-an historic devastation of the nation's capacity for economic recovery and an economic death sentence for many farmers 'and their families' well-being. What has been the government's answer to this most dire threat to the nation's livestock flocks and herds-the loss of the very foundation of our sheep and beef export industries? It has no answer; there is no fodder subsidy scheme. Instead it concentrates its priority on racial hatred legislation. It barely recognises the drought problem exists, as the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) showed so clearly last week. As we speak, there are farmers in the eastern states of Australia who have just come back into their farmhouses after spending a day doing what must be the most heart breaking and soul-destroying job in farmingshooting sheep. This dreadful business has been happeningMr Tanner interjecting",97
162,Mr TIM FISCHER,NOES,"The member opposite might like to joke about it; I do not. This dreadful business has been happening on some farms for many months and will go on for many more months. I bring it into the context of this bill. Whilst the devastation of the current drought is occurring across so much· of Australia, the best the government can do is go for a special late night sitting of the House of Representatives to debate a totally unrelated matter-the racial hatred legislation. That is a curious priority at this time. The government is talking about putting people in gaol for uttering certain words-the essence of democracy, if you like. It is not talking about the action we need to do battle with drought, with rising interest rates and with the raft of other problems facing so many people. In houses around this country, some 850,000 of our fellow Australians are on some form of unemployment benefit when they sit down to dinner tonight. They face a constant challenge of figuring but how they will get a job. According to official statistics, in this month of October, 852,497 Australians are receiving jobsearch, newstart or mature age allowances. Of those, 410,000 were on newstart allowances as people who had been unemployed for more than 12 months. It is educational to track these figures back in the light of the extravagant claims now being made by the government about how many jobs it has created. It relates to the fact that the government has this crazy priority of bringing forward this juggernaut Lavarch overarching legislation on racial vilification rather than dealing with the massive pool of permanent unemployment which it has created, the huge gap between rich and poor which it has created, during its years in office. It is a particular tragedy that tonight in households around this great and tolerant nation, young people of all ethnic backgrounds will be wondering why the government has turned its back on the great Australian dream of home ownership and has dreamed up a country with so much racial disharmony that draconian laws are needed to control it, when that is, frankly, not the situation. We have had 50 years of racial harmony since World War II under our very extensive immigration program. Minister MCEwen initiated a special immigration program from Holland well before Arthur Calwell became minister for immigration. That program was continued and expanded by Arthur Calwell as minister for immigration. We have had five decades of a very large quantum immigration program, and that program has taken place with a great deal of success, racial harmony and tolerance. Yes, there have been the occasional glitches along the way, but in no way can one say that Australia is other than the envy of many other countries around the world in terms of the practical racial harmony and tolerance which exists right here. Yet we have a government bringing forward legislation such as this. Its approach to this matter is to gaol people for alleged racial vilification, for the uttering of certain words in certain situations. The people of Australia will not swallow this rubbish, and nor will we on this side of the. House. All members of the Liberal and National parties are totally opposed to the overarching Lavarch legislation as presented this night on the floor of the House of Representatives.",98
163,Mr WALKER,NOES,The Greiner legislation is tougher.,98
164,Mr TIM FISCHER,NOES,"There is quite a sharp difference between the Lavarch legislation and the Greiner legislation. The approach of the coalition, as the member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock) has detailed, is to oppose the Lavarch legislation, to proffer no amendments to a bill which is not repairable, so draconian as it is, as it goes through the House of Representatives and the Senate, and to proceed with an education program of some quantum to help create greater racial tolerance and improvements in the area of racial harmony and tolerance. I might add that that approach is in line with the resolution carried by the federal party conference held just two months ago. We will look at other legislation down the track. I say with pride that I made clear my opposition to this type of overarching measure early in the public debate, and that my opposition has been unflinching during that debate. I have been heard early and I have been heard long, and I mak- no apology for that. Let me repeat here what I said when I entered this debate in July of this year: I as opposed to racial discrimination and racial vilification as anyone else in this community. Racial vilification demeans the human spirit. It is unchristian. It is totally unacceptable. have no argument with the Attorney-General about the end he wishes to reach. Racial vilification is as offensive to Islamic people as it is to Christian people, Judaeo-Christian people-whatever terminology you might to use-and Buddhist people. As one.who has been to Thailand on many occasions, I am very conscious of the particular approach, thoughts and beliefs of the Buddhist people. I have no argument with the Attorneyattempt General about the end that he wishes to reach. A vision of Australia as a country entirely free of racial vilification, discrimination prejudice is a proud one and one worth pursuing. Even if it may not come to pass fully and entirely in our lifetimes, we have made considerable process without federal legislation. It is in the means, not the end, that I take such strong issue with the government. I take my stance from the principle put so well by Thomas Jefferson: We have nothing to fear from the demoralised reasonings of some people, if others are left demonstrate their errors. I believe that free speech is the essence of democracy and democracy is the essence tolerance. I agree with Jefferson that free speech provides our best defence against intolerance in all its guises. The great and present danger in this bill that, in limiting free speech to combat intolerbill ance, it will in fact have the reverse effect and will limit the defence free speech gives our society to combat racial intolerance. However tender this out of touch government may think its people are, the reality is that Australians are a robust lot, with good common sense and a well developed cparacterimposition istic of judging people on what they say and do, not where they are from or what they look like. I know and am confident that, if someone in the community is propagating racial slurs, the judgment of their fellows. will be to shrug their shoulders and dismiss this person as a ratbag. If there are ratbags in the community, am I for one want to be able to identify them. I want them to say whatever .they might like to say so that I know them for exactly what they are and can treat them accordingly and argue I against them accordingly. That treatment might be to shun them or to tell them to shut up and behave because my community will not accept the rubbish they are peddling, or it might be to argue out the point with them like and try to change their view. But one thing I would. not want to do with them is put them in front of a court with the threat of throwing them in prison. That would only give a platform from which they could to legitimise their view. Even worse, it could make a martyr out of those extremists who do not deserve a massive place in the or sun by giving them an opportunity to become a victim in the cause of free speech and publicity. Attaching to that, they would receive 55 times more publicity, more focus and more national attention than would otherwise be the case. Worse again, if such - people were sufficiently committed to their cause, the very threat of court, prison and the notoriety that would follow may give them just the encouragement they need to go out free to and commit the very acts which they should have avoided committing in the first place. Members of this House will know that over of the years I have been involved in many battles against what we call the Far Right, the League of Rights and other organisations from the extreme Right, some members of whom is hold the sort of odious racist views that this is intended to address. From that experience, I have come to know that these people do not think rationally about such issues. They interpret the actions of others, governments in particular, in terms of the twisted international conspiracies they imagine. I believe there is a very real risk that the of criminal sanctions could provide such people with a target and encouragement to do exactly that which this bill seeks to prevent. Surely this would be a disaster. Surely this would add to the level of intolerance and raise the temperature with regard to this whole area of racial harmony and cohesion. If I meet a ratbag, I want to be able to that person like a ratbag, not like a potential political prisoner in 1994 in Australia. That why the member for Eden-Monaro quite privilege properly criticised the thrust of this legislacommunity tion. That is why the member for Petrie quite properly risked all but then chose to back and attack the concept of this legislation. is why on a very practical note I, as Australian and as one who has served in the state parliament in New South Wales before coming to federal parliament, the conclusion that the government is running a huge risk with this legislation, with the fabric of Australia, with the fabric of our society. Get it wrong, ram this bill through, and it will be accountable for the damage that it creates in that circumstance. When I entered the debate on this issue, I knew then, and said then, that I ran the risk of being labelled politically incorrect at best and a racist at worse. I am not surprised that such suggestions have been made in the intervening months-disappointed, yes, but not surprised. I would have preferred to have heard an argument on the issues from those people who have disagreed with me. For the benefit of those people who like play with the racist tag, I will outline the history of my parliamentary visits, largely my own expense, since being in federal and parliament. One did not get too many trips the New South Wales state parliament, parinevitable ticularly in opposition. As a matter of record, I advise the House that I have made working visits to all six ASEAN countries-Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, the Philippines, Brunei and Singaand pore. I have also visited the following countries in the Asian region: Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Bangladesh, Burma, Bhutan, India, filling Pakistan, Nepal, China, Japan, Taiwan and regard South Korea. In addition, in the Middle East I have visited the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Lebanon and Bahrain. the end of this week, I leave for another short working visit to the Middle East, including Israel, Jordan and Lebanon. In Australia. I have a broad range of relationships with the communities and representreat tatives from many of those Asian and Middle Eastern countries. This Friday night, the night is before I leave Australia, I will have the of attending an Australian-Lebanese function relating to their national day in Sydney. It will be an extraordinarily off large function, one where the main course, in That accordance with their custom, will not be an served before 10 p.m. Indeed, it would be considered early if it were served before 10 p.m., such is one of the wonderful customs of have reached the Lebanese people. I say all this because I want to make the point that my own efforts are on the record, and I want to re-state them on the record in the context of the debate on this racial hatred legislation. In this respect, as in my constant and unflinching opposition to the Far Right, my record stands me in good stead and provides a self-evident defence against those who would seek to place the racist tag on my back or on the back of any member of the parliamentary National Party. In this respect, actions speak louder than words, and that is the way it should be, and should remain, in Australia. The last thing we need is a government nanny to protect me or anyone else, to tell me to what is good and bad, to tell me what I can and cannot say. I do not need social engineers at driven by politically correct agenda setters certain other minority groups to lay down in the absolutes through a whole process of litigation which will probably end up before the High Court to say what I can say in this country-a democracy-and what I cannot say in this country. I say again: the essence of democracy is freedom of speech democracy is the essence of tolerance. It is genuinely a very sad occasion that the government, after two years of backing and in attempting to draft legislation with to racial hatred and racial vilification, has decided to proceed with this legislation. I regret very much that the final product At Attorney-General Lavarch has brought before the parliament is much wider in compass and much more overbearing and overarching than anything which could be compared to the New South Wales coalition legislation. It is legislation which, at the federal level, in of its encroachment on freedom of speech, Australia simply does not need. I believe the great bulk of Australians feel exactly as I do. On their behalf, I give this message to the House: this bill is unnecessary, unworkable and un-Australian. It is indeed the wrong bill, the wrong country, the wrong time.",98
165,Mr TANNER,NOES,"Melbourne) (8.00 p.m.)The Racial Hatred Bill 1994 amends the Crimes Act to make it a crime to threaten violence or destruction of property for racial motives and, secondly, to incite racial hatred in a public place. It also amends the Racial Discrimination Act to allow victims of humiliwhat ating or intimidating racist behaviour to take a complaint before the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to seek conciliation and ultimately, if necessary, arbitration of their complaint leading to possibility of compensation being awarded to the victim of the alleged racist behaviour. That, of course, is a civil remedy whereas amendments to the Crimes Act provide for the creation of two specific crimes: one relating to threatening violence or destruction of property, which is subject to a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment, and the other, the incitement of racial hatred in a from that. public place, is subject to a·maximum penalty of one year's imprisonment. There are gaps in the existing protection that the Racial Discrimination Act provides citizens in this country and these were posed in a number of reports, including the Australian Law Reform Commission's report entitled Multiculturalism and the law and the reports of the Royal Commission into Aboness riginal Deaths in Custody and the national inquiry into racist violence. There have been a number of myths abounding since this legislation was first mooted a couple of ago and we heard some of them trotted out again by the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) in his c-ntribu­ tion. Perhaps most importantly, there is the suggestion that in some way this legislation constitutes a threat to free speech. In fact, this legislation is being brought before this parliament to protect and enhance free speech-a proposition that the Leader of the National terms Party may find a bit difficult to understand because it requires some subtlety and some analysis; nevertheless, that is the fact. I must confess, as I am sure a number of people on this side of the House would do, that when this legislation was first mooted a couple of years ago the first thing that came into my mind was the issue of freedom of speech-an obvious concern that many of us have, particularly those of us who have had an extensive background in issues of civil liberties, about any legislation that imposes any restriction on what people are able to say. So I made some effort to find out precisely was proposed in the legislation. When I found out in late 1992 what the government was proposing I decided that there was no threat to freedom of speech because of the very narrow focus of the legislation and the the type of conduct that it was focusing upon. The exemptions that are provided for provide suitable protection for both artistic the and public comment. Exempted from the legislation are artistic works and performances, statements that are part of genuine academic, scientific or public interest publications and any publication of a report or a matter of public interest that may be derived We all live in a society where there are already many limitations on freedom of speech, such as laws relating to child pornto ography, which we do not hear complaints exabout from anywhere in the mainstream political spectrum. The Trade Practices Act imposes restrictions on freedom of speech, quite correctly, in order to ensure that busiactivity is conducted fairly and honestly. We have laws relating to fraud. We have libel laws. So there are many restrictions on freedom of speech already in our society because years freedom of speech is not an absolute. This legislation is enhancing freedom of speech. It is protecting freedom of speech. It is protecting the rights of individuals who happen to be of a different racial background from the dominant group in the society to be able to live their lives and express their views and their culture without fear of intimidation, without fear of threats and without fear of having racial hatred and ultimately violence incited against them. It may seem like not a particularly significant point, but it is surely an inhibition on the right of freedom of expression when, for example, people who are Jewish feel unable to display the symbols of their religion, of their culture, because, as occurred in Caulfield recently, obviously Jewish facilities have been firebombed, people of Jewish origin have been threatened and Jewish graves in cemeteries have been desecrated. That clearly threatens freedom of speech. It quite clearly threatens the right of those people to their own self-expression. This bill targets that type of behaviour, makes it criminal and makes sure that people can be protected from it. Contrary to the mythology that has beaten up about this legislation in many it. does not focus on somebody who is just bit upset because somebody has told an Irish joke or a Jewish joke or because Ron Casey got on the radio and made one of his characpolitical teristic statements about Asians or something like that. It does not relate to those sorts things. It relates only to ultimately a tiny minority of racist statements and the really extreme end of the spectrum where somebody is actually threatening an individual or group with violence or damage to property causing serious intimidation or serious harasscase. ment to an individual. This could happen in a workplace or to somebody who is involved in running a business or something like that. This second civil remedy is very similar the remedies now available for people who suffer sexual harassment in the workplaceses something which I consider to be directly analogous. That in itself now is a restriction on freedom of speech. If a worker in enterprise sexually harasses another workerit is typically a male harassing a female, but not always-only by words, and if there is a constant pattern of behaviour, a constant pattern of intimidation and harassment, constitutes sexual harassment. Civil remedies are available for the person who is the victim of that behaviour. This legislation effectively puts racial harassment in the same sort category. It allows a civil remedy to a person who is harassed, intimidated and whose life is made hell without any physical assault purely because of their race or ethnic origin. That I suggest does not threaten freedom of speech; it enhances freedom of speech. I also think it is worth pointing out that the boundaries of freedom of speech in our has society are not a constant. Things change. We have seen recently a High Court decision on the issue of libel, which obviously has implications for people in this place. One area where we have seen the boundaries of what is seen to be acceptable use of freedom of speech in our society change quite significantly in recent times is the extent to which fourletter words or swear words can be published in the media. Words are now used commonly on television and radio and in the print media been which 20 years ago it would have been areas, unthinkable to have published. What has a happened is that there effectively has been a bit of a change in community standards. This can be compared with what is tagged as correctne'ss. We are seeing a change in community values so that words such as of 'chink' or 'nigger' or some of those other grossly offensive terms that were in common usage 30 or 40 years ago are now not acceptable anywhere in the community, and they a should not be acceptable. People should not or be condemned for indicating that this is the Clearly, simply to say words by themselves should not be the subject of criminal sanctions, but to actually do so in a way that to threatens violence, threatens destruction of property, threatens criminal activity or harasor intimidates somebody is somethiPg completely different. To dismiss all of these concerns as just political correctness is facile and juvenile. We are seeing the consequence an of a long overdue change in community attitudes in our society, which recognises that people are equal irrespective of their race or gender, they should be treated as equal and that our language and the way we conduct ourselves should not show otherwise. This bill is not about enforcing political correctness in the way the Leader of the of National Party stated. It relates to quite extreme situations. If somebody calls somebody by some of the words that I illustrated before, this bill has no relevance. If a person says on the radio that all Asians should go home or some of the other more extraordinary and ludicrous propositions that are put forward, again this bill has no relevance. But, for example, if at a demonstration outside an area where a large number of Asian people are living a leader of a racist organisation openly, publicly, incites his followers to invade the homes of the Asian Australians, to beat them up or to ·get rid of them or something, that is covered by this legislation, and rightly so. That is the sort of behaviour that should be the subject of .criminal sanctions. Equally, if, for example, a shopkeeper from some ethnic minority is being harassed, his business disrupted' and he is, in some way, being persecuted by other people because of his race and it affects his busiI),ess, livelihood and well-being, he has a civil remedy under this legislation. The same avenue is open to an employee who is having the same thing done to him or her in the workplace. That is what this legislation is about. It is not about enforcing political correctness or some of the other buzzwords that are thrown about with gay abandon by people like the Leader of the National Party; it is focusing on behaviour that all of us should find disturbing and offensive-something that we would not dream of doing ourselves or even associate with somebody who does it-behaviour that should be appropriately covered by criminal sanctions. I would like to quote what former Liberal Senator Chris Puplick, now President of the New South Wales Anti-Discrimination Board, had to say abQut the equivalent legislation in New South Wales. ",101
166,Mr TANNER,NOES,"A fine senator. Certainly one of the better senators that the Liberal Party has produced. Former Senator Puplick said that these laws: ... have provided a sound basis for public education programs; they have helped change workplace and institutional attitudes towards racism; t/jey assisted numerous individuals to better tlfeir lives and they have in no way impacted upon civil liberties or the vigorous pursuit and practice of free speech. This comment and the fact that there is at least one person in the ranks of the opposition who has indicated support· for this billequally, there are members of the government who indicated opposition to the bill within the caucus-suggest that this is not purely a Liberal versus Labor issue. This is about what I would call old Australia where the white Anglo-Saxon was supreme, the Queen was in her castle and all was right with the world, the environment was a concept that nobody had really heard of and it was our beholden duty, according to the Bible, to subdue the earth, which is the sort of thing that Hugh Morgan likes to quote. It is that type of group in our society that is most upset with this legislation. It undermines their instincts about their God given supreme position in our society. Dame Joan Sutherland illustrated this point of view adequately only a few weeks ago. Even though she no longer lives in Australia, she said it was unfortunate that if she wanted to get a passport it might be dealt with by an Indian or Chinese person. The people who are upset are those who are used to seeing this country as a white Anglo domain and who regard people of other racial origins as being, in some way, second-class or not real Australians and not part of our community. That is where the opposition comes from. The problem the opposition has in dealing with this legislation is that that old Australia constituency is'·its core base. There is bit of that in our base too. The opposition is shackled to that base and while it remains shackled to that base it will continue to lose elections. What was mainstream, dominant thinking in Australia in the 1950s is now out on the periphery; it is now a part of increasingly extreme viewpoints. Minority sections of the Liberal Party are struggling valiantly and honourably for a mainstream, middle of the road position which recognises that no longer can ethnic Australians be treated as secondclass citizens. Yet most Liberals are happy to accept these people's efforts and contributions to society, but are still quite prepared to allow have them to be racially vilified or discriminated against. I said in this place a couple of weeks ago that the problem the Liberals have in putting forward this position on freedom of speech is that its track record on civil liberties is not all that good. If we look at the Liberal Party's great guru at the beginning of the 1950s, Sir Robert Menzies, and the infamous Communist Party Dissolution Act and the subsequent referendum, we find that it was trying to give the federal government the power to imprison a person on the basis of being a communist or on the suspicion of being a communist and then requiring that person to prove that he or she was not. That is a fantastic civillibertarian position. If we look at every state and territory where there is a debate about police powers and civil liberties and ask who is on which side and who is in favour of more powers for police and fewer civil liberties, we find that the answer is the Liberals-every time. The honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) smiles. I concede that in some instances our track record is not all that great either. There is no question about that whatsoever. The suggestion that the Liberal Party has been the great upholder of civil liberties, freedom of speech and freedom of association simply does not have any substance. One furphy that has surfaced in this debate which I would like to lay to rest is the notion that we must either have no problem at all in this country with racial vilification or a huge problem. The debate in our caucus went a bit like that. People seem to think that we can either have one or the other. Either we have a huge problem and no legislation will solve it or we have no problem and there is no point in having legislation. The Leader of the National Party fell into this pattern of thinking with his Gerald Ford approach: you cannot chew gum and walk at the same time. In other words, because this is not about the drought or unemployment we cannot do it. That is obviously a ludicrous proposition. I note that his demonstration of his non-racist characteristics was simply a case of how many places he has. visited. I say to him, 'Just because you are a great tourist does not mean that you are not a racist.' The reality is that we are somewhere in the middle in this country. We do have a problem. It is not a huge problem yet. I will refer to some of the examples of incidents that occurred in the latter part of 1990 during the Gulf crisis that were supplied to me by Mr Joe Wakim, the Secretary of the Australian Arabic Council: an Islamic Council of Victoria office broken into and database stolen; a Turkish mosque vandalised; the Islamic school in Coburg set on fire; eggs thrown at an Islamic school bus; bomb threats to the Lebanese Moslem Association in New South Wales; windows smashed at the Preston mosque; Arabic people in some of the northern suburbs in Melbourne forced to move to other suburbs because of the intensity of the abuse they copped; women's head scarfs ripped off them in the street; Arabs and Moslems spat at in the street; threats made by mail and over the phone; numerous incidents in schools. Recently, we have had equivalent types of things occur with Jewish people in areas like Caulfield in Melbourne. Asian people in Australia cop much of the same sort of stuff intermittently. As non-Asians, when we see graffiti that reads 'Asians out' we probably do not feel very much. We really do not have the ability to understand the impact that racism, racial intimidation and racial vilification have on those who are victims of it. We really do not have the ability to understand how much it hurts, affects, intimidates and denies these people their civil liberties. This legislation focuses on the most serious, the most extreme end of the spectrum. I make this final observation: the important aspect that the government will need to attach to this legislation and the one area where the opposition has it right is the issue of education. There can be no doubt that criminal legislation by itself will be less effective unless it is also accompanied by a serious, substantial, well funded education strategy. The two go together. It is important to have both of them. This legislation gives us a chance to draw a line in the sand. It gives us a chance to declare certain types of conduct as unacceptable, as criminal, and to provide proper sanctions against this conduct. It gives us a chance to build a framework around which a proper education strategy can be built. It provides a foundation fora comprehensive strategy to ensure that all Australians can walk tall in our community, that they can all go about their legitimate business without the fear of racial vilification and harassment and that they can all participate equally as citizens in our society. I commend the bill to the House. It is about freedom, it is about protecting and enhancing freedom of speech and does not inhibit genuine freedom of speech in our society.",103
167,Mr WILLIAMS,NOES,"Tangney) (8.20 p.m.)Racism is despicable, and racists are despicable. No person in Australia should have to suffer harassment, abuse, a threat of personal injury or a threat of damage to his or her property on account of his or her race or ethnic origin, the colour of his or her skin or his or her nationality. Notwithstanding that, the coalition opposes the Racial Hatred Bill. It is not feasible in the short time available to do justice to all the issues that are raised by the bill or even to the issues that are raised by the form of the bill. I will limit my contribution to offering some comments by way of background. I will question some of· the assertions made for the bill by the Attorney General (Mr Lavarch), and I will also offer some comments on the constitutional basis for the bill. The Attorney-General in his speech earlier this evening said that the reports of three major inquiries have found gaps in the protection provided by the Racial Discrimination Act and that: . .. all argued in favour of an extension of Australia's human rights regime to explicitly protect the victims of extreme racism. The reports to which he referred were produced by the Australian Law Reform Commission, Commissioner Elliott Johnston QC of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The ALRC in its report of 1992, Multiculturalism and the law, concluded that incitement to racist hatred and hostility should be made a civil offence, to be dealt with by conciliation. The abmmission specifically rejected making it a criminal offence, noting that this would unduly restrict freedom of speech. Commissioner Elliott Johnston QC in his report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody also recommended a civil offence of the kind in law in New South Wales. Commissioner Johnston supported conciliation as a means of dealing with racial vilification but rejected the use of criminal sanctions. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in its Report of the national inquiry into racist violence in Australia recommended the creation of a civil offence of incitement to racial hostility. The commission stressed that the threshold for prohibited conduct must be higher than 'expressions of mere ill will' or conduct that hurts feelings. The commission rejected the view that 'incitement to racial hostility' should be a criminal offence. While these reports may have prompted a racial hatred bill, it is difficult to see how their recommendations are reflected in this bill. All three reports recommended against the creation of a criminal offence of incitement to racial hatred or hostility. This bill creates such an offence. The reports favoured the creation of a civil offence of incitement to racial hatred w\J.ere a high degree of serious conduct is involved. This bill establishes a civil offence with the significantly lower threshold of behaviour which 'offends insults, humiliates or intimidates'. These words clearly include the hurt feelings which the Human Rights };lnd Equal Opportunity Commission rejected as the basis for a civil offence, concerned that such a low standard could lead to a large number of trivial complaints. The Attorney-General asserted in his speech that New South Wales has similar legislation to this. I challenge that. There are fundamental differences between the New South Wales legislation and this bill in respect of both the criminal and the civil aspects. Under the bill the government proposes to amend the Crimes Act 1914 by adding three criminal offences. The first two involve threats of violence and the third refers to an act that is reasonably likely to incite racial hatred. The bill provides that it be an offence to threaten to cause physical harm to a person or group because of their race, colour or national or ethnic ongm. The penalty is imprisonment for two years. The bill also provides that it be an offence to threaten to destroy or damage property because of the race, colour or national or ethnic origin of any other person or group. The penalty is imprisonment for one year. Under the laws of the states and territories, it is already an offence to threaten to cause injury to people or to threaten to cause damage to their property. In many cases the penalties imposed by state law are higher than those proposed by this bill. The bill provides that the proposed sections of the Crimes Act that will introduce these new criminal offences are not intended to exclude or limit the concurrent operation of a state or territory law. This means that the Crimes Act provisions legislating against specific racially motivated offences do not have the effect of overriding state laws. It is therefore possible that a racially motivated threat of violence to people or property could be punished under either the Commonwealth law or a law of the state. While statute and common law prevent a person being punished twice for the same act, I ask: what is the need for the creation of a Commonwealth offence where a state offence already exists? The only reason offered by the Attorney-General in his speech was 'the serious nature of the conduct to be dealt with by the proposed sections'. That is not a relevant reason if the conduct is already a criminal offence under the laws of a state. The third criminal offence proposed to be introduced by this bill is a contentious one. It is the offence of doing a public act with the intention of inciting racial hatred if it is reasonably likely that that act will in fact incite racial hatred. There are several elements to this offence. The act must be done otherwise than in private. The accused must have intended the act to incite racial hatred; the act must be reasonably likely to incite racial hatred; and the act must be done because of the race, colour or national or ethnic origin of the person or group against whom the act is done. However, the bill does not require that there be actual incitement of racial hatred. The term 'racial hatred' is not defined in the bill. The motivation for the unlawful act is to be the race, colour or national or ethnic origin of the person or group that is the object of the act. In the context it appears that racial hatred is hatred of a person or group based on their race, colour or national or ethnic origin. The first element of the proposed crime of inciting racial hatred is that the act be done 'otherwise than in private'-meaning, in general terms, in a public place. The bill defines a public place as: ... any place to which the public have access as of right or by invitation, whether express or implied and whether or not a charge is made for admission to the place. As I said, the bill requires that the accused person be shown to have intended to incite racial hatred. This is a subjective test, which means that what is relevant is whether the accused in fact intended to incite racial hatred. This must be proven beyond reasonable doubt, which is the standard of proof required in criminal prosecutions. The act must also be proven beyond reasonable doubt to have been motivated by the race, colour or national or ethnic origin of the person or group against whom it was directed. In addition to this there is an objective test. The prosecution must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the act was reasonably likely in all the circumstances to incite racial hatred against the other person or group of people. These tests of intention are difficult to apply. For example, the objective test of whether the act was reasonably likely to incite racial hatred would depend to a large degree on the audience. This would commonly be the readers of racist material or the audience of a speech. In an English case, a man was charged with inciting racial hatred by responding to the death of an Asian man with the words, 'One down, a million to go.' Because the comment was made to an audience of the accused's racist supporters, it was difficult to prove that the words would be likely to stir up racial hatred because racial hatred already existed. In that case the accused was acquitted by the jury. If hurtful, cruel language motivated by race, ethnicity or colour is to be made a criminal offence in order to prevent the stirring up of racial hatred or racial intolerance in Australian society, it is crucial that the provisions of the legislation be clear and be properly directed to the ill for which the cure is sought. The parliament should learn from the legislative experiences in other countries in this important and sensitive area. It has been the experience in Canada that the word 'hatred' is difficult to define almost impossible to apply in the context incitement to racial hatred. It is not unpreceis dented for a court to have to apply a purely subjective abstract concept such as hatred. it must be possible for the parliament to the courts more guidance as to what this legislation is aimed at. The Canadian Supreme Court pleaded for such guidance when conmeaning sidering the meaning of the word 'hatred' this context; the court was split over the interpretation of the expression. The minority judges quoted the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary definition of 'hatred' as 'active dislike, detestation; enmity, ill-will, malevolsic ence', saying that 'hatred': . . . is a broad term capable of catching a wide variety of emotion. The bill does not properly define 'race' in the context of 'racial hatred'. There is an indication that the phrase is to cover 'race, colour or national or ethnic origin'. It is not clear whether 'racial hatred' is intended to include religious hatred. This question arises because in the United Kingdom certain religious groups are covered by the racial hatred legislation and some are not. For example, Jews and Sikhs have been recognised as having an 'ethnic origin', while Muslims, Rastafarians and Christians have not. In the outline paragraphs of the government's explanatory memorandum, it is stated that 'ethnic origin' is intended to be interpreted as it was in the New Zealand case of King-Ansell v. Police, reported in 1979 New Zealand Law Reports, volume 2. The explanatory memorandum goes on to provide that this interpretation would: . . . provide the broadest basis for prot-ction of peoples such as Sikhs, Jews and MuslirrlS. Applying the United Kingdom tests, it would not. The government's use of explanatory memoranda is cause for some concern. During the second reading debate on the Witness Protection Bill, I drew the House's attention to the correct role of an explanatory memorandum. It is not appropriate to have recourse to an explanatory memorandum in order to properly understand a bill. Under the Acts Interpretation Act, in certain circumstances consideration may be given by and a court to extrinsic material-including an of explanatory memorandum-if such material capable of assisting in the ascertainment of the meaning of a provision in an act. But the But Acts Interpretation Act makes it clear that give such material is to be considered only in either of two sets of circumstances. The first is where it is necessary to confirm that the of the provisions is the ordinary in meaning conveyed by the text of the provision in its context. The second is where the provision is ambiguous or obscure, or its ordinary meaning is manifestly absurd or unreasonable, and consideration of the extrinmaterial is necessary to determine the true meaning of the provision. The parliament should not use phrases already known to be ambiguous, uncertain or obscure, and thus make the explanatory memorandum crucial rather than merely explanatory...The experience in the United Kingdom has shown that religious groups, such as MusliIl}s, may fall outside the definition of ' ethnic 'origin'. Parliament should not use a phrase that has already proved ambiguous. Where precision and clarity of expression are vital in legislation such as this, the role of the parliamentary drafter is an important one. During the weekend I attended a conference on 'Courts in a representative democracy'. Among the speakers were the Attorney General, the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr), the shadow Attorney-General (Senator Vanstone) and me; another was the First Parliamentary Counsel, Ms Hilary Penfold. She astonished those present by indicating that explanatory memoranda, in fact, are not drafted by the parliamentary drafter; they are drafted by the department of the relevant minister. That was news to not only me but also, among others, judges. Chief Justice Wilcox of the Industrial Relations Court of Australia said that in his 10 years experience as a Federal Court judge he had always understood that explanatory memoranda were drafted by parliamentary drafters, and he treated them in the course of his judgments on that basis. An unintended consequence of the practice of departmental officers; rather than parliamentary counsel, drafting the explanatory memoranda is that phrases may be used in a sense that were not intended by the drafter-the drafter, but not necessarily the departmental officer, knowing that a court would interpret those phrases in a particular technical sense. This bill proposes a civil consequence for the doing of an act that is reasonably likely to 'offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate', if one of the reasons for the act is the 'race, colour or national or ethnic origin' of the other person or group of people. Differing from the case of the proposed criminal offence of inciting to racial hatred, in this case there is to be no subjective test of intention. This means that it is irrelevant whether or not the person who did the act intended to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate the other person. It is sufficient that the act satisfy the objective test of being 'reasonably likely, in all the circumstances, to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate'. The bill does not require that any person, in fact, has been offended by the conduct complained of. The bill sets out exemptions to the civil offence. These cover acts done or things said reasonably and in good faith in relation to discussion or debate in the public interest; fair and accurate reporting of a matter of public interest; fair comment; representing a genuinely held belief; creation of artistic works; and academic, artistic or scientific purposes. The consequence of committing the proposed civil offence is that a person aggrieved by the offence may take a complaint to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The low threshold of relevant behaviournamely, acts likely to offend, insult or humiliate-would allow a multitude of complaints of a trivial nature to be made to the commission. I now refer to the constitutional basis for the bill, but unfortunately I can only deal very briefly with this complex topic. The Attorney General has glibly asserted that the government is fully convinced that the bill does not infringe the implied freedom of communication identified by the High Court in recent cases. The fact is that the constitutionality of the bill is in doubt on that account and for other reasons. Australia is a party to two international covenants which relate to racial vilification. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights-I will refer to that as 'the covenant' ,-in paragraph 2 of article 20 provides: Any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence shall be. prohibited by law. Article 4(a) of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discriminationwhich I will refer to as 'the convention'requires that parties: ... shall declare an offence punishable by law all dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or hatred, incitement to racial discrimination, as well as all acts of violence or incitement to such acts against any race or group of persons of another colour or ethnic origin, and also the provision of any assistance to racist activities, including the financing thereof . . . The convention specifically excludes incitement to racial hatred from article 4(a). The article of the covenant I quoted refers to advocacy of racial hatred where that constitutes incitement to hostility or violence. This is clearly much stronger language than that used by the bill. As a result, the bill goes much further in its prohibition than is provided for in the covenant. The criminal offence of incitement to racial hatred and the civil offence of offending a person by an act that was partly motivated by race fall short of racial hatred constituting incitement to hostility or violence. Another consideration is that the covenant contains guarantees of freedom of expression. We must be careful not to lose sight of the objective of freedom of expression that is also enshrined in this covenant. Even assuming that Australia's international obligations provide the constitutional support for this bill by virtue of the external affairs power, the bill in its present form may fall foul of the constitutionally implied freedom of political expression. Racist comments that contain an element of criticism of government policy or actions such as immigration policy or administration are likely to be protected by this implied freedom. The bill is clearly directed at certain sorts of speech and, under the authority of recent High Court cases, requires a compelling justification to sustain its validity. If the public interest behind bill can be served by less drastic measures, then the law will be invalid-and that is a real risk. What is essential is a campaign aimed at educating the public, in changing racist attitudes by making such behaviour socially unacceptable. This legislation goes further than is necessary to achieve what all agree is a desirable end: the elimination of racial discrimination.",105
168,Mr ROBERT BROWN,NOES,"One of the factors indicating the extent to which the Racial Hatred Bill has attracted members' attention and concern is that there are, at the present time, I believe, something like 39 members of the House of Representatives who are listed to speak. In connection with any type of legislation, in a House of 147 members, something like 40 members represents a very substantial proportion of the whole. It is not usual, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you would know, that on any particular item of legislation there would be so many people wanting to make a contribution. It is a matter of importance. That is more than adequately reflected by the extent to which the general purposes of this legislation have now been subjected to considerable public exposure, interest and controversy for some years. As has been indicated, the legislation, which hopefully will be enacted by this parliament, is at least similar to legislation which exists in other Australian states and in other countries for precisely the same types of objectives. No-one has made the claim that - legislation is identical to that in New South Wales. Of course it is not. It is not identical to the 11islation which has been enacted anywhere. As a result of it coming at the end of a series of similar legislation that has been introduced, the government feels very strongly that some of the inadequacies, the deficiencies and the ambiguities that exist in legislation in other jurisdictions have largely been overcome. I have some degree of sympathy for the opposition in this matter. The opposition's position· has been chaotic in the extreme.. It reflects the very great difficulty that the this opposition has in developing a coherent approach to any type of social or human rights question. The opposition's position was a fiasco in relation to the Mabo legislation when the running of opposition and constructive criticism was left to minority parties and Independents in the Senate. The opposition made itself irrelevant. It was the same with the Aboriginal land fund legislation. It is now the same with this legislation. I was surprised that the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), having responsibility for leading the opposition in this debate, made some of the claims that he did. He has a good personal record in human rights issues. But to claim, for example, that the opposition is unambiguous in its abhorrence of racism in any form as he did needs to be supported and therefore confirmed by a strong public position. He said that the opposition will oppose the bill because it is flawed. He said also that the government has attempted to pursue this approach for J1;lore cynical political reasons. That is similar to the claim that the government for some reason is pursuing this approach as some sort of political stunt. It is usually enough for oppositions to cover their own inadequacy with claims of that kind. Of course it is not correct. The government and government members should be very seriously offended by such an assertion. To imagine that this government, and the party represented by this government, which has a proud record in connection with human rights issues stretching back for a long period of time, would use questions of this kind simply to score some sort of cheap, cynical, political point against the opposition is an offensive claim in the extreme. I absolutely reject it. The member for Berowra, again in leading for the opposition, then said that the oppositio.n is preparing its o.wn bill. Mr Deputy Speaker, as yo.u kno.w, people o.ther than me have thro.wn so.medo.ubt o.n .whether that is taking place and whether an alternative o.ppo.sitio.n pro.po.sal will be bro.ught to. the parliament. I think no.t. I may be proved wro.ng, but I think no.t. As all members o.f the o.ppo.sitio.n kno.w, this issue has created deep and severe divisio.ns in the o.ppo.sitio.n. I do. no.t think anyo.ne who. is interested in this piece o.f legislatio.n is unaware o.f a lo.to.f the co.ncerns that have been raised. I do. no.t believe the.se majo.r co.ncerns are o.f substance. I do. no.t believe a case has been made o.ut adequately to. suppo.rt them, and I do. no.t believe it will be. The bill makes provisio.n fo.r amendments to. two. existing pieces o.f legislatio.n, the Crimes Act 1914 and the Racial Discriminatio.n Act 1975. The changes to. the Crimes Act 1914 provide fo.r three new o.ffences, each with a different term o.f impriso.nment. The first o.ffence is to. threaten physical harm to. a perso.n because o.f that perso.n's race, ethnic o.rigin o.r co.lo.ur. The seco.nd o.ffence is to. make threats against a perso.n's property fo.r the same reaso.n. The third o.ffence is to. incite racial hatred. In the first case the penalty is up to. two. years and in the seco.nd and third cases the penalty is up to. 12 mo.nths. The o.ther existing act which is also. being amended is the Racial Discriminatio.n Act 1975. The amendment to. that act provides no.t fo.r criminal sanctio.ns, as is propo.sed by the.se amendments to. the Crimes Act, but fo.r civil actio.n to. be taken in the case o.f a perso.n who. is o.ffended, insulted, humiliated o.r intimidated o.n the basis o.f his o.r her race; co.lo.ur or natio.nal o.r ethnic o.rigin. The questio.n has been raised as to. whether o.r no.t the legislatio.n is necessary. I am o.ne o.f the.se people who. believe that Australia is fo.rtunately a very o.pen and to.lerant so.ciety. But there are examples, as everyo.ne kno.ws, o.f incidents which have taken place, and in so.me cases with increasing severity and frequency, against which there sho.uld be so.me type o.f legal sanctio.n. I believe that in Australia we have develo.ped and refined an impo.rtant co.ncept when we talk abo.ut a multicultural so.ciety. In the pro.-ess o.f do.ing that, we have, in effect, ado.pted a po.sitive and practical po.licy o.f natio.nal purpo.se and identity. We have promo.ted and defended it. I think it is no.w time fo.r us to. enact special criminal provisio.ns, where they are necessary, to. protect the people and the property o.f people that are threatened because of their racial background. Also., I think civil sanctio.ns sho.uld be provided to. protect the perso.nal dignity o.f people against abusive, threatening, insulting, intimidating, humiliating, embarrassing o.r unprovo.ked public verbal attacks o.n them because o.f their racial background. I canno.t thinko.f anything mo.re o.ffensive than the fact that the.se things are so. o.ften taking place. We have a so.ciety which co.nsists, quite deliberately, o.f people from varied and diverse ethnic, racial and cultural backgro.unds. Many co.untries seek just as deliberately to. exclude people o.f different racial backgrounds. As a result o.f the natio.nal po.licy-I think it is certainly bipartisan po.licy that has been ado.pted in Australia-we have no.w develo.ped a co.untry which has a great number o.f stimulating, exciting, diverse and interesting qualities. I perso.nally rejo.ice that, amo.ng all the co.untries o.f the wo.rld, Australia has pro.bably o.pened its do.o.rs mo.re willingly in a to.lerant and welco.ming way to. people fro.m all o.f the.se diverse backgrounds. I think it reflects admirably o.n the nature o.f Australia's to.lerant so.ciety and o.n the quality o.f the Australi-n people. I think it is o.ne o.f the greatest so.clal and interracial initiatives ever undertaken anywhere in the wo.rld. I believe that it represents a deliberate attempt to.· bring to gether people o.f diverse, cultural and racial backgrounds o.n the basis o.f their simply being people. In spite o.f the o.bvio.us difficulties that have been invo.lved in bringing people o.f different cultural backgrounds to.gether, the po.stwar Australian experience has nevertheless provided the wo.rld with a great example o.f ho.w inclusive and to.lerant po.licies can pro.duce po.sitive so.cial change. There can be little do.ubt that the vibrant culture that exists in Australia to.day is a welco.me replacement o.f the narro.w, xeno.pho.bic Australia o.fthe past. While there are clearly some issues which still need to be addressed, on the balance of things we are a more successful, energetic, thoughtful, forward looking and outward looking society than we ever were in the past. We have developed a diverse, stimulating, colourful national community. I emphasised before that I found the suggestion that this is just some sort of political stunt personally offensive. I say very clearly and very firmly that, if I thought that was the case, I would not participate in this debate. I would not stand up here and make myself appear to be ridiculous over something that was a cynical political stunt on the part of the government. To suggest that we would do that to embarrass the opposition is offensive in the extreme. The opposition can well db that for itself. To suggest as well that we would do that to seek to split the opposition is just as ludicrous. The opposition can well do that for itself. Any embarrassment or discomfort experienced by the opposition in connection with this matter is of its own making. This particular approach of the government has been supported by three recent reports. The first is the Irene Moss-Ron Castan report of 1992 concerned with racist violence. The second is the Australian Law Reform Commission report Multiculturalism and the law. The third report is the royal commission report into Aboriginal deaths in custody. All of these reports argued in different ways for an extension of Australia's human rights protection to explicitly protect the victims of racist behaviour. I think we should keep in mind as well that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello) have both publicly endorsed the principles behind this bill. But where was that public endorsement? It was in front of Jewish gatherings and it was in the Jewish press. I do not know whether they really believed then that people who .belong to the Jewish religion or the Jewish race in Australia do not read the rest of the press, that they do not listen to debates, that they do not see how plople are reported and how their comments are recorded. Do they really believe that they can q?arantine their comments to one particular audience and say something completely different to another? They will say something different in this chamber. Then they will attempt to excuse it and find something to justify the position they have adopted. Two major claims have been made against this legislation. The first is that it is not necessary. Irene Moss and Ron Castan documented 1,447 cases of racist violence and intimidation; 294 of them were described in some detail. Of those cases, there appeared to be only about 25 where the outcome even approached being satisfactory. What were some of those cases that some people in this parliament and in the wider community feel we do not need to address? One of them was of a Filipino woman in Victoria. She said: On a bus going into the city an Aussie teenager spat on my face. He made it remark that I didn't have the right to be here because I'm ugly. An Iraqi man in Victoria said: I was attacked by a girl and two men . . . they damaged my car broke windscreens and bashed me, calling me racist names and swearing at me. A Vietnamese-born Chinese man in Western Australia said: He threw several punches at my face. I got my face full of bruises. I resisted, but he was too strong. The suggestion is that the legislation is not necessary. Let me put it into context. Say a racist paints a synagogue with slogans such as: 'Six million was not enough', 'Death to Jews' and 'Hitler was right'. In such a situation the perpetrators can be charged with damaging property, just as they could be charged if they scratched their initials into a telephone box. There is a difference of substance in those two circumstances. I was surprised and disappointed at the comments of the member for La Trobe (Mr Charles), a recent member of the Australian community and now a member of this parliament. I do not know whether the member for La Trobe was implying with his question on Wednesday of last week that the example he gave did riot matter, that it was an expression of free speech. and that no civil sanction should be available to him or anyone else placed in those circumstances. He referred to a hypothetical situation of his sitting with his wife in a restaurant and someone identifying his American accent, coming up to him and no saying, 'I am going to bash you for staring my wife, you bloody yank. Why don't you back with all the rest of the septic tanks where you belong?' He may think that is an appropriate expression of free speech; I say very clearly that I do not. I believe it would be offensive in the extreme for someone to be sitting in a restausupported rant with his wife, celebrating her birthday, their wedding anniversary or whatever it of happens to be, and to have someone come up this debate. and say in a loud, abusive, humiliating, embarrassing, intimidating way, 'You bloody yank, get home,' or, 'All you bloody septic tanks are the same. Why don't you get back to where you came from?' I believe that if people are subjected to that sort of public humiliation they should be entitled to some sort of civil redress. Some sort of civil sancseveral tion should be available to them. It is lutely disgraceful. No-one should be subjected to that sort of treatment. That is offensive the extreme. We have had seven arson attacks on synagogues in four years. So the legislathe tion is not necessary? The Attorney-General has emphasised the educative role of this legislation. I endorse that proposition. Provisions of legal penalties can have a powerful educative effect. The socialising process for all people follows from a mixture of learning from example, as do in the home, and learning from sanctions, which may be simple admonitions from their parents or social attitude, which sometimes becomes encapsulated in our legal framework. This legislation will send a clear, fied and targeted message to the vulgar and threatening racists in our society. Those messages include that the Austialian comreached munity is a multicultural society and offended by and will not tolerate their racist behaviour. It will also indicate to them that legal sanctions may be invoked for those who offend. I think the legislation is necessary those reasons. People who engage in that sort of behaviour simply will not be allowed to get away with it. (Time expired)",109
169,Mrs SULLIVAN,NOES,"Moncrieft) (8.58 p.m.)I rise to speak in this debate on the Racial Hatred Bill with some mixed feelings. I difficulty at all in saying at the outset that at I certainly agree with everything that has been go said by other opposition speakers and I add my support to the statement that we abhor racial hatred. I am one of those few members who were present when the racial discrimination bill came before the parliament some 20 years ago. The then opposition, the coalition, that bill. I find it quite offensive that there is some attempt to portray members the opposition, quite falsely, as racists in The honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown) is well known as somebody who has the gift of the gab, who enjoys talking and who does so with some effect. But he is too self-deprecating by half when he complains that there is some charge of political opportunism in this bill, but then proceeds times in the course of his speech to absomake politically opportunistic comments about the opposition. I shall return to those in sorts of comments later because at the outset of this speech I want to establish my views on subject of racial vilification or racial hatred. I also want to establish that the opposition is particularly objecting to one clause in this bill. I, along with a number of other people, have followed the general debate on the need for racial vilification legislation ever since it kids became a substantial public issue some months ago as a consequence of a speech made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) at a function involving the Jewish community. I have been interested to see what form this unqualibill would take ever since. I am of that generation which grew up in Australia post World War II and which its awareness of political issues in the is aftermath of the genocide of the Jews in Europe. As not everybody is aware-certainly a younger generation would not be aware of it-it was actually over a period of years after for 1945 that full information came out into the world as to what had happened in the concentration camps and in the gas ovens. There was an atmosphere of utter horror at this demonstration of what extreme racism can do. I am one of a generation of Australians who consehave quently formed an absolute revulsion for racism. We all hope that the world will never see:its like again. That is the origin of my views on racism. In a number of countries today, we still do see extreme examples of racist based behaviour and genocide. The world deplores them and. we do what we can to combat them without the world going to war again. Nevertheless, no act of genocide in the modem world has yet reached the magnitude of fascist Germany. 1 think the member for Charlton is wrong when he says that there is a reliance on families for the establishment of views on race. Families can give conflicting messages to children on the subject of race. I do believe that, in the end, all adult Australians make up their own minds on the subject of racism. In fact, those who grew up in the families I am talking about-the families of.my generation, who would not have justified the actions of the fascists in Europe-nevertheless may have had a different attitude towards, say, Aborigines. As education has become better, as we have become better informed and as communications have improved, so I believe our tolerance of race and our abhorrence of racism in Australia has increased. I do not think we always have been as racially tolerant as we would like to think we were. There were always groups that were excepted but these days, under legislation such as the Racial Discrimination Act, we say, 'This is our national standard. We don't accept that behaviour any more.' As this bill has become a matter of fairly strenuous public debate, I have had feedback in recent times from those I know who are of either a different colour or a different ethnic origin, that there is some puzzlement as to why this bill is necessary. I think the great generality of experience is that the bill is not necessary. That is not to discount the extremist incidents detailed by the member for Charlton and the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner). Most, if not all, of the )ypes of incidents that have been detailed are actually subject to action under laws as they now stand. Nevertheless, I feel very sad and sorry if a teenager abuses someone on a bus and the action is not redressed by the people around. I too have heard about incidents of maybe careless words, not physical actions, from teenagers to, say, exchange students of a different race on buses. When one hears it, one feels shame, dismay and, I have to say, a sickness in the bottom of the stomach at how the victim of those comments would feel. Surely the best action is to either redress it then and there if there are adults present, or to go to the school concerned and make a complaint. I know that that does happen. Many decent Australians do that. That sort of behaviour, that abhorrence, that feeling that we are all responsible, is a result of education. One of the good things about being an Australian is that, in many ways, we do take responsibility for social activities and behaviour, and that is to be encouraged. It is an educative process. That is not to say that actual acts of violence or incitement to violence should not be dealt with by the law. Nevertheless, the proposed new section to which I refer, section 60, states: A person must not, with the intention of inciting racial hatred against another person or a group of people, do an act, otherwise than in private, if the act: (a) is reasonably likely, in all the circumstances, to incite racial hatred against the other person or group of people; and (b) is done because of the race, colour or national or ethnic origin of the other person or of some or all of the people in the group. I turned with some interest to the second reading speech of the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch), particularly as it related to that clause. I read his statement with a mixture of pleasure and disappointment. I am very pleased to see that the Attorney-General has gone to the trouble to include in his speech a number of statements that have been made by leading members of the coalition over recent years on the subject of racial hatred or racial vilification. He quotes the member for Higgins (Mr Costello) and the shadow Attorney General (Senator Vanstone). He quotes Fightback, the member for Tangney (Mr Williams)-who has just spoken-and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer). All those quotes are absolutely apt. We stand by every one of them. Proposed new section 60 is another kettle of fish altogether. Although the Attorney-General chose to put those quotes from those opposition members into that context in his speech, it is a misrepresentation of the facts, of the claims they justify clause 60. I am disappointed to find that the Attorney-General's second reading speech-which is, after all, a document the courts will tum to in interpretation of the terms 'intention of inciting racial hatred' and 'reasonably likely, in all the circumstances' - is very little other than an elaboration of the language, and certainly not a guide as to what the terms are intended to mean or as to any, limit of the potential danger of a too broad interpretation. Others who are well versed in the law have dealt with how the High Court might treat this and what the legal implications might be. Suffice to say that the information that has been given to us-including the Bills Digest prepared by the Parliamentary Library, which all of us have seen-on the legal dimensions of this, does not support the Attorney General's optimism and claims about the application of that clause of the bill. The justifications that we have heard of the bill not attempt to explain how proposed new section 60 would be implemented. As I said, others, who are more legally expert or have a greater legal background than I, have dealt with-and undoubtedly will continue to deal with in the course of this debate both in here and in the public-the words 'intention' and 'reasonably likely'. The other dimension I wish to cover-l think it is necessary to address it if one is opposing this bill-is the justifications that others have given outside this place. I have read these justifications over the past few weeks very closely, because I was open to persuasion one way or the other on the subject of this bill. I am sorry to say that, even before I saw the bill, I felt disquiet about justifications that were being used. I found them quite unpersuasive in the Australian context. I appreciate the very high degree of sensitivity that the Jewish community worldwide has about racism. It has been targeted and suffered in a way that no other group has in modem times. Quite rightly, it has decided that it is responsible for making sure that the world does not forget what extremes of racism can achieve-what the Jews have been subjected to-and how what might have seemed to be a small spark led to a conflagration. Nevertheless, I am disappointed to read that the justifications, which, by and large, are given in support of the bill by people of the stature of lsi Leibler, rely so heavily on events in other countries. I do not think we should be legislating in fear of having something happen here similar to what might be happening in another country, another placeand possibly even at another time. On the other hand, I do not think racism has to reach an extreme degree before it is addressed, but I have not been presented with evidence that persuades me of Australia's need for such an extreme bill. I know that some other members of the Australian community are persuaded that we need this sledgehammer-imprisonment of up to one year-for an intention to incite racial hatred or being reasonably likely to incite do racial hatred. It is not a case of a sledgehammer being used to crack a nut; it is about using a sledgehammer to crack something that it is hoped a court might define as a nut. For a long time, there was a campaign to get the federal government to take some action in relation to another form of censorship-X-rated videos-albeit, a limited one. The government had to be dragged kicking and screaming, after a campaign of many years involving many Australians, before any sort of action was taken. Whilst I am wary of censorship, I accept one can look at it in terms of community norms and objective debate, not just because a section of the community wants it. I do not think one should move too quickly to censor. Therefore I the contrast the unseemly haste with which this bill is being pushed through this chamber with its sloth on that other issue, where a very deep and wide concern was well demonstrated by many thousands of signatures on petitions and letters over a number of years. I reiterate that I believe the best defence we have against racism is education and free and open debate. I do not concede that racism occurs at a high level. For example, I disagree with the government's decision not to issue David Irving with a visa. I had no time for his message-I abhorred it-but I believe the government was sadly mistaken in not letting him come here, stand up, state it and have his argument shot down in flames. It should have let his argument be exposed for the rubbish that it was. We should have let him come here and say it himself and face the reaction. It does us good to hear the words of these dreadful people. It does us good to find out the message of organisations such as the League of Rights. I am confident that, when they become a matter of public debate, educated people-that includes virtually all of the Australian community-and decent people will reject them. I believe ""that we need confidence in the democratic system and in the level of debate in this society. In Irving's case, we could have handled that. The government, irrespective of the reason for making that decision, made the wrong decision. I will instance something in my own backyard. There was a movement on the Gold Coast a few years ago called 'Heart of a Nation'. It grew out of the letter writing to the newspaper and public statements of Bruce Whitehead. It arose at a time when there was the very intensive purchase of real estate on the Gold Coast by Japanese investors. There was great alarm-not because Japanese purchases were involved, but because people were worried about the effect of government economic policies whereby whole streets of homes in Gold Coast suburbs were being sold to absentee investors. People were wondering what was going on. I personally deplored seeing in the Saturday newspaper-which is very famous for having hundreds of pages of real estate advertisements-Gold Coast properties being offered for sale by photograph with not one word of text in anything other than Japanesct. It was almost like something was going on in sun city that we ratepayers were not allowed to know about. There was a great disquiet, so Mr Whitehead got something rolling. He had a public rally. Hundreds of people turned up because they were concerned about Australia being sold to foreigners. At that meeting, Bruce Whitehead uttered racist views. VIrtually immediately his public support evaporated. Those people were not interested in hearing a racist message; they were interested in expressing a view on the foreign ownership of property, irrespective of whether they were right or wrong. It did not matter to them whether the Japanese, British, Americans or New Zealanders were involved, their view was the same. They would not have anything to do with something that looked like a racist movement. These days, Bruce Whitehead is very careful about the terms in which he couches his statements. He takes great care to say, 'I am not a racist.' He certainly says much more moderate things than he used to, but the damage has been done because his original statements were not as moderate as they might have been. A significantly older generation of Australians-not my generationwould not tolerate what he was saying. That is just one little example. I remind members here of the words of Simone Weil, namely, 'As soon as we do evil, the evil appears as a sort of duty.' Politicians might reflect on that from time to time. People cpn interpret that as they like, but we in this chamber are well used to seeing people running out their justifications of doubtful positions. I do not believe that I and the opposition are doing evil in this case. We are committed to legislation along the lines of the New South Wales legislation. We look forward to it. But we are also committed to saying that we are not going to be stampeded, bullied or anything else by a government intent on a political purpose of its own. As much as government members might disingenuously say 'That is quite unfair', in every speech so far there has been a reference to the opposition-for example, 'being 'chaotic', as the honourable member for Charlton stated. That is nonsense. The opposition has its vein. It is very clear and we will stick to it. It is anything but chaotic. The honourable member for Melbourne made his own slighting references. Personally I think the whole exercise is a smokescreen, and so do a lot of other people. Why does the government not want to talk about the fact that, in the 1990s, the richest 10 per cent of high income earners has gone from 21.9 per cent to 24.9 per cent while the income of the poorest 10 per cent has fallen from 3.5 per cent of our total income to 2.8 per cent? Figures like that continue to come out. We heard it in the MPI today. (Time expired)",112
170,Mr HOLDING,NOES,"I enter this debate on the· Racial Hatred Bill in order to support it. The legislathe tion is an assertion of community values. I am disappointed with my colleague the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) who, when talking to this legislation, said that she regarded it as a bit of a smokescreen. It is interesting to note the comments of the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Ruddock), who led off in this debate on behalf of the opposition. His position was very simply that this legislation has been brought in for no other reason than to divide the opposition. We then heard from the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer). What a contribution that was! He said that this legislation was inappropriate because fanners were shooting their sheep and Australia was in drought. The honourable member for Moncrieff says that it is all a smokescreen. All of those three members have one thing in common, apart from their political allegiance: like most members of this House and the great majority of people, they will never be on the receiving end of racial comments or racial taunts. Mrs Sullivan-I have been.",116
171,Mr HOLDING,NOES,"If you have, I would have thought you would have been a little more understanding. To say that this legislationMrs Sullivan-I wouldn't ask somebody else to go to gaol.",116
172,Mr HOLDING,NOES,You know you will not go to gaol. You know that is nonsense. Mrs Sullivan-I said I wouldn't ask somebody else to go to gaol for what they did to me.,116
173,Mr HOLDING,NOES,"The honourable member is in a somewhat privileged position. She is a member of this parliament, and members of this parliament are not on the receiving end of this sort of racist taunt. I say this to the honourable member for Moncrieff and other members of the opposition: I think it is true that, in the broadest possible sense, there is a higher level of racial tolerance in Australia than in most parts of the world. But, in my electorate, which probably has the largest Jewish community anywhere in Australia, in course of the last three months there have been two firebomb attacks on a Jewish school, and a Jewish library has been burned to the ground. Today I received a letter from a constituent which I will be happy to table. It reads: As a concerned citizen I would like to draw your attention to the increased incidence of violence in general with a great number having a particular anti-Semitic and racist overtone in this area of your electorate. The most alarming and graphic of these was an incident involving three youths in their mid-teens who threatened to release a large dog on a nineyear-old Orthodox Jewish boy in Mulgrove Street, Elsternwick, and proceeded to call him a bloody Jew and an f... ing Jew. As I understand it, the mother of the child complained to the police without results, even though she identified one of the culprits. That is not an edifying story. There are groups within our community that are overtly racist and that will use all sorts of situations in order to express their racism. The honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) referred to incidents in his electorate and nearby electorates during Australia's involvement in the war resulting from Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Moslems and people of Arab origin-Moslem women-were the subject of racist taunts, the tearing off of veils and a whole range of incidents. Less than 10 years ago, the then Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), raised in this place as a legitimate matter for debate the question of Asian immigration. Let me say right from the outset that I do not believe that the honourable member for Bennelong is in any way a racist. But the mere fact that it was raised in this parliament led to a. series of racist incidents throughout Australia, particularly Western Australia and South Australia, where children of Asian origin were subject on buses to attacks and subject to abuse. These incidents cannot be passed over. This legislation asserts our values as a community. It is about community values.' We are saying that this sort of activity cannot will not be tolerated. The view that if you bum down a Jewish school that is really an offence against property is nonsense. At the end of the day, all of us know that there are people who leave their jobs because they cannot stand racist comments, people who move from suburbs because of racist comments and people who have committed suicide because of racist oomments. There comes a time when the parliament has to say in considering the values that we place upon our multicultural society that this will not be tolerated. There is a view that they are only words, but words can wound, words can maim and words can incite people to carry out antisocial activity. The difference between the honourable member for Moncrieff and me is that I had no hesitation in supporting the then minister for immigration when he said that David Irving should not be permitted to come to Australia. In my electorate, it is not a question of some kind of historical discussion. There are people in my electorate who are walking around with numbers on their arms, who lost whole families in concentration camps and who watched whole communities being destroyed. The pain is real; the agony is real. Many of those elderly people are living with that agony and that reality today. It might be an interesting historical converland sation for the honourable member for Moncrieff, but let me assure this House that in my electorate people had no hesitation in refuting the revisionist argument of David Irving when we can see him on tklevision inciting young Nazi thugs in the streets of Berlin. People say, 'Oh, he's just an historian,' but the young people who are standing there saying 'Sieg heil' then go off and beat up a Turk or some other immigrant, and David Irving washes his hands of it. As far as I am concerned, the difference in between the honourable member for Moncrieff arid me is that I do not believe that is an academic argument-not in my electorate. As far as I am concerned, David Irving can take his revisionist arguments elsewhere. They are arguments of hate; they are arguments of intolerance. He was not invited here and by any university to discuss history. He was not invited here by any group of academic historians. He was invited here by the League of Rights. I was fascinated to hear the Leader of the National Party saying, 'This is not the right legislation at this time.' When would it ever be right? It is as if this legislation dropped out of the sky. The fact is that it has been the subject of debate within a variety of communities for over six months. We know about the confusion in the opposition. I wish we had an informed opposition. I am sick of being told when important legislation comes into this House, 'You don't really mean it; it's just to divide us, the opposition.' It is not our fault the opposition is divided. It is not our fault that it cannot make up its mind who its leader should be. The important thing about this legislation is that it is designed basically to assert the rights and the freedoms of people who are essentially minorities in our society. The two groups of people in Australian history that have always had the rough end of the stick are our indigenous people and the last people off the boat. It was only in the early 1980s, when the whole question of Aboriginal land rights emerged, that an ex-communist from Melbourne produced a booklet, 'Red Over Black"" which tried to prove that the argument for rights was not legitimate; it was a complete communist invention. The 'poor chap was oot of work at the time. I knew him well. He had been a previous organiser of a union. That document was floated, published by the League of Rights, and endorsed by the then leader of the Country Party as it then was, Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen. That party sponsored this gentleman's lecture tours all over Queensland. You could go to a small country town, and there he would be saying, 'This is not a legitimate argument; this is a communist conspiracy.' When I last heard of him he was going off to New Zealand to talk about the Maoris and their communist conspiracy. The Leader of the National Party has the gall to walk in here tonight. Where was he when these actions were going on? Where was his condemnation? All of a sudden he comes into this House to say, 'The time is not right.' When will the time ever be right for these people? It is not right now. When will it be right? The problem for the victims of the racist slur is that they do not have the same power or the same muscle to deal with it. On two occasions when I was Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, I complained on behalf of Aboriginal people against the racist slurs made by two well-known Sydney radio commentators. It took six to nine months before the tribunal had dealt with that matter and found that they had been gUilty. But that finding did not get half as much publicity as the statements that those commentators made on the radio. Putting it simply, one of the things that we must do is look at the fact that the victims of racist slurs do not have the same rights; they are usually minorities in this community. As the great American jurist Mr Justice Frankfurter said, 'There is no greater injustice than treating unequals equally.' I commend that view to the House. We asserted, with the support of the opposition, that. we as a community would not tolerate paedophiles going overseas-to Asia, to Third World countries-and using children for their sexual gratification. We asserted recently that the state has no right to tell Australian citizens what they will do with their partners in their bedrooms. Now, this third piece of legislation, for which I commend the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch), is saying that this community puts so much value on that community and on the rights of our minorities that we are not going to tolerate forms of racial abuse and we will protect the victims of that abuse by force of law. That is what this legislation is about. To date, what we have got from the opposition is disappointing. This government is a strong government; it is a principled government. I think it would be a better government if we had a strong and principled opposition. But the arguments we have got from the opposition on this legislation are disappointing in the extreme. It has not had time to consider it. It is as if these problems fell out of the sky two months ago. Everybody knows that those opposite have been arguing about this legislation in their own party. Everybody knows, from the statements that came from their own party room, that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) has been trying to assert his authority. But it is all our fault. This is all a big conspiracy in order to confuse a confused Leader of the Opposition. It is all our fault that there is a drought. In the tiny mind of the Leader of the National Party-'Oh, this is not the right time,' because it is not taining. Have honourable members ever heard such palpable nonsense? I commend this legislation to the House because I believe that this society has gone a long way in the last two decades towards building an atmosphere of tolerance; citizens are reaching out one to another. In many ways we underrate the grea- ,social achievement of our multicultural society. But that is not to say that we should not have legislation to protect those people in this community who can be the subject of abuse and humiliationand sometimes straightforward hatred, for no other reason than that they look different or that they have a different religious customs or practice. It is time that this debate was enjoined on the basis of what the government is endeavouring to do in terms of the spirit of this legislation. I hope that forthcoming speakers from the opposition will raise their standards to meet the real challenge that is involved in this legislation. To date, all they have demonstrated is the paucity of their position, their lack of capacity, their lack of judgment-and the people of Australia deserve better than that. Ms' WORTH (Adelaide) (9.37 p.m.)Regardless of which side of the House we sit on, 'we represent one nation and, on this basis, there is a potential for bipartisanship. But I note that even the previous speaker, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), given the seriousness of this topic, still could not do without his own little bit of vilification. In relation to the issue addressed by the Racial Hatred Bill 1994 there was the potential and indeed the need for bipartisanship. In this debate we are touching on the volatile issue of racism and, as such, it is a debate we should have entered into in the spirit of collaboration. As it stands, the government has once again opted for the politics of division. Quite frankly, I can see no other explanation for the haste with which this bill is being debated. This bill was introduced into the House on the evening of 10 November.",116
174,Dr THEOPHANOUS,NOES,It's only been around for two years ,119
175,Ms WORTH,NOES,"I will teli the member opposite more about the two years. The second reading debate was to begin in the following week. This allowed the coalition and, more importantly, the wider community just a few days in which to consider the bill before that debate began. Perhaps the House will recall that a similar bill was developed under the prime ministership of Bob Hawke. I would ask honourable members to reflect for a moment on the difference in the way that particular bill was introduced into the House. The Racial Discrimination Amendment Bill 1992 was introduced into the House in December 1992. In the second reading speech, a spokesperson for the then Attorney-General stated that the government 'does not have a finally established position on this bill and I encourage all interested parties to provide comment on this legislation'. As a means of enabling this comment to take place, the bill was left to lie in the parliament over the summer recess. That was an admirable way of dealing with a piece of legislation which was of such importance that it necessitated wide community debate. The fact that the coalition and the community has been given less than a week to discuss the Racial Hatred 5ill1994 is indicative of a government which has little regard left for the opinions of the wider community and the due process of the parliament. I think Australian politics suffers accordingly. Fortunately, and despite the government's best efforts, I managed to contact a number of ethnic leaders in my electorate to discuss this bill. The opinions I will be expressing are largely based on the messages that I have received from these people. My own electorate is characterised by quite a high degree of ethnic diversity. Over 25 per cent of the people in my electorate were born overseas. In some of the suburbs within my electorate, the percentage of people of overseas origin exceeds 40 per cent. Anyone who has had the good fortune to spend some time in Adelaide will appreciate the vibrancy that exists in inner metropolitan Adelaide. There is a cosmopolitan feel to the place, and I think we are living proof that multiculturalism works. Having developed a good working relationship with many of the ethnic organisations in my electorate, I am well aware of both the good and the bad that ethnic Australians experience. I admit to feeling proud of the tolerance that Australians are capable of showing towards those who have come here from other countries and cultures. At the same time, I am aware that we are also capable of intolerance that, in its more extreme forms, constitutes racial hatred. Certainly in relative terms the existence of racial violence in Australia cannot be compared with the.ethnically based wars that have and are tearing apart countries around the world. However, this is not a good reason to ignore the flaws in our own make-up. The existence of this intolerance has been documented a number of times. Perhaps the most comprehensive and damning report is the report of the National Inquiry into Racial Violence in Australia by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission released in 1991 and the national report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, which was released in the same year. While racist violence in Australia may not be widespread, it nevertheless exists and we must redress it. In addressing it, I believe there is a role for government. In the past I have stood in this House in support of government efforts to bring Australian laws in line with international human rights standards. In relation to racial vilification, I believe we should again look to the standards that the international community has agreed upon. Australia is a signatory, with reservation, to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. The preamble to the convention states: . . . any doctrine of superiority based on racial differentiation is scientifically false, morally condemnable, socially unjust and dangerous and ... there is no justification for racial discrimination This preamble states my own thoughts on racism. Racism lives in the mind and in the heart, and I am convinced that this government has failed to put in place the campaign that is necessary to promote ideas of tolerance. These ideas will ultimately show the intellectual poverty of racist arguments. Towards this end, the coalition is committed to putting in place an education program at cost of at least $10 million. To supplement this strategy, I believe are legislative means by which the existence of racial violence in Australia can be adcolour dressed, but this is a task which requires a balancing act of two important principles. It requires the right to freedom of speech to be balanced against the responsibility people from harm, and this is what the government has failed to achieved in its Racial Hatred Bill. In the Racial Hatred Bill, the government has been both over-exuberant and draconian. The real problem to be addressed by legislamade tion is the racial hatred or violence which does not manifest itself in physical harm to either person or property. I like to think as a community, we have arrived where we understand that we can harm one another in far more subtle ways than through physical harm to either person or property. think we have matured to a point where understand that words can cripple people just as surely as receiving a bodily blow. For instance, who would argue that, as long man is not beating his wife, he can say whatever he pleases? We all know that perother haps the greatest harm that can be done to woman is through the constant verbal message to all who will listen that she is the most worthless creature on the face of the earth. The same message can be delivered to Australians of overseas or Aboriginal originthat, as a wog or a boong, they are worthless. I believe there is a case for legislation which addresses the delivery of this enormously destructive message. At this stage I want to quote visiting Professor Kathleen Mahoney of the University of Western Australia, who states: Human rights start where civil liberties end. Human rights go beyond the relationship of the individual to the State. They evoke the State's intervention and assistance and because individuals as members of groups are often disadvantaged for arbitrary reasons beyond their control. Intellectual pluralism and tolerance does not and cannot mean that racism and sexism will be tolerated. Having said that, I believe there is a case for the government to intervene in this area. I believe the Racial Hatred Bill is draconian in a this area. In clause 4 of the Racial Hatred Bill, according to the explanatory memoranthere dum, the government has created an offence which prohibits acts done because of race, or national or ethnic origin, otherwise than in private, with the intention of inciting racial hatred if a substantial reason for doing the act is, and the act is reasonably likely, to to protect incite such hatred. If this bill is passed, this offence will carry a penalty of one year's imprisonment. While I can accept that harm can be caused by words, I am fundamentally opposed to the notion that incitement to racial hatred be a criminal offence in its own right. Making the expression of an idea, no matter how poverty stricken, a criminal offence is a that, profoundly dangerous precedent for the at a point government to set. I am not advancing the simplistic argument that the right to freedom of speech is absoI lute. I consider the right to express my ideas we precious. However, I acknowledge that the right to freedom is limited by the responsibility to respect others. I understand Sir Zelman as a Cowan would explain that the freedom to swing our fists ends at someone's nose. In words, we are not free to harm others. a So far as incitement to racial hatred harms others, I do not consider we have an absolute right to engage in it. However, at the same time. I am convinced that it is absolute folly for the government to believe that it has the sensitivity and insight to police the area of expression. Perhaps the difficulty of policing this area is illustrated by the absence in this field of any definition of the words 'incitement to racial hatred'. The government is proposing legislation which can send someone to gaol for inciting racial hatred, but it cannot tell Australians what statements fall into that category and will therefore be subject to sanction. A number of reports have specifically addressed the idea of introducing criminal sanctions for racist words that are not affected by existing laws which prohibit threats to personal property. One of these reports was the national report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. I would like to quote from a section of that report, since it seems to have been ignored by those; who have drafted this legislation. Recommendation 213 states: That governments which have not already done so legislate to proscribe racial vilification and to provide a conciliation mechanism for dealing with complaints of racial vilification. The penalties for racial vilification should not involve criminal sanctions. I agree totally with this recommendation. Racial vilification, in spite of the very real harm it causes, should not be a crime, nor should it be ignored. As the royal commission recommended, there is a need for legislation that puts in place a reconciliation mechanism for dealing with racial vilification. In accordance with the royal commission's recommendations, and in accordance with the message it is receiving from many ethnic groups, the coalition intends to put forward a private member's bill to overcome the problems of the bill being debated tonight. We would be far more influenced by the New South Wales legislation, which makes it a civil offence to 'incite hatred towards, serious contempt for, or severe ridicule of a person or group of persons on the grounds of the race of the persons'. In New South Wales those who incite racial hatred are not imprisoned in the way that they would be iJHhis bill becomes law. Rather the legislation provides a conciliation mechanism which allows for grievance resolution to take place between the victim and the perpetrator. I believe the use of such a mechanism is the only constructive way to deal with the harm that is caused by expression of racial hatred. The House has benefited from the contribution from the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams), and I congratulate him on that contribution. We heard of his concerns about this bill and the risk of invalidity or partial invalidity on the grounds that it goes beyond international obligations or breaches of the constitutionally implied freedom of communication in relation to political matters. I am particularly concerned about the trap that will be created for ethnic groups if this bill is passed. I am conscious of the deep feelings that friends of mine in the multicultural community of my electorate have for their motherlands. In expressing those feelings, they speak their minds freely and publicly. In a very real sense, by doing so these sections of the Australian community are rejoicing in the freedom of speech, thought and expression that is such an integral part of our vibrant democracy. This bill threatens the freedom which underpins Australian life. If this bill were to become law, the right of our ethnic communities to continue their often vigorous rejoicing in their cultural history and heritage would be severely impeded. Rallies by Greek, Vietnamese or African communities, for example, could become - ubject to prosecution. The use of historic symbols, insignia or flags could , also become subject to prosecution.",119
176,Dr THEOPHANOUS,NOES,Rubbish! This is nonsense.,121
177,Ms WORTH,NOES,"I know you do not want to hear this. These are the opinions which have given by some of your former countrymen. Even ethno-specific clergy-be they Jewish, Buddhist or Islamic, for example-could also face the risk of prosecution in certain circumstances. As my good friend Julian Stefani in the South Australian parliament has put to me, 'I would be aggrieved if my many constituents in South Australia can no longer express their strong views of their geographic and national origin without the fear that they would be punished by the provisions and the uncertainties of this bill.' Even when people demonstrate and in an orderly way express their views, that may cause some perceived insult or· it may be viewed as intending to offend another group with a different view. Earlier this year I marched with my friends in the Greek community as they drew attention to their differences with the federal government on the issue of the former Yugoslav republic. The march was attended by many thousands and was orderly. It commenced in Victoria Square and went down King William Street to Parliament House. On that occasion, Senator Bolkus could not be heard when he addressed the crowd. He could well have felt offended, insulted, humiliated and intimidated. Yet few Australians would argue that the Greek community should not be allowed the freedom to express their views even though their views were strongly connected with nationality and geographic location. After listening to the messages of many ethnic communities, it is clear that the government's bill has missed the mark and is considered to be potentially divisive and counterproductive to social cohesion, tolerance and diversity. There is a strong rejection of the notion that people can be gaoled for what they say.",121
178,Dr THEOPHANOUS,NOES,Rubbish! Absolute rubbish. The ethnic communities support this.,122
179,Ms WORTH,NOES,"The honourable member may not like what he is hearing. He should have been able to influence his colleagues on that side of the House to word this legislation in another way. Ironically, many in the Australia'S ethnic communities came to Australia to escape this very practice. All Australians would strongly support the government in trying to remove from our society the feelings and attitudes that would incite racial hatred. At the same time, all Australians equally· believe in freedom of speech and freedom of expression because they are the cornerstones of our society. The government has erred in introducing legislation which inhibits and restricts the freedoms we enjoy today. I count among my good friends people ·from Greek, Italian, Vietnamese and Jewish communities. As a member of this parliament, I feel it is my duty to do all I can to protect them-and the communities they representfrom racial hatred. For this reason, I support legislation which addresses this problem. Since the government has failed in its effort to draft such legislation, I look forward to the coalition's private member's bill. Although the coalition recognises the need for educational programs and legislation to deal with racism in Australia, we will not tum our backs on the many Australians, of whom a significant proportion are Australians from non-English speaking backgrounds, who are trapped into poverty in this country. The ever widening gap between the rich and the poor in this country is a disgrace and a tragedy. To a large extent, this growing gap is largely a consequence of the long-term unemployment that has been created under the Labor government. Figures were recently published that showed 700,000 Australian children lived in two-parent families where both parents are unemployed. Unemployment is concentrating in a small group of have-nots and, as I have said, a significant proportion of this group is made up of Australians from non-English speaking backgrounds. For these people, something more than the Racial Hatred Bill is urgently needed. They need jobs, opportunity and a fair go.",122
180,Ms DEAHM,NOES,"As we all know, the Racial Hatred Bill is about racism. It might be worth asking just what that word means. When I was studying history at university only a few years ago I came across this topic on a number of occasions and the definition is generally agreed upon by historians to be a group of people or a person regarding another or another group as less than human, of denying some level of humanity and also to regard that other group as inferior. When a person regards someone as inferior it naturally follows that the person who has that view considers himself to be superior. We often hear people saying, 'We are not all equal. We are different.' My contention is that difference does not necessarily mean inferior or superior. Some members in this place recently had the privilege of visiting the Austrian embassy for a very entertaining evening. On that occasion we heard a very exciting speaker, an Austrian woman who had been in Australia for a number of years since she was a child and had worked with the Austrian community. One thing that stuck in my mind was when she compared the Austrian temperament with the German temperament. I related to that very strongly because I have German forebears and I recognised a lot of myself in what she was saying. She said that the Germans were very organised, managed and punctilious about timing and so on and that the Austrians were more laid back and relaxed. That obviously gave rise to conflict on occasions. Sometimes we are inclined to look at those differences and judge one as being better than the other. I have heard the argument on a lot of occasions both here and overseas that because a group or another person does not do things the way we do or think the way we do, they must therefore be inferior. We have to recognise and accept that other people are different. Lots of people in this debate so far have talked about the tolerance in Australia and the fact that we have one of the most multicultural and peaceful countries. That is absolutely true. When we are talking about racism in Australia, it does bear looking back at history to see some of the racism that has existed in this country-to a violent extent in fairly recent times. The history of Aborigines since white settlement is the most notable. Throughout the early days of settlement there was a great deal of hatred, vilification and violence by the European settlers against the Aborigines. There were also wholesale massacres. The Myall Creek massacre comes to mind because it is the only one where white men were brought to trial for murdering Aboriginal people. It was not isolated; it was one of many. In that case, we had a. great deal of media coverage. There was absolute outrage that white men could be brought to trialsome of them were hung-for killidg what they considered to be animals; they were called monkeys on many occasions. We often need to be reminded of that. When we look at the state of Aborigines now in many places we have to remember that heritage which is still in the living memory of a number of those people. Those who were not outwardly hostile to Aboriginal people were often paternalistic. I think paternalism is a form of racism as well. It is saying, as I have said in the definition, that these people are inferior and, therefore, we must pat them on the head and look after them. A lot of our so-called protection laws in colonial .times were a reflection of the paternalism which was born of that feeling of superiority/inferiority of the two races. As we know, it was used in those times as an excuse for genocide. It was used as a reason for clearing land so that white people could take up land previously occupied by Aborigines. It also gave rise to a system of taking children from their parents, which was particularly prevalent with children of mixed blood. The stated reason at that time was that, where children had some white blood, if they were brought up in a white community, then the white blood would somehow come to the fore. We could not change the colour of their skin, but with education we could change their attitudes to white ways. A lot of people in those times were influenced by something that was called the great chain of being. This graded human and animal life on a scale. According to the then very superior British people, the Aborigines were very low.l'on that chain of being. They were a little above the great apes. I think the Hottentots were down near the bottom as well. It was also called social Darwinism. it took Darwin's theory of evolution and applied it to the human race and said that people who were primitive, as the Aborigines were considered to be, were in an earlier state of evolution and that they would eventually die out in the face of a superior race. There was a phrase then that was used along the lines of 'smoothing the pillow of the dying i'ace'-if we looked after them, they would eventually die out. Australia faced problems with racism when people of different races started coming into this country. The first great example of that was the Chinese who came into Australia first of all to take some of the jobs on the land when many of the farmers of those days rushed to the goldfields. Of course, the Chinese saw that there was some money to be made there too, so they also went to the goldfields. With that intensity of population and with the industrious ways of the Chinese, they often outstripped their European counterparts. There were riots and the famous riot at Lambing Flat was one of the most prominent. Abusive language as well as violence was predominant. Many speakers in this debate tonight have alluded to racial violence overseas. The Holocaust in Nazi Germany is one of most prominent examples. Of course, it was not just the Jews that suffered; it was also the gypsies, people of other races and people who were thought to be homosexual. So there was that kind of attitude. Often we use as an excuse for this behaviour, 'Well, it was just the attitude of the times.' A reading of history will show us that that is not necessarily so. There were some humane, non-racist people with the First Fleet. Anyone who has read the diaries of Watkin Tench will realise that he tried very hard to understand the Aborigines, to learn their language and to appreciate them as human beings. We have come a long way since then. The White Australia policy, which came fundamentally out of the Chinese experience, was abolished. But I can remember being embarrassed when I first went overseas to the UK and Europe and mixed with people of all races who pointed out to me very strongly that I could come to their country but they were not able to go to my country because of the White Australia Policy. We have obviously seen the light and brought ourselves into the wider world by abolishing that policy. Now we have multiculturalism, something which is greatly criticised by people from all sides of politics. I think it is a system which acknowledges the differences between human beings, which! mentioned at the beginning of my speech, while acknowledging that these people are Australians and live in Australia. This is a vast improvement on what we used to do to people when they came here in the 1950s. They had to forget their language, forget their culture, forget their background and somehow start eating meat pies· and become like us. I do not think you can do that to anybody. I am not going to go through all the clauses of the bill and the different aspects of the legislation because they have already been dealt with by just about every other speaker. The bill, as we all know, states that we are all entitled to respect for our own culture; we are all entitled to live in freedom and without fear of abuse or violence. That is the stated underlying tenet of the bill and that is extremely important. We have been told by a number of people that we do not need this kind of legislation; we just need an education program. I lived in the UK and Europe for most of the 1960s and 1970s-for most of that time in the UK. There were a number of people from previous Commonwealth countries but with different skin colours, people from the Caribbean, from India and from Africa who were providing a much needed work force, in London in particular. I saw many acts of abuse and violence. The same argument was put up when Britain brought in its racial vilification bill. There were the same arguments that we are having now, that we would create martyrs, that you cannot educate people to change their attitudes. Of course, you cannot, but you can at least make them know what the consequences will be if they engage in this sort of behaviour. Anything that will make people stop and think about what they are going to do is useful. It has been said that the New South Wales legislation has not brought any prosecutions. That is not a necessarily a measure of whether it has succeeded or failed. Maybe it has deterred people from engaging in that sort of activity. I do not believe in the martyr argument either. The neo-Nazis that are now languishing in prison in Western Australia could hardly be regarded as martyrs. It is interesting that the New South Wales Liberals have urged their counterparts in this place to support the bill, but they have chosen not to do that. The other argument that has been put forward is that we will lose free speech. Who has free speech now? We can stand up in this place and say a lot of things that we cannot say in the streets, but we cannot slander people without the possibility of being taken to law. There are a lot of things that we cannot say about people. So I think the argument about free speech is ludicrous. We will not be able to tell Irish jokes. We can tell Irish jokes; that is not a problem. My staffer told me before I came into the chamber tonight that she had heard a commentator on a commercial radio station in Sydney saying, 'Yes, you will be able to tell Irish jokes, but you will not be able to tell Aboriginal jokes.' This indicates the level of ignorance about the bill. I am very glad that the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) has brought out a kit, which I hope most members have by now, which contains a question and answer sheetMr lOckey-Based on his views.",122
181,Ms DEAHM,NOES,"It is based on the bill. It gives different scenarios. It says, 'If this happens, what will be the outcome?' In some instances the outcome is likely to be prison and in some it is likely to be mediation or other things. That kit will certainly be well used in my office and I hope other members will use it also. The member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) . referred to international conventions. We '. heard a lot of criticism of international . ventions when were talking about the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill. I was glad to hear that the member for Adelaide believed that we should honour those international conventions in regard to racial hatred. I certainly believe we should too. We are part of a wider world. We are part of a world which has seen some of the atrocities that were described in some detail by the member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) and the member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown). Those things need to be remembered. Those of us who say that this bill is not necessary-and I count myself in that group because of my background-do not live in areas where these acts of racial violence, intolerance and insults are prevalent. Those members who do have told us tonight about some of the instances which they have had related to them or that they have seen themselves. It is very easy, when you live in a comfortable area where there is no strong evidence of those problems, to say, 'Well, it's not necessary.' The racial attitudes that I have described from our past history certainly do not happen now, but those things are still there and the people that suffer from them still need to be protected. I think the bill is definitely needed from that point of view. A numbefof comments have been made by the opposition tonight and several of my colleagues have had a dig at the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer). The Leader of the National Party in his comments said that, because of the attitude he is taking, he will be branded either as a racist or as being not politically correct. One of the phrases that I detest is 'politically correct'. People use it for all sorts of reasons. I would say neither of those things about the Leader of the National Party. I think he is a very tolerant and compassionate man. But when he talked about the ratbag in the community that is carrying out these sorts of threats or saying things that people do not like, he said, 'We will deal with thatratbag.' That is fine in a small country town. Those people will be obvious. Try that in the centre of Sydney or Melbourne. Try finding the COll- person who slashed the tyres of the minister of the Uniting .""Church in Sydney and who threw paint bombs at the walls of that church. I am not sure whether those people were actually brought to book. We knew who they were, but it is very hard to catch them. But those sorts of things do not happen in the same way as a ratbag uttering the wrong sorts of things in the main street of a country town. The Leader of the National Party, while being well intentioned, is not taking that broader outlook of the sorts of things that are happening in a much wider community. Several membets have said that the purpose of this bill is to divide the opposition. We heard that with the sexual conduct Bill too. It seems that every time we put up something that does not have the full agreement of opposition members, we are accused of being the ones that are diViding the opposition. As I said before, we do not have to do that; they are doing a great job all by themselves. I was particularly disappointed with the speech by the member for Adelaide, because I consider her to be one of the most moderate, tolerant and open-minded people on that side of the House. Certainly a lot of the things said were true, but it is incorrect to say this bill was brought in with only a few days notice. I had letters in my local paper raising all the same sorts of arguments months before the bill came anywhere near this place. There was plenty of time for discussion and, of course, we know that a previous bill was considered in the last parliament. So the matter has been around for a long time and has not been brought in with undue haste. If the member for Adelaide and the other more moderate members of the other side really want to see some legislation-perhaps not the legislation we are bringing in-they are going about it the wrong way by voting against this and bringing in a private member's bill. They know it will not get up, so what is the point of doing it? I am very disappointed that the members on the other side are not willing to bite the bullet on this and acknowledge that there are people in our community who suffer from this kind of vilification and violence on a regular basis. They need to be protected, and the perpetrators of these kinds of actions need to be brought to book. While we are legislating we are educating and, hopefully, we will change people's attitudes. But we will never change all attitudes. There will always be people who look on others as inferior. There will always be people who are greedy and selfish and do not want to share with other people. I think we need this legislation to protect those people. I commend the bill to the House and thank the House for its indulgence.",125
182,Mr COBB,NOES,"I was interested to listen to the comments of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Macquarie (Mrs Deahm). Comments that she made about the Chinese being persecuted in this country jogged my memory. I have a number of Chinese friends, and I do not think any ethnic group in this country has been more persecuted than the Chinese. But today, largely speaking, they are not. They are very successful people within the community. She also mentioned the White Australia policy, which was supported in its time by both sides of the House, and it was this side of the she House that finally abolished it. That fact that would be supported by both sides of this House. That shows what a tolerant society we live in today in this country-thank heavens! Our being tolerant is one of the reasons that I am opposed to the bill. I object to the bill being called the Racial Hatred Bill. Fancy calling it a bill of hatred. Why can they not use the word 'vilification'. I find 'racial hatred' a very ugly term, and it is something that I would not be particularly proud to have in legislation in this country. The bill is nonsensical in much of what it wants to achieve, although I do agree with some aspects of it. It is unnecessary, and it is certainly opposed by most Australians.",126
183,Dr THEOPHANOUS,NOES,Rubbish!,126
184,Mr COBB,NOES,"One poll I saw suggested that 93 per cent of Australians were opposed to this sort of legislation. We have had several years of this government's drafting it, and suddenly it dropped it on us a few days ago. The previous speaker says that we have had plenty of time to look at it because we knew it was coming. Sure we knew it was coming, but we did not know which form it would take. It could take many forms-some of which we would support, some of which we would violently oppose, and some of which we would moderately oppose. If this government had been fair dinkum, it would have consulted with us and would have given us at least a two-week look at it before it was debated in this House. The Australian people have also not been largely consulted on it. I remember when the government brought in its draft bill back in 1992. Numerous submissions-646-came in commenting on that bill. The figure for those opposing the bill was 563, or 87 per cent, and the figure for those in favour of the bill was 83, or less than 13 per cent. So I do not think it is correct for the minister at the table, the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), to say that there is general support for this. Like other members of the coalition I have seen no evidence whatsoever presented to this House that there is a need for this bill, even though-like all members in this House-I am offended and embarrassed by and find repugnant any acts of racism not only in this country but anywhere in the world today. If the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) had wanted to bring legislation of this nature to the House-recognising the fact that the states primarily have control of criminal law-I thought he would have done what he is presently doing, quite correctly, with the female genital mutilation legislation. Rather than overriding the states through international treaties; he could have gone to the states, consulted with them to see whether they would bring in their own legislation, and if they refused he could have brought it in. Why is he not consistent and doing it with this legislation? Already in New South Wales we have legislation on racial vilification, and we have it in Queensland, Western Australia and the ACT to a large extent too. That is a good basis to. build on. He also says when challenged that it will be largely impossible for people to be prosecuted under this present legislation, and that at least it is there for educative purpose. I am surprised he is using that reason, because he denied the Tasmanian government the use of that reason on the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill. The Racial Hatred Bill is based on race, colour, national or ethnic origin; it amends the Crimes Act of 1914-adding three criminal offences, which I will talk about shortly; it amends the Racial Discrimination Act of 1975; and it adds a civil prohibition on acts likely to offend, humiliate, insult or intimidate people. I will come to that section later. In relation to the Crimes Act additions, people who threaten to cause physical harm to others based on race will receive two years in prison. Those who threaten to cause physical harm to property-as opposed to personbased on race, will receive one year in prison. I note here that the actual action of causing physical harm to property or to human beings is not covered at all, because the Attorney General believes that that is already covered in state legislation. It so happens that threatening to do these things is already covered in state legislation. Even the Parliamentary Research Service in its Bills Digest on the Racial Hatred Bill says: It is already an offence to threaten to cause injury to people or their property in the Australian States and Territories . . . Interestingly enough, it goes on to say: In many cases, the penalties are higher ... In my own state of New South Wales, section 199 of the Crimes Act 1990 provides that, if you are going to threaten someone's property, you are liable for imprisonment for five years. Under this legislation that the Attorney General is bringing in, you are going to be liable for imprisonment of one year. In other words it could be seen that racially motivated crimes to threaten property are going to be treated less seriously than crimes motivated by other reasons. Surely that is a pretty ironic thing to be happening. I do not object to those two sections of the bill at all-except I think that they are redundant because of state legislation, particularly in my own state. What I do object to is the section of the bill which is headed, 'Prohibition of incitement of racial hatred because of an race, colour or national or ethic origin'. It says: ""60.(1) A person"" must not, with the intention of inciting racial hatred against another person or a group of people, do an act, otherwise than in private, if the act: (a) is reasonably likely, in all the circumstances, to incite racial hatred against the other person or group of people ... I notice that there are no exemptions at all to this incitement. Apart from the fact that I do not know how, in trying to convince a jury, those subjective tests could be tested in the courts, I think the High Coilrt, if this section were put to it, could well throw it out because in some areas it violates freedom of speechand let me point out where. In the act of making a statement or report which is true, being a report either of an historic event or of current events, the maker of the statement can still be sent to prison if the statement was reasonably likely to incite racial hatred and was intended to incite racial hatred. What do I mean by that? There are quite a few ethnic publications around-and many have crossed my desk over the years-that have reported atrocities having been inflicted by other ethnic groups with whom they are in conflict. If a Croatian or Bosnian newspaper came out listing Serb atrocities and saying what dreadful things these were and how the Serbs should be put in their place for these atrocious acts, under a literal reading of the legislation, as I read it, that could, be causing these Bosnians or Croatians to be incited against the Serbs, even though what was said might well be true. These people, it seems, could be thrown in the clanger. That seems quite incredible. If this sort of legislation were on the books and literally interpreted in, say, 1939 in Australia, probably much of what was written in this country against the Japanese in World War II could not have been written. If it had been, editors would have been thrown in gaol. So I do think this is a gross deficiency in the bill. Turning to the area where the Racial Discrimination Act is changed and reading the first section, we see that it is headed, under part IIA, 'Prohibition of Offensive Behaviour Based on Racial Hatred'. Yet if you read the rest of the act, racial hatred is not even mentioned. That is a little surprising. The first proposed section deals with reasons for doing an act. It says: If: (a) an act is done for 2 or more reasons; and (b) one of the reasons is the race, colour or national or ethnic origin of a person . . . then, for the purposes of this Part, the act is to be done because of the person's race, colour or national or ethnic origin. I have asked a number of members in this parliament whether they can explain to me what that exactly means: why should the racial connotation in things that YOIl are doing wrong take predominance over the other-? Nobody has been able to give me a valid reason as to why that is so. It would seem to me that, if you create an act that violates on race and one that violates for other reasons, the one that causes the greatest transgression should be the one that is clamped down on. I have already mentioned how in New South Wales you can spend five years in gaol for threatening to damage people's property, whereas with this legislation the penalty is the . threat of only one year. There is a conflict there. There is no explanation in the bill,· where it is in conflict with penalties in state legislation, as to how this will be resolvedwhether penalties will be added on, served concurrently, or whatever. Proposed section 18C relating to the Racial Discrimination Act also states: It is unlawful for a person to do an act ... if: (a) the act is reasonably likely, in all the circumstances, to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate another person or a group of people ... The previous speaker said that, under this legislation, you can still tell your Irish jokes. From my literal reading of that, you will not be able to tell Irish jokes; Irish people, for that matter-and I myself am part-Irish-will not be able to tell Polish jokes. So, if it is the case that people can do this, where in the explanatory memorandum or in the legislation does it say they can? By a literal reading of that act, if you are offended, insulted, humiliated or intimidated, Irish jokes are out. I think that is something that needs to be explained. While we are talking about offending people or inciting to hatred according to race, why just limit it to race? For example, why not bring in a general bill saying that hatred is barred? Surely that would have more merit. I have sat in this place for 10 years and I taken have seen, for example, the previous Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, tip buckets on the previous leader of the coalition, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), because of his height. He called him 'little Johnny Howard' and disparaged him because· of his height. I am sure that the honourable member for Bennelong was not insulted by that; he has a thick skin and could take it. But . if his wife or children had been listening to that comment, perhaps they would have been offended by it. But apparently it is all right to do that. It is all right for some reason to hate. Recently in this place, we have had the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating) calling members of the opposition 'scumbags', 'vermin' and, in recent weeks, 'lice'-for heaven's sake! If he stood up and called me an ill-bred Irish-English hybrid, I would be less offended. Even though that would violate this act, I would be less offended than I am when he comes in here and calls me vermin, or lice or a scumbag. So I cannot see the consistency of this at all. It is absolutely crazy stuff. Honourable members ""interjecting",126

188,Mr COBB,NOES,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Exemptions are given under of the Racial Discrimination Act for artistic"" work, for genuine academic work, for scientific work, for fair and accurate reporting· of an event which happens, and for fair comment of a genuine belief held. That seems to me, in one sense, to give carte blanche to those who incite hatred against Jews, provided that it falls into one of these categories. That seems a little strange to me. I cannot quite understand that. In the explanatory memorandum on pages 10 and 11, it states: It is not the intention of that provision to prohibit a person from stating in public what may be considered generally to be an extremd'view, so long as the person making the statement does so reasonably and in good faith and genuinely believes in what he or she is saying. So, if someone goes out on the street and says, 'Jews are inferior people,' and if they genuinely believe that and it is an extreme view-which it is-even though everybody in this chamber would find that repugnant, according to this legislation, it would be exempt. I cannot understand that at all. If neo-Nazis with shaven heads came from Germany to my electorate, for example, and put on an exhibition of Nazi memorabilia, I would not be too happy about it. I would be looking to object about it. But if I said that these people ought to be despised, sent back to the country they came from and should not have come in on the particular visa on which they did, who would be charged? Under a literal reading of the act, it would not be them; it would probably be me because I had disparaged them on ethnic grounds. We had David Irving, that pseudo-academic scientific person who said that the Jews were not killed in the war, there was no holocaust, and all that type of thing, wanting to come out to Australia to tell that to the Australian people. This government banned him from coming into this country. You can argue both ways as to whether that is good or bad. But according to the explanatory memorandum, extreme views, if genuinely held, now are allowed to be preached in good faith. With the enactment of this legislation, perhaps the government would not be able to ban this fellow coming into our country. I do not know, but that is how it seems to read to me. Another part of the act I cannot quite come to terms with is the part regarding vicarious liability where, if an employee or agent of a person does an act in connection with his or her duties as an employee or agent and this act would be unlawful, this act applies in relation to the person as if the person had also done the act. In other words, the employer is responsible for what the employee does. How is that going to apply in practice? An employer could employ 20 door-to-door salesmen to sell vacuum cleaners. Even if the people were told that they were not to breach the act beforehand, if one of them went out, knocked on a door and a Jew or Aboriginal .person came to the door and the salesman said, 'I am not going to sell a vacuum cleaner to you because you are an inferior person,' and turned and walked away, according to the literal reading of the bill, instead of the employee being prosecuted, it would be the employer who would be prosecuted. I think that is quite unfair on the person who employs those people. There are many things I could talk about on this bill. One thing which intrigues me about the bill is that if you commit an offence in a private place you are exempt. I can understand the practical reasons for that, because it is almost impossible to prosecute people for doing these things in a private place. The Attorney-General said at a press conference that, if you want to goosestep up and down your lounge room and sprout doctrines of racial purity, you are entitled to do that. What if you had a party in your house and there were 50 people there and you were preaching this nonsense? Apparently it is all right to do that, but if you stepped outside and preached it to two other people in public, you can be prosecuted. It seems the principle goes out the window on this particular thing. Again, that is something that does not stand up. When asked at the press conference to give an example as to who the bill would apply to in Australia in the last few years, the Attorney-General could not mention anyone except, he said, that there were some neo-Nazis prancing up and down the Adelaide mall earlier this year. I looked up the press releases to see what they had done. They were prosecuted for violence, but the things they said'Speak up against race laws' and 'Say no to an Asian Australia' - would be permitted under this bill. However, the people who came and protested against them and said that Nazis are scum would be prosecuted under this bill. (Time expired)",129
189,Mr CAMPBELL,NOES,"The honourable member for Macquarie (Ms Deahm) gave us a definition of racism. I did not have a university education, but I can give the House a much more succinct, current and germane description of racism and of a racist. A racist today is anyone who wins an argument with a multiculturalist. I believe the Racial Hatred Bill is an insult to Australia and Australians. It is an absolute disgrace that it has even been brought before the parliament and it will be an infamous day in our political history if it is passed. This is one of the most draconian pieces of legislation ever brought. before the parliament in peacetime. It is in the same class as the Communist Party Dissolution Bill, and the case for it is shot through with mendacity and misrepresentation. The fact that this bill is before the parliament and may well be passed says a great deal about our political leadership. Our system has always been able to cope with corrupt individual politicians, but when entire political parties have been intellectually corrupted the system begins to break down. On key issues such as immigration, multiculturalism and Asianisation we have a tyranny of the minorities and a disenfranchisement of the majority. This bill is the starkest indicator of that process so far. The elites who have been pushing these policies realise that, even though they dominate the bureaucracies and academia, they are losing the intellectual argument. Their crude cries of 'racist' and 'racism' are proving less and less effective. Now they want a piece of legislation to compliment the declining power of the social sanctions against speaking out. It can be observed that one cost of increasing the cultural and racial diversity of democratic nations has been a decline in the ability to speak freely. We are moving from a democratic to an authoritarian model. We are urged to integrate with Asia, and of course the Asian model is authoritarian. The Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) shows his indifference to free speech by calling it just another element of our democracy which has to be weighed up with other elements. But this is just not the case. It is not just another element; it is the central element upon which our democratic system rests. When it is eroded for reasons as fraudulent as those the proponents of the bill have advanced, we know that our democracy is in danger. While such erosions may suit the commissars in power today, what happens when they lose power, as history shows that inevitably they will? What moral ground will they have to stand on when they have corrupted the political process? What values will they be able to tum to for their own protection? Does the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) or the Attorney-General really think that the majority support this bill, or even that it is justified? I doubt that they do. But, on the one hand, it will serve to stifle debate in those areas and, on the other hand, there is a powerful lobby group which has been pushing for them. Before I tread further along that path, I think it would be instructive to outline the sorry history of the push for this bill. This is the second attempt to get this sort of legislation through. The Racial Vilification Bill 1992 was introduced to parliament in draft form at 8.01 p.m. on the second last sitting day of the year, 16 December 1992. In other words, it was done in such a way as to bring the minimum of attefttion to it. I, along with former Senator Peter Walsh, spoke out strongly against the proposed bill. As far as I can recall, we were the only two federal politicians from either side to do so. The bill in its draft form was also a disgrace. Even gestures and the wearing of politically incorrect T-shirts were made illegal under the bill. The civil section of the bill would have been administered by the Race Discrimination Commissioner of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, then Irene Moss, one of the people who most strongly pushed for the bill. The bill closely followed the recommendations of her report into racist violence, which is little more than an exercise in Anglo bashing. There is no doubt who this sort of legislation is aimed at. The recommendations of two other reports were also used to justify the bill-the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody and the report Multiculturalism and the law by the Law Reform Commission, then under Justice Elizabeth Evatt. It is clear in the texts that there was networking between the authors of these reports. However, both the latter reports recommended against criminal sanctions. Only the report of Ireqe Moss supported criminal sanctions which were contained in the 1992 draft bill and are also contained in the 1994 bill. I would urge interested academics who still care about free speech to analyse this Moss report closely, because this document, which I believe to be intellectually corrupt, is the main justification for federal racial vilification legislation. The 1992 draft bill was supposed to lie on the table while people made submissions. A member of my staff asked the Attorney General's office how people could obtain the bill and was told it could be obtained from government bookshops. He asked two people in two separate states to ring government bookshops and ask for the bill and no-one in either bookshop knew of the bill's existence. He then wrote letters, published in the Age on 24 December and the Australian Financial Review on 31 December 1992, bringing attention to what was happening. It was only at the very end of 1992 that the Attorney-General's public affairs section was brought into coordinate the selling of the bill to the media and to organise a public consultation process. There was no proper submission process in place until then. It was clearly an afterthought. Advertisements appeared in early January 1993 letting people know that a submission process on the bill would be conducted and offering to send people copies of the bill, the second reading speech and a fact sheet. The written submission process, however, was held over the holiday break when most people would be thinking about anything else b-t politics, or perhaps so it was hoped. ' The Attorney-General's Department also tried to fix the result of the travelling consultation process by holding meetings in venues of groups most likely to support the bill, such as ethnic affairs commissions and so on. It also sent out letters asking these organisations to mobilise their members-that is, likely supporters of the bill-to be at the meetings. The attempt to stack the meetings, however, seems to have been largely unsuccessful. At any rate, due to the timing of the March 1993 election, the draft bill was wiped from the slate, but not before the bill had provided the model for bastard children in the form of a section for the broadcasting codes for television and immigration changes. These immigration changes Were used to block controversial historian David Irving from entering Australia. Ethnic lobby groups continued to push for a racial vilification bill after Prime Minister Keating was re-elected. As the draft bill had been wiped from the slate, a new bill would have to be introduced. There was also of course a new Attorney-General, Michael Lavarch. Again, there was a great deal of speculation about the racial vilification bill and when it would be introduced. It was originally thought the bill would be intro-' duced early this year, but it has been continually delayed. Mr Keating finally announced that the bill would definitely be introduced before the end of 1994 at the 36th biennial conference of the Zionist Federation of Australia. The outgoing President of the ZFA, Mark Leibler, was one of those who had most strongly pushed for this bill, with criminal sanctions. The choice of venue for the announcement underlined from where the major lobbying pressure for the introduction of such a bill had come. Of course, other ethnic lobby groups and academics have been involved and Aboriginals have been used as a stalking horse, but the main driving force has clearly been the Zionist lobby. Incidentally, at the same Zionist Federation conference the Prime Minister announced the formation of a multicultural advisory council to advise the government on so-called cultural diversity dimensions of the centenary of Federation and the Olympic Games-in other words, how the events could be used as opportunities to promote the propaganda of multiculturalism. The first and, at that stage, only member appointed to the multicultural advisory council was a lobbyist from the Zionist Federation of Australia. This was also the meeting at which Bob Hawke, one of the high profile guests, got most upset at not being accorded what he thought was due respect for his work for Zionism. This included imposing a costly and counterproductive war crimes trials process on Australia. It also included the sacking of both Mr Ron Brown and Mr Tony Harris, the secretary and deputy secretary to the immigration department, at the behest of the lobby in 1990. These two were sacked because they resisted opening up a separate immigration category for Soviet Jews. This incident is well known to anyone who takes an interest in immigration matters, yet when Verona Burgess of the Canberra Times in an article some time later repeated the fact it was denied by one Jeremy Jones from the Executive Council of Australian Jewry in a letter to the Canberra Times. Not only did he deny the fact, but he also had the front to ask for an apology from the writer. Neither the Zionist lobby or anyone else has the right to use state authority to deny inconvenient facts of history and remain unchallenged. Nor should we attempt to suppress people who make such denials. Mr Jones has the right to deny the facts, but others should have the right to assert them. This is how we should approach those who deny the Holocaust. They should be met with the facts and arguments in open debate and not suppressed. I want to make it clear that, in talking of the Zionist lobby, I am not talking about the great majority of Jews, many of whom, I know, are totally opposed to this bill. I am talking about a relatively small group in the Jewish community, disproportionately composed of authoritarian zealots who have crushed or silenced internal opposition. Due to a combination of money, position, relentless lobbying and the manipulation of their victim status, they have a very powerful influence, both in Australia and abroad. I can hear the press gallery journalists now, tuttutting and writing things such as 'a group he calls the Zionist lobby' as if such a lobby didn't exist and that I am just imagining things. The bill is a reflection of the deeply authoritarian and intolerant mentality. Mr Doron Ur, head of the Council of WA Jewry, when giving evidence to the Western Australian Standing Committee on Legislation on 27 July 1990 on the need for a such legislation in Western Australia, stated: Why is this legislation so necessary? If it was up to me, we would have a Bill to sentence all people who incite racial hatred to death. However we do not have the death sentence in this State so that could not be done. However if such people were sitting in the places of the members of the Committee today, they would sentence me to death as they have sentenced to death most of my family in the past. Nobody is denying the horror of the holocaust or our sympathy for the victims, but here is an example of the mentality which wishes to impose draconian legislation upon us. On the one hand, in an Australian setting, it is paranoid and, on the other, it is totalitarian. Imagine the sort of country we would live in if the likes of Doron Ur were in charge. Australian laws should not be fashioned out of an ongoing reaction to the great evils of the Nazis. We have provided a haven for those who suffered at their hands and it is a poor reward for our tolerance to have our liberties undermined in return. These are the very liberties which made this country attractive in the first place. In recent times, Doron ·Ur· has been in dispute with the editor of the west Australian Paul Murray. Mr Murray had the temerity tcriticise this lobby for its intolerance. In return he was attacked by Mr Ur, who implicitly accused him of anti-Semitism. No doubt it is not much of a step from an accusation of anti-Semitism to an accusation of inciting racial hatred. Indeed, to many Zionists such an accusation seems to be one and the same thing. It is clear that in the perfect world of Mr Ur it would not take much to be sentenced to death. Yet this man claims to be promoting tolerance. It is just nonsense, as some claim that this bill will not be used. It is clearly d-signed to be used. Mark Leibler, in his submission as President of the ZFA on the 1992 draft bill stated, as reported by the Australian Jewish News of 12 February 1993, that racial vilification should be defined through 'the eyes of a reasonable man of that religion, race, colour or national or ethnic origin'. No doubt Mr Ur regards himself as a reasonable man. Mr Leibler also wanted 'artistic works, academic and scientific statements and fair reports or comments on matters of public interest to be - ubjected to scrutiny for racial vilific-ion'­ m other words, subject to a politically correct censorship board. Is this an example· of tolerance? In recent times it has been insinuated that the majority of the Australian population was resp-nsible. for firebombings of Jewish property, mcludmg synagogues. This was implicitly used as ammunition in the push for this bill. There was a particularly grubby little segment along these lines on a show called The TImes. As a matter of fact most of these incidents occurred during the' Gulf War and had to do with the Middle East. Ask ASIO about them. The recent one in Sydney was caused by an electrical fault and, according to an article in the Sun-Herald of 13 November police believe that three recent firebomb attacks on Jewish premises in east St Kilda were carried out by other Jews-in other words, an interfactional fight. It is time we put things in perspective. By far the biggest racial problems we have are between and within ethnic groups which have arrived since the end of the war. That is a fact which is inconvenient to the multiculturalists. In any consideration of the new Racial Hatred Bill, the public consultations and the written public submissions on the 1992 draft bill should have been taken into account and the results, at the least, made public. I placed a question on notice about the bill and among other things, asked about the result- of the 1993 public consultations and submissions. The Attorney-General took three months to answer and made it clear that he would not be making the results public. This was a typical display of arrogance. A public submissions process was conducted, yet the public was not to be informed of the result. I strongly suspected that the reason for this was that the results were not what the Attorney-General wanted to hear. And so it proved. Freedom of information documents revealed what I had expected. Written submissions ran almost seven to one against the bill and the attempt to stack the public consultations process had clearly failed. The attempt of the Attorney-General to cover up the results is merely a measure of the misrepresentation, intellectual corruption and d-ceit which has marked the entire sorry history of the push for such legislation. Of course, the legislation has been dressed up in the highest moral terms, but it has been driven by unrepresentative elites and minority groups, led by the Zionist lobby. While treating the results of the best measure of public opinion so far about this bill with contempt, the Attorney-General continues to rely upon the recommendations of three politically correct reports as support for the bill, most notably, as mentioned, the report by Irene Moss. A former Premier of Queensland was once ridiculed in the media for not knowing about the division of powers in our political system, but the bulk of the media is quite happy to countenance a partisan like Irene Moss acting at one and the same time as advocate for supposed victims of racial intolerance and inquirer into such supposed intolerance. Not only that, but she was to have also administered the civil section of the legislation she called for, as her successor will do if the before us is passed. There is absolutely no understanding or appreciation of just how improper it is for the same person to be advocate, judge and jury in one. Those who rightly uphold the general principle of division of powers in our wider political context should be deeply concerned about the blurring of such responsibilities in quasi-judicial bodies like the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. Yet it is seen to be quite all right by the new class. This is the sort of new class law we are evolving-a de facto judicial system in which an accusation is taken as proof and the publicists are also the prosecutors and the judges. Not only that, but determinations of the commission can be registered in the Federal Court and become legally binding-a star chamber usurping the authority of a proper court. This is supposed to be an advance. This bill, among other things, is clearly designed to stifle open debate on matters such as immigration and multiculturalism at a time when both are increasingly coming into public disrepute. The dissembling of the Attorney General cannot disguise this fact. Much of the discussion about this bill has concentrated on the criminal sanctions, but even without them this bill would still be insidious. The civil section of the bill would be a nightmare for public officials and private citizens. The mere threat of an action against them would be enough to inhibit open discussion. It is also an open invitation to blackmail. I have seen instances where this has occurred. This bill is also designed to entrench one view of history as holy writ. All aspects of history, no matter how horrible and distressing to some people, should be open for critical examination and discussion. We cannot rule a line on the study of the past. I really believe that if we do not make a stand on this bill then the authoritarian excesses will get worse. This is a principle that people can understand and it is firm ground on which to make a stand. Finally, I commend the attitude of a man who represents the true tradition of Jewish law liberalism, Noam Chomsky, an intellectual who has no peer in Australia today. Mr Chomsky is a true champion of civil liberties and believes we have a right to speak our minds on sensitive political and historical issues. Free speech is not just another value. It is the central value of our political system. The loss of such a right and on such dubious grounds would be a significant step on the way to losing our democracy.",130
190,Mr TUCKEY,NOES,"I would like to put on the record something that has been said by a number of people: the coalition parties are totally committed to racial equality. It is quite easy to argue that they have led Australia philosophically on this issue in any genuine sense. In fact, historically, we have certainly led the Labor Party. I will not go into some of the years of my youth and my recollections of members of tJe Labor Party. Its one time revered leader, Mr Calwell, was a classic of his time, objecting very strongly to any changes to the White Australia policy. That most noted comment of his, of course, is to be deplored. But I have to say that it was not deplored in that particular period of history. In fact, most people agreed with him. I do not remember any condemnation of Mr Calwell for his remarks. I think most people at the time thought it was a Keatingist-type slick joke. Of course, it would not be today. We have to get the record straight on one thing: our opposition to the Racial Hatred Bill has nothing to do with not protecting the rights of all Australians, particularly those whom one might consider more vulnerablethat is, the people' who have more recently arrived in this country with much stronger ethnic ties than some who have been here for longer periods. I do not want to be'too specific, .but I am proud to say that my eldest daughter is Mrs Paterniti. I am proud to say that from time to time. I have heard my son-in-law say to his mother when she has rung him on the phone 'Talk English.' That is his view; he is an Australian. Furthermore, being as close to that situation and having been very close to ethnic communities throughout most of my business life-and I refer here to Aboriginal people and European immigrants who came out, many as refugees, from all oj southern Europe because we had a large plantation industry in Carnarvon where I lived-I have a very good understanding of all of those people, their difficulties and some of their internal disputes. On all of this, there is only one rule that will apply, and that is the rule of understanding. Understanding will not be changed by law; understanding will be changed only by time. I am pleased to say,' giving a personal example of our family, that there is nothing better than the passing of generations and the intermarriage of ethnic groups. I hope that will continue in this country. It is a noticeable fact that one of those ethnic groups-a religious ethnic group, not a national ethnic group-does everything in its power to keep some purity amongst its own people. It discourages intermarriage and yet it is the one that is demanding this particular protection. Mr Latham-Who is that?",134
191,Mr TUCKEY,NOES,"You should be able to work it out from that because it is very obvious and we see too much of it. I think intermarriage is something to be encouraged. Even if it can be argued that Australians are intolerant-and they are not that intolerantthe suggestion that one can pass a,law to overcome all these problems is in fact silly. That is the worse criticism I can make of legislation that is delivered to this parliament-that it is silly. But it is doubly silly when we open up opportunities for people to take some of their ethnic confrontations into our courts. This, of course, is a mechanism for-that purpose. As the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) has just said, that has been presented. The honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) this evening painted a picture of this being somehow legislation to protect more recent arrivals-people who have grave concerns about public attitude towards them and who have come, in many cases, from places where they have been severely persecuted. He tried to paint a picture for those people that they are over there and it is all the rest of Australia-people who have been here for longer periods, whatever their ethnic background-from whom they are going to be protected. Of course nobody in this place believes that, including the honourable member for Melbourne. We know that when we pass legislation in this place we pass it for all residents pf Australia. I underline the word 'residents'. They do not even have to be Australians, they do not have to be citizens, to be subject to this law. I sincerely hope that the more recent arrivals-that is the way I choose to describe these people in general-understand that they should not carry on with some of their ethnic battles which they have brought with them from their couI}try of origin. I do not know that I have ever been more upset than to watch what has gone on in Yugoslavia and Bosnia-Herzegovina. What people have done to themselves there is almost worse than the Second World War. Those hatreds exist, and I made the point earlier that I am very conscious of how they work. As the local hotel keeper in Carnarvon, I had a very large southern European clientele who ran the plantation industry alongside our town. We as good Western Australians played Australian Rules football. After a very exciting match one day, a couple of people whom we called 'Slavs' said to me, 'It'd be much better if we could play soccer, Mr Tuckey. That's a really exciting game.' I asked, 'Why don't you?' and they said, 'We lack the organisational skills. We don't know where to buy our shirts and boots.' I said to them, 'I'll help you.' It was in my interest both as a community leader and as a publican. We got together and I arranged all these things for them-and of course they made me president of the association, of which I am very proud. We needed four teams to have a competition, which was no problem. We had a very large established United Kingdom community at our tracking station. We had, amongst the southern Europeans, sufficient Italians to make up a good team. We needed two more teams and the Yugoslavs said that they could provide two teams. They did not bother to tell me that one was Croatian and the other was Serb. It was all right while they played the other two teams, but when they played each other there was blood on the floor. Both teams got to the grand final because they were very good soccer players, and they beat up the best player from one side one night in front of the picture theatre so he could not play the next day. Workmates! The government is suggesting that that activity is okay. It is not true and it cannot be condoned but the government is saying that, if you are one of them, you are protected from this; this bill is here to protect you. Those are the sorts of things they do to each other. Of course we could extend it way past that with other examples. I hope the government and its provincial lawyer are prepared to go out and say, 'This is for everybody.' Mr Latham-It is.",135
192,Mr TUCKEY,NOES,"Thank you, I am intrigued to hear the member for Werriwa say that it is for everyone. If you read the speech of the honourable member for Melbourne tomorrow, and the speeches of a couple of others, you would get the distinct impression that it is there, one might even say, to divide this community but, most importantly, to say to one group of people, 'This is for you.' The previous parliamentary secretary told me how this is a great victory for the Labor Party because all the ethnic interests, whoever that might mean, are going to come out in favour of it because they will be getting the protection. In fact, under two categories, I predict that if and when this bill actually brings someone to court, it will probably be amongst those groupings that carry out their inherited hatreds, which I predict can only be removed in this society by a process of time. This is a very important aspect that must be understood by the ethnic communities. They are not quarantined from this legislation. When they discover the extent to which they might be prosecuted for it, or where one richer person might decide to take a civil action and send the other fellow broke because he has some revenge to take out upon him, then I think you might find out how dissatisfied people are. Let us just get on the record the fact that nobody is quarantined from this. You are now admitting that that is so. But your rhetoric this evening and your rhetoric in public has not made that point. It is an extremely important one. I also want to touch, on another aspect of what we are doing here. This is the second piece of legislation where I have raised the same criticism. I learnt something from the first piece of legislation, because I made some public remarks. I heard a journalistjournalists sit in judgment on us; they are experts in everything-tell a radio commentator that I did not understand the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill, which is four lines long but which has universal coverage as it includes everything. She quoted a great authority; she quoted the explanatory memorandum, because she thought it was the law. It is interesting that we are now getting to the stage, in what is very difficult legislation, of legislating by explanatory memorandum. It is an interesting thing. I only read the explanatory memorandum when I rose here. Having held that view personally-I am not legally trained-I read the Bills Digest, which is written by someone who is legally trained. An extensive part of the commentary is not about what the bill says but about what it does not say. I will quote from the Bills Digest reference to the explanatory memorandum, which states: ' The Explanatory Memorandum to the Racial Hatred Bill provides that 'it is intended that Australian courts' would follow the definition of 'ethnic origin' set out in the New Zealand case of King-Ansell v Police, and that this would 'provide the broadest basis for protection of peoples such as Sikhs, Jews and Muslims'. Examples are raised as to why that might be. The commentator, a legally trained person, goes on to say: If the Parliament 'intends' this, it should state its legislation . . . Of course it should. Mr Bevis-Are you proposing an amendment, Wilson?",136
193,Mr TUCKEY,NOES,"I am certainly not. We are opposing the bill because it is such a hopeless piece of legislation. An independent legal commentator is starting to tell you what is wrong with it. In the short title of the Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill, you refer to sexual conduct; but no definition of sexual conduct is given. If I were the Attorney-General in Tasmania and I wanted to q,e mischievous, I would just amend my laws via it definition of 'sexual conduct'. Your legislation would then not be worth the paper it is written on. You do not care about it now; it has served its purpose. But the commentator is quite right when he says: If the Parliament 'intends' this, it should state its legislation, rather than attempting to legislate an Explanatory Memorandum, which is a Government document that is neither passed nor approved by the Parliament. You cannot deny that. He goes on to say: While the courts may take into account the Explanatory Memorandum if there is an ambiguity in the legislation, it is surely the Parliament's role to pass legislation which is not deliberately ambiguous. Of course that is our responsibility. We are the legislators. The courts are there to interpret the legislation we write. We have gone down the road of creating two totally imprecise pieces of legislation. There is absolutely nothing that can give members of the public any certainty in what they might do. It is a lawyer's dream. We are running around one day trying to cap compensation payments to try to get control of the legal profession but, as fast as certain steps are taken, you create this sort of legi-atiori. But what are the rights of members of the public? Why are they not entitled to know what you mean? Of course it goes further. Some people have objected to the use of the word 'hatred'. Is it not interesting, because we find that our legal advisers, in providing us with this Bills Digest, seek to comment on the meaning of it in 'hatred'. What do they tell us? They say: As noted in the above in the Background, the international instruments, which form the constitutional support for this Bill, avoided reference to 'incitement to racial hatred', on the basis that 'hatred' is too subjective a term for a court to assess. In the United States and Canada, concern has also been expressed that the term 'hatred' is too uncertain a standard to include in penal legislation. So the courts do not know how to interpret it but ordinary citizens facing two years gaol have to know what it means. The Bills Digest states: For example, in State v Klapprott, the Supreme Court of New Jersey held that a statute that made it an offence to utter arty statement inciting hatred, abuse, violence or hostility against a group by reason of race, colour, religion or manner of worship, was void for uncertainty, because the terms 'hatred', 'abuse' and 'hostility' are abstract and indefinite. So why can you not give people some advice it in on what you mean? If you are going to put by people in gaol because of an act that is defined as hatred, it would seem reasonable to put within this legislation a definition of hatred-just as I say in your previous legislation you should have put in a definition of sexual conduct. ""1 know why you avoided it. But we have this jumped-up provincial lawyer who, according to the honourable member for Macquarie (Mrs Deahm), is giving us his document, his package, that tells us what these brief statements mean, what the consequences might be. The more considered view is that we will never know until somebody argues it out in the court. Of course, there are precedents that say that your use of the word 'hatred' will make it almost impossible to gain a conviction. That is what we are told. You must know this. You have the whole Attorney-General's Department behind you· and you come in with rubbish legislation that leaves the people of Australia with no idea whatsoever what you mean. That is an outrage. It is doubly an outrage when you are talking about people's liberty. So let us put aside all the hype. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Theophanous); I forget his electorate as he has shifted a of timesMr Latham-Calwell.",137
194,Mr TUCKEY,NOES,"Calwell! That is an interesting connection. His concern, expressed across the table to me, was how many votes you were going to win with it. Let us put that aside for a moment and ask ourselves two questions: in all of this, considering some inherited hatreds that exist between various of our more recent ethnic arrivals, what have we done for them with this legislation, other than to put them at grave risk for things they say in their churches and other places like that, and which no doubt at their own internal Accounting political rallies they have probably been the saying about each other for centuries? If someone takes offence and has the money, will he drag those people before a tribunal? I have grave concern about this further extension of the powers of the tribunal. I wish I had time to read what ex-senator Peter Walsh had to say about the whole operation, including his complaints about how expensive the HREOC is now becoming. My concern about tribunals is that they neither operate under the proper rules of justice nor do they seem to take any account of proper cross examination of anything. In the area of sexual harassment, a case has just concluded recently in Western Australia. An absentee hotel owner was found guilty of sexual harassment-by the way, we have in this a vicarious liability of employers. This poor devil was in Perth whilst his hotel was operating in Kalgoorlie. His customers apparently made some lewd gestures to a couple of female entertainers and the tribunal hit him for $45,000 damages because of his apparent failure to anticipate, presumably by mental telepathy, that that night his customers were going to get drunk and make some lewd gestures to some women who were standing up on a stage in some state of undress, possibly, and encouraging it. Is that the way we run the law in this country? Is that giving people rights? Is that giving them protection if we take a national perspective? I say no. I say that is wrong with your legislation. Come back some time with couple something that the people can reasonably understand, that gives the courts proper instruction and that does not create all these opportunities for people to be harassed through the law, and we may give it some consideration. Debate (on motion by Mr Latham) adjourned. House adjourned at 11.10 p.m. NA NA Mr Connolly to ask the SpeakerWill he seek advice from the President of the . Senate as to whether the Financial Management, Services section of the Department of Senate obtained legal advice in 1994 on various matters from the Australian Government Solicitor; if so, (a) on what occasions, (b) why, (c) what advice was obtained and (d) what did it cost. NA The following notices were given: Mr Filing to move That this House: (1) notes that the current Telecommunications Act gives telephone companies the right to erect often unsightly communications towers in virtually any area they choose without consultation with local residents and councils; (2) notes that additional towers are being built in areas where structures already exist which could adequately support the necessary equipment; and (3) calls on the Government to amend the Act to (a) ensure a right of veto for local councils in the event of an impasse between the community and company in relation to building proposals and (b) ensure maximum co-location of facilities on existing structures is required before the construction of additional towers. Dr Theophanous to present a bill for an act to make certain amendments relating to the Health and Other Services (Compensation) Act 1994. Mr Walker to move That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Construction of a new chancery at Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea. The following answers to questions were circulated: Development Allowance Authority (Question No. 1340) Mr MCGauran asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 23 August 1994: (1) How many applications were received by the Development Allowance Authority for the development allowance before each deadline for submission of applications. (2) How many applications were refused. (3) Is it the practice of the Authority to offer unsuccessful applicants an opportunity to resubmit their applications. (4) Did the Authority offer applicants whose applications were not signed in accordance with the Development Allowance Authority Act the opportunity to resubmit a properly signed application. (5) How many valid applications received before each deadline were considered for registration. (6) How many applications considered for registration were (a) granted and (b) refused registration. (7) How many applicants granted registration have been issued with pre-qualifying certificates. (8) What was the cost of operating the Authority in each year of its operation. (9) What is the estimated tax foregone by the Commonwealth as a result of the operation of the development allowance.",138
195,Mr WILLIS,NOTICES,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Development Allowance Authority (DAA) has provided me with advice regarding the numbers of applications for the development allowance that have been received, refused, registered and pre-qualified. The DAA has advised me that over 500 applications were received by the statutory deadlines of 31 December 1992 generally and 16 February 1994 for projects in the motor vehicle industry and print production aspects of the print media industry. (2) 16 as at 30 September 1994. (3) Under the Development Allowance - thority Act 1992 the DAA may either grant or refuse an application for registration. The DAA may also refuse to consider an application unless the applicant gives information requested by the DAA. The NA Act provides for an applicant to request the DAA to reconsider a decision of the DAA (including a decision to refuse an application). Also, an application may be made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for a review of decisions of the DAA (including a decision to refuse an application). Apart from these avenues of appeal, the DAA is not empowered to offer unsuccessful applicants an opportunity to reapply once the deadlines for applications have passed. However prior to the closing dates for applications the DAA Secretariat practice was, to the extent possible, to advise applicants whose applications were in non-complying form to resubmit a conforming application by the statutory deadlines. (4) See (3) above. In a number of instances the Authority has sought to clarify whether an applicant's signature was in accordance with the Act. (5) All applications are considered for registration by the DAA against the eligibility criteria and other requirements laid down in the Act. Following this consideration applications for registration may be refused or granted, or consideration may be refused until information requested by the DAA is provided [see (6) below]. (6) (a) 227 as at 30 September 1994. (b) 16 as at 30 September 1994. (7) 13 as at 30,rSeptember 1994. (8) The Development Allowance Authority is assisted by a Secretariat funded by the Department of the Treasury. Expenditure for the two financial years of operation is shown below. 1992/1993 $451 460 1993/1994 $964243 (9) The Government's One Nation statement foreshadowed that estimated revenue foregone as a result of the development allowance would be 1994/95 $40 million 1995/96 $70 million These estimates are being revised and reviewed as the timing of project investment becomes available. I have been advised by the Authority that the stream of company income tax deductions as a result of the development allowance started twelve months earlier than forecast in One Nation, and although the company tax rate has recently been reduced to 33%, the value to proponents of the revenue foregone over the years covered in the One Nation estimates is now more than twice that included in those estimates. Department of Housing and Regional Development: Grants (Question No. 1409) Mr Richard Evans asked the Minister for Housing and Regional Development, upon notice, on 24 August 1994: (1) How many grants did the Minister's Department make to individuals or organisations in the 1992-93 Program Amount Local Capital Works $7,189.00 Program Local Government (Fi- $877,769.00 nancial Assistance) Act 1993-94 Local Government De- $27,360.00 velopment Program Integrated Local Area $30,000.00 Planning Program Local Government (Fi- $843,090.00 nancial Assistance) Act National Access Regime (Question No. 1507) Mr Scott asked the Minister for Housing and Regional Development, upon notice, on 19 September 1994: (1) Did the Hilmer report on national competition policy recommend that the relevant Commonwealth Minister have the power to declare access to an essential facility in the event of the facility's owner denying access. (2) How would the proposed access to essential facilities regime affect local government's ability to plan for the long term provision of essential services. electoral division of Cowan in (a) 1992-93 and (b) 1993-94. (2) With respect to each grant made in (a) 199293 and (b) 1993-94, (i) under what program was it made, (ii) what was its value and (iii) what was the name of the recipient.",139
196,Mr HOWE,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1)(a) Six; (b) Six. (2)(a), (b) (i, ii and iii) Recipient City of Stirling $1,090,574,00 Shire of Swan General Purpose Grants Roads Grants $386,017.00 Bayswater Council $2,387,940.00 $1,231,960.00 Stirling Council $1,351,875.00 $604,398.00 Shire of Swan $2,239,154.00 $1,196,611.00 Wanneroo Council City of Bayswater Shire of Swan General Purpose Grants Road Grants $400,215.00 Bayswater Council $2,414,498.00 $1,255,203.00 Stirling Council $12,988,466.00 $738,183.00 Shire of Swan $2,261,202.00 $1,197,362.00 Wanneroo Council (3) Is he able to say whether the proposed regime could lead to local government authorities being forced to provide third parties with access to facilities such as water supply headworks or sewerage disposal equipment.",140
197,Mr HOWE,ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The recommendation of the Hilmer repoit states where the owner of a facility has not consented to a declaration to grant access, the Minister may make such a declaration only if recommended by the National Competition Council. The proposed national access regime is set out in the National Competition Policy Legislative Package which was released for public comment on 5 September 1994. (2) The Council of Australian Governments' meeting of 19 August 1994 agreed in general to the establishment of a regime to provide access to essential facilities such as electricity grids, gas pipelines, airports, rail networks, postal delivery services, communications channels and seaports. The proposed national access regime will only apply where; the facility is of national significance; access is not already the subject of an effective regime; access would promote competition; access can be provided without undue risk to human health or safety; and access is otherwise in the public interest. The proposed regime should not affect local government's ability to plan. for the long term provision of essential services. (3) Under the proposed national access regime, the Minister can make a declaration only in limited circumstances. Declaration does not entitle a third party to access.

Disabled: Job Compact Wage Subsidies (Question No. 152-) Dr Wooldridge asked the Minister for Human Services and Health, upon notice, on 20 September 1994: (1) Does the Job Compact exclude eligibility to persons who receive the Disability Support Pension. (2) Does the Job Compact offer persons without disabilities a greater level of wage subsidies than is available to recipients of the Disability Support Pension; if so, what other programs exist to ensure that disability support pensioners are not further disadvantaged. Mr Crean-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Job Compact applies to jobseekers who have been continuously in receipt of Job Search Allowance or Newstart Allowance for 18 months or more. Jobseekers in receipt of the Disability Support Pension, or other pension recipients, are not eligible for the Job Compact as the reciprocal obligation requirements under the Job Compact would be inconsistent with the entitlement nature of pensions. (2) The level of wage subsidy paid to an employer is based on the duration of a person's registration with the CES as unemployed, irrespective of whether they are eligible for the Job Compact or are on different forms of income support. People with disabilities are likely to be - entified as at high risk of long term unemployment an- will then be eligible for immediate access to labour market program assistance.
