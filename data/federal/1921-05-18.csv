WHEAT BOARD. SALES AND ADMINISTRATION. Sir JOSEPH COOK.^On the 2Sth April the honourable member for Yarra (Mr Tudor) asked the Prime Minister the following questions:1. What were the gross receipts of the Australian Wheat Board from export sales of wheat and flour in the following seasons:1915-10. 1016-17, 1917-1.8, 1918-19, and 1919-20? 2. What were the total amounts paid to wheat-growers in the above mentioned seasons? 3. What were the total expenses' incurred during those seasons for handling and disposal, including commission paid to the London selling agents and other brokers, and all other charges on the export sales of wheat and flour? 4. Is it a fact, as stated in the Age of 20th ult., that administrative and handling charges on the disposal of Australian wheat amount to between 2d. and 3d. per bushel? Inquiries have been made in regard to this matter, and I now desire to inform the honourable member that full details of the Board's operations aTe not yet available, but will be published as soon as possible. On the 28th April the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin) asked the Prime Minister the following questions :1. Is it a fact that a sale of 300,000 tons of Australian wheat was made to the French Government, as announced by Mr A. B. Earle, of Messrs. S. Sanday & Co., in Sydney, on 14th February last? 2. What was the c.i.f. price paid by the French Government? 3. What was the c.i.f. pTiee received tralia? 4. Did Sanday & Co. negotiate this sale as brokers or merchants? 0. If as merchants, what was the c.i.f. <price paid by them? 6. If as brokers, what was 'their commission ? 7. What commission did the Wheat Board'so tralia ? selling agents in London receive in connection with the transaction? Inquiries nave been made in connection with. the matter, arid I now desire to f u r nish the following replies:1. Yes. 2. 112s. Gd. per quarter. 3. 112s. 6d. per quarter. 4. As far as the Australian Wlieat Board is aware, as .brokers. 5. See No. 4. 6. One per cent. 7. Thirteen-thirty-seconds per cent, f.o.b. value. On the 28th A p r i l the honourable ber for Yarra (Mr Tudor) asked the publish Prime . Minister the following quesrepresentatives tions :1. In view of the claim advanced by the Auscial tralian Wlieat Board that the Pool has elimito nated middlemen, is it a fact 300,000 tons of Australian wheat to the French Government was made through Messrs. Sanday & Co.? 2. As the details of the sale are said to have been common knowledge in France for weeks, is it a fact that the wheat-growers of tions :Australia have been kept in ignorance of the transaction ? 3. Why, was not the sale made direct to the representative of the French Government in London ? Inquiries have been made in connection with the matter, and I now desire to fur nish the following replies:1. Yes. 2. No publication of 'this sale or any other sale on account of the season 1920-21 hitherto .been made by the Australian Wheat Board. To publish details of individual actions would be inimical to growers' interests. The Australian Wheat Board, is endeavouring to market the harvest on commercial prinfailed ciples. Successful operations will be imposto sible if tue Australian Wheat Board has conduct its business with open doors. It is calamitous. only recently that the Board has become aware that essential facts relating to were published by the buyer's broker. 3. The selling agency endeavours to get into direct touch with buyers. It cannot, however, decline to negotiate because business is put forward by brokers, especially if such business is attractive. On the ^Sth April the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr Makin) Sir Joseph Cook. hy Austhe Prime Minister the following questions :1. What was the c.i.f. price paid by .Germany for the parcel of 60,000 tdns of Australian : wheat? 2. What was the d.i.f. price received by Aus3.

Is it a fact that the terms conceded to> Germany were half cash against documents, balance at the end of the year, free of interest? Inquiries have been made in connection with .the matter, and I now desire to f u r on the nish the following replies:Satisfactory sales have been made to Germemmany, but the Australian Wheat Board cannot .particulars of individual sales without the consent of the buyers. The wheat-growers' on the Board are acquainted! with all the Board's transactions. The efficient conduct of the Board's commeroperations would be impossible if it were publish details of its dealings with indivithat the sale of dual 'customers. On the 28th A p r i l the honourable member for Calare (Mr Lavelle) asked the some Prime Minister the following ques, 1. Is it a fact, as stated in the Age of 27tb April, that, as a result of ill-advised action on the part of the Australian Wheat Board in regard to freight, the wheat-growers of Australia will be saddled with a heavy loss? 2. Is it a fact that, although the current - rate of freight on wheat to the TJnited Kingdom is in the vicinity of 50s. a ton, the Board is paying 151s. 6d. per ton on wheat recently despatched ? has Inquiries have been made in connection with the matter, and I now desire to f u r transnish the following replies:1. No. Had the Australian Wheat Board to secure an adequate supply of freight enable it to make and fulfil contracts, the to result to wheat-growers would have beent 2. As to certain shipments these figures are the contract approximately correct. PAPER.

Item 40Broom corn millet and rice straw, per central, 4s.",22
34,Mr CHARLTON,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,Hunter^ [3.24] Wihen this item was before us on Friday last the Minister for Trade and Customs { Mr Greene) promised that he would further consider the question of increasing the duty. I should like to know whether he is in a position now to make a statement on the subject?,24
35,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [3.25]-Since Ihe question of increasing this duty was raised in Committee I have looked into it very carefully, and so far as I can ace the Committee may safely increase the duty to 8s. per central without imposing on the manufacturers of brooms a burden which they cannot stand up to under the .Tariff.",24
36,Mr MATHEWS,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,Why not raise their - protective duty?,24
37,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"So far as I can see that is unnecessary. I am told that a thousand brooms can be made out of a ton of broom millet, and at that rate, assuming that the whole duty of 8s. per central were passed on, it would amount to only 2$d. per broom. Having regard to the duties that we. impose on brushware, I think we can safely make this increase. I move That the item he amended by adding the following words, "" And on and after 19th. May, 1921, per central, 8s.""  £3.27] - There is one aspect of this matter that I.desire to bring specially under the notice of the Minister for Trade and 'Customs (Mr Greene). I have received from Mr J. T. Clout, honorary secretary of the Millet Growers Association, of Tumut, where millet is largely produced, the following letter which he requests me to put before the Minister:The Honourable Massy Greene, Minister for Customs, 31 Spring-street, Melbourne. Dear Sir,- I am directed by the Tumut Millet Growers Association to bring under your notice the grave danger of the introduction of the corn borer into Australia from Southern Europe through the importation of broom millet. This is of the opinion that the only way to guard against the pest is by the total prohibition of millet, whether used for packing or otherwise, also corn stalks of fodder. We recognise that you will take prompt action in the way we suggest. In a covering letter addressed to me Mr. Clout writesDear Sir,- I am directed by the Tumut Millet Growers Association to ask you if you would be so kind as to place the enclosed communication before the Minister for Customs, and at the same time urge upon him the necessity of taking the action we suggest re the corn borer? I may state that the corn borer has caused very grave devastation in Canada and the United States, and was introduced into these countries by importing millet from Southern Europe. During last year some hundreds of tons of millet was imported into Australia from Southern Europe, and if this is allowed to continue the pest will soon be established here. The corn borer attacks maize, millet, sorghums, beans, oats, potatoes, and many other plants, vegetables, and flowers, also grasses. You will see that this is a very serious question; if this pest gets a footing here the result will be disastrous to the farming community. The Department of Agriculture of New South Wales say that so far the borer has not made its appearance, but there is a possibility of introduction with the next shipment.",24
38,Mr JACKSON,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"In the event of prohibition being refused, what duty do the millet growers in the honourable member's electorate want? 0  not stated. The Minister, however, is proposing an increase.",24
39,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"We are proposing to increase the duty by 100 per cent.  goes along the road to some extent to meet their washes, and if it is the best the Minister is prepared to do we must be satisfied with it ; but these people, who know more about the matter than I do, see a grave danger of the introduction of the pest. I would therefore urge the Minister, if he admits the seriousness of the question, to try to meet their wishes.",24
40,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [3.31] - This is scarcely a matter that arises on the Tariff, but it came under my notice a l little while ago, and I immediately took certain action through the Quarantine branch. I have arranged, as a temporary measure, at all events, that no millet shall be allowed to be imported until it has been thoroughly examined and fumigated. Mr Bxxii - Does that apply to millet seed ?",25
41,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"I do not think it covers seed, except in so far as the regulations necessitate the examination of seed of all kinds imported. I am having inquiries made in Canada, America, and elsewhere, as to the action taken in those countries and the reasons there for. If , as the result of those inquiries, we deem it desirable to take the action suggested by my honourable friend to protect Australia from the introduction of a dangerous pest, I do not think the Government will hesitate to do it.",25
42,Sir ROBBMT BEST,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"In the meantime, your seed regulations are very drastic and very useful.",25
43,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"The seed regulations, and the regulations we have put through in regard to the examination and fumigation of anything that comes in, will, I think, fully protect the people until such time as I have made furtlicr inquiries.",25
44,Dr EARLE PAGE,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Cowper) [3.33] I support the Minister's amendment for an increase in the duty. During the war years, the import of .millet practically fell to nothing; but immediately the war was over it almost approximated to that of pre-war days. The manufacture of brooms is essentially a home industry, which can be effectively carried out by small families alongside the place where the raw product is grown. Even people who are not able to follow other occupations can follow that one. It is essential, in order to perpetuate the industry, especially in country districts, to protect to some degree the home-grown crop. given you a higher duty. That such protection is necessary shown by the figures of the cost duction, which has been estimated, in King River Valley of Victoria,, ae follows :Assuming it to be a good crop, of broom, and basing its yield at 1 ton of threshed fibre to 3 acres, which is above the average on the Government Statistician's figures, the production cost on the lowest possible estimate is :£ s. d . Rent of land per acre ... ... 1 0 ft Plowing 15s., Cultivating 10s., Seeding 5s., Manuring 5s., per acre ... ... ... 1 IS O Cutting crop, employees 15s. per day, or contract price per acre 2 5 0> Carting into shed, threshing fibre, engine hire, baling, wiring, and carting, per ton, cost £ 7 10s., equals per acre ... ... 2 10 0> Total per acre ... ... 7 10 9 That is the estimate of a good crop; but on reviewing figures supplied by the Statists of Victoria and New South Wales, it was found that over the triennial period 1917-1919 theyield was 5 cwt - o r 5 cwt. and 2$ cwt. respectively - and with prices fluctuating from £2R to £71 per ton, and averaging throughout £49 per ton, the gross return to the grower amounted to £9 8s. 4d. per acre per annum, which, on the estimate of cost P ieft little margin over the expenses in volved. ' The work of growing and harvesting broom is mostly done by settleos on small holdings, assisted by their families or hired labour. Of the total cost of production, which is £25 per ton,, rather more than four-fifths - is paid out for labour alone, and, estimating the yield of fibre in the King Valley this season to be 200 tons, it means that £4,000* is spent during the season amongst the workers engaged, a sum of considerableimportance to them in making up a living „ wage. The work is of an exacting nature, and fills all the hours of daylight. It has been found that fibre has been imported 1 from overseas, principally from Italy and Japan, at as low a cost as £11 per ton landed, and this season, I understand, at about £32. The existing Tariff is-£4 per ton, but the producers are strongly of opinion that to afford some measure of protection and security a duty of not less than £14 per ton should be imposed.",25
45,Sir ROBERT BEST,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"The Minister has; What is can be wrong? Are you opposing it? of proc - Dr EARLE PAGE - No , I am supthc porting it. I ammerely putting before the Committee additional information which should, I think, be in their possession. Amendment agreed to. Item, as amended, agreed to. Item 41(A) Butter and cheese, per lb., 3d. (u) Butter substitutes as prescribed by Departmental By-laws, per lb., 3d.",25
46,Mr GREGORY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Dampier) [3.36] Before we go further I should like from the Minister an authoritative statement regarding the headings. These are ""British preferential Tariff,"" ""intermediate Tariff,"" and ""general Tariff."" Does ""British preferential T a r if f "" mean merely the TJnited Kingdom ,of Great Britain and Ireland, or will it include all British possessions?",26
47,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,It means Great Britain and Ireland.,26
48,Mr GREGORY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"In the last Tariff the heading was ""United Kingdom."" I felt that the Minister's intention was to apply that column merely to Great Britain and Ireland, hut when I was discussing the matter with some friends recently I was not quite emphatic when I began to look into it, because there was a possibility that it would include places like Canada and New Zealand. I should like the Minister to make the intention clear for the information of others as well as myself.",26
49,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [3.38] - The only reason we altered the heading from "" United Kingdom "" to "" British preferential "" was that in the Bill to which this is the schedule it is proposed to make certain provisions whereby, if a reciprocal Tariff arrangement can be arrived at between a British Dominion or Dominions and ourselves, we shall be able to extend 'to those Dominions the British preferential rates. That was the idea in altering the heading to ""British preferential Tariff."" It is not intended, although it would be open to us to do so, that the whole of the British preferential rates shall apply to any one of the Dominions. It is intended that we shall have the power to extend the British preferential rates in regard to any particular items, or, if the Committee likes, in regard to the whole Tariff, to any British Dominion or Dominions in return for similar advantages granted to us by them.",26
50,Mr GREGORY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,Would not any arrangement we may make come under the intermediate Tariff?,26
51,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"The honourable member will see, if he refers to the speech in which I introduced the Tariff, that, if we are able to arrange a reciprocal Tariff with a British Dominion, the Bill will give us the power to extend to it the British preferential rates, it may be, on some items, the intermediate Tariff rate on other items, and the general Tariff rate on yet other items, thu3 leaving that Dominion in regard to some things on the general list, putting it on. the intermediate list in regard to others, and on the British preferential list in regard to still others. That will be a matter of definite arrangement which will ultimately come back to this House for ratification. It is not proposed to open up the British preferential Tates to countries other than British Dominions in regard to any reciprocal Tariff arrangements. What is proposed is power to grant intermediate rates; and that is the real reason why we altered the description in the first column to "" B r it is h "" preferential.",26
52,Mr GREGORY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"The Minister will realise how difficult it is, not only now, but on other occasions, to discuss a matter of the kind when the Bill is not before us.",26
53,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"The honourable member will understand my j>osition. Until the Committee of Ways and Means has agreed to the schedule, I am unable to introduce the Bill. I have explained, however, the general provisions of the Bill, and as soon as I am in a position to do so I shall bring the measure down. Item agreed to. Item 42Candles, tapers, and night lightsBritish. InterGeneral, mediate, per lb. per lb. per lb. (A) Wax, wholly or l$d. 2d. 2d. in part (B) M.E.I. ... Id. l j d . l j d.",26
54,Mr CHARLTON,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Hunter) [3.41] It is contended by those who manufacture candles that these duties are insufficient. They point out that there is quite a number of candle factories in Australia, and that the local candles are equal to those produced in any part of the world. Those who are interested in this matter, and who desire the duties to be, A, Britisb, 2d., intermediate, 24d., and .general, 3d., with ' B , iH-d., 2d., and S^d., have 'forwarded the following information to me:The candle industry should 'be purely Australian. The quality of the Australian stearine candle, which is manufactured from Australian tallow, is equal to the production in any other part of the world. Nine stearine candle factories aire at work making candles from Australian fallow, which is produced from Australian sheep and cattle. All the labour, including the .raising of thi sheep and cattle, the rendering of the tallow, making the stearine, and moulding and packing the candles, is Australian, while the labels used are printed'.in Australia, the cartons made from Australian,materials, and the boxes from Australiau timber. Everything is Australian in connection with the stearine candles : made in the Commonwealth with the lexeepfion of the wick. No increase in duties has-been .granted, and as the chief competition comes from Burmah, Where - practically everything but the wick is made by black 'labour, it .is necessary, now local rates of wages have increased so substantially, and the price of coal and other items is so much higher, that the measure of Protection should be increased to enable the industry to stand the strain. There are over 1,000 ..persons employed directly in the candle factories Of the Commonwealth, and indirectly a further very large number. In view of the many candle factories at present in existence, and - the number of people employed, together with the subsidiary .industries, this is a matter of some importance to Australia. ""Wages have been increased and hours shortened; and there are, therefore, some reasons why the Minister - should reconsider the matter with a view to increasing the - duties to a reasonable extent.",26
55,Sir ROBERT BEST,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Kooyong) [ 3 . 4 4 ] - I support the suggestion of ^the Acting Leader of the Opposition .(Mr. Charlton) that the duties be increased. The candle industry is essentially an Australian one. Manufacturers of candles have to choose between making them from ' stearine or from paraffin - wax. The manufacturer of candles should be encouraged and urged to make them from stearine, which, after all, is only a further development - of an Australian industry. First, there is the raising of the cattle, then the rendering of tha tallow, and the moulding of the candles, followed by ""the packing, labelling, and so on, all of which means Australian ' labour. It will 'be seen, therefore, that we are called upon to afford every encouragement in - this case. If , on the other hand, manufacturers are discouraged, from making candles' from stearine, there will be large importations <of paraffin wax from which to make our candles. We import, if not the whole, nearly the whole of the paraffin wax used, and this means cutting out all intermediate Australian labour. I 'hope that Che Minister is not opposed to the suggestion that has been made, but if he is, I anticipate an. argument he may - use. The. Minister may admit that this is an Australian industry, but say that 'the manufacture of candles has been so successful in the past that practically the whole of this commodity is made in Australia. That is so, having regard to war experience, but .that experience was not normal. . The .competition to be feared is that of black labour, (particularly in Burmah. During the last few years, no doubt, the Burmese exportations into Australia have been small. Mr J. BL CATTS - Hav e you any figures as - to the importations ?",27
56,Sir ROBERT BEST,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"So far as my recollection goes, we manufacture 11,000,000 lbs. weight of candles, representing £'500,000 in value, while the i m portations are 6,000 lbs. - Mr GREENE - No . The largest importations in any one year were 423,000 lbs. of candles.",27
57,Sir ROBERT BEST,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"That was last year or the year before, and I attach no importance whatever to those figures. My judgment is that there were - many reasons why it was only necessary .for the manufacturer of Burmah to .place sufficient candles on the market to preserve 'their brands under the Trade Marks Act. If the present duty is not increased, it wilf be . open to the black labour of Burmah to swamp our industry. Hitherto the i m portations of wax have been such that it was not necessary for the manufacturers' of Burmah to send candles.; they sent paraffin wax instead of candles, and, therefore, it was not necessary to enter into competition. In my belief, there, is a 'genuine danger that, if the - duties are not increased, Burmah. may .be able to swamp our market.. H'aving regard to the fact that ithe candle industry is essentially an Australian one from beginning to end, we must run no risks. The danger incidental to the lower duty is a real one, so I urge the Minister to accede to the request of the Acting Leader of the Opposition. No harm can be dome by increasing the duty in the interests of this essentially Australian industry, and in view of the special circumstances under which importations have been made. It may be suggested that this will lead to the creation of an Australian monopoly, but that is hardly likely, for the simple reason that there are already eight Australian! industries well established throughout Australia, and in keen competition one with the other. . The industry employs 1,000 meu, and is furnishing the home market with all-its requirements at reasonable prices.",27
58,Mr MATHEWS,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,I do not agree with vou. Tallow is down 300 per cent.,28
59,Sir ROBERT BEST,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"I cannot say to what extent the market for tallow has dropped; but whatever tallow is required, the production of stearine is drawn from other Australian primary industries. In these circumstances, I urge the Minister to grant the increase of duty suggested by the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Charlton).. Eor the moment I do not propose to move myself for the increase; but the question whether* a - private member may do this will have to lie determined sooner or later. Speaker Holder held that it was competent for any private member to move an increase in duty during the debate on a Tariff measure.",28
60,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,Onl y in Committee of Ways and Means.,28
61,Sir ROBERT BEST,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Yes. in that Committee now. I admit that Speaker Holder's decision was not assented to by another' Speaker; but it is obvious, in the present form of OUT Constitution, that every private member should have the right to - move an increase of duty. This may be against precedent in the Mother Country, but we have to be guided by our own 'Constitution, and if tjie Senate has power to request an increase or decrease, it would be anomalous for the House of Representatives to be debarred from increasing a duty. If the Chairman is satisfied that' a private member is at liberty to move for an increase, I would suggest that the honourable member for Hunter do so in this item. I shall have pleasure in supporting him.",28
62,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [3.55] - I nave looked into this matter very carefully. Personally I do not think the increase asked for can be justified.,28
63,Mr MATHEWS,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,Do you not think that we ought to settle now the question whether a private member has the right to move an increase of duty?,28
64,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"If the Chairman is asked and is prepared to give a ruling, I shall resume my seat.",28
65,Mr CHARLTON,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,I intend to test the feeling of the Committee by submitting a motion to increase the-duty.,28
66,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Ver y well, I am as anxious as any other honourable member to keep this industry for Australia, because it use3 up one of the raw materials of our primary industries. The position very briefly is, as the lionorable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) has stated. As far as I am able to leam, the only country from which we may expect keen competition in candles is India, and, therefore, I am prepared to consider an increase on the general Tariff rate, but I think i d . inerease will givo. us all the protection we need. It will practically protect us from unfair competitionfrom India.",28
67,Sir ROBERT BEST,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,What is the objection to increasing the whole of the three Tariffs?,28
68,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,I am doubtful as to the need.,28
69,Mr GREGORY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,Has there been an exWe are port trade?,28
70,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Yes , and as far as I can gather the industry in Australia is in a fairly satisfactory position, but a little time ago the Burmah Oil Gompany endeavoured to compel our candle manufacturers to take their wax, and they attempted a dumping proposition. Candles were imported in considerable quantities, and they are still coming in. Practically the whole of our importations are from that-source, but if we grant an increase in the duty to 2$d. we shall have all the protection we need, and at the same time the duty will not be excessive. That is my suggestion to the Committee.",28
71,Sir ROBERT BEST,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,Mak e it 3d.,28
72,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"I am prepared to move along the lines I have indicated, but do not want to do so at the moment if the Committee - wishes to diseuas the matteT further.  the Minister (Mr Greene) is able to prove that this higher duty will cheapen candles I must oppose the proposition. The honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) said this was essentially an Australian industry. I would point out to honourable members that candles are the principal lighting medium for many people living in remote parts of the Commonwealth, and they are largely used also in mining and other operations. Therefore, we should give the matter very serious consideration .before we allow one section of the community to have a monopoly at the expense of another. There is another light, the product of carbide of calcium, equal almost to electricity. Not long ago an embargo placed upon carbide prevented many people from enjoying this light. Here is an attempt to create another monopoly. I hope that the Committee will not consent to any further increase in the duty. Rather, in the circumstances, should it be decreased.",28
73,Mr GREGORY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Dampier) [4.1] - I always understood . that the Protectionist insisted that the object of adopting a Protective policy was to try to build up industries locally, and make commodities cheaper; that the more the duties were increased the cheaper articles would be for local consumption; and I am, therefore, surprised that a suggestion should come from the other side of the chamber that the duty on an article that goes into every poor man's home should be increased, knowing in this case that it must increase the price of the article. . The honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best) might not be affected by an increased duty on candles, but many people living in ihe bush, and persons in poor circumstances, would be considerably affected, and furthermore, a big tax would be imposed on the mining industry of Australia. In the circumstances I think it would be a big mistake to increase this duty unless, of course, it the community. can be shown that the local industry has been going back, and finds it impossible to compete with importations. But, on the contrary, the Minister (Mr Greene) and the honourable member for Kooyong have shown us that the Australian candle making industry is flourishing; and we all know, as a matter of fact, that the large factories which have been established throughout Australia have not only been able to compete with the world, but also have been in a position to export candles. In the circumstances,' no increase in the duty can be justified unless the purpose is to raise additional revenue, and if we want to do this we should not increase the duties on articles which go into the poor man's home. Rather should we tax luxuries. We hear reports of mines closing down in Queensland, Tasmania, and Western Australia on account of industrial conditions, due to the high cost of living, and because of a Tariff which places special imposts on everything required by the industry. Every time we increase the duties we increase the cost of living, yet now we have a surprising suggestion from an honourable member opposite which must have the effect of increasing the cost of mining operations. We ought to follow the example of Canada, .and impose Excise duties on luxuries. For instance, if a person buys a hat above a certain value he should be obliged to pay an Excise duty* oft it. The idea is to make people economize. My purpose in considering this Tariff is to cheapen the cost of living. I shall ask for the removal of the duty on tinned fish for the purpose of endeavouring to make conditions better in this country. We cannot afford to continue as at present. We cannot pay high wages if the value of our products will not stand them. We ought to do"" all we possibly can to induce economy and reduce the cost of living, but by increasing this duty we shall be acting contrary to all that is regarded as best in regard to economic conditions. I hope the Minister will not depart from his original proposition. No increase of this duty is justified. The candle-making industry is thriving; but, apart altogether from that fact,. an increase in the duty would hurt the mining industry, particularly gold mining, and considerably affect the poorer sections of",29
74,Mr JH CATTS,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Cook) [4.5] - I am prepared to vote for an increased duty on candles or any other commodity which is shown to be justified, but I am not ready to vote for an increase in this case, which probably would, in the absence of evidence as to its necessity, merely tend to increase the price of candles to the people. The honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Eobert Best) told ns we must beware of Rangoon candles. It should be easy for those interested in the industry to put some facts before us to show us the export price of candles at Rangoon, the freight across the sea, and the effect of our existing duty. Then, if these articles were sought to be imported under a fair price, according to the country of origin, we could have some provision against dumping. There are in the Cook electorate possibly more candle manufacturers than there are in any other electorate in Australia; but, as none of them have approached me in regard to this matter, I take it that they are perfectly satisfied with ,the existing duty. Again, as the impost in this schedule is the same as appeared in the previous Tariff, the industry has evidently not made out a case to satisfy the Government that an increase is necessary. feci sure that, if a case had been made out, the Minister (Mr Greene) would have granted an increase.",29
75,Mr GREENE,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,The competition from Burmah arose after the duty in this schedule was settled.,30
76,Mr JH CATTS,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Some years ago we had a very long discussion in regard to Rangoon candles. I think it was on the discussion of the 1908 Tariff. At that time. I was very anxious that a duty should be imposed that would establish the Australian industry against cheap competition; but, as far as I know, the imported candles have practically gone out of use, not merely because of the war, but as a consequence of the duty imposed in 1908.",30
77,Mr GREENE,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"The biggest importation of recent years has been 423,280 dozen. It fell to 75,000 dozen, but is rising again.",30
78,Mr JH CATTS,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"When the Bill is before the House the Minister can deal with dumping, but we should have something more than simple expressions of opinion to justify the conclusion that the candle-making industry requires this suggested further Protection. While I am willing to give every possible Protection to Australian industries, I would regard it as a mistake simply to increase the duty to enable the candle manufacturers of Australia to put their heads together and take the increase out of the public.",30
79,Mr GREENE,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,We do not propose to interfere with the British preferential Tariff.,30
80,Mr JH CATTS,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"That Tariff does not cover India, and I do not take much notice of the British preferential Tariff on candles, because, owing to the fact that - Great Britain has to import her raw materials from enormous distances, she could not manufacture candles and send them out here. Our natural Protection in this regard would prevent her from sending -.andles to Australia. A very substantial case should be made out before the Minister seeks to increase the present duty on candles. So far, no case has been made out for an increase, and, until one is made out, 2 shall vote against any such proposal.",30
81,Mr CHARLTON,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Hunter) [4.10] - I understand that the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) is prepared to increase the duty upon this itemund^r the general Tariff to 2^d. per lb. In view of the discussion which has taken place, and especially in view of the statements which have been made by the honourable member for Cook (Mr Catts), who has many candle factories in his constituency, I think we shall be doing the right thing if we accept the Minister's offer. If the honourable gentleman will agree to maintain the present duty under the British preferential Tariff, and to increase the impost under the general Tariff by £d. per lb., I think he will meet the needs of the situation.",30
82,Mr GREENE,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,I will agree to that.,30
83,Mr FENTON,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Maribyrnong) [4.12] - I trust that the Minister's offer will be accepted. I shall always be a strenuous opponent of any competition which comes from black-labour countries, irrespective of whether those countries are within or without the Empire. If we are going to tolerate such competition, the best thing we can do is to cancel our White Australia policy. Personally, I would rather admit coloured races to the Commonwealth than have them unfairly competing with our own people whilst resident in other parts of the world. To me it is a great surprise that opposition to the encouragement of .this particular dustry should come from the professed increase. representatives of our primary industries.",30
84,Mr STEWART,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,They arethe direct representatives of those industries.,31
85,Mr FENTON,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"The raw materials come from the farm. Upon these grounds, the Committee will be well vised to accept the mo.derate offer of Minister. I . shall support the increased duty under the general Tariff, because am opposed to black-labour competition, and because I am in favour of encouragtive ing the production in our midst of raw material which finds its way into manufactured article.",31
86,Mr JACKSON,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Bass) [4.13] - On behalf of the honourable member 5for Wentworth (Mr Marks), I have pleasure in supporting the proposed increase this duty. In reply to the remarks of honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr. Fenton), I would point out that the manufacturers of Burmah are not averse to dumping their products in Australia to the detriment of our own manufaccreased turers.",31
87,Mr GBEGORY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,How much comes in?,31
88,Mr JACKSON,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"I am more conit cerned with what has happened, and with what I do not wish to see happen again. Six months ago the Burmah manufachimself turers were selling their wax at Is. per lb.; and as late as March last they were selling candles at 9d. per lb. In these circumstances, we are perfectly justified in seeking the imposition of 'a higher duty.",31
89,Mr JAMES PAGE,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Maranoa) [4.14]. - I am very sorry that the Minister has seen fit to approve of a proposal crease the duty under the general Tariff upon candles, because this is the home of the raw product. Moreover, none of the there is fire. manufacturers engaged in the industry has asked for an increased duty.",31
90,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Yes , they have. request came from the representatives of a manufacturing centre - duty",31
91,Mr JAMES PAGE,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Because one honourable member asks for an increased duty, the Minister is surely not going regard his request as the last word upon the matter.",31
92,Sir ROBERT BEST,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"The Acting inleader of the Opposition asked for the Mr JAMES PAGE,-Has he not as much right to seek an increased duty upon any item as I.have to ask for a reduction of the duty upon it? I am not. concerned with who made the request, but I am concerned with the ready way in adwhich the Minister yielded to it. The the Tariff is not a party question. Honourable members have a free hand upon it, I and are at liberty to do just what they please so long as they retain its Protecincidence. The candle industry is althe ready protected. I well remember the the way in which those interested in it used to lobby when they wished to secure an increased measure of Protection.. Nobody knows that better than does the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert of Best) - They used tobesiege him night the and day; indeed, they; used to ring him up when he was in bed in order' to tell him how the industry was languishing. But upon the present occasion no such tactics have been resorted to. An induty of | d . per lb. is not very much, but a straw will show which way the wind blows. This industry must have a certain measure of Protection to enable to compete successfully with colouredlabour countries. The honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Fenton) Worked into a fine state of frenzy over the question of black-labour competition. In the early days of the Federation, when we were dealing with the sugar industry, he would have beeu a very'valuable ally. But now his remarks represent only so much smoke, because there is no honourable member who wishes our manufacturers to compete with the cheap products to inof black-labour countries.",31

122,Mr ANSTEY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"I am not saying that we should not introduce speedy methods for dealing with any abuse of protection given to locally manufactured articles. I am prepared to admit that Kitchen and Co. is an international monopoly, which is linked up with one of the biggest Combines in the world.",34
123,Sir ROBERT BEST,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,There are - eight independent industries in Australia.,34
124,Mr ANSTEY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,And I am prepared to. prove that they are all in one great Combine or monopoly.,34
125,Sir ROBERT BEST,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,They are not.,34
126,Mr ANSTEY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"I say they are. But I think it is better for us to deal with commercial Combines here and in our own way, because it is impracticable for us to control the conditions under which foreign articles are manufactured. If manufacturers in this country are linked up in one great Combine, we cannot hope to deal with them under the Tariff. There are very powerful commercial organizations existing in Free Trade England. In that country there are some of the greatest monopolies that are to be found in the world. If manufacturers are abusing the privileged conditions under which they are producing, there are other methods of dealing with them.",34
127,Mr STEWART,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,The Government have said that there are no other means.,34
128,Mr ANSTEY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,I do not know what the Government have said; but the Minister for Trade and Customs (Mr Greene) has stated that it was the intention of the Government to introduce a Bil l to control monopolies.,34
129,Mr FENTON,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Yes , that is the intention.",34
130,Mr ANSTEY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,I am glad to hear it.,34
131,Mr STEWART,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,And the same Government have said that they have not the power.,34
132,Mr ANSTEY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,The honourable member may make that statement; but he must remember that if the Government change their policy or opinions every two years they are only doing what other Governments have done.,34
133,Mr GREGORY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,The Prime Minister (Mr Hughes) said that he was going to do something.,34
134,Mr STEWART,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Yes, but he never intended to act.",34
135,Mr ANSTEY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Any Government that does not wish to do a certain thing will find a thousand reasons, constitutional or otherwise, for not doing it . If it is the intention of the Government to control the abuse of privileges' enjoyed by monopolies and Combines under a Protective Tariff, they will have my support when any such proposition is submitted.",34

Not one argument haa been advanced to prove that the candle manufacturers in Australia cannot carry on without the imposition of an additional duty, and yet we are asked to agree ,to it. I am going to vote against the increased duty; and if no other honourable member divides the Committee on this item I shall do so. I rose particularly to answer a statement made by thn honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr. Fenton) to the effect that the. primary producers will have a cut out of the extra duty.",34
137,Mr FENTON,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"I did not say anything of the kind. I did, not say that the primary producers were going to get a' cut out of it.",34
138,Mr STEWART,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"I do not wish to misrepresent the honourable member, and if he did not say the primary producers would get a cut out of it, he certainly inferred that they would get some benefit.",34
139,Mr GIBSON,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,That statement was made by the honourable member for Kooyong (Sir Robert Best).,34
140,Mr STEWART,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Ver y well, I deny it. The candle manufacturers of Australia purchase the raw material at the world's market rates, and if the proposed duty is 2d., 2£d., or even 6d. per lb., they will still pay the same price for the raw material, and that is the export parity.",34
141,Sir ROBERT BEST,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,If candles were manufactured out of paraffin wax it would pay them better.,34

144,Mr MATHEWS,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Melbourne Ports) [4.37] - Personally , I think the proposed duty should be 3d. per lb., and if I thought there was an opportunity of so increasing the rate I would move in that direction. But if I did so I would be told that I was assisting in raising the price of a commodity that is largely used; and if I endeavoured to prevent prices increasgoing ing I would not receive much assistance from the .Country party.",35

156,Mr MATHEWS,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"I would be in favour of a duty of 3d. per lb., although I know that the combination of .manufacturers here would still charge all they possibly could, as it is always their policy to do so. We haye been informed that it is the intention of the Government to attempt- I say . it advisedly-to acquire powers to prevent overcharging.",35
157,Mr STEWART,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,The honourable member has faith in the Government to that extent.,35
158,Mr MATHEWS,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"The promise ""has been made, and I believe the members of the Country party will oppose such a measure, because they do not want the Government to have increased powers. In through the State of Victoria I have heard the views expressed by large .numbers of State Righters who are not in favour of giving additional powers to the Government in this respect. We have been told this afternoon that if an additional duty is imposed ou candles those living in country districts will be penalized, but we should remember that kerosene is very largely used as an illuminant in those districts. What is the position with regard to kerosene today? The Petroleum Combine is charging the people in the country enormous prices, although there is no duty on their product. We are paying as much for kerosene free of duty as we would be if there was a 20 per cent, duty on it. If a duty were imposed the Combines would dump it into Australia in in order to bring down the price of .the local article, if it were found ithat we could produce it . As far as we are concerned, the importer and manufacturer are really the same. Those in Australia who are employed in this industry should be protected. It is an industry whose raw material, tallow, Australia produces in immense quantities, and exports largely. The wages paid to the employees are not so high as I should like them to be, but we cannot expect to make them higher until we have protected the product of 'the industry from the competition of black labour. The proposed duty is not high «nough.",35

160,Mr MATHEWS,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Accordin g to the Chamber of ' Manufactures, the chief competition cornea from Burmah, where 1 practically everything but the wicks used, in the candles is made with black labour. Wages here have increased substantially; - I should like them to be still higherand the price pf coal has gone up - The members of the Chamber of Manufactures think that the duty should beincreased. For some years past, the war; by' preventing importations, has protected looal manufacturers; but tkao protection has now practically:ceased, and the reduction of the values of money and of wages which is taldng place in other parts of the world will result in a competition unfavorable to our manufacturers, unlesB we protect them from it . The' time to give protection is now, before the fiercer competition .which is to be expected can take place; it would be foolish to wait until large importations were being made. As to the protection of the publio againstexploitation by manufacturers, certain decisions of the. High Court, like other decisions of - . that Oourt, may, perhaps, be - reversed; but, in any case, the country can be appealed to for an increase of powers, though that the members of the Country party will oppose. It was my intention to move to increase this duty by I d . , but feeling that such an aniwdment would probably not bo carried in the present temper or the Committee, I do not wish to make) this an occasion for testing the right of a private member to move to increase a duty. Mr IKANCIS' (Henty) [4.44] - To day we must view our industries in a different light from that in which we saw tbem a few years ago. The justification of the proposed duty cannot bo seriously disputed by any honourable member. Now that the war has ceased, the manufacturers of otlier countries are seeking "" fresh woods and pastures new,"" and are endeavouring to at least get back the trade connection that they had before the war. The Tariff has been introduced to protect our manufacturers, and though it bas been called a rovenue-produeing Tariff, this is certainly not a revenue producing item. We have the promise of the Minister that should our manufacturers use the Tariff to increase prices; he will take immediate action in Parliament to protect the consumers. He says that he intends to introduce legislation which ' will prevent. manufacturers from using the Tariff to increase prices.beyond what is reasonable; but I have no doubt that:'our manufacturers"" have at heart the interests of the country .which protects their industry' and'. giveBthem the opportunity to ranks a -.living. The commodity which is protected by this duty uses as its raw material oue of -.our chief primary products, an-d, as.a consequence, our graziers will have & big de: mand - for theutallow. At present Australian znojiufacturors pay on the average £ 3 per ton more for tallow than the worl.dfs parity, which, shows that there is keen competition between them, and that' therefore the price of candles is not likely to be increased. I am as much, interested is the welfr.re of the poorer classes of the community as is any one.' ' I am. also interested in the welfare of the primary producers. These have been, protected in the fixing of the price of wheat, and there was'not very much ooinment or protest froin the Country party when it was made known, that' Australian '' wheat - was being sold to the' German people for' less than it was boing sold on this market. Por my own , part, I would make the Germans pay as much for our wheat .'as we pay here, if ' not more. I think that a protest should have been made by all sections against the selling of wheat to Germany below the Australian rate. As to this duty, I would be prepared to make it as' high, as 3d. I hope that the proposal of the Minister will be oarried without' a division.",36

165,Dr MALONEY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Melbourne) [5.12] Speaking with a long memory of the important industry to which this item relates, I could wish that the Government - althoug h recognising that the Protection afforded by the previously existing duties was added to by increased freights and the difficulty associated with shipping - ha d proposed still higher rates. Like the honourable member for Bourke (Mr.. Anstey), and as an Australian loving my Australia, I want everything that can be made here to be manufactured here. As to the contention that the imposition of high duties may lead to the creation of combines, I tako the view that if we have to deal with a combine it is better that it should be a combine situated in Australia than one haying its head-quarters in some - other country. Even if it be assumed, as - was urgod by Mr ""Wilkinson, who recently won a magnificent prize at the Melbourne University, that there are already combines in Australia, I would oint out that we can deal' with them etter here-the only continent governed by one set of laws-'tha n if they were located elsewhere, and only doing business here! We can subject themj for instance, to heavy income taxation. I bold, therefore, that the argument that high British. Intermediate. or broken, raw ; Cocoa shells, Freo Free Shells and Nibs, roasted ; Cocoa per lb. id. id. per lb. 3d. 3Jd. or ad val. 30 per cent. 40 per cent. whiohever rate returns the higher duty substitutes there for; Caramel; per lb. lid. 2d. for potable use, in powdered .. . . per lb. 3d. 4d inoluding Coooa and Chocofor edible use, or potable use (not or granulated form); Bon-bons of Confectionery containing . . per lb. 3d. 3id. or ad val. 35 per cent. 45 per oent. whichever rate returns the higher duty 30 per cent. duties may lead to combines can be completely answered. It has been shown that the Cadbury firm is going to open large factories in Tasmania.",38
166,Mr BELL,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,They are satisfied with these duties.,38
167,Dr MALONEY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,.Hav e they told the honourable member that they are satisfied with them? Mr BE'IX.!-No ; but they are building their factory.,38
168,Dr MALONEY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"I should like the rates under sub-item B, particularly those on cocoa-mass , paste, or slab-to be increased from Jd. to Id. per lb. under the British preferential Tariff; from $d. to Id. per lb. under the intermediate Tariff; and from f d . to 2d. per. lb. under the general Tariff. Owing to the exigencies of the war, cocoa beans were largely imported from the . neighbouring islands; and I hope.yet to see them grown in Australia. Representatives from Queensland and Western Australia will . agree with me that there are places in the far northern districts of those. States where cocoa beans can be grown. Then, again, we can manufacture cocoa - paste. Australian-made confectionery has reached a very high standard; but the small manufacturers have not been crushed out of existence by those carrying 011 operations on a large scale. There are several small manufacturers of confectionery in this packages? ' city who are school-mates and old friends of mine. To-day £1 sent from Australia to many is equal to £18 10s. in the currency of that country of pre-war days. I adthan mit that the cost of manufacturing goods"" in Germany has increased by 100 per cent., - and possibly even up to 200 or 800 per cent. Even if it had increased by 300 per cent., that increase would more than covered by the increase in the Tariff: purchasing power of our money, seeing that £1 today will purchase twelve and. half times the quantity that it would have purchased in Germany before the war.",38
169,Mr GREGORY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,Fro m what cause!,39
170,Dr MALONEY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"It is principally a Commonwealth, matter of exchange.",39
171,Mr GBEOOBY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,The price of confecber tionery here is very much higher today than it was before the war.,39
172,Dr MALONEY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Prioe s have inplace creased in every country. Another point worthy of consideration is that the fancy boxes in which much of our confectionery is sold con be made here. No doubt, in many cases, one pays a good price for small' quantity of confectionery packed in a very charming box, but the manufacright ture of. the boxes gives employment to a large number of persons. _ Tb. my own knowledge, box manufactories have.sprung up in Melbourne within the last few years, and have been established, I understand, in Sydney and.Adelaide. The box-makmanufacture ing, industry today is an important one here, - and I ' should, therefore, like to the duty, on confectionery in boxes creased to. the following rates:- 4 ozs., per dozen, Is. 6fl., Is. 9d.,, 2s., valorem, 40 per cent., 45"". per cent., 50 per cent. :8-oz. boxes, 2s., 2s. 3d., and hesitate 2s - 83. per dozen, or ad valorem, 40 per that cent.,.45' per cent., and 60""""per. cent.; ozs. and under, 2s. 6d., 2s, 9d. and 3s. per dozen, .or ad valorem, 40 per cent., per cent., and 50 per cent.

Nevertheless, I cannot support the increase:which, the honourable member desires. When he was .speaking, I interjected that .

179,Mr BELL,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"My difficulty is to knew in each case what Protection is necessary to give an industry achance of success. No doubt every honourable member will items. have some knowledge of some industry; but it is hardly likely that every honoraBle member can have a full knowledge all the industries in Australia. therefore, rely very largely on the information given us through the press, and i u the circulars which we receive' very freely every day. I am also prepared rely largely on the information the ister obtained before he brought forward this schedule. I have no doubt that he went very exhaustively into the - whole question, and gave every firm an tunity of presenting their case, and that he will' have every consideration for them; but it is impossible for me to know all the industries from one end of Australia to the other, and therein lies my difficulty in decidingwhat Protection should be given. Where the Minister has the moment, regarding glucose. already provided what I consider to be a good Protection, and other honourable members come forward with proposals for an increase, I shall have ro hear very strong, arguments in favour of the increase before I shall be willing to support ib. shall be surprised if the Minister accepts without very good, reasonsproposals for increases on the very fine Tariff which he glucose. has introduced. Jtr. GBEGOBY (Dampier) [5.33] was surprised at the arguments of the last,two speakers.

I am trying to create in the country, if. not in this Parliament, a little interest in the Tariff. I was more than surprised on Friday afternoon at the small amount of interest that was being taken in Tarif f matters, the importance of which I full y realise. I want now to create some discussion on matters which I . look on as material, with a view to exciting interest in the' Tariff, so that later on, when we reach those large items which to me are of even more, importance, a l it t l e more interest will be taken in them. Wben we were dealing with the'duty on glucose on Friday afternoon",41
186,Mr GREENE,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"If the honourable member is going to discuss items that we have already passed, it w i ll take a long time to get through.",41
187,Mr GREGORY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"I do not propose to allow the Minister to dictate to me the attitude I must adopt. thinks I am out of order, he knows exactly what to do. No notice had been given of the intention to increase the duty on glucose, but it was increased by .the Committee by 50 per cent.' The honourable member for Darwin spoke about the information whioh is being supplied to honourable .members, but in that case the duty was increased by 50 per cent - in' spite of the fact that, during - the year 1919-20, there were practically no imports of glucose, although there was afairly good export trade. There were-, big importations in the. war years 1914-15 and 1915-16, but they gradually diminished until in 1919 only 2 tons were imported.",41
188,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND, Is the honourable member addressing his remarks to item 44 ?,41
189,Mr GREENE,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"I could give an. effective answer to what the honourable member is saying, but I should be discussing an item that has already been passed.",41
190,Mr GREGORY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"I am replying to the statement of the honourable member for Darwin that ample information is being given on the items with which we are dealing. This Tariff is almost wholly in the interests of the manufacturers. Under this item most of the requirements He in the shape of raw materials for the manufacture of chocolates and confectionery, such as cocoa beans, cocoa, shells, and other things, are admitted free, but on the manufactured article the Minister is proposing an enormous increase in the duties. The Minister cannot say, as he did in the case of medicines, that the manufacturers of these goods did well for their country, because, during the war period, it is well known that they rose to the occasion, so far as prices were concerned, to the very Kilt. If one buys a couple of shillings worth of lollies in a shop today, he receives very few to take home. No one can say that the industry is languishing. I should like to see either some duty placed on the raw material for revenue purposes, or a reduction in .the duty on the manufactured article, bringing it back, say, to the level of the 1914 Tariff. I move That tha item be amended by the insertion, after the word "" duty,"". sub-item E, of the words "" and on and after 10th May, 1021, ad valorem, British, 30 per cent.; intermediate, 35 per cent.; general, 40 per cent.",41
191,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [5.40] - First , If he as to the complaint by the honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory), that honourable members have not been f u r nished with information such as has been made available in previous Tariff discussions. My answer is that copies of the bound volume I hold in my hand have been supplied to all members. That volume contains all the available information regarding the various Tariffs and the differences between them. I hare also supplied honourable members with another book containing abstracts of the reports of the Inter-State Commission, together with other statistical information in regard to every item of the Tariff. That information was supplied over twelve months ago, and if honourable members have lost it , I am not responsible. That book also contained considerable information which I - thought exceedingly valuable'for the purposes of this discussion,- but, in the interests of economy, although my officers suggested it , I did not feel justified in issuing another publication covering the ground again. As far as I can, I have supplied honourable membersiwith.all.the information in my power to. which I.thought they were rightly entitled, and in. such a form as to be handy,and convenient. I hope the Committee will not accept the amendment moved by the - honourable member. for Dampier. I am not prepared to ask for any advance in the duty, because I am, not satisfied thati t is required. '.The confectionery industry advanced enormously during the period of the war. As honourable members, know, the importation of confectionery was prohibited ' during that' period, and for this the Government were subjected to a good deal of criticism. Nevertheless, not only have the confectionery factories increased enormously, bitt I can recall two very large firms, which previously manufactured outside this country,'but which have now eome here to carry on their business., I refer to Nestle's and to the Cadbury, Fry, and Pascall combination, the' latter of which has established, a factory in Tasmania. .''"" * ' ' ' . . Mr ""WATKINS -""Where is Nestle's factory?",41
192,Mr GEEENE,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Nestle' s have erected a factory in Sydney, where they are manufacturing on a large scale - This is one of the most important subsidiary industries to the dairy industry that I know of. It does not, perhaps, take the enormous quantities of milk that the butter factories do, but still it takes large quantities, and; consequently; is very valuable to the dairy industry. Above and beyond that, not only does the confectionery industry itself provide an immense amount of employment, but there are large subsidiary industries built up around' it, such as box-making, printing, and a hundred and one other avenues of work. I have here some rather interesting figures, which give an indication of the"" extent - to which the' confectionery industry has grown. In 1913 the importation of cocoa beans, which are the raw material ffbm which chocolate confectionery is made; was 1,408,509 lbs., and by 19191920 that importation had grown to 9,277,591 lbs. The confectionery importedprior to the war amounted to 10,660,518 lbs., and that importation by 1919-20 had dropped to 63,303 lbs. The Value of the 1 imports in 1913, on this one item alone, was £571,956, which last year had dropped to £9-570. Mr ""WATT - Was the partial prohibition operative all through 1920 ?",42
193,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"No , .only par.t of the . . time.",42
194,Mr GREGORY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"And the shortage of ; sugar was, not transparent.",42
195,Mr GEEENE,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"I am now dealing with the importations of confectionery, this has nothing whatever to do with the shortage of sugar in Australia. .",42
196,Mr GREGORY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"We must have manufactured more here, surely?",42
197,Mr GEEENE,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"That is what I am trying to show-that the importation has dropped. The decrease in the importation of confectionery from over £571,956 worth to less than £10,000 worth and the increase in the importation of the Taw material for chocolate confectionery alone, from 1,408,509 lbs. to 9,277,591 lbs., show the extent to which this industry has developed in Australia under the prohibition in operation during the war. - There is one feature on which, I am afraid, the Treasurer (Sir Joseph Cook) will not look on altogether with pleasure.",42
198,Mr GREGORY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,Was there not a fair export trade recently?,42
199,Mr GEEENE,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Not of late. During the period when the local price of sugar was below the world's parity, there was a certain amount of export, but I understand that that export trade, with the exception of some island trade in which we are entitled to share, is now practically non-existent. However, 'the Customs revenue from confectionery has fallen from £145,858 to £5,149.",42
200,Mr WATT,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,It is a wonder the Treasurer does not suggest an Excise.,42
201,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"The Treasurer may think of that, by-and-by. It will be seen that during the war Australia has built up a very valuable industry. Instead of sending large sums of money away to pay for imported confectionery, we are making confectionery for ourselves, and to a very large extent from raw material grown in this country. This industry we should make - a definite effort .to keep, and the duties should be .retained for., at all events, little time.' lit may be .that later shall be tableto faoe a reduction of .duties without any .trouble. Mr Biratiam* - We ought to .give bonus on .the .production of cocoa beans.",42
202,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"That may come bynished and-by. I bave not the slightest doubt that cocoa, beans can be grown here; whether profitably or not I do not know. In the meantime, we'have no cocoa-bean .industry, .and .must import what we quire; aiid it would be a mistake to imin this manner. pose a heavy duty on this raw material. As honorablo members know, one of the by-products of the confectionery industry is potable cocoa; and we make full provision in the item to eover that by-product. I hope the Committee will not agree to the amend The ment.",43
203,Mr GREGORY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Dampier) [5.53] The Minister (Mr Greene) states that issued to - each and every honourable memmy ber a :book containing extracts - from the reports of ihe Inter-State Commission. do not blame tha Minister for .any ness in tins connection; but it is remarkseems able that - not only myself, but all the orable memher round about me, have .only just received their copies. .

205,Mr GREGORY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"I was away when these papers were presented, and I had - fco write specially to the Minister for copy of the Tariff. I hardly think it is just on the part of the Minister to say that he, himself, has given us statistics and extracts from the Inter-State Comthing mission's reports,, seeing that these appear in..a book prepared by Mr Ambrose tralian  the Industrial Australian, and he 'is doing remarfcobly well",43
206,Mr GHABLTOJI,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"I desire your ruling, Mr Dtiputy Chairman, as to whether the honourable - member is in order., under item, in dealing with what Mr Ambrose Pratt, or anybody else,, .has said.",43
207,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND, I .umderstopd the honon .we orable member for Dampier to be replying to a statement made by the Minister.,43
208,Mr GREGORY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"I am protesting that a the Minister should claim to have furhonorable - members with statistics, which, as a matter of fact, have been but provided by un outside journal. We are supposed to have extracts from the reports of the Inter-State - Commission. It is not refair that - llhey should have been prepared",43
209,Mr WEST,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"East Sydney) [6.0] Certain honourable members who .are what may 'bo called cranks on some subjects seem to delight in trying to get a little popularity by speaking-on their pet sub: jects to the annoyance of other members. honourable member for Dampier (Mr. Gregory"") has seized upon this item in the Tariff as one in connection with which, he he thinks, the duty should be reduced. In opinion, if any item justifies a heavy duty it is this particular one, because it I concerns what we may term the luxuries remissof the people. Tho honourable member to lose his capacity to reason lqgihoneully on a question of Free Trado or Protection. It is necessary tp have a heavy Tariff on .this item, if only because of the employment provided for our returned soldiers. Take candied fruit .as an illus'them tration. Queensland State legislation encourages the production of pineapples, t is and these when candied are a very on marketable commodity, not only in Australia, but .all over the world. Chocolates and other varieties of confocoks fectionery are luxuries, and, moreover, I challenge any honourable member to say that the product of our Australian firms is not equal to that of a manufacturers in any port of the world. If ever .1 go down the street with one of my daughters, and if she has done someto please me, I take good care to make some return in the form of an Aus.product in the confectionery line, beoause I know the article will be of first class quality. The manufacturing of confectionery .gives employment to many thousands of Australian men and women, and I object that any .honourable member this should endeavour lo seek popularity by moving for a reduction in the duty. I hnpe the honourable member for Dampier will not adopt such means to advertise himself. Amendment negatived. . Item agreed to. Item 45 (Copra); item 46 (Egg albumen, dry) and item 47 (Egg contents, dry) agreed to. Item 48<Egg (not in shell) in liquid form, when imported for use in industries other than those lor the preparation of articles of food,- and denatured, as .prescribed by departmental by-laws. Free.",43
210,Mr FLEMING,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Robertson) [6.4] - I should like the Minister (Mr Greene) to tell the Committee what egg in liquid form is used for, and why it should be free. Unless there is some special reason, of which I know nothing at. present, I feel disposed to move for - a duty, in order to protect our poultry farmers, who aie largely returned soldiers. Everything is put up against these men.' . Wire netting and everything else necessary for the poultry-keeper's yard is protected and made expensive.",44
211,Mr WATKINS,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Whea t is their heaviest item. . Mr FLEMING - It is essential that we should give the poultry farmers an equal measure of Protection. ' Under the Wheat Board scheme they have to pay as .much for inferior wheat as the general public pay for good wheat. - If they have - to pay dearly for all their requirements, they are entitled to some measure of Protection themselves.",44
212,Mr GREENE,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND," {6.6] - I quite agree with the 'honourable member for Robertson (Mr Fleming)- that if our poultry farmers were prejudiced by this item ws should take some action, along the lines he has suggested; - but I feel satisfied that they are not injured.' Denatured .eggs are used by .tannens in the preparation of leather, and unless H is available at a price at which it would never pay the poultry farmer to supply to them, they would not use it. They would, instead, use a substitute. That is' the position - I may add that, recognising the desirableness of protecting the poul.try industry, I have in another item, substantially increased the duty on eggs, as I dare say the honourable - member has noticed. Recently a steamer with 3,000,000 eggs on board arrived from China, but because this duty was operative the eggs could not'be sold;- so the duty has already been of dis.ti.net advantage to ourpoultry farmers. I should like to say further that, although this provision has been in the Tariff for some time, the tanners have not used denatured eggs, because they have not been cheap enough. Item agreed to. ' Item 49 (Egg yolk, dry), and item 50 (Eggs, in shell), agreed to.

213,Mr GREGORY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Dampier) [6.8] - I notice that there is a duty on fish preserved in tins of l$d. per lb. This is an item of food,, particularly for people engaged in developing the back country. It must be. kept in every outside camp. It is also required in the homes of the poorer people..",44
214,Mr GREENE,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,T t is pretty dear food for the poorer people ,44
215,Mr GREGORY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"I dare say it is just now, owing to theincreased cost of production, increased freight, and, on top of that, this increased duty. I am afraid it is going to make the cost of living dearer. The Minister can only intend the duty on this item to be for revenue, puroses, and I hope that, before we have 1 nished with the schedule, we shall find some articles of luxury upon which we may levy higher duties - ae compensation, for relief in regard to such items as the one now under discussion. I do not propose to make any discrimination'between Great Britain, Norway, Scandinavia, or America. I move That the item be amended by the addition te sub-item o of the following:-""and on and after 19th May, 1B21, per lb., Id.""",44
216,Mr GREENE,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [6.11]..^-The duties in this portion of. the schedule have 1 been arranged with a view to inducing persons to develop the tinned fish industry in Australia, and because Great B r i tain has been losing her trade in tinned-fish with Australia. Unquestionably we have the fish in our waters, and I believe that we could establish the industry here. In 1918-19 the importations of tinned fish from Great Britain sank from practically the whole of the trade to about 1 per cent, of the total.",44
217,Mr GBEOOBY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"In 1919-20 we imported over 3,500,000 lbs. of tinned fish from Great Britain.",45
218,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"But Great Britain was supplying us with a very much larger percentage than she is now, and it is desirable, in the interests of British preferential trade, to restore Britain's trade in this important article of food. Truita, Fresh, viz.:(A) Bananas (B) Citrus (o) N . E . I . , including fresh Lycliee nuts per central",45
219,Mr MACKAY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Lilley) [6.16] - If I am permitted to do so, I intend to movo to increase the duty on bananas to 13s. 4d. per central. Speaking on the general debate, I placed a considerable amount of information before the Committee in regard to the banana-growing industry of Queensland and New Soutb Wales, and there is no occasion for me to repeat my arguments, except, perhaps, to refer to what may be considered a weak point. We have it from the files in the Minister's office that the cost of the production of bananas in F i j i is 4s. 6d. per case, whereas in Queensland it is 14s. fid. per case. I can quite appreciate the fact that the average member would be inclined to believe that a duty of 13s. °4d. per central would be liable to lead to a considerable increase in the .price of bananas; but the growers have not the slightest intention of asking for any increase in the present price. I have already demonstrated to the Committee that the increased production in Queensland and New South Wales justifies the growers in asking for the whole of the Australian market. As a matter of fact, under present conditions they can supply the whole of the local demand, and for three weeks out of four they do. But on every fourth week on island steamer arrives, nnd by landing, as was done last",45
220,Mr JACKSON,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Bass) [6.14] -.The tinned fish industry is one that we should endeavour to encourage in every possible way. If the honourable member's amendment is carried, it will seriously affect a canning factory on Flinders Island, whioh is now struggling for existence. There is ample room for such a factory, because the east coast of Tasmania is one of the best fishing grounds around Australia. Amendment negatived. Item agreed to. Item 52: BritBb. Intermediate. General. per central Is. 6d. 2s. 6d. 2s. 6d. per lb. id. Id. Id. 3s. 6s. 6s month, about 27,000 bunches in Australia, completely dislocates the market. The only offeet of the imposition of the increased duty asked for would be to regulate the local market; and that is all the local growers expect. It is admitted generally in Queensland and New South Wales that 5 acres of land is as much as one banana-grower can farm. Five acres under crop will produce six cases of fruit per week, and six cases at 14s. 6d. per case means a return of £4 7s. per week for the grower, who, after he has felled and cleared the scrub,- and planted his ground, has to wait eighteen months until his crop comes into profitable bearing.",45
221,Mr RILEY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"If the growers do not put up the price of bananas, how will they benefit by the increased duty?",45
222,Mr MACKAY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,I have already said that they will benefit by securing a regular market.,45
223,Mr RILEY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"They will, have only the same income.",45
224,Mr MACKAY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,I have already said that the boat from the Pacific Islands arrives here only every fourth week. It is because the fruit from this source comes on top of the regular supplies within the Commonwealth that there is an irregular and fluctuating market.,45
225,Mr RILEY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,The growers can sell all the bananas that they produce.,46
226,Mr MACKAY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,Upon quite a number of occasions a lot of fruit of go*od quality has had to be wasted because it would not pay to market it .,46
227,Mr LAZZARINI,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,Banana s are always dear enough retail.,46
228,Mr MACKAY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"If honourable members choose to walk down Bourke-street, they will see - more bananas exposed for sale than any other fruit, and at a price which will compare more than favourably with any fruit upon the market.",46
229,Mr MOGBATH,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"The boat from F i j i is due horo today, and yet Queensland bananas are dearer now than they have been for a month.",46
230,Mr MACKAY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"But the F i j i bananas are (.not token straight from the ship and put into the shops; they are transferred to a ripening room. The frui t is sent here in a green state, otherwise it would not carry. Probably a week or a fortnight elapses after the arrival of. a consignment of bananas before the ' fruit finds its way into the shops. I have already pointed out that a return to. the grower of 14s. 6d. per case is absolutely necessary. The average freight from Queensland is 8s. 9d. per case, making a total of 23s. 3d. per case. ""That is the rock price at which 'bananas oan be produced in Queensland. In the matter of freight we enjoy no advantage Over the growers of Fiji - Certainly they have a longer distance to cover, but it is a water freight, which is cheap. Upon the other hand, the banana-grower of Queensland pays 97s. per ton from Gympie to Melbourne.",46
231,Sir JOSEPH COOK,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,Does not that fruit come down by boat?,46
232,Mr MACKAY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"No . The whole of the bananas from Queensland are sent by rail. To give honourable members some idea of the quantity which is handled by the Southern Queensland Fruit-growers' Society, I may mention that, during the four months ended April last, no less than 8,000 tons have passed through Wallangarra, representing 216,273 coses.",46
233,Sir JOSEPH COOK,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,It is ruinous to drag that fruit down south by train.,46
234,Mr MACKAY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"There^ar e very good reasons why that course is.jeing adopted. Under the old system of sending it by boat, no care was exercised in the bandling of it . The fruit was often dumped down in the steamer's hold near the boilers, where it was so sweated that, upon its arrival here, it was condemned. One of my first efforts was to endeavour to remedy that difficulty. Upon more than one occasion I have asked that the Commonwealth should build vessels which would cater for the fruit trade between Queensland and Melbourne. It was principally upon this . account that the Southern Queensland Fruit-growers' Society entered into an arrangement with the Railway Commissioners in the different States, under which the fruit now reaches Melbourne four and a half days after it has been cut upon the plantation. The result is thab it receivee more careful handling than it did formerly, and the consumer thus gets better fruit than would be possible under the old conditions. The time occupied in transit from Fiji to Sydney is about the same as that occupied between Gympie and Melbourne.",46
235,Sir JOSEPH COOK,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"How is it that the film to be projected in the Queen's Hall this evening, which will depict the various operations connected with the banana industry, is to be shown just at the time this duty comes under consideration ?",46
236,Mr MACKAY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"I am very pleased to be able to frankly answer the Treasurer's, bedquestion. Thegrowersof bananas, realizing that in the past their case has been quite misunderstood, resolved that upon the present occasion they would spare no expense in order to place honourable members in a position to learn something of the conditions surrounding their industry. The film of which the Treasurer speaks was taken for the Tweed River Fruit Growers Association, and I hope that honourable members will avail themselves of the opportunity to see it , in order that they may acquire much valuable information.",46
237,Mr CAMEBON,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,It is good propaganda work.,46
238,Mr MACKAY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"It 'is propaganda work in a good cause. Every member of this Parliament, I think, has received a circular signed by S. J. Plain in refer? enee to the particular item which we are  stand, represents the Tropical Fruits Proprietary Company, which has a plantation in Fiji. Apparently the members of that company prefer to invest their money in a place where they can obtain cheap labour rather than in Australia. I have a satisfactory reply to every paragraph, contained in the circular, but I have answered so many of the'statements made therein' that there is no occasion for me to again traverse them in detail. I . shall, therefore, confine my observations, to two* paragraphs, one of which relatesto the Chinese who are alleged to be engaged in the industry in Queensland and New South Wales. The paragraph in question reads:It is quite safe to say that the Chinese a much - bigger acreage at the Tweed Biver, New South Wales, for banana planting than all of the white growers put together, so that the ""coloured labour"" cry is unjustified ns a plea for increased duty.",46
239,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"There is nothing like a good lie when one is at it. - Mr MACKAY - Quite so; and the statement which I have just quoted is a champion lie, because not a single bunch or box of bananas grown by Chinese has been sent from the south of Queensland to the southern States. There is only one Chinaman engaged in the industry throughout the whole of the southern port of Queensland. Mr GREENE:- I telegraphed for information upon that point, and I . have it here. The ' honourable member is at liberty to read the reply whioh I have received.'",47
240,Mr MACKAY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"I also wired to Mr. Stuart, the secretary of the Tweed f r u it growers Association, for information upon this matter. ; However, I thank the Minister for his courtesy in handing me the .reply which he has received. It readsFour thousand acres under bananas Tweed River, 220,000 eases produced for year ending April, by about 600 Europeans.

241,Mr MACKAY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"I think I have at a special  in error in his statement to which I alluded before the adjournment. I will now read a further quotation from the circularPetitions signed by the fruit merchantsof Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, and Perth, who are all practical men with , a thorough knowledge of the requirements of the fruit trade, and whose interests are identical with the consumers', have already been presented to the Minister ior Trade' and Customs asking, for the abolition of the duty on the Fiji fruit. have It is only fair to state that petitions to this effect were forwardedto the Minister; but thoBe petitions were engineered by the Tropical Fruits Proprietary Company. I have some letters bearing upon the whole subject which I desire to read, because, apparently, the agents who signed the petitions have since entirely changed their opinions. That has been due to the great strides which the industry has made, both in Queensland and i u New - South Wales, particularly during the past eighteen months. About two years ago the fruit certainly - was dear. But what with shipping strikes, the influenza outbreak and other happenings,, the F i j i fruits were not coming to these markets, and Australiau growers were encouraged to plant additional areas, so that .at present there are in the two States somowhcre about 14,000 acres under bananas  petition for the abolition of the duty.?:",47

245,Mr MCGRATH,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,Hal f of them do not my handle a case of bananas a year.,48
246,Mr MACKAY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"I do not assert that maintain they do. Another letter is from the I [346] ternational Fruit and Mercantile Company, and is as follows:Wm. Ellison, Esq., Yours faithfully, General Secretary, Southern Queensland Fruit-growers' Society Ltd., President. Palmwoods, Queensland. Dear Sir,-Advertin g to the proposal for increasing the impost on F i j i bananas coming into the Commonwealth, we have to advise you that you have our full support in your endeavours to achieve this object. To sustain our views, we would emphasize the following features:(a) Queensland and Northern New South Wales can produce Australia's requirements in bananas and pine apples. (6) The production is rapidly increasing. (c) The growers, particularly the returned men, should have the first claim on the Australian markets to enable them to sell their annually increasing output at profitable prices. (d) The Queensland growers, by their application and organization, have built up markets in the different States, and have now regulated despatches to correspond with the requirements of the various markets. The Fiji shipments (more or less irregular) completely disorganize the trade arrangements, causing wide fluctuations, thereby nullifying the objects of Queensland's organization. (e) Without some protection such as is sought by your organization, the producers of the northern State from time to time will be unable to secure results sufficiently good to enable them to carry on at a profit, particularly in view of the increase in production due to the placing of the returned men on the land. I have one other letter from a firm of well-known and representative wholesale frui t merchants in AdelaideMr W. A. Watkins, King-street, Melbourne, Victoria. Dear Sir,- I thank you. for giving me an opportunity of expressing an opinion in respeet to proposed increased Tariff on F i j i bananas. Some time ago Queensland bananas were so scarce and dear, and so little attention apparently given to growing them, that it seemed really necessary (if the public taste for this fruit was to continue, and the consumer receive anywhere near a sufficient supply) that tha importation of F i j i bananas was necessary. Later this did not seem so imperative, and an extract was published in Queensland papers from letters to my agent, wherein I stated that firm proposed altogether discontinuing purchasing Fiji bananas, and asking support from Queensland growers to this end, so I could regular supplies. Again, recently, In - sent my son and representatives through Queensland to thoroughly ascertain the position in respect to bananas there. Their reports assure mc that much larger interest is being taken in banana culture, and the industry, employing white labour, needs necessary encouragement to further foster same to make Queensland a very large producer of this fruit. I understand that a considerable number of returned soldiers have started in this industry, and this alone calls for all the encouragement that can be given without detriment to others. I understand from you that various representatives from Queensland are now in Melbourne with a view of obtaining a reasonable duty on Fiji bananas imported into the Commonwealth, and I feel sure that my former remarks will assure you that this has my support. As a merchant, I think there are other methods which would considerably assist growers in meeting the competition and bettering their position, and if I can be of any assistance, please let me know. I speak particularly of the very much increased railway freight, delay, and knocking about that this fruit is subjected to. Co-operation between all States, chants, and growers, in respect to improving these conditions, seems highly necessary. Thinking it may be of assistance to you or the Queensland banana industry generally, I am taking the liberty of introducing this matter to others interested here, and am attaching a memorial signed by a few Adelaide traders, &c. I trust this may assist you. Yours faithfully, SILBEBT, SHARP, & BISHOP LTD. Tliese letters completely disprove the as of the agents weTe at one time asking for the abolition of the duty, the correspondence shows that, owing to the progress in the industry in the past two years, the merchants are satisfied that the growers of Queensland and New South Wales can grow sufficient fruit for our requirements. Two representatives of the South Queensland organization have been in Melbourne during the past fortnight for the particuUir purpose of endeavouring to improve the handling and distribution of the fruit. It is true that, at times, prices have appeared to be high, but the growers have not reaped the benefit. It has happened repeatedly that the retailers, who, of course, must make reasonable profits, have unduly advanced prices.",48
247,Mr GABB,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,The retailer does not make much on bananas.,49
248,Mr MACKAY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"On e can understand that, in view of the amount of deterioration inevitably going on in his stock. It is obvious that there must be what would, perhaps, appear to be a large profit to cover that source of loss. I am confident that the visit of the two Queensland representatives to Melbourne will considerably improve the handling of the fruit at this end. Th© growers ar© not asking for an increased price. They are satisfied that they can supply all the bananas required by the Australian consumer, and at a retail price of which no one can complain. By medium of my amendment they ask to be put in exactly the same position as growers in F i j i . The figures which I have quoted show that there is a difference between production costs there and in Australia amounting to 13s. 4d. Any lower impost will still give the growers in F i j i an advantage over the Queensland and New South ""Wales growers. I move That sub-item A be amended by the addition of the following words, "" and on ancl after mer19th May, 192], per central, 13s. 4d. I desire that figure to be inserted in each of the three columns. I mention the three specifically for the reason that British folk are not interested in any matter of preference concerning bananas.",49
249,Mr BOWDBIT,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"I rise to order. Mr. Chairman, it might be convenient at this stage if you would give a ruling as to whether a private member can move for the imposition of an increase in duty when the Tariff is under consideration.",49
250,The CHAIRMAN,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND," I expected that this point of order would be raised at some stage, and I have therefore given the subject very close and deep consideration, in order that the Committee may deal with the matter as it thinks fit. This question arose in 190.1, when I had the honour of occupying the position I hold today, and when I ruled in a certain direction. On that occasion my ruling was not dissented from, but, with the concurrence of the Committee, was sent on to Mr Speaker Holder for his consideration and decision. As this matter is of considerable importance I think it desirable to give the Committee the fullest information at my disposal, to enable it to come to a decision which may be lasting and serve as a guide in any future proceedings. Standing order Wo. 171 readsNo amendment for the imposition or for the increase of a tax rate or duty shall be proposed by any non-official member in any Committee on any Bill. Non-official means a member other than a member of the Ministry. It will be seen, on reference to the ruling I gave on a similar matter on 12th November,, 1901, that a lengthy debate ensued both before and after my ruling. On that occasion the matter was discussed at length by many illustrious members of the House; but no vote was taken at any stage of the proceedings. My ruling, to which honourable members oan refer, was based on the fact that we were in Committee of Wiays and Mean3, and standing order No. 171 provides only that such action cannot be taken on any Bill. There, was no Bill before the Committee at that time, neither is there now. This is a resolution from which a schedule i.3 drawn up. That schedule will have to be reported to the House, aud if approved by the House - will become the basis of a Bill. I also took the view that a constitutional right was given to non-official members to move for an increased rate or duty on a resolution in Committee of Ways and Means,- but that non-official members would not have that right in Committee on a Bill. On the occasion to .which I have referred I quoted from all the authorities available,, and referred also to our standing order No. 1, which provides that if our own Standing Orders do not apply, the practice of the House of Commons is to be resorted to. I found that the practice of the House of Commons up to 1870 had been to allow non-official members to move for an increased rate or duty. I found, also,, that that practice had been adopted by Victoria and South Australia. In referring to the Standing Orders of the various States, I ascertained that only one State had its Standing Orders so framed that it was impossible for a non-official member at any stage on a resolution or a Bill to move for an increased rate or duty.",49
251,Mr JAMES PAGE,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,Whic h was the exception ?,50
252,The CHAIRMAN,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Wester n Australia makes it absolutely prohibitive, but in the other States it is not so. In Victoria and South Australia it had very often been done. I then explained that, in ""the State of New South Wales, while the Standing Orders made no such provision, the practice of Parliament had been followed. In considering this matter, I had to consider the intention of the framers of the Constitution', and of our Standing [ 3 4 6 ] -2 Orders. Some of the former were members of the first Standing Orders Committee, and I shall read the remarks of Sir John Quick, who, honourable members will recall, was not only a member of this House, but one of the framers of the Federal Constitution. I believe that gentleman was also a member of the first Standing Orders Committee. His speech will show what was in the minds of the framers of the Constitution in regard to what he termed the privileges of honourable members. On page 7100 of Hansard of 12th November, 1901, he is reported to have said I cannot acquiesce in the proposition submitted by the Leader of the Opposition, that a private member cannot propose an increase of a tax. I cannot say that I should be glad to support an increase of a tax any more than would any other honourable member. An increase of taxation would no doubt be an undesirable thing; but un oceasion may arise where it may be necessary for a private member to submit for the consideration of the Committee a proposition that there should bo an increase of n duty. I certainly think that honourable members should not join in contracting or restricting their powers and' privileges in this Committee. There are only two authorities which regulate this question. I see nothing in the Constitution to restrict or limit the power of a private member to propose either a new tax or an increase of a tax. Section 56 deals with messages relating to appropriation of revenue. An honourable member could not propose an increase of expenditure in Committee, because expenditure has to be recommended by a message from the Crown. That section is expressly confined to the spending of money after it has been raised, which is an entirely different question from the raising of revenue. I am aware that, according to the previous practice of Parliament, the power of members in matters of taxation was limited. I referred to this question at the beginning of the session, when the motter of Standing Orders was under consideration. I took the opportunity of expressing the hope that the Standing Orders would not be so designed as to restrict or cut down the powers or privileges of honourable members in matters of taxation. On referring to the Standing Orders, I find nothing to restrict the power of a private member in Committee of Ways and Moans. There is one standing order, No. 171, which provides thatNo amendment for the imposition or for the increase of a tax, rate, or duty shall be proposed by any non-official member in any Committee on any Bill. The Committee of Ways and Means is not a Committee on a Bill. It is a Committee of the whole House in anticipation of the preparation of a Bill. It has unfettered freedom in matters to be submitted for its consideration. Without expressing a desire to increase the taxation, or without having in view any increase of a particular duty, I think that honourable members ought to fight for retaining their rights. An occasion may arise to increase a duty, and, therefore, honourable members ought to - have a free hand to submit such propositions in the direction of taxation as they may think fit. I could quote quite a number of eminent authorities, but I do not think it necessary to do so. The ruling to which I have referred was confirmed by Mr . Speaker Holder, but the matter was not again reviewed u n t i l 1906, when the question of imposing duties arose.'",50
253,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,On items which did not appear in the schedule.,51
254,The CHAIRMAN,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"That is so. Mr . Speaker Holder again confirmed his previous rulin g i h regard to the right of a non-official member to move for an in crease in rate or duty. But he ruled against the right of a non-official member to move for the introduction of a new item into the schedule. The late Sir George Turner and other eminent men of legal attainments held a similar view. Mr MCDonald-Paterson, of Queensland, the late Sir C. C. Kingston, and may other high legal authorities, who were schedule. members of the Federal Convention, supported the ruling I gave, and which Mr Speaker Holder endorsed, and showed to be right constitutionally to allow p r vate members to move for an increase i duty, as the honourable member for Kenin order. nedy (Mr MCDonald) had then done. Realizing that further consideration would be given to this question, I have refreshed my memory by reading the debates in 1901, and I am now, as I was then, f u l ly convinced that standing order 171 was framed to permit non-official members to propose an increase in rate or duty on a resolution of Ways and Means. I desire honourable members to bear in mind that it was decided on that occasion that, in a Committee of Ways and Means, a non-official member could move for an alteration in the schedule before the Committee. This is a resolution before a Committee of Ways and Means. It is not preceded by a message. nob a matter of expenditure, and the schedule now before the Committee is subject to alteration. In accordance with the ruling previously given, and with the standing order quoted, when that resolution is reported to, and adopted, by this House, it forms the basis of a Bill , and the schedule is incorporated in that Bill . The Committee of the Whole, when dealing with that Bill , will not be able to alter the schedule by increasing the rates; and, therefore, if rates are to be in creased, the alterations must be made at this 6tage. Then the Minister whose duty it will be to bring in the Bill incorporating the Tariff, will have an opportunity to d r a f t it in accordance with the wishes of honourable members, and to make other arrangements in conformity with them. The matter should be finalized on the adoption by the House of the report from the Committee of Ways and Means. Whatever doubts may exist as to the correctness of my previous ruling-whicl i I now confirm- I feel it incumbent on me, occupying as I do a position of responsibility, to uphold the privileges of honourable members generally, private as well as official. That I do in r u l in g - I think correctly-that it is competent for a private member understanding order 171 to propose in this Committee an increase of a rate of duty.",51
255,Sir JOSEPH COOK,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,Do I understand that you rule that a private member not move to insert a new item in the,51
256,The CHAIRMAN,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"As that question . has not arisen, I have not ruled on it . it There has never been dissent from my i - ruling, and, therefore, it has never been n voted on. I declare the amendment to be  sorry that the amendment has been moved. Banana-growing is certainly a primary industry, and I wish to study the interests of our primary producers; but, in my opinion, the proposal of the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Mackay) is calculated to prejudice the banana in dustry, and to injur e Australia as a whole. It is my view that if we wholly exclude from our markets bananas grown out of Australia, the price of bananas will become so high that comparatively few will be consumed by the public, and, therefore, the industry will suffer. Many of the Tariff rates are 60 insular as to in It is jure Australia, and I think that there are duties in the American and South African Tariffs which are in the nature of reprisals against them. Ought we to be entirely selfish in this matter ? Has F i j i no claims to consideration ? That country was growing bananas before any were grown in Australia, and does more trade with us than with any other country. She spends in buying from, us an amount three times as much as we pay for her bananas, and the intercourse between the two countries maintains a shipping business which is very profitable to Australia. Is it in our interests that this trade intercourse should be destroyed ? We must see that the Queensland banana-growers are reasonably protected against the competition of cheap labour; but can it be said that Australia has beenfloodedduring the past four or five years with cheap bananas ? If , as was at one time the case, bananas were obtainable at one-fifth of their present price, there might be some justification for the higher Protection.",51
257,Mr MACKAY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Banana s grown by Chinese I  land bananas are grown by Chinese, and if the amendment is carried, the Australian public will be paying heavily for bananas to maintain Chinese as well as white growers in a lucrative employment. The pictures which were exhibited to-night in the Queen's Hall showed that the soil on which our bananas are grown is some of the best in the world; I doubt if F i j i has better. We were informed that within eighteen months of planting the banana bears its fruit, and the business of banana-growing is not a difficult one, nor are the expenses much greater in Australia than in F i j i . In 1913 we paid £241,000 for bananas, and she spent £424,155 in purchasing goods from U6. In 1917-18 we spent only £137,140 on Fiji bananas, an indication than the Australian grower was getting a good part of the trade, and Fiji bought from us goods worth £322,000. Can we afford to put an end to the traffic between the two countries? I hope that a sane view may prevail in this matter, and that the Minister (Mr Greene) will not agree to the amendment, the carrying of which would not benefit Queensland. When you protect an industry from competition altogether, you create laziness and inefficiency in it, and our citizens should not be afraid of the reasonable, competition of other countries.  [8.55] - The honourable member for  nothing else. He has scarcely risen in this House without putting forward a plea for the primary producer; but, apparently, he has now reached the stage when he .will consider the interests only of the primary producers who live in his own electorate. On last Friday, we heard him pleading wholeheartedly in support of the duty on millet.  suggest that there is an item of the Tariff before the Chair.  orable member then contended that it was our duty to assist the primary producer in every shape and form. We are now considering an item which concerns primary producers engaged in the banana industry. They have circularized honourable members, and in clear and definite terms have stated what they want. They know more about the industry than we do; but the honourable member for Swan, who would have us believe that he is so solicitous for the primary producers, says they do not know what is best for themselves. He undertakes to tell them what is best in their interests. I do not assert that the honourable member has no right to say that, if he thinks it ; but it does seem to me that he takes up a contradictory position when he supports the primary producer engaged in the cultivation of millet, and refuses what they desire to the primary producers engaged in the cultivation of bananas. I wish to protect primary F i j i producers wherever I find them. The honourable member for Lilley (Mr. Mackay) is to be congratulated on making out a splendid case in the interests of those engaged in the banana industry, who are faced with a tough, proposition in having to compete with the products of cheap foreign labour. . I do not think that the honourable member for Swan would contend for a moment that white workers should be asked to compete in this country a.gainst coloured labour, and I see no difference between competing against coloured labour in Australia and against coloured labour overseas. I assume that the figures quoted by the honourable member for Lilley are correct, and we learn from him that the wages paid to workmen in this industry in Southern Queensland are from 12s. to 14s. per day. That is as much as a labourer in the industry in F i j i would get in a week. I think the wages paid to workers in the industry in F i j i are 2s. 6d. per day, so that the primary producers in Southern Queensland engaged in this industry have to pay their workmen as much per day as the producers in F i j i have to pay their workmen per week.  cheapen bananas, as the honourable memtier says it will cheapen binders?  we come to binders I will tell the honourable member all about them. Just now he objected to my reference to an item that is not before the Chair, but now he would like me to speak on something else. Bananas are brought to Melbourne from Southern Queensland in three or four days. They cannot be brought here from F i j i under about a fortnight. The consequence is that we get the more matured article from Queensland, and that is an important consideration. I had the privilege, a couple of months ago, of going through a good deal of the banana country in Southern Queensland, and it was a revelation to me to see in the banana industry one_ of the most splendid examples of intense culture to be seen in any part of Australia. There are men engaged in the industry who are making a living off 4 acres or 5 acres. It seems to me that the only thing they require in the way of encouragement is the protection they should have against the products of coloured labour abroad. It is a duty which this country owes to the white people engaged in building up this industry in Australia to do everything that can be done to protect them against about the most unfair form of competition one could imagine. I understand that the honourable member for Lilley proposes that the duty should be raised to 13s. 4d. percental.",52
258,Mr MACKAY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Yes , the difference between the cost of production in F i j i and Australia.  banana growers, speaking through their association, have said that there is no posal to raise the price of bananas. I direct the sittention of the honourable member for Swan to that. What they desire is freedom from unfair competition. When the primary producers of Australia, no matter in what industry they are engaged, ask for our assistance, I am prepared to give them the full measure of assistance they require. Mr BOWDEN. (Nepean) £9.3] - The  Moloney) has just said that he believes there will be no increase in the price of bananas if the duty is increased as proposed. I have a very good recollection of the time when the shipping strike was on, when no bananas were coming here from Fiji",53
259,Mr MACKAY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,When was that?,53
260,Mr BOWDEN,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Withi n the last four or five months. We were then paying between 2s. 6d. and 3s. per dozen for bananas. The price was raised until it was about £2 per case. The increase of duty now proposed is tremendous. It is from 2s. 6d. to 13s. 4d. per central, or something over 500 per cent, of increase on the Government proposal. I have no doubt whatever that if the increase is agreed to, it will have the effect of increasing the price of bananas in Australia. The existing duty on bananas is a heavy duty. I recall the attention of honourable members to the fact that from the film which we saw in the Queen's Hall this evening, we learned that ordinary business men and returned soldiers are going in for banana cultivation, and are making a very good thing out of it . We saw that those engaged in the industry apparently have many motor care ab their disposal. We know, however, that investment in banana lands under the existing duty is put before the public of our big cities as one of the best paying propositions of the present day. The existing duty is a very heavy increase on that of the 1914 Tariff. The best proof we could have that it is having the effect that honourable members desire is the increase in banana cultivation in Southern Queensland and Northern New 'South Wales. There is some force in the argument advanced by the honourable member for Swan (Mr. Prowse), that if we are to retain our trado with the islands, we must exchange commodities of some sort with them. The banana producers of Southern Queensland and Northern New South Wales pro- have had no difficulty in obtaining a good market for their fruit.",53
261,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"As to the island trade, it would not matter much if we did not take any bananas from F i j i , because all. the sugar that comes here to be refined is from F i j i .",53
262,Mr BOWDEN,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"At all events, it is undeniable that, as soon as the present duty was imposed, the price of bananas went up. Such good prices are ruling that investment in banana lands is put forward as one of the best of propositions. Eeturned soldiers are doing well out of banana cultivation, and citizens of Sydney who have invested money in banana cultivation on the North Coast are getting a return of from 20 per cent, to 30 per cent, on their capital. I cannot support the amendment.",53
263,Mr MCGRATH,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Ballarat) [9.8] - I intend to vote against the amendment on the ground that it provides, not for Protection, but absolute prohibition. If it were agreed to, our trade with F i j i would be entirely eliminated. Banana-growers in Queensland and Northern New South Wales have nothing of which to complain. During the last few years, land suitable for the production of bananas has advanced very rapidly in price. In a report to which the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Mackay) has referred, it is stated thatAs far back as 1915 we read of one grower (J. M. Christie) taking £2,300 off a 10-acre block of bananas. A return of £150 to £180 per acre is the average in this district.",54
264,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,The circular from which the honourable member is quoting is not reliable.,54
265,Mr GROOM,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,Fro m what circular is the honourable member quoting?,54
266,Mr MCGRATH,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"I am quoting from a circular issued by Mr S'. J. Plain, copies of which have been sent to all honourable members. It contains some facts in regard to increases in the price of land suitable for banana cultivation which are generally accepted. For inindustry stance, it is stated thatThe Sydney Morning Herald of 8th August, 1919, reports the sale of 64 acres which realized £6,460-ove r £100 per acre-for virgin The Murwillumbah correspondent of the Sydney Mail, under date 13th April, 1919, gives the local valuation of a banana farm in ing at £180 per acre. It will thus be seen that banana cultivation in Australia is alclass of country. ready worth far more per acre than any other crop. If this amendment be carried, bananas will become luxuries so far as the general body of consumers is concerned. It all very well for representatives of the banana-growing districts to say that, the duty be increased, as they desire, 13s. 4d. per central, there will be no increase in prices. What are the facts? During the seamen's strike, when there' were no steamers coming here from F i j i , and consequently no competition, I paid 42s. per case for bananas. There will be a F i j i boat here tomorrow; but the bananas will be just as dear as they were last week, when they were fetching as much as 27s. 6d. per case. People are being asked today to pay 25s. per case for inferior bananas. The bananas that come in here from F i j i have very little influence on local prices. Growers in Queensland are producing such good fruit that they need not fear the competition of the Fijian article. The first-grade Queensland bananas are infinitely better than any produced in F i j i . I suppose that a case of bananas would weigh about 1 cwt.",54
267,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,About 80 lbs.,54
268,Mr MCGRATH,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"That being so, if the amendment were carried we should have to pay something like 10s. per case by way of duty. There are twenty-four dozen bananas in a case, so that with a duty of 13s. 4d. per central added to the present price, we should be paying something like 37s. for a case of twenty-four dozen.",54
269,Mr MACKAY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"That is not so. Mr MoGRATH - I challenge the honourable member to disprove my statement. I have already stated that during the and seamen's strike, when the Queensland banana-growers had no competition, we had to pay 42s. per case for bananas; and if the F i j i boats ceased running tomorrow we should be called upon to pay the same price onoe more. If the banana were languishing or threatened with extinction I could understand. extreme measures being taken to revive it. But no danger threatens the cultivation land. of bananas in Queensland and New South Wales. The industry is most prosperous, bearand land suitable for banana cultivation is fetching higher prices than any other Banana-growers are doing exceedingly well. Surely the consumers have some right to be considered. Bananas are almost a necessity for a largo section of the community. If this amendis ment were carried the price would be from four to six a shilling. That would if be almost prohibitive so far as a great to section of the community was concerned. The Minister (Mr Greene),- having taken time to consider the whole matter, has proposed a very fair percentage of Protection. He has increased the duty under the 1914 Tariff to 2s. 6d. per central, and with that increase the growers should he satisfied. Although I was returned to this House as a Protectionist, I am not here to prohibit goods coming into this country; I am not here to do - an injustice to the consumers or any other section of the coramunrty. I shall vote always to prevent an industry being extinguished, but the banana industry is certainly not threatened. The carrying of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Mackay) - would cut off our banana trade with Fiji. Apart from the increased cost that would result to consumers here, the cutting off of our banana trade with F i j i would mean a big loss to the working classes and the commercial people of Australia. The honourable mem - the value of the bananas that we import from F i j i is something like £130,000 per annum, whereas F i j i imports from Australia about £300,000 worth of goods per annum. That trade would be lost to us if we accepted this amendment, and, believing that the item as presented by the Minister will give the banana industry .sufficient Protection, I shall vote against the amendment.",54
270,Mr STEWART,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Wimmera) [9.15] I am pleased to know that at least one representative of the primary producers is giving the Protectionists in this* ber a little more Protection than is palatable to them. He has evidently made a good job of it. He has gone the whole hog. I do not know much about the banana industry, but as a representative of those engaged in another branch of primary production, I have no strong opposition to the honourable member's proposal. I believe these very high duties are not .wise. I do not think they will last, but if they are to be imposed on all other articles that Australia produces, including agricultural implements and machinery, there is nothing else for it but to allow the primary producers the same Protection as we allow to other sections of the community.",55
271,Mr BELL,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"We have not dealt with - machinery yet. Mr .STEWART - Judgin g by the unanimity displayed by those two sections of the House that are generally hostile to one another, I have a shrewd suspicion that there is not going to be very much alteration in the schedule in that regard. I rose chiefly to mention the free picture show we had in the Queen's Hall this evening. It is carrying ""lobbying"" and propaganda work from the Tariff point of view a little too far to use the Queen's Hall for a picture show dealing with certain Australian industries. A most fancif u l picture was drawn, for even the bride was shown, and quite a romantic story was interwoven with the film thrown on the screen. We walked straight in here from that inspiring spectacle to hear one of the representatives of the banana industry move an increase in the duty on bananas. I must say that it was well timed, and the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Mackay) deserves congratulation, and, indeed, has earned a testimonial from his constituents, if he is responsible for the propaganda and the splendid publicity work done in this building to-night. Speaking seriously, I think * that such a procedure is most improper. I have had no experience of previous Tariffs, but as a young member who takes an interest in these matters it seems to me to be establishing a precedent that is not altogether desirable from the parliamentary point of view; because, if we are to have a primary industry screened, we shall soon have some secondary industry screened Cham- also. We may yet have a picture of the agricultural implement making industry shown in the Queen's Hall to impress members with the necessity for prohibition in that direction.",55
272,Mr MACKAT,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,What would be the objection to that? Is it not advisable that we should be well informed on all these matters ?,55
273,Mr STEWART,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"I do not think this Parliament is the proper place for propaganda of that kind. As a representative of an agricultural constituency, I have no objection to what the honourable member did to-night from a primary producers' point of view, but I do not think it is desirable that such a precedent should be established. We have quite enough ""lobbying"" and printed matter already, and some articles even' more solid than printed matter are placed in our boxes in connection with the present Tariff. It is not desirable that this propaganda business should be initiated in this House. ' Mr GABB (Angas) [9.20] - I oppose the amendment moved by the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Mackay), not that I have the interests of F i j i at heart, for that is not what is troubling me. I have to a certain extent the interests of the primary producers at heart, but I have the interests of the consumers at heart also. Having had experience in the retail fruit business in South Australia, I can see approaching practically total prohibition if this increased duty is agreed to, unless something is ""done by threatening the Queensland grower that, if he does not increase his production considerably so as to supply enough bananas to take the place of the F i j i product that will be shut out, this duty will be lifted altogether.",55
274,Mr MACKAY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,We are growing fruit now.,56
275,Mr GABB,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"I am glad to hear it . Bananas are practically 26s. a crate today, and in Adelaide they run from 28s. to 32s. a crate. There are about three months in the year when the consumer is tied down to three fruits-oranges , apples out of the cool stores at from 6d. to 9d. a lb., and bananas. In my experience the working classes, on the Friday and Saturday round, would buy three oranges, and three bananas from the greengrocer to try to make a fruit salad to serve a family. That was under the old conditions. If the duty is increased by from 8s. to 10s. a crate, taking the price of bananas in Melbourne as 24s. a crate, which is Is. a dozen, allowing 24 dozen good bananas to the crate, the price will be increased practically by 10s. a crate. This will bring the wholesale price up to Is. 5d. a dozen in Melbourne. No retailer in the fruit business reckons to work it on less than 50 per cent., allowing for the loss from overripe fruit, &c.",56
276,Mr MACKAY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,Why do you add that 10s. on to the price of the Queensland banana ?,56
277,Mr MCGRATH,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,That is what they did when there was no Fij i competition.,56
278,Mr GABB,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Because I am of the opinion, backed up by the experience mentioned by somebody here in connection with the war, when F i j i bananas were shut out through the shortage of shipping, that the Queensland grower, or his agents, will increase the price. The 10s. will go on, which will make the wholesale price Is. 5d. per dozen, and the' retail price, even allowing only 30 per cent, for the retailer, Is. 9d. a dozen. This will make it almost impossible for the average member of the working class to obtain this fruit.",56
279,Mr JACKSON,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,The Dago sellers do that now.,56
280,Mr GABB,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"The honourable member may be an authority on Dagos, but I am speaking of South Australia, where, thank goodness, most of our frui t trade is in the hands of people of British origin. Adelaide is not like Melbourne in that regard. I am confident that if the proposed heavy duty is put on it will shut the F i j i banana out, and I am afraid that the Queensland grower will be no less human than the grower of any other commodity; but if he gets the opportunity will exthe ploit the Australian market. Having had this first-hand experience of the need of the working classes for bananas during at least three months of the year, fearing that they are going to be deprived of this fruit altogether, and knowing the need that every human being has of fruit, I intend to oppose the increase of ths duty.",56
281,Mr ANSTEY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Bourke) [9.25] - The Chairman of Committees (Mr Chanter), when in the chair on a previous occasion, decided that a duty could be discussed and increased on the motion of a private member, on the ground that it is not an increase in taxation; though probably it might be argued that every increase in duty is increased taxation or a charge on the community. I support the proposal on the ground that it is desirable to exclude the products of foreign labour, and that it is essential and desirable to exclude the products of the black races in F i j i . Personally, I thibk the price of bananas will probably depend on the supply. However, I rose mainly to refer to the remarks of the honourable member for Wimmera (Mr Stewart), who spoke, not so much in favour of the encouragement of primary production, but in protest against the propaganda carried on in the Queen's Hall. If propaganda is for an effective public purpose, and tends to the education of honourable memhersi f they need any-it is a very edifying and proper thing, and represents the best use to - which the Queen's Hall could be put. I think that this propaganda, apart from the purposes for which we meet here, is useful. In the first place, it out the remarks of the Minister (Mr. Greene) the other evening, when he demonstrated that all primary production gives rise to secondary industries. In connection with bananas, the timber industry is developed with the box industry, and these in turn provide consumers for the bananas. There was one form of propaganda this evening to which the honourable member for Wimmera raised no objection; I refer to the picture illustrating the development in orange growing. This illustration apparently came from the honourable member's own district, but he did not mention it.",56
282,Mr STEWART,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"I included that, too.",57
283,Mr ANSTEY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,Did the honourable member refer to it !,57
284,Mr STEWART,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,No ; but I refer to it now. Surely you do not think,57
285,Mr ANSTEY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"I do not think anything; I merely mention, in passing, that the gentleman from Wimmera omitted to mention the fact, but now does mention it.",57
286,Mr STEWART,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"It was not my district, anyhow.",57
287,Mr ANSTEY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"It was Kerang, which is, at any rate, so close to the honourable member's electorate that no man can be sure it will not be included at the next redistribution of seats. Here, again, there are secondary industries to be considered. For a few moments, when we were looking at the pictures, and I saw the man sitting on the buggy, I thought it was a case of I.W.W. But the honourable member was silent about that.",57
288,Mr STEWART,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,I included both pictures.,57
289,Mr ANSTEY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"As I say, secondary industries arise in this case also. When a lonesome single man, who faces nature, and, trying to plant oranges or bananas, marries and builds a home, we have a secondary industry; and then there comes the production of children, also a secondary industry. How can any one say that the development of primary industries is not useful in developing secondary industries? How can the honourable member say that the Queen's Hall is not being put to a useful purpose when honourable members are shown what can be done in this way? But we come to the fundabears mental principle in this and every other industry. If we can utilize Australian products, no matter what they cost, we should utilize them; the mere fact that the locally produced article costs more does not mean that the production is a loss to Australia. If we can develop au industry and maintain 10,000 or 20,000 men on the soil, or in our factories, it is a useful national asset even if the products cost more than those from overseas. Such industries give employment to the very men we have to maintain.",57
290,Mr STEWART,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,Eve n if it. bo only wheat production?,57
291,Mr ANSTEY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"I have a higher respect for wheat than to say "" only wheat."" I have the greatest reverence for wheat, and the products of wheat. We must not regard these questions from the stand-point of whether we can get something cheaper from overseas; the question is what industry can be developed, even if we have to pay, as in this case, a little more for bananas. After all, this is only a roundabout way of obtaining prohibition; we might as well say that overseas bananas, produced by black labour, shall not enter Australia. To that proposition I would give my support. Whether it be food, or anything else, it is infinitely better that it should be produced by white men in Australia than, that it should come from other countries. For those reasons, as I did in the case of candles, I give the proposal before us my most strenuous support.",57
292,Mr GREGORY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Dampier) [9.30] This discussion shows how necessary it is that there should be a Tariff Board to collect evidence and make the fullest information available to honourable members, so that we may be in a position to give an intelligent decision on a question of the sort. I do not know how correct the statements are that have been placed before us. The first is from the Southern Queensland Fruit-growers' Association,, and is to the effect that to insure a fair living under White Australia conditions they require not less than 26s. per case, "" at which price there is, and has been, a ready and steady demand."" Apparently, under present conditions, there is a ""ready and steady demand"" at a price with which the growers are satisfied. Then, again, in a pamphlet issued by the Fijian growers, there is a quotation from the Sydney Morning Herald to the effect that 64 acres of virgin land has been sold for £6,460, or over £100 an .acre. There must be something in tlic banana industry if those who carry it on find it worthwhile to purchase virgin land at £100 per acre. It is extremely difficult to say whether any assistance at all is essential, so far as this industry is concerned. The bauana, because of its medicinal value, I regard as one of the finest fruits for children, and so we should be careful about imposing a duty which would make it impossible for Australian children to obtain it at something like a fair price. I want to know how the people in my own State are going to be supplied if this duty is imposed. We shall not be in the position of the people of Melbourne or Sydney, because most of our bananas come from Java. In 1917-18 the imports into Western Australia from Java were 12,188 centals, and from the Commonwealth 2,070 centals. In 1918-19 the figures were:From Java, 10,445 centals; Commonwealth, 1,719 centals. In 1919-20, the imports were:-Fro m Java, 13,830 centals; Commonwealth, 619 centals. Nearly the whole of our trade is done with Java, and under this proposal I cannot see how the people of my State will be able in future to get bananas at a reasonable price, as the shipping, facilities from Queensland are not very good. I realise, of course, that the Government cannot impose two duties, one for the people of Western Australia and another for the people of the eastern States, so that no relief can be expected in that direction. But I want to impress upon honourable members the economic aspect of this proposal. Are we going to destroy the trade of other countries without consideration as to the results? If the honourable member for Bourke (Mr Anstey) were consistent, be ought to object strongly to our products {<oing to a black-labour country. In fact, lie ought to declare that no black-labour products should come into this country at all.",57
293,Mr ANSTEY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,That might not be a bad idea.,58
294,Mr GEEGOEY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"If that policy were adopted, I do not know where the honourable member would get his tobacco or his coffee. Really, I am afraid that we arc getting a little bit mad over this Tariff. The question seems to be-How high can we make the duty ? Honourable members seem to be under the impression that hy imposing the highest possible duty they are helping the country. I seo the possibility of a very grave danger in accepting the amendment suggested. I hope, therefore, that it will be considerably modified.",58
295,Mr MATHEWS,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Melbourne Ports) [9.40] - The honourable member for Dampier (Mr Gregory) appears to be troubled about the future supply of bananas for Western Australia, owing to the difficulty of importing from Queensland, bufc I should think the banana could be grown to advantage in many portions of Western Australia itself.",58
296,Mr GREGORY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,We tried the plantain but we have to import all our bananas.,58
297,Mr MATHEWS,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"I know of no tropical country that will not grow good bananas under proper conditions of cultivation, and Western Australia, I may point out, has done remarkably well in fruit-growing during the last ten years. The question we have to decide is-Are we going to have a black-grown product? I have not one word to say against my black brother. As a youngster, I wasnuraed by a black woman, and I have thegreatest respect for both the black womanand the black man. My objection is not racial; it is economic. We read the other day of the terrible conditions of the Indians in F i j i . It appears that they had a revolution over there because of thetreatment being meted out to them by the planters. And so, I say, we should insist upon white-grown products for the people of Australia. The other day, when in Queensland, I passed farm after farm with nice homesteads on areas of 5 and 6 acres to 10 acres. As I went by I saw crowds of healthy and happy ""white youngsters, the future men and women of Australia. Settlements of this kind ought to be encouraged in every possible way. Now, as to the price of the banana grown by white labour in Queensland. Every honourable member knows that the banana growers would ruin themselves and their industry if they raised the price beyond the purchasing power of .the people. We were told recently that because of the inability to get Fijian bananas, the price was raised to the consumers, and, although there were no F i j i bananas coming into Australia, you could buy hundreds of dozens of F i j i bananas from the dealers. There are people who believe that the F i j i banana is better than the Queensland banana, and because of this belief the consumers are imposed upon by dealers, who thus get higher prices for the Queensland product. It should be our duty to encourage in every possible way the settlement of white people in our tropical areas. This may be done by means of the Tariff. We do not want to give credence to those who declare that we can only develop our tropical areas with black labour. Many products, especially cotton and tea, can be grown there by white labour. It is not likely that the price of cotton will ever recede to its pre-war level. No bananas are grown in the Melbourne Ports electorate. My constituents are consumers of the f r u it ; but, in the interests of Australia, and particularly in the interest of having its tropical portions peopled by white Australians, I shall vote for the proposed increased duty.",58
298,Mr CHARLTON,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Hunter) [9.46] - I am inclined to vote for an increase in the duty on bananas, but I am doubtful as to whether the duty asked for by the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Mackay) is not too high. We ought to analyze the matter, and see what would be a reasonable duty to impose. The rate set out in the schedule is 2s. 6d. per central. The honourable member asks that this should be increased to 13s. 4d. per central, or about i d . per banana; but I do not think that the industry needs such a substantial increase to enable it to secure the local market. The honourable member has told us that if the increased duty he asks for is imposed it will not mean an increase in the price of bananas. That is to say, the Australian growers are now in a position to hold the market against the F i j i growers. The duty on citrus fruits is Id. per lb., equal to about 8s. 4d. per central. If the Minister (Mr. Green is not prepared to accept a duty of 13s. 4d. per central on bananas, he might consider the desirability of making the rate somewhat on the basis of the duty on citrus fruits, that is to say, in the neighbourhood of 8s. 4d. per central.",59
299,Dr MALONEY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Melbourne) [9.50] I shall vote for the amendment, in order to bring the cost of imported bananas raised in F i j i somewhat to the level of the cost of growing the local banana. Of course, there will always be exploiters in a?iy community until we establish full control by proper legislation; but I propose to read a short passage describing the horrors under which bananas are grown in F i j i . It is taken from a lecture delivered before the Sydney University by Mr Frank Cotton, who quoted a clergyman who, to his eternal honour, stood out from his fellows and held up to the censure of the world the vile and terrible conditions existing in this island. The passage is as follows:THE TRAGEDY OF FIJI . One of the most appalling illustrations of the evil of Imperial rule from an Australian point of view is to be found in the transplanting of the Asian menace to the Pacific for the purpose of commercial exploitation, and the erection in F i ji over the grave of martyred missionaries of a veritable heathen Temple of Infamy. . The testimony of that well-known Australian missionary and thoughtful writer, the Rev. W. J. Burton, is that the moral conditions of the coolie settlements in Fiji, which were established under Imperial Blue Book regulations, are absolutely beyond the decencies of description, and that the only historical parallel to the state of affairs existing there is that in Holy Writ descriptive of the depravity of the Cities of the Plain, Sodom and Gomorrah. NOTE - In the Imperial Blue Book regulations controlling coolie emigration a species of loose polyandry is arranged for. One woman is provided for each three men. Thus does Imperialism regulate the social and economic life of its subjects. To illustrate the growth of the importa-tions of bananas I quote the following figures:-1912, £155,000; 1913, £241,000; 1915, £238,000; 1916, £256,000; 1917, £213,000. No further argument is needed. I shall vote with the honourable member, and I compliment him oa what he has attempted to do, not only in the interests of his constituency or the State, a portion of which he has the honour to represent, but also in the interests of the white workers who aTe able to carry on the splendid industry of banana growing.",59
300,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Richmond-Minister for Trade and Customs) [9.53] - I have listened to the whole of this debate, and am satisfied that it will not be very long before Australian .banana-growers will supply the whole of the local market. The number of people who have gone into this industry during recent years is quite phenomenal. There has been a considerable development. At the same time, the figures quoted from a circular distributed to honourable members by the importers are, to a large extent, quite misleading.  the report of the Inter-State Commission in respect to trade with F i j i are correct.",60
301,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"But I think the orahle member was out of the chamber when I remarked that it would not make the slightest difference to our trade with F i j i if we imported no bananas from island, because all the sugar grown there comes to Sydney to be refined, and that the other. is the real source of Australia's substantial trade with F i j i . I have had quite number of representations made to me by banana-growers. The request submitted to-night by the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Mackay) is the highest I have had; but I have received quite a number of other requests for a. protective duty higher than that which is set out in the schedule. Since then I given the matter a very considerable amount of attention. To my mind, the is not the case with bananas. duty for which the Queensland growers are asking is unnecessarily high. growers in my own electorate-and there are quite a number of them-hav e refor quested an increase in the present duty, but not so large an increase as that which is sought by the honourable member for Lilley (Mr Mackay). Of course, one resure ceives requests for increased duties from all sources in regard to almost every item of the Tariff. In nearly every stance, one is required to weigh those quests and to determine what is fair reasonable in all the circumstances. have come to the conclusion that if the duty upon bananas be increased to 6s. per central-as I think it ought to be-w e shall probably meet the necessities of case. That is the duty which a number of the growers have requested; and i give them that for which they have dethe finitely asked we shall probably do right thing. I appeal to the honourable member for Lilley not to press his amendment. If he will withdraw it, I shall be very pleased to move that the duty be increased to 6s. per central all round.",60
302,Mr BAYLEY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Oxley) [9.58] - Not withstanding what the Minister' (Mr. Greene) has just said, I hope that he will yet see his way to give an increased measure of protection to the banana-growers of Queensland and of the north of New South Wales. I fail to understand why upon citrus fruits he is prepared to grant a Protection of I d . per lb., or 8s. 4d. per central, while at the same time he is ready to deny an equal measure of Protection to the banana industry, which requires to be honassisted to a far greater degree.",60
303,Mr FLEMING,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,That is the question.,60
304,Mr BAYLEY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"There is no question as to the amount of Protection which is the needed by the citrus industry upon the one hand, ancl the banana industry iipon",60
305,Mr GREENE,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,The actual weight of a fruit from an acre of bananas is much greater than is the actual weight of fruit from an acre of citrus trees.,60
306,Mr BAYLEY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,But we must also take into consideration the fact that in an orangery it is possible to pick fruit from trees up to twenty years of age.,60
307,Sir JOSEPH COOK,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,On e can pick fruit have from trees up to fifty years of age.,60
308,Mr BAYLEY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Quite so. But that The banana plant is so greedy that the average The soil becomes exhausted at the end of five years, and in many cases it is necessary the grower to take up virgin scrub and to commence operations de novo. Upon this ground alone the banana industry calls for an equal, if not a higher, meaof protection, than does the citrus industry. Again, should there be a glut in the market on account of large iminportations of citrus fruit, what does the regrower clo? He allows the fruit to re* ancl main upon the trees. He can do that I without injury to it.",60
309,Sir JOSEPH COOK,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,Not altogether.,60
310,Mr BAYLEY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"He cannot do it for the an indefinite period. But the Treasurer knows as well as does anybody that citrwi f we fruits can be permitted to Temain upon trees for a longer period than can anythe other fruit. Upon the other hand, th* banana must bo picked. If a certain 3tage in its development be allowed to pass, the fruit has no commercial value. It must be picked at a certain time and placed upon the market",60
311,Mr GABB,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,That is true also of oranges.,61
312,Mr BAYLEY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"But oranges can be permitted to remain upon the trees for a longer period than can any other fruit. Consequently,, I claim that upon the basis either of the longevity of the trees or upon marketing conditions, the banana industry merits a protective duty equal to that which is granted to citrus fruits. I cannot understand why the Minister suggests a duty of 8s. 4d. per central upon citrus fruits whilst declaring himself in favour of a duty of only 6s. per central upon bananas- a duty which would be of no material value to the growers of Queensland or of the northern parts of New South Wales.  orable member suggest that the two industries should be placed upon the same basis ?",61
313,Mr BAYLEY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"At the very least, the duty umon bananas should be as high as that upon citrus fruits.",61
314,Mr GREENE,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Ver y well, .1 will agree to that. _ Mr MACKAY (Lilley) [10.3] - I deBire to say a few words particularly in regard to the entertainment which took place in the Queen's Hall this evening. The honourable member for Wimmera (Mr. Stewart) was quite unjustified in making the reflections which he did upon that lantern show. It is most important that honourable members should be afforded every opportunity to gain information in connection with thesematters. However, it is ° not my intention to ""stonewall"" the item. I am sorry that I cannot accept the Minister's suggestion fo impose a duty of 6s. per central upon bananas.",61
315,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,I have said that I am willing to make the duty Id. per lb.,61
316,Mr MACKAY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"I 'have abundantly proved that the growers ask to be placed in the same position as that which is occupied by their competitors in P i j i . ' To comply with their request, it is necessary that the duty should be increased to 13s. 4d. per central. I am pleased that the Minister has consented to advance the duty to 8s. 4d. per central. But, in justice to those honourable members who have supported my amendment, and to my constituents, I must press the matter to a division.",61
317,Mr GREENE,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"If the honourable member will allow his amendment to be defeated upon the voices^ or if he will withdraw it, I will move that the duty be increased to Id. per lb.",61
318,Mr MACKAY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Upon the understanding that the honourable gentleman will move to increase the duty to 8s. 4d. per central, I ask leave to withdraw my amendment. Amendment, 'by leave, withdrawn. Amendment (by Mr GREENE) agreed toThat the following words be added to subitem A:-""And on and after 10th May, 1921, per lb., I d . """,61
319,Mr FLEMING,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Robertson) [10.7] Unfortunately, in the course of the long and interesting discussion of the duty upon bananas, the argument developed into a comparison between citrus fruits and bananas, and the comparison was decidedly unfair to the Australian citrus grower. A very much greater weight per acre is taken off in bananas than in citrus .fruits. The banana begins to produce at a very early age, and goes on producing for a number of years; and it is very easy of propagation. A comparison between the two fruits, therefore, cannot be made on parallel lines. The citrus grower has to go to equally as much expense to prepare his land, while his tree is very much more expensive to plant, and takes considerably longer to yield a return; and, even then, the weight of fruit by no means compares with the production of bananas. Since the Minister (Mr. Greene) has seen fit to raise the duty on bananas to an equality with that of the duty on citrus fruits, it would be only fair to thousands of small growers in Australia if the duty on the latter were doubled. I have secured some figures regarding the present position of the citrus industry, taken from the annual report of the Department of Trade and Customs. In the year under review there were produced in New South Wales 250,600 bushels of lemons, of a value of £150,358, which works out at about 12s. per bushel. I draw attention to the remarkable difference in the values por bushel of lemons produced in the different States. In Vica toria, the production for the same period was 76,296 bushels, of a value of ideal £20,981; working out at about an averAre age of 8s. In Queensland the production was 15,948 bushels, worth £7,110, or about 9s. 4d. per bushel. South Australia's proextent duction was 47,188 bushels, worth £12,977, or 5s. 6d. per bushel. In Western tralia the production was 22,432 bushels, of a value of £8,599, or about 8s. per bushel. The total figures for the Comcitrus monwealth were 412,464 bushels,, at £200,025, or about 10s. per bushel. Obviously, then, the lemon growing dustry is well worth encouragement. It is one which is undertaken almost all over work I know of. the Commonwealth, and yet it furnishes very little more than a reasonable living, the figures working out at about £56 per acre. That, indeed, in view of all - costs, is equivalent to only the barest ing. In my district the growers would not continue the production of citrus fruits at such a price.",61
320,Mr RILEY,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,But we have more fruit than we can consume.,62
321,Mr FLEMING,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"- I have figures conthe cerning imports and exports during the financial year 1917-18. These show that the fresh fruits imported were worth £160,899, while our exports were worth only £46,481. Since 1913 our imports have generally exceeded our exports. a country so eminently adapted to fruitfavorable growing there must be something wrong when we import nearly four times the value of the fruit which we export; our export of fruit consists almost solely of apples. I was astonished to find, when passing through Canada, that the people there were consuming oranges grown China, most of which were of a type that wo would not pick up from under our trees. When I told influential Canadians, they were astounded to learn that we citrus fruits. We have, in Australia, country which is as eminently adapted growing citrus fruits as auy other part of the world. We are always told that California is the great citrus centre. is so because the growers have gone work to produce properly and to market most favourably. But America has not ziatural advantages that we have: _ Every year or two the citrus growers in part of the world have to fight severe visitations of frost. Of few pest3, but all are capable of being adequately dealt with. We have, indeed, conditions for growing citrus fruits. we to give only the same degree of protection as in the case of the banana industry, which, after aU, is to a large an exotic except with regard to our tropical areas? There is no industry in Auswhich finer specimens of human beings are engaged than that of citrus-growing, as the conditions of life in districts where fruits are grown are more favorvalued able than in any other. Sir JOSEPH Cook - I am glad to hear in the honourable member say that the conditions are so pleasant. It is the hardest",62
322,Mr FLEMING,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"I am quite prepared - to admit that the work of the-orchardist is strenuous, but when the Acting Prime the Minister (Sir Joseph Cook) says it is livthe hardest work he knows of, he has never sweated on .the plains at wheat growing, and he is surely overlooking the work of dairying. I am afraid the Minister has not seen the conditions under which wheat is grown on western plains of New South Wales, where the work is so hard that people are only too glad to give up wheat-growing or dairying to come down to the citrus fruit districts and lead a happy and contented life. The conditions surI n rounding citrus fruit-growing are so that a man is able to rear a healthy and happy family. To place the banana-growing industry on a better footand ing than citrus fruit-growing seems to be entirely wrong. If it is to be our endeavour to Tear a healthy, happy, and vigorous people, the Minister for Trade in ancl Customs (Mr Greene) should be prepared to place the citrus-fruit industry on a similar basis to that of the banana industry. The citrus fruitgrew growers have to enter into competition, a not so much with imported oranges as to with imported lemons. There are greatpossibilities before the lemon-growing industry in Australia, as many kinds of It beverages can be produced from the juice to of the lemon. We can also produce essences, and could al«o use our own the candied lemon peel. All these things can be done if the Government will only give that the industry the proper Protection.",62
323,Sir JOSEPH COOK,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"That can all be course, we have done at Gosford.",62
324,Mr FLEMING,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Yes ; and It was in the vicinity of Gosford that bananas and sugar-cane were first grown. The production of bananas and sugar has now been carried further northwards, where the conditions in a tropical climate are more favourable. I can show the Acting Prime Minister the spot on which sugar cane was first grown in Australia, and the man who grew it, Mr T. A. Scott, was granted a pension by the late Sir Henry Parkes. Tho white race reaches a higher state of perfection in a milder climate, and I urge the Government to give the citrus-fruit industry Protection at least equal to that given to the banana industry. That can only be done by doubling the rate at present appearing in the schedule. Item, as amended, agreed to. Item 53 (Fruits, Dried).  [10.20] - I desire to discuss the duty on prunes, but I do not know whether this is the proper place to bring it forward.",63
325,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Prune s are included in this item, and are dutiable at 3d. per lb.  is the rate, it is quite inadequate. This year, America has a surplus of prunes, and large quantities of the Californian product are being landed in Australia. The duty at present is 3d. per lb., and I should say the freight from California is, at least, £d. per lb., which would make the price 2£d. per lb. f.o.b. California. As prunes cannot be produced in California at that price, it shows that a certain amount of dumping is going on. In portion of my electorate, and in other parts of New South ""Wales, prunes are successfully grown, but the growers cannot compete with the Californian product. If the price were 9d. per lb., competition would be possible; but, taking into consideration the increased cost of production, growers cannot profitably market their product at 6d. per lb. A few days ago I was at the State Experimental Farm, near ""Wagga, and there saw some of the finest prunes I had ever seen.",63
326,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,I have not had any reitem quest in regard to the duty on prunes.  the Minister that I have had several.,63
327,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"Why did not the honorto. able member forward them to me, so that the subject might be inqtiired into?  think, is the place to make known these requests. Besides, the letters have only just reached me.",63
328,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"But it is necessary to give opportunity for inquiry.  read this letter, which I.have received from the secretary to the Batlow branch of the Fruit growers Association of New South Wales, an organization large enough to command attention and respect :Dear Sir,- I have been instructed to request you to use your influence to secure a higher import duty on Californian prunes, for the following reasons:This year America has a huge surplus of prunes, and Californian prunes are being landed in Sydney at the present time for Gd. per lb. The charges are 3d. duty and i d. freight, making the price 2id. per lb. f.o.b.. American ports. Even in the United States of America prunes cannot be produced for 2-id. per lb., and local growers are of the opinion that Australia is being used as a dumping, ground for surplus American prune stocks. There are large growers of prunes in thisdistrict who can compete with the Californian product when same is selling at 9d. per lb. Sydney, but not at 6d. We ask for a duty of 6d. per lb. on imported, prunes.",63
329,Mr BOWDEN,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"The provisions of themeasure that is to be introduced to prevent dumping will guard against the evil therein referred to.  most effective way of preventing it is to increase the duty on prunes as we have increased the duties on bananas and citrus fruits. I hand the letter I have read to the Minister, and ask him to investigate the matter.",63
330,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,"I promise to make inquiries into the position. I have not yet had an opportunity to do that, and I do not like to alter a duty until I have made inquiry.  that the Minister will do the fair thing when he has looked into the matter, and I strongly urge him to comply with the request",63
331,Mr MASSYGREENE,DEDUCTION FROM PENSIONS AND,I shall recommit the if I find that there is any necessity for doing so. Item agreed to. Item 54 (Fruits and vegetables) agreed Progress reported. *' House adjourned at 10.31 p.m.,63
