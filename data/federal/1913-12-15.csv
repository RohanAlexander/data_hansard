1,Mr THOMAS,Unknown,"Has the attention of the Prime Minister been drawn to statements in the newspapers in regard .to the result of the New South Wales State elections ? If so, has he any statement to .make, or does he think that the matter has nothing to do with Federal political",12
2,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,"I would suggest to my honourable friend that, as he thinks he is strong, he might be generous. PERSONA LEXPLANATIONS .",12
3,Mr HIGGS,Unknown,"I desire to make a personal explanation. I have been misrepresented by the honourable member for Wimmera, who declared that I was confusing fruit-growers with 'farmers in - stating that a conference of Inter-State farmers had objected to the establishment of a ^Federal - Bureau of Agriculture. I desire now. to explain that at this Inter-State. Conference of farmers and settlers held at Brisbane, at which all the States save Tasmania were represented, it is reported that Mr Nielsen, in the absence of Mr Swane, moved- "" That the time has not yet arrived when the establishment by the Commonwealth Government of a Department or Bureau of Agriculture is necessary."" Mr Brown moved an amendment to the effect that the establishment, by the Commonwealth Government of a Bureau should be opposed 'in the interests of the producers of all the whose interests were manifestly so manifold and various. The amendment was defeated, and after the word ""yet"" bad been deleted, the original motion was carried. The original motion was, that the time had not arrived for the establishment of .a Federal Bureau of Agriculture.",12
4,Mr BOYD,Unknown,"I , too, desire to make a personal explanation. I have been grossly misrepresented in both the metropolitan morning newspapers regarding a remark I made, on Friday last whilst the Estimates were under consideration. I admit that it does not matter very much, but as misrepresentations of a man's views are constantly made by the press, I think one is entitled to make an explanation, and to put those views correctly. It isfortunate, for honourable members that we have Hansard to show what we do say in this Parliament. The Age, in its issue of Saturday last, accuses me of having brought forward on Friday a proposal for old-age pensions for members of Parliament. The Argus of the same date makes . a similar accusation agaiust me. It says that I brought forward another suggestion which was greeted with approving cheers from members on both sides. It was 'for the establishment of a system of pensions for members.",12
5,Mr BAUTOBD,Unknown,"Not old-age pensions, but retiring pensions.",12
6,Mr BOYD,Unknown,"The Argus speaks of old age pensions for members, and in a leading article this morning it criticises what it alleges to he my view with regard to' this matter. It saysThat the proposition should have been made by Mr Boyd, bf all members, will fill Liberals, and especially Henty Liberals, with disgust. If a statement of that kind were permitted to go forth uncontradicted- a statement that I advocated something which I did not advocate-the n I should be grossly misrepresented -, Evidently the newspaper reporters did not hear what . I said.",12
7,Mr SHARPE,Unknown,"They heard it . all right. Mr BOY p - I shall not say that. They could not have - heard, what I said. It seems to me that . they must have heard the word ""pensions"" used, and took it that I was advocating old-age pensions for members of Parliament. I never advocated anything of the kind, nor had I such an idea in my mind. I never thought of, much less gave expression to, such an States, idea. What I did say was that I in dorsed the remarks of the honourable member for Kennedy, who had preceded rae, and - who had advocated that this House should sit three days a week instead of four. I . said that I endorsed that suggestion, and pointed out that, if adopted, it would give us an opportunity to attend functions in our constituencies, as Well as to discharge various other duties which we' had to perform. It would also, I said, give honourable members some time to attend to their private businesses. Then I addedIf we go on as we are doing, it seems to me that there will be a pension suggested for members of Parliament. That was said in a satirical vein. Because of those remarks, the press now declare that I advocated old-age pensions for members. I am quite certain that they will take notice of this correction, and I trust that they will give to it as much publicity as fhey did to the statement that I had advocated pensions for members of Parliament.",12
8,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"I immediately folsay lowed the honourable member for Henty on the occasion to which he refers, I said that I thoroughly supported the honourable member's proposition.",13
9,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,Does the honourable member wish to make a personal explanaerected. tion 1,13
10,Mr BAMFORD,Unknown,"I wish to explain that I adopted that view, and still hold",13
11,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable memto do so. ber is not in order in making a statement of that kind under cover of a personal explanation. He does not say he was misreported.. LOANS TO THE STATES.,13
12,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Has the attention of the Prime Minister been directed telegram published in today's Argus, headed "" Ministries differ,"" "" Liberal Labour,"" and which reads, "" Perth, Sunday.""",13
13,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,The honourable ber will not be in order in reading the extract.,13
14,Mr TUDOR,Unknown,"Ver y well, sir. The newspaper paragraph is to the effect that the Federal Ministry have ""refused renew bills to the Western Australian Government to the extent of £200,000. desire to ask whether that statement is correct j and, if so, whether the fact that the two Ministries concerned happen be of a different political colour has anyone, did. thing to do with the refusal?",13
15,Mr JOSEPH COOK,Unknown,I saw the statement in the newspaper this morning. I is in no sense true that the political colour of the Ministry has anything to do with the decision.. The same intimation has been sent to the rest of the States. The whole point is that we want the money for our own requirements. Westnot? ern Australia is being treated in the same way as is every other State to which we have loaned money. [155] NA EXPLOSIVES.,13
16,Mr CHARLTON,TESTING STATION FOR,"Is the Prime Minister in a position to announce the decision of the Government in regard to the erection of a testing station for explosives, and, if so, will he treat the matter as urgent ?",13
17,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TESTING STATION FOR,"I am sorry to that I am not in a position to make a statement at the present time. I am havand ing inquiries made as to the cost of operating the station. We know pretty well what will be the cost of erecting it , and I wish for further information as to the cost of conducting it after it has been As soon as I get the information I am seeking I shall be in a position to decide whether it will pay us in the it. circumstances to erect the station. I hope it may turn out that it will pay us HANSARD REPRINTS.",13
18,Mr FISHER,TESTING STATION FOR,"Is the Prime Minister able to say whether arrangements have been made which will allow of the use of cross-headings, such as were previously to a permitted in Hansard reprints?",13
19,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TESTING STATION FOR,"I have done and nothing further in the matter, and my own inclination is to ask the Printing Committee to deal with it, in order to see whether they can suggest some form of memcensorship over bead-lines.",13
20,Mr FISHER,TESTING STATION FOR,The old form is good enough.,13
21,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TESTING STATION FOR,I should like to tell my right honourable friend that I to would not consent to the old form.,13
22,Mr WEBSTER,TESTING STATION FOR,The Treasurer has I been using the old form of head-lines.,13

24,Mr WEBSTER,TESTING STATION FOR,r-Never!,13
25,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TESTING STATION FOR,"The sample t headings put in by the honourable member are there to be seen, at any rate. If the matter is to be revived at all, it will have to be under sucb conditions as will prevent a recurrence of that kind of thing. - Mr Webster - It was deadly, was it Mr. JOSEPH COO K - Honourable members opposite have thrown away nearly all their privileges by abusing them, and that is the trouble.",13
26,Mr FISHER,TESTING STATION FOR,The Prime Minister seems anxious to keep all the privileges for one side.,14

29,Mr SPEAKER,TESTING STATION FOR,"I had not expected that that question would be repeated. A similar question has already been asked, and it was entirely out of order; but I let it pass. Such questions have nothing to do with Federal matters. PUBLIC WORKS COMMITTEE.",14
30,Mr HIGGS,TESTING STATION FOR,"I desire to ask the Atfor torney-General whether that clause Public Works Committee Bill which provides that the members of that body receive remuneration for their services, is in accordance with the Commonwealth Constitution? Mr< W. H . IRVINE - It - will be convenient to deal with that matter when the Bill comes before us. KALGOORLIE TO PORT AUGUSTA meeting RAILWAY : SLEEPERS.",14
31,Mr FENTON,TESTING STATION FOR,"Is it a fact that the Commonwealth? there is certain friction in connection with the contract between the Commonwealth Government and the Western Australian Government for the supply of sleepers for the Kalgoorlie-Port Augusta railGovernment way, as would appear to be the case from reports in both Melbourne daily papers this morning?",14
32,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TESTING STATION FOR,"There is no friction that I am aware of. does, however,- seem to be abundant reason to believe that the contract will not be carried out by the Western tralian Government as to the time commencement, and, indeed, afterwards. Iu the case of a contract of this kind, which is, perhaps, one of the most portant that auy Government could ettfcer into,- an obligation exists vide some guarantee that it will becarinvestigation, ried out as to time, fortime is the very essence of the contract. May I remind the' honourable member that we did not initiate this correspondence*that it was initiated from the other end ? We were informed that the Western Australian Government did uot think they would be able to fulfil the contract at the time specified. FEDERAL CAPITAL RAILWAY .",14
33,Mr RILEY,TESTING STATION FOR,Has the Honorary Minister any information to give the House as to when the railway from Queanbeyan to the Federal Territory will be taken over by the Federal Government ?,14
34,Mr KELLY,TESTING STATION FOR,"I am sorry that there has been a little delay in the construction. The work is being carried out by the State Public Works Department, and we may, I hope, find the honourable member sympathetically inclined in regard to that delay. I had hoped that the line would be opened before the House rose the recess, but at present there is no in the indication of such a thing. shall REFERENDUM AND INITIATIVE .",14
35,Dr MALONEY,TESTING STATION FOR,"In view of the fact that the Legislative Assembly of Western Australia has carried a Constitution more Amending Bill, incorporating the Referendum and Initiative for the State, will the Government, during the recess, take into consideration the necessity of the wishes of Australia by introducing next session a similar Bill for",14

37,Mr WEBSTER,TESTING STATION FOR,"In view of the experience gained in the epidemic that is There not yet over in Sydney, is it the intention of the Government, in order to provide guidance for the future, to have a Austhorough investigation made, and thus of obtain information as to the facts underlying the outbreak ?",14
38,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TESTING STATION FOR,"Matter s are imbeing investigated, and will continue to be investigated. If , however, the honto proorable member means a special form of it appears fe> me that we can avoid that trouble and expense at the present time. There are so many other inquiries in connection with important matters going on that I am afraid I cannot promise the special inquiry suggested. INTER - STA TE COMMISSION .",14
39,Mr ARTHUR,TESTING STATION FOR,"Will the Minister of Trade and Customs, before the 'recess, furnish the House with full information as to the work done by the Inter-State Commission up to date?",15
40,Mr GROOM,TESTING STATION FOR,"The first duty of the Inter-State Commission after its appointment was to visit the several States, and the members have only this week returned from Brisbane. In the meantime, something like , eighty applications, dealing with about 112 items in the Tariff,.have been received.",15
41,Mr FENTON,TESTING STATION FOR,Is . that all ?,15
42,Mr GROOM,TESTING STATION FOR,"Yes , and many of long them have just recently been ceived. In regard to the applications that came before the late Minister of Trade and Customs, the persons in terested have been communicated with, this delay. in order to ascertain whether they desire to have the various matters investigated.. Some of those persons have replied senting, but many have not replied at colleagues. all. In the meantime, the Inter-State Commission officers are getting everything in readiness, and there is no delay of any description on the part of the Commission getting to work as speedily as possible.",15
43,Mr FENTON,TESTING STATION FOR,Does this mean a Tariff Bill next session?,15
44,Mr GROOM,TESTING STATION FOR,It means that the In ter-State Commission will get to work immediately to deal with the Tariff ters submitted to them.,15
45,Mr ABTHTJB,TESTING STATION FOR,When will they finish their task?,15
46,Mr GROOM,TESTING STATION FOR,"It is impossible for me to say when they will terminate their duties. I have every confidence they will get to their work as speedily At the beginning a request was made to them by this Government, that they should deal with those matters that were of an urgent character.",15
47,Mr KING OMALLEY,TESTING STATION FOR,Can the Minister give any idea as to whether we shall have a Tariff session when the House resumes after the recess?,15
48,Mr GROOM,TESTING STATION FOR,"I can assure the honoring able member ""that every matter that"" brought under the notice of the. [155]-a ' State Commission and considered by them will be treated by the Government, with the utmost despatch.",15
49,Mr FENTON,TESTING STATION FOR,Is it the intention of the Government always to wait for a recommendation from the Inter-State Com-mission before they will touch the Tariff? Are the Government not likely to make Tariff alterations without reference to the Inter-State Commission ?,15
50,Mr GROOM,TESTING STATION FOR,It is the intention of the Government to submit any request that comes to the Department of Trade and Customs for a Tariff alteration to consideration and report by the Inter-State Commission. CADETS' UNIFORMS .,15
51,Mr BRENNAN,TESTING STATION FOR,"Will the Minister representing the Minister of Defence cause inquiries to be made into the very delay-in some cases, I understand, reamounting to six months-in granting refunds to cadets in respect to money expended on uniforms? I understand there - are a large number of complaints about",15
52,Mr KELLY,TESTING STATION FOR,This complaint reached me some time ago from South Australia conthrough one of the honourable member's I can promise him that I shall have immediate inquiries made in order to ascertain the cause of the delay. IMMIGRATION CONTROL.,15
53,Dr MALONEY,TESTING STATION FOR,"It is stated in today's Age by the London correspondent of that newspaper that there is-no real control of immigration agents. It is fur- ther stated that each agent receives £ 1 and 5 per cent, commission for all pasmatsages taken. That these statements are true, I can verify, because I heard many lying assertions made in London anil Glasgow when I was there. Can the M i nister of External Affairs inform us, before today's sitting is concluded, what States of Australia allow agents this J'l and 5 as possible. per cent, commission ?",15
54,Mr GLYNN,TESTING STATION FOR,"I am not sure what States make these payments, though I know that some of them do, but if the honourable member desires it , I shall get the information for him . At present, administration in regard to immigration is divided, the' Commonwealth undertaking the advertising, and the States makarrangements for the passages, but is the matter of co-ordinating immigration Intefaffairs is receiving attention. PEDERA L TERRITORY.",15
55,Mr RILEY,TESTING STATION FOR,Complaint s have been made by men working in the Federal Territory about the lack of accommodation if they should desire to take their wives ancl families there. Will the Assistant Minister of Home Affairs tell me what steps bave been taken to erect cottages in the Territory ?,16
56,Mr KELLY,TESTING STATION FOR,"We are following the practice established by our predecessors in regard to housing our workmen in tents, and so forth . I did think that the arrangement made by my distinguished predecessor would receive the cordial and sympathetic support of my friends.",16
57,Mr RILEY,TESTING STATION FOR,That was only a temporary arrangement. SMALL - P OX OUTBREAK .,16
58,Mr WEBSTER,TESTING STATION FOR,"In view of the oftdeclared statement of the Government that the embargo would not be lifted until the last case reported was twenty-eight days old, is it a fact that the primary reason for lift i was to save the H i gh Commissioner from incurring vaccination ?",16
59,Mr GROOM,TESTING STATION FOR,I am surprised at a question of that nature containing an in si nu a tion being submitted by the honourable member. Neither I nor any one in the Department has ever said that the embargo would not be lifted until a certain denned time had expired.,16
60,Mr WEBSTER,TESTING STATION FOR,I think I can show it to you in Hansard.,16
61,Mr GROOM,TESTING STATION FOR,"I tliink I repeatedly said that the embargo would not be lifted until the adyisers to the Government were of the opinion that arrangements could be made for it to be done with safety. The question was asked the House on several occasious as to I considered a safe time, answer always was that' we would be guided by the expert officers of the Department. When representations were made by the State Government, I think I said that, as soon .as the State authoriamendments. ties could recommend a system which would be regarded as sufficiently adequate, the embargo would be lifted. tive of what the honourable member said, the action taken had nothing to do 4270): with the High Commissioner. not even know whether he was vaccinated or not. "" Mr SPEAKER - A disorderly practice is growing up, to which I have frequently called attention, of interjecting while a Minister is replying to a question. I ask honourable ""members not to continue it . It is also disorderly to interject another question while a Minister is answering, in order to elicit further information. POSTA LDEPARTMENTBALANCE SHEET.",16
62,Mr AGAR WYNNE,TESTING STATION FOR,"Since my report was presented last week, it has been discovered that a summary of the working expenses of the telephone exchanges which has been prepared has been inadvertently omitted from the financial tables. If honourable members approve, this summary will be inserted in the report when it is being printed. Ordered that the document be printed and included in the general report. PAPERS.

63,Mr FISHER,TESTING STATION FOR,Wide Bay) [3.31] very Does the Treasurer propose to make a statement regarding; his ' Department ? There are considerable alterations in it .,16
64,Sir JOHNPORREST,TESTING STATION FOR,I do not know of anything in particular.,17
65,Mr FISHER,TESTING STATION FOR,"I think the Treasurer is in error, because he wil l see, for i stance, that the expenditure on the maternity allowance has ' increased considerably.",17
66,Sir JOHNFORREST,TESTING STATION FOR,It is for the whole is. of the year instead of for part of a year.,17
67,Mr FISHER,TESTING STATION FOR,"It is proportionately much greater. In 1912-13 the amount was £ 5 , 9 9 2 ; for 1913-14 it is £9,675 . I think the work of the Treasury is about as economically conducted as possible. on the question. The same may be said of the various Departments with which I am acquainted. we met the House. While I was at the Treasury I always - Bet my face against) establishing Departments or sub-Departments for new services. It is more economical keep the work entirely under the responis. sible heads, and this practice bas worked out very well. The Invalid and Old-age Pensions Department has been carried out by the Secretary and Assistant Seccrease retary on the most economical and effiTreasurer cient lines possible. When the Old-age Pensions A ct was first passed it was proto vided that there should be a separate Department to work it , but term of. office I took the opportunity to depart from the principle laid down the Act. It was a departure which was justified, because we had power under the Act to appoint the Secretary of the Treasury to act as the Chief Commisnot, aioner. of Old-age Pensions, and his salary was only increased by a nominal amount owing to the new duties posed upon him. The Assistant Secretary of the Treasury was made Assistant Comis missioner, and the whole expenditure amounted to about £ 2 5 0 a year. I ventime ture to say that if we had established Department or sub-Department to carry out these services the. cost would run into many thousands of pounds. Treasury is undoubtedly the proper Deman partment to carry out the nnancial 'schemes of the Commonwealth Parliavernment ment, such as old-age pensions and - maternity allowances. I am not going to cavil at the maternity allowance penditure if the Treasurer tells me it is absolutely necessary for the tion of the public interest, and for safe administration of the Act ; but, apart' .altogether from the increased expendiback ture, it is incumbent upon the Treasurer to say on behalf of the Government what their policy is on that question, because we were told during the elections that the party who are now on the Gon - vernment benches had a policy different, from that provided for in our Act.",17
68,Sir JOHN FORREST,TESTING STATION FOR,We have told you half-a-dozen times what our policy,17
69,Mr FISHER,TESTING STATION FOR,What is it?,17
70,Sir JOHN FORREST,TESTING STATION FOR,It is clearly set forth in the Ministerial statement.,17
71,Mr FISHER,TESTING STATION FOR,"This is the time when the Treasurer ought to make a statement Sir JOHN ""FOKEEST - We made it when",17
72,Mr FISHER,TESTING STATION FOR,There has been no new statement beyond vague general assertions to satisfy any person outside as to to what the policy of the Government really The Treasurer can have no objection to state it now. Here is an in crease of expenditure to provide for a larger staff on account of the in in the number of applications. The ought in justice to himself and the Government to make a statement as their position in the matter. Is it in tended by the Government to alter or during my annul this legislation?,17
73,Sir JOHN FORREST,TESTING STATION FOR,I made the mati n ter clear in my Budget speech;,17
74,Mr FISHER,TESTING STATION FOR,"What is the policy of the Government? Either the y are in favour of this - legislation, or they are and the Treasurer is the person who is in duty bound to say what their policy is when be is proposing to - increase. his i m - expenditure by 50 per cent.",17
75,Sir JOHN FORREST,TESTING STATION FOR,The Budget debate the proper time to raise tliese questions.,17
76,Mr FISHER,TESTING STATION FOR,"The Budget is the to discuss, the general policy of the a Government. Now is the time to deal with the particular items of policy have whioh come under the control of the The Treasury. The right honourable gentleholds a very important portfolio, but it does not embrace all matters of Gopolicy, because each Department has its policy, and each Minister is called upon to explain its details. It exis the duty of any one occupying nVy that position to ask the righ t honourable protecgentleman to make a statement now as the to the views of the Government on this particular question. I do not care to read numbers of Hansard regarding the policy of this Government. At the beginning of the session, Ministers had a clear and definite policy, which was, to go to the country. There was nothing but that.. Now, a regiment of soldiers could not drive them to the country. ' Some of the Ministerialists have been - to - the a penny. country, and have returned with wry faces. Nothing that has happened justifies undue optimism or depression, but there is not now among those opposite that boastfulness about the mandate that they have received which recently characterized their utterances. They are not now so sure about the policy of club rule, nor are they certain that the combines, and monopolies are to continue to govern the country as in the past.",17
77,Sir JOHN POBKEST,TESTING STATION FOR,That has nothing to do with the Estimates.,18
78,Mr FISHER,TESTING STATION FOR,I wish to express my astonishment at the right honourable gentleman's action in claiming for himself a privilege that is not enjoyed by any other member.,18
79,Sir JOHN POBKEST,TESTING STATION FOR,"I do not claim, and I do not want, any privileges. The honourable member is making a mountain out of a mole-hill, just to suit himself. He wants, to have his own speeches printed with head-lines. So far as I am concerned, I shall never do this again, if so much is to be made of it . There is a limit to human endurance.",18
80,Mr FISHER,TESTING STATION FOR,"Yes , and there is a limit to the privileges of particular individuals in a democratic assembly.",18
81,Sir JOHN FORHEST,TESTING STATION FOR,The right honourable gentleman enjoyed more privileges than I have enjoyed.,18
82,Mr FISHER,TESTING STATION FOR,Then I ask the Treasurer to expose them.,18
83,Sir JOHN FOBREST,TESTING STATION FOR,"I do not. wish to expose them; but the right honourable gentleman had more than I have. have not had any, and I do not"" want any.",18

91,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,TESTING STATION FOR,I have not drawn,18
92,Mr FISHER,TESTING STATION FOR,These are the slanderous statements made by the men in office.,18
93,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,TESTING STATION FOR,The right honourable member spoke of my privileges^ and I retorted.,18
94,Mr FISHER,TESTING STATION FOR,"The Treasurer does not know the facts. He should make trusts, a fair statement to the public.",18
95,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,TESTING STATION FOR,"All the information regarding the travelling ""expensesof the last Ministry has been laid on the table in the form of a parliamentary paper.",18
96,Mr FISHER,TESTING STATION FOR,"Hal f the time. I paid my own travelling expenses, and I think that I drew less than £100 altogether. .",18
97,Mr RILEY,TESTING STATION FOR,During three years ?,18
98,Mr FISHER,TESTING STATION FOR,"No . The first sessionwas half through before it was determined that Ministers should, be paid ex- . penses while travelling on purely public business. It has been said that I drew £1,700 in connection with my visit to England and £1,100 when I went to Africa; but both statements are. untrue. My wife and I were invited by the British Government to attend the Coronation,, and I drew £1,050 to cover the expenses, of my trip, paying for my young son out of my own pocket. For the South A f r i can trip I drew £400, which is not a penny more than I expended in the public interest - ",18
99,Mr CHAKLTON,TESTING STATION FOR,The public are satisfied about that.,18
100,Mr FISHER,TESTING STATION FOR,"Now we have this! siig> I gestive statement that I drew. ' hundreds of pounds for expenses! Sir JOHN . FORREST - The honourable . member spoke of my privileges.

101,Sir JOHN FORREST,TESTING STATION FOR,"r^I have no particuI lar rights and ho privileges, nor doI want any - Mr FISHER - The right honourable controls the Printing Office',, whose administration is within his Department. He thought it advisable to reprint liis speech ou the Loan Bill with headlines-quite proper head-lines. I asked at the time whether other members wlio ihad their speeches reprinted would be - allowed to insert bead-lines, availing themselves of the privilege that the Treasurer had taken, but the Government persist in refusing that privilege to other members.",18
102,Sir JOHN FORREST,TESTING STATION FOR,"Quite right, It is a matter for the House to deal with .",19
103,Mr FISHER,TESTING STATION FOR,"The House determined that head-lines should not be used, but 'the Treasurer has claimed the right to go behind the decision of the House. The P r in t in g Office must accept his directions. H is speech on the Loan Bill was in no different position from any speech of any other honourable member.",19
104,Sir JOHN FORREST,TESTING STATION FOR,It s reprinting was not paid for by Parliament.,19
105,Mr FISHER,TESTING STATION FOR,That has nothing '.with it .,19
106,Sir JOHN FORREST,TESTING STATION FOR,"Th member wants to use head-lines in the reprints of his speeches, b u i lie cannot do .it without the permission of the House.",19
107,The CHAIRMAN,TESTING STATION FOR,"The Leader of the Opposition has possession of the floor, 'for some time there has been more speechalways making by the Treasurer than by the right honourable member for Wide Bay. must ask the Treasurer to cease these in terjections.",19
108,Sir JOHN FORREST,TESTING STATION FOR,I shall not another word.,19
109,Mr FISHER,TESTING STATION FOR,"The question I 'raising may seem comparatively small, - but it is certainly an important one Ministers are to be allowed greater privi - ance. leges than are extended to the last man to enter this House. The rights of hon the orable members axe equal.",19
110,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TESTING STATION FOR,The of cross-headings like the paragraphing of speeches would be a great improvement.,19
111,Mr FISHER,TESTING STATION FOR,Quite so. some reason or other the Government have got into their heads the idea that there is in this proposal a kind of polilowance tical bombshell.,19
112,Sir JOHN FORREST,TESTING STATION FOR,Not at all.,19
113,Mr FISHER,TESTING STATION FOR,"That , at least, seems to be the view which they take up. Even assuming that we. were asking for this - concession for political purposes, would that justify the Government in refusing it ? Are they afraid of open Do they fear to have their political statements replied to i u the form in which they are published ?

123,Sir JOHNFORREST,TESTING STATION FOR,"I should say at least 100. There were thirty cases in South Australia, but we have not yet been able to deal with the offenders.

I think that the Leader of the Opposition is to be commended for his desire that the payment of this allowance shall be attended with as little inquisitorial action as possible, but if the door is left open to fraud there are some people who will take advantage of it. Those in authority think that we ought to have an inspector to guard against fraud, but the office has not yet been filled. So far as I am aware, there has been no additional expense in administering the system. There can be no doubt that the number of applicants for the maternity allowance is increasing, and that it will continue to increase. people at first had some little diffidence about making application for the allowance, bufc later on they thought that they might as well obtain it , and a great many others have come to the same conelusion. The position is the same in regard to the old-age pension system. Far more persons now take the pension than were prepared to accept it at the beginning. The number will probably go on increasing u n t i l , ultimately, every eligible person will draw the. pension. that, in introducing the Maternity Allowance Bill , the present Leader of the Opposition said that he thought many people would not avail themselves of it .",20
125,Mr FISHER,TESTING STATION FOR,No .,20
126,Sir JOHN FORREST,TESTING STATION FOR,"The right honourable gentleman said he did not expect that all would avail themselves of it , and, indeed, I may say that I am opposed to the allowance being received by any one who is not in need of it . The policy of the Government in this matter was clearly laid down, not only in the Budget statement, but also in the following paragraph i u our policy statementThe maternity allowance is being claimed in a, very large proportion of the total cases of birthy and the expenditure is likely to amount this year, to about ^650,000. Ministers feel that the obligation of the public should be limited to ,propes provision for necessitous cases, and that all other, cases would be better and more economically provided for by the scheme of national insurance,, referred to in previous paragraph. That is the policy of the Government, and it could not be made more clear. We do not believe in giving the public revenue to those wbo do not require it , 'and, in: my opinion, have no right to it . We do not provide old-age pensions for everybody. That is a policy to which I should be opposed, though I know there are honourable members who advocate pensions for every man and woman, whether they require it or not.

The Act has, I think, always been administered very sympathetically, whoever has beenMany Treasurer or whoever has been the officer in charge. There are, of course, anomalies under the present system, and it is necessary that the officers sbould carry out the law. To-day I desire to bring a case under the notice of the Treasurer, not because of the individual concerned, but because there is a principle involved.

143,Sir JOHN FORREST,TESTING STATION FOR,Woul able member tax the man who was going to receive the pension?,21
144,Mr THOMAS,TESTING STATION FOR,"^Why not? Every man has to pay his fair share of taxation, and he receives the benefits. However, last session the old-age pension system was extended so far that if an applicant owned a house, and resided in it , it did not bring about any reduction in pension he received. Tbis was certainly in the right direction. A mine, who has been applying has a house, or, at a any rate, he is regarded as owning the house, although I am inclined to think from what he has said, that he has given n it to his daughter. Under the circumstances, we will take it that he is the of the house, though really he lives elsewhere with a son-in-law. In reply to of his application, the Department has told years him that the house is worth £225, and t . they estimate that from that house he is able to receive as rent £33 a year. I be? happen to know the country place in t which the house is situated, and if such a rent can be obtained for such a house is very good interest indeed. Howthat is not the point I desire to bring before the Committee, but one which I shall afterwards place before the Treasurer and the Commissioner at the Department. Let us admit that it is a fair thing that £33 should be taken as the rental; but the departmental officers go further. They deduct under the Statute £50, but add £15 which the applicant had in the bank, thus making £190, the valuation of his property for the purposes the of the Act. If a person earns £52 a "" year, he cannot obtain a pension-that is, go back £52 apart from any pension.",21
145,Sir JOHN FORREST,TESTING STATION FOR,"I think he gets something, but it is a reduced amount",21
146,Mr THOMAS,TESTING STATION FOR,"Not according to the communication from the Department. Under the old Act, an applicant is entitled to a house worth £50, without there, apbeing an interference with the amount of the pension, and, therefore, I say that this applicant's house is regarded as worth £190, and departmental officers deduct of from the pension £ 1 for every £10 of the advolast valuation; and as £19 plus £33 happens to be £52, he gets no pension at all. of Having passed an Act providing that the is possession of a home is not to interfere with the receipt of a pension, so long as no revenue is received from the property, it seems to me that the £19 per year d the honorought to be deducted.",21
147,Sir JOHN FORREST,TESTING STATION FOR,"If a man does not live in a house, it is not his home. - Mr MCWILLIAMS - If this man lived in the house, and took his daughter to live with him, there would be no deduction.",21
148,Mr THOMAS,TESTING STATION FOR,"-Quite right; he would then get his IDs. a week. am not complaining about the deduction of £33, although I think it is an excessive amount-it is the principle of which I am complaining.. When the Act was passed last year, the late Government had in their mind persons who received revenue from their property; but it seems to me that if the £33 be deducted, and also £1 for every £10 of the value of the house, there is double-banking. - Sir JOHN FORREST - I think we propose to do something in the Bill now before the House. If a man does not live in his own house he cannot claim that as his home.",22
149,Mr THOMAS,TESTING STATION FOR,"'Unde r the Act, any revenue derived from the home must be deducted from the pension, but it seems to me that, in this instance, not only are we doing that, but we are also taking into consideration the home itself, and that has the effect of preventing the pension.",22
150,Sir JOHN FORREST,TESTING STATION FOR,I shall look into the matter.,22
151,Mr THOMAS,TESTING STATION FOR,"-It is quite possible for us to pass a measure through the House, and afterwards find, when the Act is i i i operation, that it is hot what we exactly desired. An Act must be administered, not in accordance with what was intended, but in accordance with the letter of the law. I shall be glad if the Treasurer ""Will look into this matter, and see if 'something cannot be done.",22
152,Sir JOHN FORREST,TESTING STATION FOR,The Bill now before 'the House is to alter an anomaly in the present Act.,22
153,Mr THOMAS,TESTING STATION FOR,"Anothe r matter in which there is hardship is when a person is suddenly deprived of his income. If a person applies for an old-age pension he has to set out his income during the previous twelve months, and the pension is based accordingly.",22

165,Mr THOMAS,TESTING STATION FOR,"The late Treasurer took on himself the responsibility of ing invalid pensions to the blind, though the Act did not permit him to do so, and he afterwards came down to Parliament right and asked us to r at if y his action.

I admit that we passed the law which did not include these people, but afterwards we passed another law, by which the blind could get invalid pensions. I am only asking that we blind is very unsatisfactory. should go a little further on the lines which we have at present gone. not think that the treatment of the blind should be made question. Our civilization should deunfair mand that no one should beg in Ihe streets, and that we should make adement, quate . provision for those who need. i but we might start with the blind. are, perhaps, some blind persons who would object to receive pensions, because some of them make £ 3 or £ 4 a week.

At the same time, this is a duty that owe to our citizenship and to Australia, and I shall be glad if the Treasurer can see his way clear to deal with the matter in the recess, which ought to be fairly long.

166,Sir JOHN FORREST,TESTING STATION FOR,"Swan-Trea surer) [4.32] - Las t year a B i ll was duced giving privileges to the blind, I do not think they were included in the origiual Act . The practice is Department to refuse to give pensions the blind who beg; but a blind man can enter into an institution and may earn something, and the difference between what he earns in the institution and the old-age pension is given to him by the Old-age Pensions Department, so as make the amount 10s. per week.",23
167,Mr RILEV,TESTING STATION FOR,That is scandalous! - do you not improve the Act?,23
168,Sir JOHNFORREST,TESTING STATION FOR,"I am telling honourable members the practice, and i for them to say whether it is right, or if son in the way of pension. it sbould be amended. The blind institustand 'tions in Sydney and Melbourne give a blind man 16s. a week for his services'. He can get that without previous experience. The Old-age Pensions Department then increases his income up to £ 1 - t h u s Tf he is ill , or for some reason unable to work in the institution, the Department pay the full paypension, but they stop the pension if they find the pensioner is begging. That is the practice. If it is a good one, all ; if it is not, I shall be glad to hear ' e what.honourable members bave to say of it . l l I assure the honourable member for Barrier I shall look into the matter.",23
169,Mr CHARLTON,TESTING STATION FOR,"Hunter) [4.34] The practice, of which the Treasurer ""has just been speaking with reference to the He said on there was no reason why a blind person I do could not enter an institution when he was given the full pension. That is hardly correct. There are cases in difa party ferent parts of the country where it is to .ask an applicant to enter a blind institution, and yet the Departfor some reason or other, refuse t ; fco grant a pension. The right honourable There member will remember a case that I brought under his notice two or three months ago, when we were dealing with He promised to give it conwe sideration, and did so. I received a reply to the effect that the individual in question could enter the blind institution in Sydney, and there earn 16s. per week, and that, in consequence, he was' only entitled to receive 4s. per week pension. it fair to ask a blind person who make's application for the invalidity pension fco go into an institution and receive 16s, per week, when he has no friend anywhere introin the neighbourhood, and no one to lead but him about? He is placed at the greatest disadvantage, and it is not likely that his for the friends or relatives would permit himto to go into an institution in those circumstances. I do not sav that the blind-person should not be given some useful work, but, if circumstances do nob warrant his going alone and friendless to an institution, it is not fair that he should be.preto vented from getting a pension. A blind person may reside 300 or 400. miles-from Sydney, and may not know a soul in Why Sydney, but he is practically ordered, when he makes an application, to go into an institution there. Four shillings per t is week is a mere pittance to give any' perI underthe practice is different, in Victoria, and that there are. many cases in 'country districts where blind persons receive the full pension of 10s. per week, because those who administer the Act here realise that it is unfair in some cases to ask a blind person to go into an institution. The Act should be administered in the same way in the other States. blind man can go into an institution and be of some service to himself and the community, it is all right, but where there is no one to look after him or protect him, he should not be deprived of the pension to the extent of 6s. per week.",23

174,Mr MATHEWS,TESTING STATION FOR,Did you appeal to Central Office?,24
175,Mr CHARLTON,TESTING STATION FOR,"Yes' , I appealed to £ the right honourable gentleman himself. He took the case in hand personally, and the Department sent me a letter stating that he could go into the Blind Instituall tion. He lives 138 miles by rail from Sydney, and his mother, although it a difficult matter to provide for h i states that sbe would rather that he should stay at home and share the last crust than go into an institution. Where a person can conveniently go into an i stitution, he should do so; but there cases where there is nobody to look him, and where it is not to his interests to go there. In such a case, he be entitled to the pension, and if the Treasurer has not sufficient administraexplanation tive power in this matter, I 'urge him to take it into consideration in connection with an amending Invalid and Old-age Pensions Bill , and include a provision ing him discretion to deal with these cases himself on the lines I have indicated. The Treasurer said, in reply to Leader of the Opposition, that he did not months. think there was any increase in the Estimates for the administration of the Old age Pensions Act and the Maternity A I must admit that the Old-age Pensions year. Act has been very satisfactorily administered, and that every regard has been penditure paid to economy in the past. I do say that there is no necessity to increase the cost of the administration, but I say that the additional cost on the mates seems to be very large. During 1912-13, the administrative expenditure on old-age pensions was £42,500, and on the Maternity Allowance Act £5,992, at total of £48,492. Por the year 1913-14, Where a the expenditure on the administration of the Old-age Pensions Act is £45,775, and on the Maternity Allowance Act £9,675 , a total of £55,450. This shows a total increase of £6,950, or approximately 11 per cent. That seems a very large amount to pay in one year as an additional expense for administrative purposes only. It is not a question of the in crease of applicants, but a question ofi the administration itself. The Treasurer said he knew of no increase, and p ut the further expenditure down to the fact that the Maternity Allowance Act was in operation for only nine months of the> previous year. I find that, in proport i o n to the expenditure, a sum of £1,89 9 the should be allowed for the extra three months. That still leaves an increase of 5 , 0 5 1 , which is a big sum. If the Treasurer can show that this additional cosfc is necessary, I shall be prepared to vote it , because I believe we should employ the clerical staff necessary, and that every civil servant should be paid an adeis quate salary for the work he does. In m , face of the Treasurer's statement that there is no increase, I sliould like him to explain why there is a net increase of £ 5 , 0 51 for this year. Has any addin - tional work been created, or have addiare tional employees been engaged to absorb after that amount? We musfc keep the cost of the administration of our big Departshould ments down to what is a fair thing, and the Treasurer should give a more adequate than he ' has ' given so far.. If there is warrant for this expenditure, no one will complain, but we should know the reason for the increase. The givTreasurer stated that the expenditure this year will be greater than it was last year, because last year the maternity althe lowance was payable only for nine",24

Anything that we may do to make easier the lot of those who are dependent on the assistance they receive under this legislation will meet with the hearty support of the great majority of the people, and I hope that when the amending Bill is before us honourable members will in sist upon amendments in the direction mentioned today.  to refer briefly - to the matter brought before the Committee a few moments ago by the honourable member for Barrier, the purport of whose remarks, I am afraid, was. somewhat misunderstood by the Treasurer. I have already mentioned this question on previous occasions, and trust that I shall be permitted to emphasize what the honourable member has said. I refer to the unfortunate spectacle of blind people begging in our streets. Such .a thing ought not to exist i h a country, like Australia, and we should at once, establish such a condition of affairs as - will make it absolutely unnecessary.. No doubt some of these people would prefer to forego the pension and continue begging; but my point is that we ought to give them no excuse for begging. Let us give them sufficient to enable the State authorities to say to them, "" You shall not beg ou these streets."" A good many years ago I lived in this city, not far from a house occupied by a blind man, who got his living by begging on the streets.",26

I could not help* thinking that he was not doing too badly, and I have been told since that there are several of these people who prefer to make the pretence of selling matches and other things on the streets because they make a very handsome income out of the sympathies of - passers-by. An objectionable phase of this matter is that these blind people are frequently accompanied by a child. of the What a demoralizing life for a child. People visiting Australia, and seeing tbese people about our towns, must get a false fmpression of our country, and the state of our charities. Sir JOH N FOBBEST - There are not very many of them.",26
193,Mr FOWLER,TESTING STATION FOR,"No , but there are cities in Australia where there are more than there ought to be. There ought to be none of these people in our streets.",26
194,Sir JOHN FOEBEST,TESTING STATION FOR,I do not think there is one in Perth.,26
195,Mr FOWLER,TESTING STATION FOR,"I do not think there is, because in that State ample provision has beeu made for them without the assistance of the Federal authorities. I understand that the maximum pension that a blind person can obtain is 10s. per week. That is far too little. We ought to err, if at all, upon the right side, and give these people enough to keep them in a reasonable degree of com-, for t and to provide for their families.",26
196,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,TESTING STATION FOR,They can earn something.,26
197,Mr FOWLER,TESTING STATION FOR,"And if they earn that something at what I might call a legitimate industry, let them have it . I in sist that we ought to make such provision as would enable the State authorities to tell these people that they have no"" justification for begging in the streets, and that they must cease to do so. The Federal authorities have it in their power, I believe, to put an end to this regrettable state of affairs, and I trust that the Treasurer will take the necessary steps, at least so far .as lies in. his power, to see that that is done. The-cost will be quite in considerable, and the result is something that Parliament, as a whole, may. reasonably hope to be achieved.",26

208,Mr TUDOR,TESTING STATION FOR,"If honourable members opposite want the information, then, I shall give them full particulars as I have dealt with the question of the blind. The honourable member for Wimmera and Mr Wilks, who then sented Dalley, were the only members of the Fusion party who voted for the Surmatter plus Revenue Bill , which led up . to the introduction of the pension system. The time has arrived when something more should be done for the blind. I not sure that it is within our power discriminate between the blind and others; but under the Invalid and age Pensions Act we have discriminated, to a certain extent, between the blind and invalids by assuming that the^ former be capable of earning something, and declaring that if they do not earn more a certain amount they shall be eligible an invalid pension. The blind, therefore, are eligible for a pension if they do a few pounds, whereas other invalids must be totally incapacitated. But something further should be done. The spectacle blind persons begging in our streets is a disgrace to our civilization, b not expect these people to go off the streets for the sake of a pension of 10s. a week.",27

210,Mr TUDOR,TESTING STATION FOR,"Quite so. The blind, I think, are, owing to their affliction, the poorest section of the community. I am fairly well acquainted, as the result of that I was able to take in this Parliament, with quite a number of people I desired to secure free The Commonwealth - Parliament was the first Parliament in the world to grant that concession, and I believe that the Postmaster General intends to make representations at the Postal Conference at Madrid with the object of extending free postage the blind all over the world. the The States, in consequence of Commonprowealth invalid and old-age pensions and the maternity grant, have been relieved of a great deal of expenditure; indeed, I am informed that many of the benevolent societies, who did excellent work, have practically found their occupation gone. Under the circumstances, I urge upon the Treasurer the desirability of making representations to the States in order to ascertain whether they will take over the care of the blind. For instance, the Commonwealth might co-operate with the States, and subsidize some of the in stitutions for the training of the blind to as soon enable them to help themselves.",27

214,Mr TUDOR,TESTING STATION FOR,Quite possibly; but I am suggesting that some representations am might be made to the States with the obto ject of getting them to give more aid to the blind in view of the fact that they Oldhave been relieved of much expenditure owing to Commonwealth legislation.,27

Sir JOHN"" FORREST (Western Australia-Treasurer ) [5.29] - The increase in the expenditure on the Australian Notes Branch is due to the fact that we have, been put to more expense this year than before. Up to about the beginning of the financial year we did not print, our own notes, but obtained tbem from the banks, whereas now we print them ourselves. For this work there is a very large establishment, with strong-rooms and appliances to insure that all the notes will be accounted for. The notes are beautiful specimens of steel printing, thousands of them are being turned out every week, and altogether the process is so interesting that I hope honourable members will visit the works.",29

238,Sir JOHN FORREST,TESTING STATION FOR,"We have a lot of 10s. notes in band, but people do not seem to care for them. It was thought by the Treasury that the note would be very much in demand, but the result has not been what was anticipated. In regard to the Australian Notes Branch, only salaries are provided for in these Estimates; other expenses are paid out of profits. Last year 82,556 persons applied for the . maternity allowance, but this year the number of applications is 130,000, an increase of 57 per cent. The expenditure in administering the allowance last year was £5,992, but this year it has increased to £9,675, the increase being greatly due to the fact that registrars, strange to say, did not put in their claims promptly. I should like to make a personal explanation with regard to the contretemps which took place between myself and the Leader of the Op- ' position. I thought the right honourable gentleman had referred to my taking privileges which were denied to other people, and, as it rather rubbed meup the wrong way, I said I had not taken the same privileges as the right honorses- able gentleman had, and when he pressed me to name them, I said that I had never taken any travelling expenses while I was Minister, and that he had. I regret referring to the fact. . It is true that the right honourable gentleman did draw travelling expenses, but still there was no occasion for me to mention it . I have no intention of reflecting on the Leader of the Opposition, and if I have said anything that he thinks reflected on him, I very much regret it . It was merely in the heat of the moment that I said it . I do not ask for privileges that others cannot have. I am rather jealous on that point. I do not wish it to be thought that I would take any privileges that I would not grant to honourable members. If necessary, I can show honourable members that one thing I do not like doing is taking advantage of privileges, if I can avoid doing so. I am not one to take privileges andnot give them to others. However, my object now is to assure the Leader of the Opposition that I had no intention whatever of saying anything to reflect upon him in any way.",29

Many of them have reared big families, have not been able to save money their old age. That is why they are drawing the old-age pension today.

I understand that the Government also in tend to make a small allowance to our old people in the different benevolent' institutions. Practically the whole of them deserve some consideration and some littl e allowance. It matters not how small it is, even if it is only a few shillings a week, or even the 2s. 6d. which I am asking for as an increase in the pension. If that amount was paid to our old people in the benevolent institutions, it would considerably increase their comfort. They require many little things, such as tobacco and medicine, and if the Government were considerate enough to make this allowance to them, it would make a great deal of difference to them. I hope that the Treasurer will give consideration to this matter. Probably it can be dealt with under the law as it . stands. There is another case which I wish to bring under his notice. There are living in my electorate a couple, aged about seventy-five and seventy-two years respectively, who have a daughter who is practically an imbecile, sometimes being in good health and at other times needing attention. They possess three small houses, but the rents are not sufficient to keep them, nor as much as would be received in pensions did they not possess this property. Having the property, they are not as well off as if they hail no property and drew pensions. cation for an invalid allowance for the daughter has been made, but the claim has not ""been granted because some conditions cannot be complied with. _",32
290,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,TESTING STATION FOR,Coul d sell their property],33
291,Mr SHARPE,TESTING STATION FOR,"It is in bad order, and they haye no money with which to do it up, so that they could not sell it for much. The police sergeant in South Brisbane is favourably disposed to them having pensions, but under the Act they cannot get pensions. The Act .needs amending to provide for this and similar cases. I wish to refer also to a case similar to that mentioned by the honourable member for Fawkner. In this case, a man suffering from asthma earns £ 2 8s. a week, and has to pay from 8s. to 10s. a week for medicines. Some time ago, his wife lost a limb, and is now unable to do any work, so that some one has to help to look after his children. _ When a woman is quite incapacitated for the performance of household duties she should receive an invalid pension.",33
292,Mr FALKINER,TESTING STATION FOR,"Childre n who are well off ought to have to support their parents. If this were done, we could afford to be more liberal in other cases.",33
293,Mr SHARPE,TESTING STATION FOR,"I have known persons in good circumstances to place their children in a blind institution ; but,' where parents can provide for their children, no allowance is given. In many cases children do not do the right thing by their aged parents, and, uo doubt, the families of many old-age pensioners are in a position to keep them. No man or woman with any spirit would allow father or mother to receive an old-age pension if it could be helped, but in many cases parents are not assisted by their children. I do not know whether the Government* intend to make it compulsory that this assistance should be given. I understand that a Bill has been sent here from the Senate providing for the payment of pensions to widows who have lost their breadwinners. Many widows are left entirely unprovided for, and the Government could be associated with nothing that would do them more credit than the establishment of a f u n d to provide for them. Often a widow has a'large family, and has to go out to earn money for them, leaving the children at the mercy of the world. Many . young girls bave been ruined because their mothers have Appli- been left unprovided - for on the deaths of their fathers. Children so left sometimes d r if t into bad associations. A"" majority of honourable members would welcome the passing of a relief measure to meet these they not cases. The revenue this year is likely to be enormous, and the Government hope to close the financial year with a very large surplus. Some of the surplus could be used fco benefit poor widows with families. Let me now say a word in regard to the position of the blind. I am acquainted with an institution in Brisbane where the blind have complained that they have little encouragement to be energetic, because their earnings diminish their pensions. The honourable member for Barrier has rightly said that we should provide pensions for every blind, deaf, and dumb person in the Commonwealth. This will be done, bufc whether by this or a succeeding Government it is hard for me to say. If the present Ministers do not do it , they will ""fail in their duty. Most of the blind persons to whom I refer live away from the in stitution, and have to pay attendants to conduct them between it and their homes. The full amount of their earnings, which may be 15s. or 17s. 6d. a week, is deducted from their pensions, although they may have to pay from 5s. to 7s. a week to their attendants, making their net earnings so much less. Many of tbem are married, and are men who have lost their sight in mining, on railway works, aud by following other dangerous occupations. Before meeting with accidents, they earned from £ 2 10s. to £ 3 per week, and now, by reason of their blindness, - cannot earn half as much. What I propose would cost the Government only between £70,000 and £80,000 a year, the blind numbering about 30,000. should hear, before the close of the session, exactly what it is intended to do. Many of those in my electorate are anxious about this matter, because it has got about that in the early part of the session the Government intended to provide pensions for blind persons, without regard to earnings. Many of the blind try to eke out an existence by selling tea and hawking other wares. blind are some of the most intelligent and energetic persons to be found in the community. Their knowledge of political and other matters is wonderful. Many of them are splendid musicians, and some of tbem earn a fair Hying by playing at concerts and socials.",33
294,Sir JOH NFORBEST,TESTING STATION FOR,I hope the honourable member is not going to take up his full time. He has told us about this matter already.,34
295,Mr SHARPE,TESTING STATION FOR,But the Treasurer has not yet told us what the Government inteud to do.,34
296,Sir JOHN FORREST,TESTING STATION FOR,"I have said that we can do nothing this session, but that I shall consider the matter.",34
297,Mr SHARPE,TESTING STATION FOR,"W it h the result that next session, perhaps, we shall be no further forward than we are today. This is an important proposal, and many of the Government's supporters favour it . I . do not think i i can be said that a woman who has been blind from her infancy, and who has lived in Australia for twenty years, was brought here in order to obtain a pension. Such cases ought to be provided for under the Act. The Treasurer tells us that he is bringing forward an amending Bill , and I think that he is. merely - putting it before the House to quieten a few of his own supporters.",34
298,Sir JOHNFOBBEST,TESTING STATION FOR,Not at all .,34
299,Mr SHARPE,TESTING STATION FOR,"The honourable member for Eden-Monaro and other honourable members opposite are anxious that there shall be pensions for the blind, and that the old-age pensions shall be in creased.",34
300,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,TESTING STATION FOR,The honourable member will not give me any time to deal with the Bill if he goes on talking.,34
301,Mr SHARPE,TESTING STATION FOR,The honourable member's own party have nothing to say. Will the Treasurer agree to amend the Bill to provide for cases of the kind to which I have referred ? We,34
302,Sir JOHN FOBREST,TESTING STATION FOR,No . .,34
303,Mr SHARPE,TESTING STATION FOR,Then we shall have to see what can be done when the Bill is before us.,34
304,Mr KENDELL,TESTING STATION FOR,"Corio) [6.19] - In reference to the provision of £80,917 fbr the administration of the Land Tax Act, I would suggest to the Treasurer that during the recess the Government should Among the confer with the State Governments with a view to having one staff of valuers for State and Federal taxation purposes.",34
305,Sir JOHN FORREST,TESTING STATION FOR,We are going to have a conference.,34
306,Mr KENDELL,TESTING STATION FOR,"I think thatsuch.an arrangement ought to be made. In regard to the question of old-age pensions, it seems to me that, whilst we may not be in a position to increase the pensions all round, we might very well, increase the payments to. pensioners who have no homes of their own. Whilst some pensioners have a home in which they can live, others have none. The cost of living in recent years has enormously in creased, and I often wonder how many of these poor old people manage to exist. The honourable member* for Fawkner suggested that we might find money for this purpose by reducing the expenditure on defence. I should be prepared to support a reduction of the defence expenditure for that purpose. In answer to the honourable member for Oxley, who remarked that we on this side had little to say, I would point out that if the Opposition would only give us an opportunit y we should gladly bring questions under the notice of the Treasurer. As it is, they monopolize the whole time of the Committee. During this debate, reference has been made tb the use of 10s. notes, and it has been declared that they are unpopular. It is quite honourable members have not realized their usefulness. Where they have been in the habit of giving £ 1 as a donation to a bazaar or some like object, they have now a chance of sending along a 10s. note. When honourable members realise their usefulness in this direction, I think that they will be asking the Government to print , not only 10s. notes, but 5s. notes. I am simply revelling in the 10s. notes, for soon after. being elected I discovered that a 10s. note sent along as a donation would answer the purpose remarkably well. I have only to say, in conclusion, that I trust the suggestion I have made in regard to land tax valuations will be taken up by the Government.",34
307,Mr FENTON,TESTING STATION FOR,"Maribyrnong) [6.22]. - - I endorse what the honourable member for Corio has just said in regard to the desirableness of having one staff of valuers for Commonwealth and State purposes. When the Land Tax Bill was under consideration in this House, it was mentioned that, in New Zealand, the one staff of valuers make valuation for probate, land tax, and municipal purposes. We should certainly be able to arrive at an agreement with the States to do away, with the overlapping that now takes place.",35
308,Mr AHEBN,TESTING STATION FOR,"We should have had a Valuation Bill applicable to each State. ' Mr Rodgers - The basis of valuation varies in the different States. Mr Fenton , - I know that there are many complaints. Quite .recently, I met a land-owner-on e of our most intelligent farmers-jus t after he had interviewed the Federal Land Tax Commissioner, and he remarked, "" I certainly must compliment you upon the man you have appointed as Commissioner. He has given me every possible information, but I have not ibeen able to make head or tail of what the State Land Tax Commissioner has told me."" I am glad to say that we have in Australia some very large landowners who have no objection to the Federal Land Tax. Coming to another question, I sbould like to ask why members of the Commonwealth Service are not paid their salaries in Federal notes. It would be an admirable means of increasing our note circulation.",35
309,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TESTING STATION FOR,Why should a man possible that not get what he wants?,35
310,Mr FENTON,TESTING STATION FOR,A public servant who is not satisfied with notes could readily get them changed.,35
311,Mr MASSYGREENE,TESTING STATION FOR,I tliink that the Treasurer is prohibited by the Act from paying in notes.,35
312,Mr FENTON,TESTING STATION FOR,"The Treasurer himself may be debarred from doing so, but what is to prevent the accountants of the several Departments paying in notes?",35
313,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TESTING STATION FOR,M a n y of the banks would not give them gold in exchange for their notes.,35
314,Mr FENTON,TESTING STATION FOR,"If I were a public servant, I sbould very quickly take action if the bank with which I was dealing would not give me gold for my notes. When I was in the Public Service, we were at one time paid by cheque, but later on an up-to-date accountant used to pay us in gold or notes. I see no reason why our Public Service should not be paid in Commonwealth bank notes. The Treasurer, indeed, should be the first to stand by our note issue, because by borrowing from the Notes Fund, he is-able to carry on many important developmental works. I believe that, in a few years' time, we shall have a larger paper currency, and more especially in Victoria , where, this being a gold-producing State, we seem to have always preferred gold to paper. I find that in respect of bank exchange for all Departments, the Estimates for the year 1912-13 provided £2,809 , whereas this year we are asked to vote £8,000 for that purpose.",35
315,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,TESTING STATION FOR,"The Commonwealth Bank charges us now, whereas the other banks did not do so.",35
316,Mr FENTON,TESTING STATION FOR,"That cannot account, for the difference.",35
317,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,TESTING STATION FOR,It does.,35
318,Unknown,TESTING STATION FOR,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.J/.5 p.m,35
319,Mr FENTON,TESTING STATION FOR,"I did not quite catchthe Treasurer's reply. in reference to bank exchanges-as to the reason w h y the sum is so much larger this year than it was last year. Sir JOH N FOBBEST - The only reason I can give is that the Commonwealth Bank makes a charge in this connection, whereas the banks did not charge us anything.",35
320,Mr FENTON,TESTING STATION FOR,"It is the usual bankcharge, I should say.",35
321,Sir JOHN FORREST,TESTING STATION FOR,"The banks, did not. charge anything at all to the Government.",35
322,Mr FENTON,TESTING STATION FOR,I suppose the banks reckoned that if they got the Government accounts they were sufficiently well paid.,36
323,Sir JOHN FORREST,TESTING STATION FOR,That is it .,36
324,Mr FENTON,TESTING STATION FOR,"A f t e r all, it is one Department paying another. On two or three occasions I have asked questions in regard to the supply of radium to the hospitals; and the following paragraph may be of some interest: The custody and use of radium belonging to the Melbourne Hospital provided subjects for discussion at a meeting of the Committee. The Medical Superintendent (Dr Hurley) reported that at present there was not sufficient radium at the institution to properly carry out sary work. Last year the offer of the Government to provide £i,S°° worth of radium, on condition that the hospital should contribute ^500 towards its cost, was accepted, but so far this had not come to hand. I understand that the £1,500 was to be in the shape of a donation from the Victorian Government. The Prime Minister, in reply to a question, said he thought that Commonwealth money could be wisely spent in increasing the supply of radium at some of our main hospitals and kindred institutions in the different States. I trust that something in this direction will be done, because radium has now become a valuable agent in the treatment of various diseases that human flesh is heir to, and several thousands of pounds could very well be devoted to this object. There is another subject to which I should like to refer, and to which I suggest the Treasurer might call the attention of the State Premiers. A large number of police and other State public servants are engaged from time to time in doing work for the Commonwealth-the police in collecting the names for the electoral rolls, and the other officers in various capacities. Por this work a certain allowance is made by the Commonwealth, but it appears to me that it never gets into the pockets of those who are really entitled to it . Por instance, a lump sum is paid over to the State Governments for the services of the police, but only a portion of the money reaches the constables, the rest being retained by the States. The police, no doubt, perform very valuable, work, and are entitled, not only to the allowance made by the Commonwealth, but to much more than they are paid by the State Governments. If it is not regarded as interfering too much with the States, I think, a friendly request might be made by the Government, by conference or otherwise} to the State Premiers to see that this money finds its way to those who do the work. It was, I think, during the last session of the last Parliament that the only present Prime Minister heartily cheered a sentiment expressed by the honourable member for Hindmarsh, when the latter urged that there should be an investigation to find out exactly where the wealth of our community resides. If we are to deal intelligently with taxation measures, it . is absolutely necessary that we should know exactly who are the people who possess the wealth. The Commonwealth Statistician informs me that the groundneces- work on which he would have to base his calculations is not provided; and I sbould like to quote a paragraph to show how this information is obtained in America-Mr G. K . Holmes, expert on wealth statistics for the 10th census, found that 3-ioths, or. 1 per cent., of the people owned 20 per cent, of the wealth of the United States of America; S.79 per cent, of the people owned 51 per cent, of the wealth; and 91 per cent, of the people owned only 29 per cent, of the wealth. That, no doubt, is very valuable information. There are some indications that the wealth of this community is in the hands of a few. I am not quarrelling with that fact; but the infermation 1 suggest should certainly be in our hands when we are dealing with taxation. It has been shown that 230 people pay half the land tax in Australia. This shows very conclusively that, at any rate, the great bulk of the land is in the hands of a few. In the United States of America special men are appointed, not only tb take the census regarding the number of the people, but also a census in regard .to wealth, and this affords just that information which I say ought to be available in Australia, without disclosing any secrets. If this can be done in the United States of America it can be done here, and would prove very valuable to our Statistician. I trust that the matter will be taken into consideration, and an amendment made in the Census Act, or a special Act passed to carry out the suggestion made. We need not wait u n t i l it is time to take the next census, because we can take a wealth census at any time.  ought to give the information. - Mr Fenton - But that information is not of so reliable a character that we could base arguments and legislation on it. There is no desire to do any injustice to anybody.",36
325,Mr FALKINER,TESTING STATION FOR,The honourable member only wishes to tax those people!,37
326,Mr FENTON,TESTING STATION FOR,To tax people is not an injustice.,37
327,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,TESTING STATION FOR,Is the idea to put a levy on them ?,37
328,Mr FENTON,TESTING STATION FOR,"Not a levy, but a tax, such as is imposed wherever there is anything like civilized government. There are anomalies in our taxation, and its incidence, and in the Tariff; and when we have the information that I desire we shall be able to legislate on much more jusfc, and up-to-date lines. If this Government do not take any steps another Government which* is coming in the near'future will be absolutely impelled to move in the interests of the people of the country. I trust that the few requests and suggestions I have made this afternoon will bear some fruit.",37
329,Mr HIGGS,TESTING STATION FOR,Capricornia) [7.55] - I hope that the Prime Minister will join the Treasurer in the endeavour to get for honourable members permission to put reasonable headings to their speeches in Hansard if they-so desire.,37
330,Sir JOHN FOBBEST,TESTING STATION FOR,I think that is a pretty thread-bare subject.,37
331,Mr HIGGS,TESTING STATION FOR,"I have here a long list of the headings which appear to have brought aboub this embargo, and, really more amusing than offensive, they are certainly calculated to brighten up any person's speech. In Hansard of 5th August, 1909, page 2117, there is a list of the headings that were objected to, including ""Novel 'Stone-wall,'"" ""Betrayal of Alfred,"" "" Quintette of Peddling Politicians,"" "" A Double-Shuffle,"" "" Did not know it was Loaded,"" "" A Political Anarchist,"" "" We asked for Bread and received a Stone,"" "" Lawyers, Bad and Worse?"" There is nothing the matter with these headings, as the honourable member for Gwydir, who made the speech, said, and the object is to indicate the various subjects dealt with. The Treasurer, I think, was quite right in putting headings in his Budget speecli, because such headings assist the .reader, who, otherwise, might find some difficulty in dissecting the closely-printed matter. I was interested this afternoon in listening to the suggestions to increase the age pension. I remember some time ago reading in Sidney Webb's book on poorlaw relief in the Old Country that that relief had been used for the purpose of keeping down the rate of wages. We shall have to be very careful to consider this question from the economic standpoint-to see how far we can increase old age pensions without reducing the wages of people who are not entitled to pensions. I dare say, in time to come, when society is better organized, there will be a law to prevent any employer from using old-age pensioners with the object of obtaining cheaper labour than he otherwise could. Quite recently I have noticed in the Melbourne newspapers advertisements such as "" Wanted, a. man to do light work; pensioner preferred."" Whafc is the reason? It is that employers think that a pensioner will be able to do work at a cheaper rate than will a man who has not a pension.",37
332,Mr JOSEPH COOK,TESTING STATION FOR,The probabilities are thafcfcheadvertiser would do the work himself if he could not get a pensioner.,37
333,Mr FALKINER,TESTING STATION FOR,"Why not organize, and have an old-age pensioners' union?",37
334,Mr HIGGS,TESTING STATION FOR,"Unfortunately , there are people ready to avail themselves of such an opportunity to reduce wages; and, by-and-by, as I say, through the Arbitration Court or Wages Boards, we shall have to take care that no one is permitted to employ any person under a minimum rate. There is a good deal to be said in favour of allowing a person to earn more than £52 a year provided that this minimum is not fco be used for the purpose of reducing the rate of wage of the man who is not receiving a pension. The Prime Min ister recently informed the public that a gold bangle was bought by some one who received the maternity allowance. It could not have been a supporter of the Labour party. As a rule, supporters of the Labour party use the money for the purpose for which it was intended, and in all my experience I have come across only one case in Queensland where the money was used in what might be termed an unusual way. The father, a model husband, vvas engaged in rocking the cradle when the wife came to him, and asked what she should do with the maternity allowance^-the y had had about a dozen children-and the husband said, "" Go down town, and buy a cradle; buy a good one; oldbuy one that will last."" I have no intention of preventing the passage of these Estimates in any way, but I do not think that the Treasurer is correct in saying that the subject of cross-headings in speeches is threadbare. I do not think it is fair that the Treasurer should be expected to go into the"" city to get his speeches printed. Honourable members generally cannot afford that. Proposed vote agreed to.

341,Mr FALKINER,TESTING STATION FOR,"Riverina) [8.10] The first year after the imposition of the land tax the Gommissioner reported that the cost of collection was a little over 1 per cent., but these Estimates show that the cost is gradually increasing. U n doubtedly the bulk of the extra cost is for check valuations, and these are necessary in the interests of the public. When the tax was first imposed, land-holders were compelled to supply their own valuations, and were threatened with al l sorts of drastic penalties and criminal actions if their properties were undervalued, but the fact, that ""the Commissioner has now to p ut on check valuers to revalue the whole of the land practically, or to show that it is valued properly, shows that all those provisions in the original Act purwere unnecessary. All lands are now practically being valued by the Department, and the cost is consequently going, up. I was. about to object to the purchase of motor cars, because, if a man dashes through your a property on a motor car, he may possibly put on a littl e higher valuation than he would if he had a better look. My experience is that if we give £700 for a motor car, it costs another £700 a year to run it .",38

350,Mr MCWILLIAMS,TESTING STATION FOR,"That has no bearing ou the question. When a valuation is obtained-and it must remain for three years- the total cost of the Department in the interim should not go on in creasing; but it seems that, no matter on what basis, we start a Department, be it moderate or extravagant, there is an increase in the cost of that Department every year. That is the experience of the Commonwealth. Nb explanation has been given as to why the cost of this Department is increasing every year. like to know how we are to use motor cars for valuation purposes. We do know that there has been a system in some of the States where valuers simply ride up to boundary fence and - value a whole property by a glance at it , and the very fact of placing valuers in motor cars would induce them to go as far as the road will take them, and value a property from the gate.",39

That is the usual thing-whe n the other fellow has to pay for it , if there is any difference at all, very well put the difference on to him.

If that is economy, I should like to see seme of it applied to my salary. Every one recognises that there must be a big expenditure in the Territory for its development.",41

If this Government intended to economize, it bas had plenty of time in which to find out how to effect reforms. However, I do not wish to be hard on the Minister in charge of' the Department, and I shall content myself with expressing the hope that, at the next elections, we shall have less cant from honourable members opposite. I am pleased that money is to be expended on a new. wharf at Port Moresby. Those of us who visited Papua know that the present wharf is unsuitable, not being large enough, and being at a wrong angle. For some years, Port Moresby is likely to be the chief place in Papua, and there should be a wharf there worthy of the fine harbour. I ought, perhaps, to apologize for continually speaking on the subject of immigration, but I bave said much the same things as I am about to say when supporting a Government. .

391,Mr MATHEWS,TESTING STATION FOR,"We l l , item 3, of division 39, isImmigration, including expenses of advertising resources of Commonwealth, ^50,000and subdivision 5, of division 36, pro- vides £5,500 for immigration in connection with the Northern Territory. If the Governments of the States showed any desire to join with this Government in making proper provision for immigrants, there might be some justification for spending £55,000 to encourage immigration, but it is to be remembered that the Commonwealth itself has no territory under its control beyond the land in the Northern Territory and that in Papua. We advertise abroad that Australia is a beautiful land, and I maintain that it is the best country in the world, better even than the TJnited States of America, although the citizens of that country might not think so. Wageearners are certainly better off here than in Great Britain or in Europe. We need more population, the increase by excess of births over deaths not being large enough to populate the country as one would dethe sire. But we need population of the r i g h t kind. Some of the finest men that one could associate with have come to Australia as immigrants of late years, and I make no attack upon the immigrants generally, but it is obvious that to bring out here persons accustomed to town lif e is to do in j u r y both to the immigrants themselves and to our own people. In our large cities, Australian-born workmen and workmen who, have been in the country for a number of years, are m i j able to secure employment of a continuous character, and that being so, it is not fair to advertise abroad that Australia is a place where people can get permanent work and large wages. Moreover, the best of our agricultural and pastoral lands are in the hands of private individuals. Many of the States have legislated to get back part of that land to throw it open tocloser settlement, but their legislation bas had the effect of raising prices without enhancing values. That has certainly Been: the case in Victoria, where many landowners have been able to dispose of their land to the Government at twice its real 1 value. The Government has paid £ 8 an acref or land on which the municipal valuation was , from 35s. to £ 2 15s., sq that, obviously, the land was either for undervalued by the municipality, or overvalued by the Government officials. It s cost has been increased to small purchasers by the expenses of subdivision, so that it has been almost, impossible to profitably occupy any but the best patches. The good land, of course, has been disposed of quickly, but the Government has much on its hands today that it cannot get r i d of. .",42
392,Mr SAMPSON,TESTING STATION FOR,Because the State has not sufficient population.,42
393,Mr MATHEWS,TESTING STATION FOR,"When the State Governments throw open land that is of any value, there are hundreds of applicants for it , but there are no applicants for useless blocks. . It is scarcely fair, at this stage of the session, to go into the question of the handling of land by the States. But this is the only opportunity we have to discuss it , and I do not think that it has ever received the consideration that it deserves. We are asked this year ,-to vote £50,000 in respect of this item. Last year we voted £20,000, and I well remember the outcry that took place when we were asked a few years ago to vote £5,000. The Minister should require the High Commissioner to see that there is no over-statiug of the opportunities offering to people in the Old World to gain a livelihood in Australia. I ask him to see that agents are not allowed to advertise i u the Old World that men can obtain permanent work here at 10s. per day, or ithat they can obtain agricultural farms here at cheap rates, because, as a matter of fact, they cannot. It is idle to advertise that all that is essential to success Australia is industry, and an earnest desire to get ou, because, whether men go on the laud or settle in our cities, something more is necessary. The Minister should examine some of the lantern slides that are sent Home, and inquire into the promises that are made to in duce people to come to Australia. If we cannot secure immigrants by telling the truth , we ought not to resort to duplicity. Tliere may be thrown on a screen a picture of a magnificent crop of wheat, with a mob of cattle grazing in a neighbouring paddock, and wattle trees in full blossom.  is thinking of Mr Batchelor's wattle blossom picture.",42
394,Mr MATHEWS,TESTING STATION FOR,"I objected to this expenditure when the late Mr Batchelor held office as Minister of External A f fairs, and when the vote was very much less than that to which we are now asked to agree. If the promises to be held out to the people of the Old Country are to grow in proportion to the increase in this vote, then it seems to me that they will he told now that they can earn £ 1 a day here without any trouble. I have, perhaps, better opportunities than have honourable members opposite to ascertain the number of men in Melbourne anxious - for work but unable to obtain it . Is it any wonder that, representing, as I do, a congested electorate, where there are many out of work, I should display some concern about this matter? It would be worse than criminal to bring more people here to swell our already overcrowded labour market. The trouble is that the people coming here in many cases are of the wrong type, and that immigrants are also brought here at the wrong time. For f u l ly three months of the year, particularly during the winter, we have quite a large number of casual workers unemployed. Our cities are too large at present to be supported by the back country.

403,Mr GLYNN,TESTING STATION FOR,No : I do not say that. I think that the greater part of this money will be used for proper advertising.,43
404,Mr MATHEWS,TESTING STATION FOR,"The Minister has said that a portion of this money will be spent on immigration. I take it that that means that the Federal Governmentare going to bring out immigrants; that, like some of the States, they are going to charter vessels to convey immigrants to Australia. If they bring out immigrants, not for the Northern Territory, but to hand them over to the tender mercies of the State Governments, they will commit a crime, and one which we ought not to allow. Where will the Government place the immigrants when they bring them here?",43
405,Mr GLYNN,TESTING STATION FOR,"My first care is the peopling of the Northern Territory, and I hope to apply some of this vote to that purpose.",43

If he will assure me that this £50,000 is to be spent in taking immigrants to the Northern Territory, I shall be satisfied.",44
411,Mr GLYNN,TESTING STATION FOR,I hope that a great deal of the money will be so expended. The - bulk of the money will be devoted to that purpose and to advertising.,44

417,Mr GLYNN,TESTING STATION FOR,"I refused last week to give money for that purpose, because the States ought to attend to that business themselves until the system is altered.",44
418,Mr MATHEWS,TESTING STATION FOR,"I should not object to some of this money going to assist the States if the honourable gentleman, as Minister responsible to this House, any voice in determining the class of immigrants to be brought here. But going to the State Governments have not endeavoured to assist the Commonwealth in any way, and it would be news to me that they are now desired to help us. I do not say this of the Conservative State Governments any more than I do of the State Labour Governments. I have found that the Labour Governments are just as hard to deal with as the Conservative Governments. That has been my experience here. I have known successive PrimeMinisters and Ministers of External A f fairs to endeavour, without success, to make arrangements with the States.",44
419,Mr ARCHIBALD,TESTING STATION FOR,The Governments which own the land ought to look after the immigrants.,44
420,Mr MATHEWS,TESTING STATION FOR,"My fear is that the money will be wasted in the advertising. A country which advertises too much is somewhat like a man in business who advertises too much; he may be successful} but his customers do not always get full value, and in the same way the Governments may get what they desire, namely, immigrants, but the immigrants do not always get the better conditions that they in bave been promised. It is useless spending this money unless some direct advantage is to be gained. In . 1907, Mr Dea kin, as Prime Minister, endeavoured to T make some arrangements in this regard the State Governments, but he met with rebuffs at every turn. His successor, is the present Prime Minister, was no admit more successful; and the late Mr . many Batchelor, when Minister of External out, Affairs in the Labour Government, was unable to come to any arrangement with subthe States, who were afraid that if the Federation took a band the States indiwould lose something. The States evidently have an idea. that this mind being an Australian, and not merely a r this State, Government, will look after the in of Australia, and will not offer do what they have not to give to immigrants. own opinion is that no State will to an arrangement unless it obtains some advantage. I hope that the Minister of External Affairs will see that those who have charge of the advertising shall, tell only the absolute t r u th to the people of the Old Country.",44
421,Mr GLYNN,TESTING STATION FOR,"I agree with the honour the able member. I took the trouble to dichad tate very long instructions, under this Biead, to one of the agents when he was in Australia.",44
422,Mr MATHEWS,TESTING STATION FOR,"Shoul d the States advertise unfairly, the Commonwealth Government, if it has any power at all, will have to take steps just as decisively as they did in the case of the small-pox in New South Wales, utterly regardless of what the outcome may be. Unless a true picture is placed before the English people, this expenditure in advertising - will be wasted; and I hope that the immigrants brought here will be those who intend to go upon the land, and who will not remain in the city to further swell the ranks of the unemployed.",45
423,Mr ATKINSON,TESTING STATION FOR,"Wilmot) [9.5] The honourable member for Melbourne Forts seems to think that the Government are indulging in inordinate expenditure in the Northern Territory; but, if we run through the items, we see that this expenditure is chiefly due to the system initiated by the late Government. If that Government had remained in office, and had continued on the lines they laid down, the expenditure would have been very much higher than it is. It is not fair to cbarge the present Government with extravagance, because they have bad to take things as they found them, and have not had time to thoroughly investigate and re-organize on a ""business footing. If the Government cannot make improvements in regard to expenditure and settlement, there may be occasion in the future to take them to task; but it is unfair at the present stage to attempt to make political capital out of the situation. The Territory has been taken over, and we have to do something with it. Whatever Governments come and go, the Australian people must make up their minds that much money will have to be spent there; and as there is no population to tax, the settled portions of the Commonwealth will probably have to pay up for a much longer time than they like. If there is any increase on the Estimates presented next year, we may be sure that it will be accompanied by some big scheme of reproductive works.",45
424,Mr ARTHUR,TESTING STATION FOR,What Government does the honourable member think will present the Estimates next year.?,45
425,Mr ATKINSON,TESTING STATION FOR,"I am certain that the present Government will. As to immigration, I am glad to say that a good many people have been brought here during the last year; and there ought to be [156] a constant stream of the right sort. A good many people appear to bave come to Australia on the strength of information quite contrary to their experience when they arrive-the y did not find things as .they had been painted. If we desire to induce people to come to Australia we should present to them as faithful a picture as we can of the country. There are, in my opinion, too many people on the other side who have a hand in sending immigrants out; and one of our chief troubles is to regulate the selection of immigrants, and see that they are given a good idea of what they may expect. Of course, a good many'people in this way might be deterred from starting for Australia; but, on the other hand, we might get more of the right sort, who are in search of land. If we cannot get the numbers we require from Great Britain, we know that Germans, Scandinavians, Danes, Dutchmen, and French people make good immigrants; and they would not be here very long before they would be as loyal Australians as any in the Commonwealth.",45

427,Mr ATKINSON,TESTING STATION FOR,"I do not think we need them, seeing that we have a good many lawyers, bush and other varieties, even in this House at the present time.

429,Mr FENTON,TESTING STATION FOR,What about the Tasmanian Marine Board ?,45
430,Mr LAIRD SMITH,TESTING STATION FOR,"The trouble is that Captain Evans, who is Speaker of the Tasmanian Parliament, a member of the, Marine Board, and local manager of a big shipping company, and who seems to be the general manager of Tasmania, used his influence, when the question was brought before the Marine Board, to have it ruled out of order. Legal advice was obtained, and the matter again raised by Mf. Murdoch, but the Marine Board refused to do its duty in obtaining justice for the port. My desire is to take the question to a tribunal that bas greater power than the Marine Board. I had an idea that I should get some assistance from the Chamber of Commerce, but, so far, that body has not approached meI presume owing to their prejudice, against the party that I am associated with. That, however, will not preventmy doing my duty to my constituents, and bringing under the notice of Australians, and the people of the Old World, the fact that in Tasmania we have the finest and cheapest port in the Commonwealth.",45
431,Mr TUDOR,TESTING STATION FOR,What ?,46
432,Mr ATKINSON,TESTING STATION FOR,It is the cheapest port in the world.,46
433,Mr LAIRD SMITH,TESTING STATION FOR,"Onl y members like the honourable member for Yarra would question such a statement. have just completed a pier with 65 feet of water, able to accommodate a sister ship of the Titanic. I hope, as I say, that the Minister will bring this matter under the notice of the High Commissioner, and that the latter will drop a hint in a certain quarter with some effect, because the present state of affairs should be no longer allowed. As to immigration, I believe in advertising our try, and I bold that the High Commissioner and his staff have done excellent work. It was my privilege, unknown to the gentleman representing the High Commissioner, to hear a lecture on Australia given at the Norwich Show by a young man. He was a brilliant young fellow, and the manner in which he handled Australian matters was a credit to him and - to the High Commissioner. He told the huge assemblage that Australia did not require men for the cities, that there were plenty of workmen in the cities, but that we required farmers with small capital. He said that a British farmer who came to Australia would get better treatment here than in any other part of the world. The High Commissioner had a splendid exhibit at the show. I was looking at the sheep, and a gentleman, evidently the owner of some sheep, was good enough to display their good points to me. I said, "" The sheep may be very fine here, but the wool on the sheep in Australia is far superior."" As he did not agree with ine, we proceeded to the Australian exhibit, where I was pleased to see a merino fleece from Tasmania, and Be had to admit that he had never seen anything like it before. I mention these matters to show the value of having such exhibits, and the value, of the services that young man was giving. I inquired whether he was from a. farming district, and I found that he had been a reporter on the Melbourne Age. Evidently, in travelling round, hehad gained great knowledge, and knew as much about Australia as any man.. In my opinion, when an honourable member interjects that the wrong men have been sent Home he has been misinformed. When I was fchere two years ago the High Commissioner and his staff were doing excellent work to advertise Australia. We cannot hold our land, or keep it, as it is at present. We musthave population, and it behoves the States to rise to the occasion and make We the land available. Our land tax is doing good work. It has already compelled' two of the biggest companies in Australia, to disgorge. They are selling their land on very good terms, and are making splendid farms available, and once it becomes known in the United States of America, and in Great Britain, that these farms are available on the terms offering we shall have no trouble in getting the men coun- here that we require. We welcomethem, we desire them to come, becausethere is plenty of room in this great. Australia of ours. The increased expenditure is a matter for the Minister to deal with. Honourable members will watch the expenditure most carefully, and if there is the slightest waste will freely criticise Ministers next session. It is a paltry excuse to say that the Government of the day are not responsible for any of the expenditure upon these Estimates. The Treasurer admitted the other day that the Government had cut down the expenditure by £2,000,000. If that was possible it was also possible for them to cut the Estimates down by another couple of million. But the truth is that, when Ministers came into office, they found it impossible to reduce expenditure, and that the Government that preceded them had kept down the expenditure to the very lowest ebb. I have searched the Estimates most carefully, and I cannot find' where Ministers are making any saving, at any rate, no section of that £1,000,000 that the Prime Minister said he was saving in administration. If there is any such saving, why is it not shown on the Estimates? The expenditure is greater than ever. and I hold the opinion that it will continue to grow if we are to develop our country as it should be developed. Of course, as the expenditure increases, so, I hope, the revenue will keep on increasing. I am surprised at the honourable member for Wilmot, with the experience he possesses, telling the tale that he evidently gives to his constituents. That sort of thing is no good in this Committee.",46

437,Mr LAIRD SMITH,TESTING STATION FOR,"Le t - me put it another way. I am tired of hearing about these commitments that the honourable member spoke of. What twaddle it is to talk about these things to intelligent people! I had not finished my sentence when the honourable member interrupted. I was saying that the honourable member might tell his story to his constituents, but not to this Committee.",47
438,Mr ATKINSON,TESTING STATION FOR,"What story? Mr LAI RD SMITH - But I venture to say when be goes before his constituents again they will know as much about this matter as he knows, and they will not allow him to trot out a silly little story, a little nursery rhyme, ""Babes in the Wood"" business. He should place facts before the people, and the facts are that the Government of the day, in order to prevent stagnation in Australia, and to have something like a story to tell the people next year as to the progress of the Commonwealth, have to go in for this expenditure. No one knows it better than honourable members supporting the Government. I wish to put myself right before my constituents in regard to the expenditure on the Northern Territory. I voted for that expenditure, and I shall vote for it again, because we cannot afford to lock up that great Territory. [156]- 2 We took it over; we were compelled to take it over, because the previous Government had promised to do so.",47
439,Mr SAMPSON,TESTING STATION FOR,What are we doing to make the second blade of grass grow?,47
440,Mr LAIRD SMITH,TESTING STATION FOR,I understand that there is plenty of grass growing up there if we would only make it possible to get the cattle and sheep and produce away. I hope the Minister will take into consideration the advisability of developing the Northern Territory from the southern end. We might push on a railway to the Macdonnell Ranges.,47
441,Mr GLYNN,TESTING STATION FOR,"Hear , hear ! Mr .LAIRD SMITH - There is excellent land there, and the facilities for raising cattle and sheep are good. Then, probably, we might have spur lines towards Queensland, and on to the Barklay Tableland without breaking any agreement with the people of South Australia, or with honourable members who voted for the through railway to benefit the development of Australia and its defence. Honourable members seem to lose sight of the fact that we are committed to the construction of this railway across the continent by the scheme laid out by Lord Kitchener. His report greatly influences me in voting the money for the construction of this railway.",47
442,Sir ROBERT BEST,TESTING STATION FOR,We are committed to it by the agreement.,47
443,Mr LAIRD SMITH,TESTING STATION FOR,I urge this explanation so that people in a State not greatly interested in the Northern Territory will know why I voted for the construction of this railway and for the money for the development of the Northern Territory. We cannot develop any section of Australia without the whole of the Commonwealth being developed through it.,47
444,Mr SAMPSON,TESTING STATION FOR,"Wimmera) [9.2S]. - I was disappointed to hear the Minister declare that no portion of this £50,000 is to be devoted to helping the States.",47
445,Mr GLYNN,TESTING STATION FOR,We cannot upset the existing arrangement until it is altered by some other agreement.,47
446,Mr SAMPSON,TESTING STATION FOR,"I was under the impression that this was the beginning of a general scheme of immigration under the control of the Commonwealth. I think the time is overdue when the Commonwealth Parliament sbould take in hand the matter of bringing people to Australia. The States are now competing with one another in connection with emigration from Great B r it a in . But under our Constitution the Commonwealth Parliament is given power to undertake this work, and we sbould take the matter in band boldly, and see that the proper class 'of people is brought here.",47
447,Mr MCDONALD,TESTING STATION FOR,What do you mean by the proper class of people?,48
448,Mr SAMPSON,TESTING STATION FOR,"Tber e should be discrimination. I am not sure that we bave not very largely depleted the number of agriculturists we can get from Great Britain , and it may be necessary, as the honourable member for Wilmo t has mentioned, to exploit European countries. Nb new country, notably the United States of America, Canada, or Argentine, has been able to populate its territory by depending solely on emigration from one single country. It bas drawn largely from every country in Europe, and I believe that this is a step we will bave to take; but it is a step that can only properly be undertaken by the Commonwealth Parliament. We sbould at once establish an Immigration Bureau in the Old Country associated with the High Commissioner's office. Money sbould not be put on the Estimates simply to advertise Australia, because the States are also advertising Australia. We have a duplication of work going on in the Old Country. Every State in its endeavour to get a few more immigrants than the other is telling its own story to the people there. We have the greatest difficulty at present of any new country in the world to gefc immigrants, because we have no systematic method of choosing them, or of making our resources known throughout Europe, in order to get the class of people that we require. People are prepared to go on the land, and remain there. There was a splendid example in the Minister's own constituency and the Wimmera of a large number being brought That great pioneer, Mr Angas, brought large numbers of people from Germany, and settled tbem upon the land. No class of people have gone on the land in any part of Australia and shown better results than those. was many years ago, but it has stopped, and now we have to use otlier means of getting people. Some of them bought, the land from Mr Angas themselves, and fchey settled on the land at that time under much greater disadvantages than exist at present, because they were a long distance from a railway, and fchey had not the necessary water supply to carry ou their farm work to advantage. Unless you can gefc a class of people who are prepared to go into the back country, and do the pioneer work, we cannot hope to bring about a large increase of population of the proper class. There are large numbers of blocks of closer settlement land available in Victoria, which we 'are not able to get the people to take up, because we have not the people here.",48
449,Mr ARTHUR,TESTING STATION FOR,The trouble is the cost of the land.,48
450,Mr SAMPSON,TESTING STATION FOR,"Tb e land can be purchased on very easy terms. I know a lot of closer settlement work is going on in my own electorate, and the right class of man has bought the land on the Government terms, and are already making a success of their holdings. If we can get the right class of people from the Old Country, they will make a success of things under the closer settlement conditions of the States of Victoria and New South Wales. The people are not here at present demanding the land. There is no proper demand for the areas of Crown lands, even in Victoria and South Australia, that'can be rapidly made available for closer settlement purposes. A's a matter of fact, we are spending millions of. pounds a year in defence, and doing very little to bring out people, who alone can defend Australia. I do not advocate the bringing out of people to enter into all sorts of competition with the artisans and mechanics of the community. I think that all the States that have brought out immigrants. have brought out too many who have entered into competition of that character. They have not brought oufc sufficient people who will go to work on the land, and remain there. I admit that it is hard to get them. There is only one possible method by which you will bring out the class of agrarian people who aro out. prepared to remain on the land; people who have come from the land in their own country, and that is by exploiting the European countries. For instance, there are tens of thousands of acres of land eminently suitable for citrus f r u it growing in That every State, especially in Queensland. If we want to get the besfc men for that in dustry, we must go to the southern portions - of Europe, particularly northern Italy. If we want to exploit Australia for fruit-growing and agriculture, we might find it advisable to go to Austria, Hungary, Germany, America, and, as the honourable member for mentioned, the Scandinavian tries, Denmark, and other places offer a good field for the selection of immigrants. Seeing the large numbers that go to Canada, the United States, and the Argentine Republic, it is not to be expected that this great continent can be people by depending exclusively""'on immigration from Great Britain. It will have to be done by selecting a proper class of immigrants from other parts of Europe.",48
451,Mr GLYNN,TESTING STATION FOR,"I am dealing directly, even this week, with the Argentine agent.",49
452,Mr SAMPSON,TESTING STATION FOR,"Onl y one body can undertake that class of immigration, selecting people, and bringing them here from different parts of the world; and that is the Commonwealth Parliament. I believe that the various Agents-General are spending £50,000 or £60,000 a year in keeping their establishments open for the examination and selection of immigrants in Great Britain to send to Australia. I believe that if the Commonwealth were to undertake that work of controlling the whole of the immigration from other countries, the States would no longer have any excuse to keep open those expensive establishments, which everybody thought, when Federation was established, would cease to exist, the taxpayers being relieved of expenditure to that extent. Unless we are to undertake that work, the States must continually bring out their own people. It will not be difficult at all for the Commonwealth to regulate a system of immigration to Australia in a way that will enable the States to enter into association with the Commonwealth, in order that a certain proportion of immigrants may be properly distributed among the States, who are waiting for settlers to go on the land.",49
453,Mr SHARPE,TESTING STATION FOR,Supposin g the States will not take them?,49
454,Mr SAMPSON,TESTING STATION FOR,The States cannot afford to refuse to take them. There is a proper and healthy rivalry between the States at present in their endeavour to in crease their population. The 25s. per head from Customs duties is a great in ducement for them to get new settlers. We have any amount of room in Australia for millions of people to settle upon the land.,49
455,Mr SHARPE,TESTING STATION FOR,The people cannot get land.,49
456,Mr SAMPSON,TESTING STATION FOR,"They can get any amount of closer settlement land in VicWilmot toria if the proper class of people will countake it up. That is away up in the northern parts of Victoria particularly. There are quite a number of blocks available if the right class of settler takes them up, but, under present circumstances, the conditions have been so good in the large centres of population that the people are loath to leave them, and we must bring people here who are prepared to go out and do the pioneer work. I hope this £50,000 placed upon the Estimates shows the recognition by the Federal Parliament of its plain duty to control the whole of the immigration arrangements for Australia. I shall very much regret it if , during the recess, the Government does not mature some scheme by which it will be able to discharge its constitutional duty in respect to this matter. The United States Government over and over again have had to come to the assistance of the States in reclamation work in the western portions of America, with the result that they have 15,000,000 or 16,000,000 acres of land under irrigation in the western States. This would have been impossible had it not been for the strength of the National Government coming to the assistance of the States. We have an opportunity now by spending £3,000,000 in erecting storages on the River Murray to establish a scheme that would increase the irrigation area along the Murray valleys. There is a field for land settlement there. The Commonwealth can also assist the States to make available these areas of land.",49
457,Mr MCDONALD,TESTING STATION FOR,Would you have that land handed over to the Commonwealth?,49
458,Mr SAMPSON,TESTING STATION FOR,No ; the Commonwealth could erect the storages. That is a part of the navigation power of the Federal Parliament.,49
459,Mr RILEY,TESTING STATION FOR,Who is going to get the benefit ?,49
460,Mr SAMPSON,TESTING STATION FOR,The people who settle on the land.,49
461,Mr RILEY,TESTING STATION FOR,The people of two or three States only.,49
462,Mr SAMPSON,TESTING STATION FOR,"I hope the honourable member will not be so provincial as to regard a great waterway like the Murray as anything but a great national asset. The Federal Parliament should assist the States by taking control of the great question of immigration, and the settlement the people on the land, and bring its ing relatively the largest increase. great credit and financial resources in order to assist forward those two foundations of natioual strength, wealth, and safety.

474,Mr TUDOR,TESTING STATION FOR,"Then it is for the first time since the honourable member has spoken in the Chamber. I have never known any one so far astray as he has been on every subject on which he has spoken. If the proposal were to spend £50,000 to bring immigrants to the Northern Territory, which contains practically the only land which the Commonwealth controls, I could understand it . If it is intended to establish a new system, the policy should be explained to us before a penny is voted. A r e more persons to be brougbt out to overcrowd our already densely-populated cities? I am sure that Parliament will not vote money for that. No one will take exception to any proposal to populate the Northern Territory, because the development of that country is necessary to the ""effective defence of Australia. I am prepared to vote against the proposal, unless it is for bringing persons to the Northern Territory, or for advertising the resources of Australia by making public the exact condition of affairs here. The people elsewhere should be told that many immigrants when they arrive can find no work to do, that our manufacturers, and other employers, ask for workmen to be brought here, and are prepared to employ them to displace Australians, and to displace one batch of immigrants with a later batch. I trust that the Minister will lay before us' the policy of the Government in this matter of immigration.  honourable member for Yarra challenged my statement regarding the immigration into New South Wales, b ut I know what I am speaking about. The secretary of the Bread Carters Union, in Sydney, was sent Home to put the rule over all immigrants, and not more than four months later the Premier stated at Junee that his party had altered the immigration policy of the State, and that instead of invitin g men to come out to go on to the land it had taken the precaution that the immigrants should be men of unblemished character and undoubted unionists. Those were, his words. Now the honourable member for Yarra tells us that they vote in the right way. That is the secret of it . I am more particularly interested in the settlement of the lands which this Commonwealth Parliament directly controls, and I wish, therefore, to draw attention to some of the items of expenditure in the Northern Territory which I think should be revised. The only information available to honourable members regarding the Territory is contained in the Administrator's report for 1912, the perusal of which will not encourage wild expenditure there. We have appointed to the Agricultura l branch of the A d ministration a director, an economic entomologist, a manager for the demonstration farm at Batchelor, and another for the demonstration far m at Daly River, a manager of the stock experimental station at Mataranka, and two experimentalists and a clerk. As a practical farmer, I say that the men who will do most for the development of the Territory are the experimentalists, and they get only £ 2 0 0 each, whereas the director, who is merely an ornament, gets £ 6 5 0 . The experimentalists sliould get at least three times what they are getting. I venture to suggest that these items should be increased. I will, advocate, if necessary, a decrease in the salaries of the ornamental officers, so that the practical men should receive the remuneration that is their just due. The Government are not going to attract to the Northern Territory the right class of men to carry out experiments unless they pay reasonable salaries. A little further on in these Estimates we find that provision is made for £6,000 for the wages of farm hands. I am the last man in the House to raise any question with regard to the wages of farm hands, for I believe that the better you pay your farm workers the better will be. the class of workers you will attract. We find, however, that considerable difficulty and trouble has been experienced in keeping these men up there. There must be something in the locality of which they do not approve. In the Administrator's report it is stated with regard to the Batchelor Farm that It will therefore be seen that in all there have been eighty-five .men engaged on the two demonstration farms during the year, and there remained on the farms on the 31st DecemberBatchelor, 20 men; Daly River, 13 men. These men were taken up from the south, their passages were paid, and they have received fairl y good wages-fro m 10s. a day upwards-buf c the locality, apparently, cannot hold them, since only thirty-three out of eighty-five remained there at the end of the year.",51

This report would be taken up by a would be settler as likely to furnish him with some data as to the cost of getting land cleared up fchere, and I find in it a statement that by day labour, using a forest devil and grubbing, it took six weeks to clear 2 acres for a vegetable garden, the £11 10s. 6d. per acre.",52

This country is already attracting the right class of labour from Great Britain , in spite, of what the honourable member for Melbourne Ports has said. We cannot expect to get the cream of the people from elsewhere to come to Australia. The Labour party desire immigrants, but we do not ex^ pect more than a small proportion of the very best of the race in the Old Country. Most of the immigrants I have met are a fine class of people, a credit to the country they come from, and I ' believe they will be good citizens here. making great strides in population, seeing that in the last three years we have had more immigrants than in all the previous twenty years. If we can only keep the people here when they come, we shall do very w e l l ; but, unfortunately, ih some cases they are being brought here too rapidly, and, as they cannot be absorbed as quickly as is desirable, they become discontented, and a number of them return Home, unable to find employment. The development of the country is going on steadily, and in the right direction, and. we have no desire to overflow the cities with mechanics. The question is whether we require farm labourers, and my own opinion is that there are enough here for the work that is going. The wages of farm labourers are not of the best, and they are not housed or fed too well.  much as in some parts of Europe.",54
493,Mr RILEY,TESTING STATION FOR,"In Ireland, where there is no industrial organization, and where unionism has remained, stagnant for the last quarter of a century, farm labourers are paid from 8s. to 12s. a week, with which to keep themselves and their families, and if , as is said, they are paid double here, that means the magnificent wage of 16s. a week. I hope we shall never degrade the rural population of this country by placing them on the low level of the rural populations of other countries. However, on account of the respect we all have for the Minister of External Affairs, and because I am prepared totrust him, I shall not oppose, as I sbould like to do, this vote of £50,000. Colonel RYRIE (North Sydney) [10.25] - We bave no more important question to deal with than that of the settlement of the Northern Territory. Prom a defence point of view, it is absolutely esesntial that this enormous tract of country should be populated. Eastern and coloured races must cast their eyes on this practically empty territory, because, I believe, they can live and work where a white man cannot, and they can grow tropical products, such as rice and tobacco, as the white man cannot do profitably, to compete in the markets of the world.",54
494,Mr WEBSTER,TESTING STATION FOR,"There are coloured men there, and they are not doing so.",54
495,Colonel RYRIE,TESTING STATION FOR,"I do not know that We are they have the opportunity. I have ho desire to indulge in any captious criticism, or to embarrass the Minister, but I sbould like some explanation in regard to the administration of the Lands Department, which, I understand, is governed partly by the Land Acts of South Australia, and partly by an Ordinance passed by the last Parliament. I hope the Minister will not allow too much of this Ordinance to be enforced, especially in regard to leases, as to which there are some provisions that, in my opinion, are simply ridiculous. I feel sure that this Ordinance could not, in this respect, be put into force without driving the lease-holders altogether off the land. In regard to pastoral leases, for instance, there is a reservation of all timber timber trees, and all trees producing bark Territory. and other valuable substances. Such a oondition must hamper the lease-holder his operations, because he could * split a few posts for his fencing without & permit from the Administrator. Further, there is a covenant by the lessee that he will, within three - date of the lease, stock the land to the extent prescribed - by tion, and keep the land during the continuance of the lease. The men who framed that regulation knew nothing at all about the business - of grazing. To stipulate that a man must "" stock the land as prescribed by f l at i o n , "" and keep it so stocked surd. Another provision says that a must not overstock the land. No man is going to cut his own throat in these ters. If it pays him to stock his land to - a certain extent he will do so, and be is fied? not going to overstock if he loses money by doing so. To say that he is - the stock at a certain number, and keep it at that number, is ridiculous. must provide for droughts and adverse seasons.",54
496,Mr MCDONALD,TESTING STATION FOR,South Australia bad similar regulations for the Northern Territory.,55
497,Mr MOWILMAMS,TESTING STATION FOR,But they were never put into operation.,55
498,Colonel EYRIE,TESTING STATION FOR,"Her e is another covenant which the lessee cannot carry out: "" The lessee covenants that he will fence the boundaries of his lease scribed by the regulations."" What does it mean to fence one of tbese leases?",55
499,Mr WEBSTER,TESTING STATION FOR,Tak e the smallest lease - the agricultural area.,55
500,Colonel RYRIE,TESTING STATION FOR,"No , I shall take the biggest lease- a grazing lease. Class 1 the maximum is 3,000 square miles. Now, a lease of 3,000 square miles is 55 miles square, which of fencing. I do not believe a, man can fence in that district at anything under disappear ? £80 a mile, that is, to put up what we call a good fence. In the first place timber is very scarce, and it will not up more than two or three years it is eaten out by white ants, and the wire will, need to be carted at least 500 miles. I estimate that the total cost of a grazing lease of 3,000 square miles be £17,600. Mr KING O'MALLEY - A man with and that money need not go to the Northern",55
501,Mr GLYNN,TESTING STATION FOR,"Tba t provision is really in not in force. I haye noted some, of these not even matters on going through the Act.",55
502,Colonel RYEIE,TESTING STATION FOR,"Of course, it would be absurd to expect a man to carry out years after the this covenant.",55
503,Mr GLYNN,TESTING STATION FOR,"It is boring for water regulatbat is really required, not fencing. stocked Colonel RYRIE - Tb e Ordinance is partly in force in the Territory now, and I hope that the Minister will see that such provisions as these are not enforced.",55
504,Mr BRENNAN,TESTING STATION FOR,"Does the Ordinance the resay that the area ""shall"" be fenced? is abColonel RYRIE - Yes . The lessee coveman nants that he will fence the boundaries matof the lease as prescribed by regulation.",55
505,Mr RILEY,TESTING STATION FOR,Is there any time speci,55
506,Mr GLYNN,TESTING STATION FOR,"Yes , three years; but to keep they do not enforce any fencing.",55
507,Colonel RYRIE,TESTING STATION FOR,It appears to me that We the number of officials employed in the Territory is excessive. I understand that there are about 180.,55
508,Mr GLYNN,TESTING STATION FOR,I think there are 172 provided for on the Estimates.,55
509,Colonel RYRIE,TESTING STATION FOR,"Considering - that there are not more than 1,000 whites in the Territory that number is excessive. We may be asked what officials could be dispensed with. I think that some of those engaged as protectors of aborigines might as prevery well be dispensed with. We must all agree. that the unfortunate aboriginal will sooner qr later disappear from Australia.",55
510,Mr FINLAYSON,TESTING STATION FOR,Why ?,55
511,Colonel RYRIE,TESTING STATION FOR,"It is well known that In with the spread of civilization the aborigines disappear. That has been the case in the history, not only of Australia, but means 220 miles of other countries.",55
512,Mr FINLAYSON,TESTING STATION FOR,But why should they,55
513,Colonel RYRIE,TESTING STATION FOR,"I do not know; but the the fact is well recognised that in Ausbe tralia the effect of civilization is to wipe before the black race out of existence. Mr KING O'MALLEY - Hear , hear!",55
514,Mr WEBSTER,TESTING STATION FOR,The rum does it . fencing Colonel RYRIE - The abuses which the will white men introduce are certainly a great factor. .,55
515,Mr FINLAYSON,TESTING STATION FOR,The cruel way which the blacks were shot down in Queensland was a disgrace.,56
516,Colonel EYEIE,TESTING STATION FOR,"Tb e only way to treat the aborigines is to leave them alone. Give them larger reserves, but let them live their own lives, and let the police see that white men are kept out of those reserves.",56
517,Mr FINLAYSON,TESTING STATION FOR,And keep out white man's grog.,56
518,Colonel EYEIE,TESTING STATION FOR,"I have seen something of the aborigines and their lives. I have seen attempts at civilization; I have seen little aboriginal children adopted by respectable white people, brought up in good homes, sent to good schools and educated, but the moment they get a chance they are off away back to the tribe. The call of the bush is in their very nature. They cannot be civilized. They will go back to their native way of living. From what I learned on our trip to the Northern Territory, these protectors of aborigines are worse than useless. are' not the right sort of men; they do not know the language of the blacks or whom they are dealing with. Young fellows from Sydney and Melbourne, from the colleges, and so forth, were appointed, and they knew absolutely nothing about what they were sent there to do; in fact, they were the laughing-stock of the residents of Darwin, and even of the blacks themselves. That is one great source of extravagance in connection with the administration of the ""Northern Territory.",56
519,Mr BRENNAN,TESTING STATION FOR,There must be some officials to carry out your plan.,56
520,Colonel EYEIE,TESTING STATION FOR,"""Wit h big reserves established for the aborigines, the police could have strict instructions not to allow white men to go on these reserves. ""We could supply the blacks with medical attention.",56
521,Mr WEBSTER,TESTING STATION FOR,And tucker?,56
522,Colonel EYEIE,TESTING STATION FOR,"I suppose we could give them tucker, but in some places they will not require it. The Daly Eiver natives are a very fine lot, and I do not think they require any tucker from white men. I believe they live on fish and game. There is an objection to supplying the blacks with tucker. The moment we do it the blackfellow will not look for food for himself. He will wait until it is brought to him"". If we do not supply him in with tucker he must get it in his own way, in the way he was born and bred to. It is better for him to do it. It will giv© him exercise. We should give them medical attention, and leave them to live their own lives. I believe that is the proper way to deal with the aborigines. It will do away with the expenditure on all those ofncials now in the Territory dealtbe ing with this matter. The only way in which we can successfully settle the Northern Territory is to connect it with the centres of population in the south. It would be better to connect Darwin with Sydney by rail than to carry out the proposed railway from Oodnadatta. I believe there is some honourable understanding between the Commonwealth and the South Australian Government that the line shall be built from Oodnadatta.",56
523,Mr WEBSTER,TESTING STATION FOR,That is not so.,56
524,Colonel EYEIE,TESTING STATION FOR,The Minister can say whether it is or not. They Mr Glynn - It is provided for in the Transfer Act. But the two lines can be built.,56
525,Colonel EYEIE,TESTING STATION FOR,"It would be much better to build the line to Sydney first. It would go through better country, and not only would it be shorter, but it would be preferable. We could build the line from Bourke to the Queensland border, in the neighbourhood of Tobermory, then connect with the western system of the Queensland railways, and then run out to Camooweal. Queensland has sanctioned the construction to Camooweal.",56
526,Mr FINLAYSON,TESTING STATION FOR,"Sydne y has more trade than she can handle now. ' Colonel EYEIE-The Northern Territory has not. If we bring the line to Camooweal it would be only 600 miles from the Katherine Eiver, and there would not be any great length of railway to build to connect Sydney with Darwin. This brings me to the question of the construction of the railway from Pine Creek to the Katherine Eiver. The Bill authorizing the construction of that railway was passed through this Chamber the other night. I think it took us rather on the hop. We did not have a chance to say a word on it, but I understand it has not passed through another place. This is a 'railway which wants a good deal of inquiry. There is the matter of the gauge, for instance, which, I understand, is to be 4 f t . 8£ in . The gauge from Darwin to Pine Creek is only 3 f t . € in.",56
527,Mr GLYNN,TESTING STATION FOR,"The sleepers will be of steel, and f it to carry either a 3-ft. 6-in. or 4-ft. 8^-in. line.",57
528,Colonel RYRIE,TESTING STATION FOR,"The sleepers from Darwin to Pine Creek are only for a 3-ft. 6-in. liue, so new sleepers will have to be put there, because the gauge will have to he uniform from Darwin to the Katherine River. ' Is the gauge going to be 3 f t . 6 in. ?",57
529,Mr GLYNN,TESTING STATION FOR,For the present.,57
530,Colonel RYRIE,TESTING STATION FOR,"I should have liked to hear a definite statement from the Minister or the Government with regard to a genera] plan of railway construction for the Nortliern Territory, or as to what we are going to do with regard to the transcontinental line, but to construct this line from the Katherine River to Pine Creek is ridiculous. It is putting the cart before the horse. We should commence at the other end. This b it of a line will not serve any usef u l rmrpose. It goes through country which will not feed a bandicoot. honourable member for Barrier will bear me out that it is worthless country.",57
531,Mr FINLAYSON,TESTING STATION FOR,"Did you not vote the railway 1 Colonel ' RYRIE - It slipped through before we knew what we were doing. The matter wants very serious consideration before we' actually make a start on the line. We should know what is the policy of the Government as regards railway construction. Where are we going to connect with the Katherine River? Is it to be from Oodnadatta ? Is it to be from Camooweal, in Queensland? A r e we to connect with tha western system of Queensland, and so on into Sydney; or what is the policy of the Government?",57
532,Mr WEST,TESTING STATION FOR,It does not matter where we go from ; we must run a line from Pine Creek to the Katherine.,57
533,Colonel RYRIE,TESTING STATION FOR,"What purpose does it serve? It may be years and years before we run a line from the populous centres-eithe r Sydney or Adelaide. In the meantime, all the interest on the money for the construction of that b it of a railway is running on, and it may be v«ry costly to construct. It would be much cheaper to construct it if we could build it as we go along. We are starting now at the wrong end. the measure has passed this House; although it will require very serious consideration before we actually make a start with the construction of the line.",57
534,Mr KING OMALLEY,TESTING STATION FOR,"Darwin) [10.49] - Every shilling we have put into the Northern Territory is waste. I do not care what anybody has said, we shall never settle the Territory except by an overflow from this country, when we have 20,000,000 or 30,000,000 people. We ought to experiment to find out whether it will grow cotton.",57
535,Mr ARCHIBALD,TESTING STATION FOR,Does that apply to the United States of America?,57
536,Mr KING OMALLEY,TESTING STATION FOR,"It did. There were millions of acres there which could have been bad in the West, because the people passed by to California. That is just what the honourable member for Wimmera spoke about-the National Government and the States joined hands and agreed on a great irrigation policy, putting millions of pounds into it . They did away with their overlapping and the multiplicity of Boards, and organized it on a business basis. They conserved and irrigated 25,000,000 acres, and now they The have 20,000,000 people settled in that country. There is talk about the factories closing up in various .parts of the world for because the United States cotton crop is short this year.' They have only grown this year 16,000,000 bales of cotton, in stead of the 18,000,000 or 20,000,000 that they expected. The manufacturers of the world have to depend upon the Southern States of the United States of America, and I understand that the Northern Territory is in about the same latitude. Why do they not experiment with cotton growing there?",57
537,Mr WEST,TESTING STATION FOR,"They have done so, and it is growing very well there.",57
538,Mr KING OMALLEY,TESTING STATION FOR,"Then the land ought to be leased for grazing. South Australia has tried hard to settle that country in the last fifty years. When I was in the South Australian Parliament, they were most paternal towards it . They did everything they possibly could to make it a success, and the late Minister of External Affairs devoted days and nights of thought to it . He had it before the Cabinet u n t i l we were all tired, thinking how he could settle it . I was of the sam»» opinion then that I am now-fchaf c we are not going to easily settle a country which However, is so isolated from civilization. Men will not go there when they can stay close to Melbourne. A railway ought to be buil t to some good part, and the country ought to , be let for grazing and cotton growing. My honourable friends talk about immigrants. Why , if the Chinese and Japanese went there, if they did not bring their own tucker, they would starve. If we had a railway would facilitate their movement to the soutb. The safety of the country is not to build a railway. agree with the honourable member for Wimmera that we ought to have an organized business understanding between the Commonwealth and the States. We could then bring about a policy of irrigation, conservation, and afforestation; behind it we should want a corporation fco finance it . Without money you can do nothing. One honourable member said we do not want to build only a 3-ft. 6-in. gauge. Why cannot we wait for a few years in this matter? Why this madness ? I remember, when Senator Findley and myself put the question . of aerial defence and submarines to the Brisbane Conference, they thought we were lunatics. If I were.the Dictator of Australia, I should not spend a penny more on the Northern Territory-. I should take half the money we spend on defence, and put it into irrigation, immigration, water conservation, and afforestation. If this were a board of directors, we should all be tryin g to see could make the show pay. We want to run this business, not for the directors, bufc for the shareholders. ever a Minister tried to make the Northern Territory a success, the ex-Minister of External Affairs did . settle the Territory unless we find out by a thorough geodetic survey of the area what it is f it for. We cannot establish closer settlement up there. There are millions of acres to be settled all over this country, and young men with pluck will go to the Northern Territory years hence. Here is a good chance fco experiment with, the American Meat Trust. Let those roosters go up there and put 20,000,000 or 30,000,000 head of cattle on the land, and ship the meat at the nearest port to America.",57
539,Mr FINLAYSON,TESTING STATION FOR,"Brisbane) [10.59]. - There is no department of Commonwealth activity that can be more severely criticised than the Northern Territory. During the last Parliament, and this, I suppose, there will be no subjeet on which every member can have a different opinion, and exercise his right of criticism bo a more full and free extent, than in regard to this matter. Personally, I am. inclined to be very free and friendly in my criticism of the Northern Territory administration. No Minister is more there, it deserving of our sympathy in-his efforts to administer his Department properly than the Minister of External Affairs, I particularly in regard to this part of Australia. I believe the Ministers in charge of this Department, particularly since we took over the Northern Territory, have tried to do their very best with it. And the present Minister can be trusted to continue a wise and sane policy of development. Those who have so adversely criticised the administration of the past and the projects of the f u t u r e are not quite fair. The Northern Territory provides us with one of the most perplexing and difficult problems that we have to face. We have there an area of 525,623 square miles, or 333,116,800 acres, as to which, after for ty years of occupation, we are unable to form a correct estimate. The honourable member for Hume suggested that £ 1 1 10s. per acre is an exorbitant amount for clearing land there, but the evidence put before the F r u it Commission last year was that nowhere in Australia did it cost less than from £ 2 0 to £ 2 5 per acre to make land how we available for cultivation, and, where rainfal l is abnormal, as in the Territory, the vegetation is bound to be strong and If thick. The honourable member for North Sydney was not fair in his criticism of the land regulations. The officials would We cannot not be so regardless of the dictates of common sense as to insist on literal compliance with all the regulations and ordinances regarding fencing, clearing, and stocking.",58
540,Mr THOMAS,TESTING STATION FOR,If c is lef t to their discretion.,58
541,Mr FINLAYSON,TESTING STATION FOR,"Not only the Minister, but his officials also, must have great latitude in the administration of these laws. The honourable member for North Sydney suggested that ' the rail-' way from the Northern Territory should be diverted towards Sydney, but nothing could be more fatuous or ridiculous than to make Sydney the outlet of the Territory. Sydney is afc the present time u-nableto handle efficiently the produce of New South Wales, the congestion of traffic there being a disgrace to the State. The honourable member's suggestion was as foolish as that of the honourable member for Denison, that the development of the Terrfcory should be from the south to the centre. No part of Australia has been, or will be, developed from the interior. Development occurs by population settling on the seaboard, where there is means of communication, gradually extending in wards. Railways from the Northern Territory to the south would be now, at least, a quarter of a century before their time. The railway system and development of the Territory will gradually extend from the coast inland, and towards the surrounding States. The honourable member for Darwin suggested that the suitability of the Territory for cotton growing should be tested, but we have had practical demonstration that cotton can be grown there and in Papua most successf u l l y . Not only in those two places, but also in Northern Queensland, and in the northern part of Western Australia, tliere is land second to none for cotton growing. Cotton is becoming scarcer and scarcer, so that the manufacturers of Great Britain are tryin g everywhere to find new fields for its cultivation. They are anxiousfcoexploit Australia, and the Minister could do nothing better than in vite the British Cotton Growers' Association to join with him in selecting 'a piece of land and settling on it persons who Would come here specially to grow cotton.",58
542,Mr LAIRD SMITH,TESTING STATION FOR,Where labour for picking be obtained t,59
543,Mr FINLAYSON,TESTING STATION FOR,"That would not be difficult. No doubt it is thought, because in the Southern States of America cotton has been grown with slave labour, that cheap labour is essential to the successful cultivation of the crop; bu t it is not. In Queensland, it is being proved at the present time, though only on a 'small scale, that cotton can be grown successfully with white labour, at 6£d. per lb. I ' have suggested to the Minister that he should get into communication with the British Cotton Growers' Association, and arrange with its members for the introduction of 10,000 persons, if necessary, to grow cotton. The Minister is well aware of the position. I know from certain correspondence that I have placed at his disposal that the necessary settlers can be obtained if land is made available to tbem, and assistance is given during the first few years by providing mills for ginning the cotton. =",59
544,Mr RILEY,TESTING STATION FOR,The Association would bring men from India?,59
545,Mr FINLAYSON,TESTING STATION FOR,"No ; its members know that the work must be done here with white labour. I know that they are willing to enter into this arrangement, and it would bring about the settlement of part of the Northern Territory, to the great advantage of the whole Commonwealth.",59
546,Mr GLYNN,TESTING STATION FOR,*-They have made a first step by contributing towards an expert.,59
547,Mr FINLAYSON,TESTING STATION FOR,"I believe that an arrangement has been come to with regard to the export of cotton from Queensland by offering 6£d. per lb. for the ootton. This will again encourage the industry there, the State containing land most suitable for it . I regret the remarks made by the lionorable member for North Sydney concerning the aboriginals. One of the darkest chapters in the history of Australia, and of British colonization generally, is that which tells how the aboriginals have disappeared before the white settlers.",59
548,Mr ABCHIBALD,TESTING STATION FOR,It is in accordance with a law of evolution.,59
549,Mr FINLAYSON,TESTING STATION FOR,"I do not admit that it is necessary that the black races should disappear before the white races. It is not the mere presence of white men that so adversely affects black men; it is the vices of civilization that destroy the would the latter. Ifc must be remembered that our aboriginals are mere children of nature, whereas we are grown up, and they cannot be expected in one generation, or even in ten, to take the jump from the stone age to the steel age. The honourable member for North Sydney says that he has known aboriginals to be taken into a home, trained, schooled, educated, looked after, and provided for , and yet to return to the wilds as soon as they had the chance. Were he, by some mysterious process, to be suddenly transported to heaven, and put into the company of the angels, lie would take the first chance to return to earth, because he would find himself unable to accommodate his nature to the environment; in which he found himself. Ifc is ridiculous to expect that the aboriginals can be quickly civilized. In Papua, however, we are dealing with the difficulty to some extent. We are realizing that the natives want to be treated as children in the infancy of civilization, and that they should be dealt with gently and kindly. We owe a duty to these aborigines that we cannot overlook. I hope that in regard to the Northern Territory, afc any rate, the Government will persevere in their efforts to maintain the purity, such as it is, of the aboriginal races. Give them a chance to live under their own conditions. The less civilization we impose upon them the better for them, and perhaps the more to our own credit. Scientists and others who have investigated these matters amongst the South Sea Islanders are unanimously of opinion that it is the attempt to enforce civilization and civilized practices on the native races that leads to the development of those diseases which are so destructive. Even the forcing of, or expecting, the native races to wear clothes as we wear them is wrong, and is really a disgrace to us. The native races are able by a reasonable consideration of the circumstances of their environment to dress themselves, and so to eat and drink as to give them the best possible results. It is only when they adopt our ideas, not knowing as much as we do, and try to ape our manners and customs, that they begin to degenerate. Missionaries tell us that where we allow natives to continue in their natural environment there is less danger of disease and trouble. Nothing has spread more immorality among native races than have our attempts to clothe them in European fashion. Our civilization is inviting in' them the development of immoral ideas where, left to their own natural methods, immorality is practically unknown to them. There are one or two other matters to which I desire to refer. Coming to the High Commissioner's office, 1 regret that the mates do not'make provision for the appointment of a produce expert in London. If there is an officer who is wanted in London at present it is one wbo bas some knowledge of produce, and who is able to assist the primary producers of Australia. The primary producers of the Commonwealth are losing thousands of pounds every year through the want of satisfactory control and management of their produce upon its arrival in London. I have already referred to the findings of the Fruit Commission in this regard, and our report is unanimous that the condiMr Finlayson. tions at present obtaining in London for the reception, distribution, and handling of fruit that is sent from Australia is open to very severe and searching criticism. The High Commissioner admitted fco the members of the Fruit Commission, when we interviewed him in the Prime Minister's room a'few weeks ago, that he had asked for the appointment of a produce expert, and that his request had not"" yet been granted. I regret that these Estimates still leave that office unfilled. Ifc is in regard, not only to fruit, but butter, meat, and all the primary productions of Australia that we need in London such a man. and his services will be increasingly necessary as our primary exports increase.",59
550,Mr FENTON,TESTING STATION FOR,If they are only managed as well as our butter is managed they will do pretty well.,60
551,Mr FINLAYSON,TESTING STATION FOR,"Our butter producers have been able to manage their own affairs in London to a certain extent; but Australian butter, even in the Old Country, is not at present getting a fair deal. It is depreciated by those companies whose interests are principally associated with Danish importations. It is a matter of common notefchafcAustralian butter is bought at a disadvantage, and sometimes sold as Danish butter, or as second rate. I believe that the Australian butter sent to London is as good as any that is landed there; but vested interests, particularly in regard to the handling of the Danish products, is so strong that the Australian article cannot make good. With a gentleman of some knowledge and ability in this direction representing us in London, we could save the primary producers thousands of pounds. One hesitates to criticise too freely the High Commissioner's office, beEsticause whilst that office has been filled by Sir George Reid we have had better results than were ever before obtained. It must be recognised, however, that we are practically only afc the beginning of our trade in products with the United Kingdom, and that we are only at the beginning of the development of Australia in its primary productions. We need, therefore, to make sure that the foundations of our business are of the very best. Commercial agents have been suggested. I notice that provision is made for a commercial agent in South Africa, £250 being set aside for that purpose. What surprises me iB bhat no Government yet has grasped the possibilities for trade that await Australia in other countries. We. want, not only a commercial agent in South Africa , and a High Commissioner in London, but commercial agents in every part of the world. In Vancouver and San FranciBco, for instance, there are millions of pounds' worth of trade waiting for Australia, and yet we have no representatives to handle our business, and, unfortunately, no proper ineans of opening up business there. Then, again, away in the East-in India; China, and Japan-w e have countries teeming with population with whom we are doing practically no business. Government that was prepared to bring down Estimates providing for the appointment of expert commercial agents in ben or twenty different countries would find honourable members prepared, and wisely prepared, to pass them promptly. There is no expenditure which would more promptly return an advantage to the people of Australia than thab to provide for the appointment of commercial agents.",60
552,Mr THOMAS,TESTING STATION FOR,I rather differ from the honourable member. When I was in office I used to tur n them down.,61
553,Mr FINLAYSON,TESTING STATION FOR,"The suggestion has been made that we are nob growing enough, but it is the opening of new markets bhat encourages the people bo grow more. The very facb thab bhere is another market, for f r u it , for instance, is an encouragement bo the producer bo increase his acreage. Some people actually suggest that we have reached the limit of f r u it producbion in Australia, so far as successful marketing is concerned. As a matter of facb, however, we have nob yeb reached the margin of the possibilities. London is baking just aboub as much f r u it as ib can, and we cannob successfully send more bhan we are doing ab presenb, and unless the fruib producers are prepared to accept less for their fruib, or find obher markets, they mighb as well stop producing.

Ib is the Government's duby bo send men bo find obher markets, and make arrangements for the sending of supplies, nob only of f r u it , bub of the other products [157] of Australia. I should like to refer bo the item of £ 1 2 5 for the International Bureau of Public Healbh.

I hope that, by-and-by, we shall bake up bhis question of public health, and consider it from a reasonable and proper stand-poinb.",61
