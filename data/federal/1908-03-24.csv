3,Mr DEAKIN,NOTIFICATION OF OFFICIAL ACCEPTANCE,"It would be a pleasant task to invite a representationof the British warships; but as we are under the impression that the British' Government is about to direct a fleet to ' visit us, we think it better to wait until it. has considered the question.",14

5,Mr DEAKIN,NOTIFICATION OF OFFICIAL ACCEPTANCE,"Yes ; but I have not made it public, because, since the first news was received, we have heard of the accep-. tance of an invitation to visit Japan, and I am not aware whether that will alter the arrangements.

' I wish to know from the PostmasterEaglehawk General whether every public servant - has reached the age of sixty-five, but icnpable of doing good work,- will receive - the same treatment?",14
9,Mr MAUGER,NOTIFICATION OF OFFICIAL ACCEPTANCE,That depends largely upon the exigencies of the service and upon Public Service Commissioner.,15
10,Mr HUTCHISON,NOTIFICATION OF OFFICIAL ACCEPTANCE,"I understand that weather certain officers in the Post and Telegraph for a Department, having reached the age at which they are called upon uncler the PubDuring the lic Service Act to retire, have had their term of service extended, on the ground that 6 they are still able to render good service. ill the Postmaster-General see that the Six same consideration is extended to others request to be allowed to remain in the service after passing the retiring age, time in lieu is has been refused?

11,Mr DEAKIN,NOTIFICATION OF OFFICIAL ACCEPTANCE,Information regarding the Canberra site has already been received; but I shall invite the attention of the Government of New South Wales to the suggestion of the honourable member. NON-DELIVERY. OF LETTERS COMPLAINT FEE.,15
12,Sir JOHN QUICK,NOTIFICATION OF OFFICIAL ACCEPTANCE,"Has the attention of a of the Postmaster-General been directed to reached a report published in the Bendigo Adverare tiser of the 21st March, of a speech dea year livered at a publicbanquet, in which Mr. lhat the Hay Kirkwood made serious complaints to the about the large number of cheques and postal notes which have gone astray since November last, after being posted in the office? Will he cause the comwho plaints to be investigated, and abolish the is still vexatious fee of 2|d. now demanded as a preliminary to any inquiry re property thought to have been lost in the post ?",15
13,Mr MAUGER,NOTIFICATION OF OFFICIAL ACCEPTANCE,"My attention has been drawn to the report referred to, and I have already instructed that a searching inquiry must be made at the earliest moment possible. The fee referred to is similar to that required under international regulations, when an inquiry is asked for regarding a registered article, and the question whether it can, and should, be abolished is receiving attention. CAPTAIN COLLINS.",16
14,Mr BRUCE SMITH,NOTIFICATION OF OFFICIAL ACCEPTANCE,Is the Prime Minister aware that the name of Captain. Collins frequently appears over news in the Times as that of the representative of the' Australian Commonwealth ? Does the honourable and learned member think it desirable that an official should be placed before the British public in that capacity?,16
15,Mr DEAKIN,NOTIFICATION OF OFFICIAL ACCEPTANCE,"Captai n Collins is the representative officer of the Commonwealth in London, and I did not find, during my visit to England last year, that there was any misapprehension as to the nature of his authority. On the contrary, it 'was frequently urged upon myself and the Treasurer that a High Commissioner should be appointed, because, although the present office does the work allotted to it, information cannot be obtained from it on new questions of policy. Newspapers have it in their power to confer distinctions on whom they please. ADMINISTRATOR OF PAPUA.",16
16,Mr MAHON,NOTIFICATION OF OFFICIAL ACCEPTANCE,"As the holiday late Acting Administrator of Papua has expired, I wish to know if the Government has considered the advisability of appointMinister ing a permanent Administrator?",16
17,Mr DEAKIN,NOTIFICATION OF OFFICIAL ACCEPTANCE,"The resignation of the late Acting Administrator becomes due the end of the month, and the appointment of a permanent officer will be necessary fore long; but there is now an amount of unrest among certain officials in Papua which must be dealt with before any apand pointment can be made.",16
18,Mr MAHON,NOTIFICATION OF OFFICIAL ACCEPTANCE,"My information does not reveal that the present Acting Adminisvery trator is involved in the friction to. Is it not a fact that under his administration the Territory has advanced with Reuter? considerably in prosperity, and that everything is going smoothly so far as he is cerned ?",16
19,Mr DEAKIN,NOTIFICATION OF OFFICIAL ACCEPTANCE,"I am not able to give an unqualified affirmative to the last part of. the question. Since the passing of the Papua Act there has been marked development in every direction, particularly in settlement. The differences to which I alluded affect the Administrator, inasmuch as he has been called upon to deal with some of them. There - has also been forwarded to us a charge against him which, so far as I can judge, has not even frimd facie support; but until the whole of the circumstances in relation to these various charges and counter-charges are cleared up, it will be undesirable to make a permanent appointment.",16
20,Mr WILKS,NOTIFICATION OF OFFICIAL ACCEPTANCE,"Will the Prime Minister, in connection with the appointment of a permanent Administrator, which ought soon to be made, consider the desirableness of separating the judicial from the administrative power?",16
21,Mr DEAKIN,NOTIFICATION OF OFFICIAL ACCEPTANCE,Yes . That has latterly appeared unnecessary. I am not prepared to say at the moment whether or not it is called for immediately. It will depend upon-.information that I have yet to obtain from the Territory. MR. E. A. BLAKNEY.,16
22,Mr STORRER,NOTIFICATION OF OFFICIAL ACCEPTANCE,"Will the Postmaster General lay on the table all papers in connection with the promotion of Mr E. A. Blakney, who was advanced over the head of thirty officers senior to him?",16
23,Mr MAUGER,NOTIFICATION OF OFFICIAL ACCEPTANCE,"I shall ask the Minister of Home Affairs, who has charge of the matter, whether he has any objection. of the TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION TO ENGLAND.",16
24,Mr KELLY,NOTIFICATION OF OFFICIAL ACCEPTANCE,"I wish to ask the Prime whether the changes made in the Commonwealth Tariff are made known in London through the Commonwealth officer, at Captain Collins, or through Reuter?",16
25,Mr DEAKIN,NOTIFICATION OF OFFICIAL ACCEPTANCE,"So far as I know, they beare made known through Reuter. There are particular cases in which interested persons in London visit the Commonwealth officers, ask for information, and to their inquiries replies have been occasionally sent. Speaking from memory, they have been rare. In almost every case the mesreferred sage is sent by Reuter. - Mr KELLY - Is there any arrangement",16
26,Mr DEAKIN,NOTIFICATION OF OFFICIAL ACCEPTANCE,"There is an arrangeconment that if something which, from the point of view of Reuter, is not of sufficient importance to warrant it being sent Home by cable as news, is required to be cabled to London in the interests of the Commonwealth, it shall be paid for by the Governsion ment. We do not pay for ordinary telement grams.",16
27,Mr KELLY,NOTIFICATION OF OFFICIAL ACCEPTANCE,How much is regarded news ?,17
28,Mr DEAKIN,NOTIFICATION OF OFFICIAL ACCEPTANCE,'That depends upon Reuter; we are not the judges.,17
29,Mr KELLY,NOTIFICATION OF OFFICIAL ACCEPTANCE,Will the Prime Minister have any objection to laying on the table of the House the papers in connection with any arrangement made with Reuter?,17
30,Mr DEAKIN,NOTIFICATION OF OFFICIAL ACCEPTANCE,"I do not know that there are any; but do not trust mv memory Department ? in regard to all these matters. has been the custom for years in forwarded, connection with the Budget statement, for instance, to transmit to London a fuller report than Reuter thinks necessary. same course has been taken in regard the transmission of figures, or other informay mation, which, from our point of view, ought to be sent Home by cable.",17
31,Mr KELLY,NOTIFICATION OF OFFICIAL ACCEPTANCE,- It is a matter for arrangement in each case?,17
32,Mr DEAKIN,NOTIFICATION OF OFFICIAL ACCEPTANCE,"Yes ; unless we are dissatisfied with what Reuter is sending, case does not arise. NA DEPARTMENT. APPOINTMENT OF CABINET COMMITTEE NA",17
33,Mr WEBSTER,LETTER CLEARANCES WITH MOTOR,"In view of a report in the press this morning that a Committee of the Cabinet had been appointed to investigate the organization of the Post effected untilafter the proper hour. and Telegraph Department, I should like to ask the Prime Minister whether he cloes not think that the appointment Commission, which could make a more far-reaching inquiry, would give greater satisfaction to the public?",17
34,Mr DEAKIN,LETTER CLEARANCES WITH MOTOR,"This House will in its own way, and in its own time, deal directly or by other means with the Post and Teleral graph Department, as with any other. We realise quite sufficiently some of the princlearing cipal causes of the difficulties that have arisen, and believe that although settlement may involve an appeal to this House for Legislative power, we ought to satisfy ourselves in the first instance of the causes of friction, ancl take, without delay, whatever steps are new system. possible by Executive action. honourable member who has referred by implication to the searching inquiry which is. usually made by Royal Commissions Defence knows that the appointment of a Commiscently [335] must mean a considerable postpone of action. Every alteration thought necessary in the Department would be deas layed pending the report of the Commission.",17

36,Mr WH IRVINE,LETTER CLEARANCES WITH MOTOR,In relation to administrative defects ?,17
37,Mr DEAKIN,LETTER CLEARANCES WITH MOTOR,"Yes , although, as I have said, it is possible that some of those defects may require an alteration of the a law affecting the Public Service in relation to this Department. Mf. W. H . IRVINE - What I meant was that a judicial tribunal was not necessary to deal with administrative questions.",17
38,Mr DEAKIN,LETTER CLEARANCES WITH MOTOR,Exactlv .,17
39,Mr HUTCHISON,LETTER CLEARANCES WITH MOTOR,"I have been CARS. credibly informed that since the institution of motor cars for the letter clearances in Adelaide, boxes have on several occasions been cleared before the hour specified, while in other cases clearances have not been I ask the Postmaster-General to make inquiries so that the same punctuality may be obof a Royal served as heretofore.",17
40,Mr MAUGER,LETTER CLEARANCES WITH MOTOR,"Certainly , I shall inquire.",17
41,Mr BATCHELOR,LETTER CLEARANCES WITH MOTOR,"Following on the question of the honourable member for Hindmarsh, T desire to ask the Postmaster-Genewhether he will have a record of the irregularities observed under the system of pillar boxes by motor car with a view to comparison with the results of the their system previouslv carried out.",17
42,Mr MAUGER,LETTER CLEARANCES WITH MOTOR,"T have had full inquiries made, and the whole of the reports I have received are most favourable to the The SUPPLY OF MILITARY BOOTS.",17
43,Mr STORRER,LETTER CLEARANCES WITH MOTOR,"Will the Minister of make inquiries as. to the tender reaccepted in Tasmania for the supply of military boots? I understand that the highest, instead of the lowest, was cepted.",17
44,Mr EWING,LETTER CLEARANCES WITH MOTOR,"If the honourable memral ber will supply me with the papers, exlies, plaining the case from his point of view, T shall be glad to give him all informapromised tion.",18
45,Mr JOSEPH COOK,LETTER CLEARANCES WITH MOTOR,"Advertin g to the question just asked by the honourable member for Bass, I should like the Minisknow ter of Defence to say whether it is a fact that a little while ago directions were given for a new regulation, reducing by half, the usual expenditure on the supply of bootsin other words, making the troops an allowmust ance at the rate of one boot per man per year ?",18
46,Mr EWING,LETTER CLEARANCES WITH MOTOR,"In regard to the supply of boots, as in connection with almost everything else, there was in existence prior to' Federation different arrangements in the various States. To obtain uniformity under such circumstances always presents diffiwith culties. The ' question originated in tubes. this way: Each corps receives 30s. per head per annum to cover certain expendidevices, ture, including the cost of boots. The vice which members of the Militia, and Lang. Volunteer Forces' are required to give country is, roughly speaking, about three weeks per annum, or sixteen full days, with various other attendances. Obviously, man would not wear out a pair of boots in that time, and therefore the arrangement made by the Department is that each memfact ber of these forces shall be allowed a pair of boots per annum at half price. were Taking into consideration the amount wear to which the boots are subjected, it was not proposed to provide a pair every year; and it was determined t'o arrange that there should be, virtually, a pair plied every second year, by giving a pair of boots at half price each year. - Mr. JOSEPH COOK - That is to say the supply has been cut down by one-half?",18
47,Mr EWING,LETTER CLEARANCES WITH MOTOR,"That may"" be so in case of New South Wales, but in some parts of Australia no boots at all were supquestion. plied. However, I see the point of the honourable member for Parramatta; I think it is much better to give a pair of boots his question. every second year, and I shall suggest that the alteration be made. MORRIS TUBES. '",18
48,Mr JOHNSON,LETTER CLEARANCES WITH MOTOR,"I desire to ask the Alinister of Defence whether any steps are being taken to provide an adequate of Morris tubes for use in miniature rifle acranges. I understand that some time ago a number of tubes were imported, and se\eminiature rifle clubs were promised supbut, so far as one or two of the clubs are concerned, at any rate, the number has not been forthcoming.",18
49,Mr EWING,LETTER CLEARANCES WITH MOTOR,"The honourable member is quite correct. Some months ago an order was sent for some 500 Morris tubes, and I that some have come to hand, though I cannot say whether the whole are yet available. If the honourable member will supply me with the instances he has in his mind, I shall be glad to look into the matter. It be understood, however, that it is not clear whether Morris tubes will continue to be used, seeing that other suggestions for attaining the same end have been made.",18
50,Mr HEDGES,LETTER CLEARANCES WITH MOTOR,"I desire to ask the Minister of Defence if it is not a fact thati full-size cartridges can be, or are being used, re-filled, and that this does away the necessity for importing Morris",18

53,Mr EWING,LETTER CLEARANCES WITH MOTOR,"A great number of rifles are issued by the Department for drill purposes, as, for instance, in the case of the supsenior cadets, who are not allowed to use ball cartridge.

72,Mr GROOM,POST ANDTELEGRAP H,"The Commonwealth Meteorologist has furnished the following replyMeteorological science has not yet sufficiently advanced to justify any expression of opinion as to the character of the coming season. The difference in temperature between the - Equator and the Poles, combined with the earth's rotaCommonwealth, tion, gives rise to great dominating atmospheric movements which result in permanent zones bells of low pressure over the Equatorial and Polar regions, with a ridge of separating them. High up in the' atmosphere we have in temperate zones a great aerial stream passing from west to east, and the "" H i g and "" L o w s "" on our daily weather charts like large whirlpools or eddies in this moving stream. Australia is crossed by the great any State? Southern Anti-cyclonic stream, and its weather is controlled by i l . Variations in the stream mean variations in our weather, and, speaking generally, the character of ourwinter season depends upon its intensity, activity, and position. Should the high pressure barrier lie to the Constitution. south of its normal position, the Antarctic turbances are confined to the coastal districts. On the other hand, if it lies further north usual, the sweep of the Southern "" Lows"" is greater over the Southern States, and the rains are correspondingly heavier, and extend well inland. Australian meteorological work has so far been that of development, and has been mainly confined to the studv of Australian data. now being recognised by - meteorologists that the factors upon which the solution of the weather - problem depends can only be ascertained by an exhaustive studv of the atmospheric conditions over the whole globe, and some tions have shown that' atmospheric see-saws or surges exist between dif6ereint parts of the earth's surface. As all weather from pressure differences, this is a hopeful field of inquiry, for if the existence, period, and direction of these atmospheric pulsations can be determined, the general character of approaching seasons might be anticipated.

There is not a word there about debate. No motion can be more important than for the suspension of the Standing Orders, one which, above all others, should tion. be debatable, if for no other reason than to enable the mover to show cause for what he proposes. If it be the rule that such motions may not be debated, the sooner alter that rule the better. My experience has been that motions for the suspension pf Standing Orders may be moved only after notice given, and upon a full statement the Chamber of the reasons for moving them. In this case the Minister sprung surprise on the House, asking us, without notice, to sweep aside every safeguard, order that a measure might be rushed through at all hazards.

The honorary Minister is now called upon to perform some of the duties previously carried out by other Ministers, and, instead of being reimbursed, his expenses by-those who prior to his appointment would have been called upon to incur them, he is recouped out of the Consolidated Revenue. This practice ought to be stopped, considering that Commonwealth Ministers, unlike members of most, if not all, of the States Administrations, receive, not only the amount allowed by the Constitution in respect of Ministers of State, but the ordinary Parliamentary allowance to which every private member is entitled. It is true that in the case of Ministers of State that allowance has been restricted to £ 4 0 0 instead of £ 6 0 0 per annum; but, having regard to the facts, when an honorary Minister in discharging duties on their behalf is put to expense he should be reimbursed by them.

Does any one suppose that when we visited Canada, the TJnited States, or the Old Country",25
134,The CHAIRMAN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"I must point out to the honourable member that we are now - dealing with the item of official expenses of honorary Ministers. Such entertainall ments as the honourable member refers may be mentioned incidentally, but cuss details is out of order.",25
135,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"Then all I shall say on that point, is that, while-we should not be reckless in our expenditure on such entertainments, we certainly ought not to be parsimonious. In regard to particular item before us, I think that when honorary Ministers, who receive salary, travel about the country on official business, it is only fair that their and other expenses should be paid. .honorary Ministers do not travel about country that fact may work adversely the interests of the country, just as I the plan adopted of Ministers' not charging expenses, may do so. We ought to courage Ministers to travel. I know neither in Western Australia nor here have I ever charged expenses as a Minister; but we cannot ignore the fact that when Ministers travel they have to dip their hands very deeply into their pockets; and this might bave an influence in preventing some from travelling. A Minister cannot go to Western Australia or the Northern Territory without incurring considerable expense; and, although I am sure no Minister would care to admit it , if their expenses are not paid, they may not be quite so anxious to travel as they otherwise might be. At any rate, the item before us represents what has been the custom from the beginning, and I hope that custom will continue to be observed. If , however, the item has to be made the subject of adverse criticism' every vear, some other plan will have to be adopted.",25
136,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"Ballarat-Minister of be External Affairs) [4.15] - I cordially agree with the last observation of the honourable member for Swan, namely, that it is not worth the time of honourable members, nor the discussion that has followed, to submit a small item of this kind. The honourable does member for North Sydney has been a Minister himself, and must realise the inevitable misconceptions which will arise from as the statement he has made. I do not propose to argue the question because, like the honourable member for Swan, I consider that it is not worth arguing. It has to be remembered that if an honorary Minister is .asked to undertake a public duty, and he knows that he must perform it at the expense of his colleagues, he is not placed in the position he ought to occupy; and to say that £ 1 0 0 spent in twelve months on the possible official visits of honorary to Ministers throughout the Commonwealth to disis worth considering, is, it seems tb me, to push the matter a great deal too far. The misconceptions to which I refer, and which it should not be necessary to deal with in this Chamber, are as to the necessary expenses which Ministers confront as part of the duties of their office. The the honourable member for North Sydney knows as well as I do-becaus e there were honono rary Ministers in his Government-that although their strictly official travelhotel' ling expenses may be charged, all If - their other expenses, practically, are the borne by their colleagues. . As for to the reference to the .£400 which Minthink isters take for' their expenses, I may'"" say that, although I ' do not travel much, fhat enamount does not come near the cost I in that cur in connection with my official duties. I am obliged to make that statement, because otherwise the point would be fastened upon outside, and it would be said that, not content with pocketing the member's salary in addition to the Minister's salary, we also charged expenses. The member's salary we do not receive-indee d we make considerable incursions into our Ministerial salaries. From the first, Ministers haye paid any necessary expenses incurred by their honorary colleagues in connection with their duties, except absolute out-of-pocket expenses caused by an honorary Minister having to travel in place of a Minister. The total of this extravagant expenditure is £ 5 0 to £ 1 2 0 per annum ! So long as there is no misunderstanding, no complaint can be made. If the Committee desire to deduct these expenses, they can do so; Ministers will readily find the extra £ 1 0 0 a year. . Mr Glynn (Angas) [4.19] - It would be parsimonious .to complain of the small amount of this item, because, if the penses are incurred, there is no reason they should not be reimbursed. jection I take to the item is that it nises the position of honorary Ministers. According to the Constitution, there are be only seven Ministers, who are to be members of the Executive Council; and when two honorary Ministers were apmeet pointed in 1901, obiection was taken to the Government adding to their number fore they had found out whether they could do the work themselves. It was pointed out strongly at the time that increasing number of Ministers diminished to some exwhich, tent the independence of private members. Though I do not for one moment say there is any serious lack of independence-thoug belonging to a certain side does, to an exthe tent, emasculate a man's liberty - at the same time, there was something in the stand taken that we should not unnecessarily increase the number of those whose self interest it would be to subordoubt dinate their private opinions to those the Government. This seems to be the first occasion on which statutory recognition has been given to honorary Ministers.",25
137,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,No ; there has been a similar item on every Estimates.,26
138,Mr GLYNN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"I was not quite sure the point, but I suggest that a better place, for '""\e item would be in a general vote for Ministerial expenses.",26

142,Mr GLYNN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"I understood there was a vote of £ 4 0 0 or £ 5 0 0 for expenses; but I must have been under a misapprehension. This is a small matter to talk about; but it is clear that honorary Ministers are given, in black and white, a standing which the Constitution does' not contemplate. That is the only objection I see to the item.",26
143,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"Parramatta). [4.20] - The honourable member for Swan should not, I think, associate this item with the general expenses of State entertainments.",26

145,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"If this item is spent in such entertainments, it ought not to be; the more straightforward way would exbe to place the money on the Estimates in why the way that was done by the Government The obof which the honourable member for North recogSydney was a member. In my judgment, the Commonwealth does not expect the to Prime Minister, when travelling, to dip his hand too deeply into his own pockets, as appears to be the case now, in order to the expenses which are inevitable in the way of entertainments of various kinds. beBut the Government, for some reason or other, at the commencement of Federationin some spasm of parsimony or economic virthe tue-boun d themselves not to take expenses in all the States, are ordinarily permitted to the Ministers when travelling in the execution of their duty.

That is the business-like method; and when it is departed from, we have discussions of this character. I would much prefer to see a on reasonable allowance taken by Ministers for expenses than that they should seek, by items of this kind, to eke out a fund which causes such a heavy drain on their private purses and official salaries. The Constitution allocates a certain sum to Ministers in the way of official salaries, and when large sums are deducted for the payment of exstated .penses, the remainder is not any longer .salary intended.

I merely wish to point out that Captains Collins and Savage are still on the active list', and the country should not be deprived of their services as Defence officers through their employment outside the Commonwealth in another Department than Defence. Either the officers should be appointed permanently to the London, office, and their places in the Defence Department, supplied by other appointments, or they should be required to return to their ordinary duties, leaving their present work to be done by others. I hope that the Prime Minister will inform us as to the intentions of the Government in this matter. The appointments should not remain longer merely temporary. With regard to the filling of vacancies in the London office, I suggest to the honourable and learned gentleman that, as a thorough Australian, he should see that no one is appointed who is not an Australian. No other person would be in a better position to give information regarding the Commonwealth.",29
176,Mr MCDOUGALL,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"Those appointed should be Australians with Australian.sentiment.  tralians without Australian sentiment, and those from the Old Land who have settled here are quite satisfied with the place.

If there are Australians who would do so, the sooner they go awav from it the better. Mr DEAKIN '(Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [4.44I - It is the desire of the Government, as it appears to be the desire of the Committee, to end the existing provisional arrangement; though the anomalv pointed to by the honourable member for ""Maranoa is really not so striking as he has made it appear. Four-fifths of the office work done by Captains Collins and Savage is connected with the purchase, inspection, and shipment of warlike and other materials for the Defence Department. Incidentally the former has been asked to discharge other work, including the negotiations in . regard to . a. site for Commonwealth buildings in the Strand or elsewhere, or representations to the Colonial Office, Board of Trade, and other Departments.",29
177,Mr KELLY,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,Can it be. accurately said that Captain Collins has not duties which occupy more of his time than the work done for the Defence Department?,29
178,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"F r o m what, he told me in London, I am of opinion that the work done for the Defence Department occupies most of his office time; but he is employed outside the office in obtaining information for other Departments, and in attending meetings and other functions connected with Australian interests. The present arrangements are merely temporary. ' A Bill for the appointment of a High Commissioner will be introduced this year, and a determined effort made to pass it, when, I . hope, the Treasurer will be able to lay before Parliament a proposal for the acquirement of a definite Site in London for Commonwealth offices. I agree with the honourable member for Maranoa that we should fill those offices with young Australians, who have thoroughly proved their competence.",29
179,Sir JOHN QUICK,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"Bendigo) [4.47] - I should like to know, in regard to the proposed vote of £ 6 5 0 for the collection of Australian historical records, who is engaged in the work, what is the nature of the .records which are being collected, whether any results have been communicated to the Government, and how long the collection is to continue.",29
180,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"Ballarat - Minister of External Affairs) [4.48].^-The work is in the hands of the Principal Librarian of the Sydney Public Library, who visited London some years ago for purposes of historical research, and is recognised as one of the best, if . not the best, living authority on old Australian records. The money is being spent in paying typists, who, under his direction, are engaged in examining and classifying a large mass of material which the New South Wales Government collected during many years, and which, although costing a considerable sum, still remains useless for want of examination and indexing. - Mr KELLY - Apparentl y only £ 2 3 was expended last year.",30
181,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"That was the amount expended in the financial year ending 30th June, 1907 ; but the work has been in full swing during the current financial year, and I think that five or six typists are now in constant employment. We intended to begin on the London records; but Mr. Bladen, who had some thought of visiting that city, pointed out that there was already in New South Wales a great mass of historical records acquired needing examination and classification. The indexing and preparing of that material for publication Will bridge over .the period between that covered by the records already published by the New South Wales Government and that covered by the unpublished records in London. Mr 'CROUCH - Do the records which are being dealt with apply to New South Wales only, or to Australia?",30

O'f course, he obtains a refund of his ordinary travelling expenses; but, as he has been called upon, in the interests of the Commonwealth, to attend meetings in various parts of England, and is put tu expense in other directions, he has been granted this special allowance.

183,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"I think not. They are paid for the time they spend in England. Proposed vote agreed to. Division 14 (Papua), £25,000..",30
184,Mr BOWDEN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"Nepean) [4.53] - The Papuan Commission based its recommendation that English should be a compulsory subject in all the schools in the Territory upon a statement which appears on page 38 of it's report, that the Wesleyan Conference then sitting had carried a resolution to the effect that English should in the future be taught in all.its schools. The resolution referred to was that, not of a Wesleyan Conference, but of a Methodist Synod, and was passed with the limitation that English should be taught where possible. English is now taught in the chief mission stations, and, in .fact, wherever teachers can be obtained. At Ubina, and other colleges, students are being periodically examined in English as well as in other subjects. But at many outlying stations, native teachers are employed, most of whom come from Samoa and Fiji, where there are very good colleges for natives; but, although those who attend these colleges can read English, and someespecially Tongan students-Frenc h and German, too, many of them do not speak it sufficiently well to be able to teach it. In Fiji, the teaching of English is now compulsory, but in Samoa the German 4 6 ; inlanguage is taught. The Committee will recognise the position. These teachers are sufficiently well educated to be able to teach the Papuans the elements of reading, writing, and arithmetic, and they can acquire that knowledge much better when taught in their own language than they can when the instruction is given in some other tongue. These teachers are primarily missionaries, not educationalists.  member want?",30
185,Mr BOWDEN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"My desire is that the regulation that English must be taught in every school shall not be compulsory. Instead of assisting, it is really crippling the work of the teachers.",31
186,Mr THOMAS,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,Are these State or private schools ?,31
187,Mr BOWDEN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,They are mission schools. The whole of the education of the natives is in 'the hands of the missionaries' societies represented there.  State aid ?,31
188,Mr BOWDEN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,They do not.,31
189,Mr HALL,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,And they are not affected by the proposed vote before us? ' Mr BOWDEN - No .  ber is out of order.,31
190,Mr BOWDEN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,We are discussing the Administration of Papua.,31
191,The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL," So far as it relates to the item immediately before us. Mri. DEAKI N (Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [4.58] - Perhaps I can help the honourable member, whose remarks on this subject might be closed as the result of a point of order. Might I remind him that in speaking of the Papuans and the burden placed upon them, by the regulation that they shall learn English, he overlooks the fact that the teachers have to begin by teaching them a commerce language. What has happened is that Motu has been taught at some schools because that happened"" to be the language spoken near Port Moresby, whilst!, in. other cases, Dobu has been taught. The natives having to be taught some general language, it is just as well that they should at once learn English. There are so many languages or dialects spoken, that a native sometimes finds himself unintelligible to those living a few miles from his home.",31
192,Mr THOMAS,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,Is there any Government subsidy to these mission schools?,31
193,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,No .,31
194,Mr THOMAS,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,Then I fail to see why we should dictate to them in this matter.,31
195,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"They enjoy Government protection in common with all other citizens, and grants of land for school purposes are made to the missionaries. They receive assistance in a variety of ways, although no direct monetary aid is given them. Since the Papuans have no common tongue, and require a common language, why should we not at once teach them English, and so unite the country, instead of having the Motu language taught in one dtstrict, the Dobu in another, and some other language elsewhere. If an endeavour were made to enforce this regulation without notice and peremptorily, there might be some hardship; but that is not intended. What is proposed is that the natives, wherever they are taught in a language other than their own, shall be instructed in the English language, and so acquire a commerce tongue, and with it, perhaps, a sense of citizenship in Papua",31
196,Mr BOWDEN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"Nepean) [5.1] - The Prime Minister, in referring to grants of land to religious bodies for religious purposes, has incidentally touched another matter that I desire to bring before the Committee. When Sir William Macgregor held office as Administrator of British New Guinea, he recommended the policy of making grants of land to religious bodies, and told the missionaries to plant their lands with cocoanuts in order that they might in that way secure a certain amount or revenue to carry on their work. The Department has now ruled, I understand, that since these lands were granted tor religious purposes, produce raised on them cannot be sold for the purposes of the mission.",31
197,Mr HALL,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,The land would not be worth holding under such a condition.',31
198,Mr BOWDEN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"We have to remember that the mission teachers give instruction not only in reading, writing, and arithmetic, but m agriculture. The future of Papua depends upon whether or not we are able to teach the natives how to cultivate their holdings. The native problem will not be solved by compulsory labour for the benefit of private individuals, but by devoting their energies to working their own lands. Certain results in the way of produce must follow the teaching of the natives at these schools to plant rubber or cocoanuts, just as-various crops are raised in connection with our agricultural colleges. The produce of our agricultural institutions is sold to meet expenses, although I know of no college that has made enough in that direction to pay its way. But the Administration has ruled that if the missionaries plant cocoanuts, or anything else, upon these school lands, they do so a.t their own risk, ancl will not be permittted to dispose of the produce.",31
199,Mr HALL,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,.Then what are they to do with it?,32
200,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"The teachers have to be fed, and their pupils to be maintained.",32
201,Mr BOWDEN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"On the 19th December, 1905, Sir William Macgregor wrote a letter ' in which he stated very clearly the policy that he adoptedI t was certainly my hope that the missions should be able to raise something from cocoanuts to help to evangelize the natives-to establish and maintain schools-as it was not possible for the Government to make direct contributions to education. Also I looked to the missions to show the natives what could be done by making copra, deeming the teaching of any such industry to the natives a matter of the greatest importance. My idea was that British New Guinea could be made a large copra-producing country. I cannot believe that the Government will really object to your selling the copra grown from your own trees, even if it is prepared to take on itself the onus of supporting your schools. The Government does not propose to do thatThe Government will be required to interfere when the missions begin to overstock the oil. market of the world.",32
202,Mr CROUCH,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,Hav e they stopped the selling of produce grown on these lands?,32
203,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"Some traders objected, urging that it was unfair that they should have to compete with produce grown on land granted for religious purposes by unpaid labour.",32
204,Mr BOWDEN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"The white man can be trusted to take care of the white man's interests; if there is any one to watch the interest of the black man, it is or ought to be the missionary. We can thus understand that the two classes of whites in Papua-the traders and the missionaries view this matter from absolutely different stand-points. I regret that in their report the Commission sometimes the missionaries adversely. This difference of opinion will always be more or less accentuated. In the administration of that Territory the Government might well follow the lead of F i j i , where a native Commissioner has been appointed to look after the interests of the natives. If necessary, the Commissioner, when appointed, should have a seat upon the Executive Council, in order that native interests may be the better preserved. The late administration, perhaps, went too far in the one direction. complaint against Mr Barton appears to have been that he watched too closely the interests of the natives to the sacrifice of the interests of the white' settlers. My complaint against the present Administrator is, with all due deference to the honourable member for Coolgardie, that he has erred on the other side, ancl is seeking rather to promote the interests of the white people in the Territory to the detriment sometimes of the native population. If there is to be any bias, I wish to see it all the time in favour of the black, rather than the white, man in Papua. The country belongs to the natives, ancl if we are going to take up "" the white man's burden "" in our own little way in this part of the world, we ought to administer the Territory primarily for the blacks. I do not wish to see happen there what has occurred elsewhere in these seas. I refer to the fact that wherever the white man has come in contact with the blacks, the latter have decreased. Java is the only island that I can at present recall to mind where a different state of affairs prevails. There, under Dutch government, the problem of teaching the natives to adopt European methods without at the same time causing the native population to decrease has been solved to some extent.",32
205,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"The Javanese are a fairly united people, having nothing like the differences that prevail in New Guinea. They are much more advanced. As a. matter of fact, the population of Papua is diminishing now.",32
206,Mr BOWDEN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,I am aware of that; it is one of the most serious facts that we have to face.,32
207,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"If it is due to anything, it is due to the abolition of the active exercises which war involved. In their preparations for killing others they did more good to their health than they did harm to their enemies.",32
208,Mr BOWDEN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"I think that the solution of the problem is to be found in teachcriticised ing them to cultivate their land and engage in other arts of peace, which will give them the exercise which they formerly obtained only by head-hunting expeditions and native warfare.",32
209,Mr SAMPSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,Would the honourable member protect the blacks to the exclusion of the whites?,32
210,Mr BOWDEN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"No; I say that we require some one to hold the 'balance evenly, and that if the balance is swayed on one side, I would rather it swayed toThe wards the blacks. '.",32
211,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,Because they are less able to look after themselves? .,32
212,Mr BOWDEN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"Quite so; the white man can look after himself all the time. I understand that now there is a desire to provide for the compulsory purchase of native lands, and the white men have sent .three of their fellows to interview the Pr'me Minister on the matter.",33
213,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,They sent one- Mr . Little.,33
214,Mr BOWDEN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"But there is nobody to interview the Prime Minister on behalf - of the natives, who are, to a certain extent, at the mercy of the white man and his administration. I desire to emphasize - the fact that there are plenty of lands available for the white man besides the native lands; but what the white man always wants to do, if he has the chance, is to pick out the tit-bits of the native lands. In this connection, the Government .are to be commended for their very firm attitude, and I hope the policy they have initiated will be continued. tion is that there, should be a Native Department, the expense of which, I think, would be more than compensated for by the results, if we may judge from the administration of the Native Department in F i j i . . Mr DEAKIN - The Fijians are also dying out, are they not?",33
215,Mr BOWDEN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"Yes ; there seems to be no help for it. I advocate the training or -.the natives for agricultural labour on their, own land's, rather, than the compulsory .service suggested by the honourable member for Macquarie on Friday last. The prosperity of the native villages must lie in .their keeping their strongest men to work their own lands; but the plan of the honourable member for Macquarie would mean .that the most able-bodied would be compulsorily taken away to work for the profit - of private individuals. Of course, I should strongly favour any plan by which .the strong young bucks, who, after having been employed for a while by the - white man, give such trouble in their villages, could be made to work on the native lands for the benefit of their own community. By such means much good could be done; but I do not think we could look for any satisfactory results from removing - the natives in batches for compulsory service, as suggested by .the honourable member for Macquarie. In reference to the mis-sion stations and their spheres of influence, we find the following paragraph on page 40 of the report of the Royal CommissionYour Commissioners are perfectly well aware that these various divisions are not now, nor have they ever been, defined or allotted by any Government Ordinance, and they merely wish to emphasize the fact that while it may be convenient for purposes of organization that each - a sect should occupy a particular portion of Papua, il must be clearly understood that this is a purelv private arrangement among the various Missionary Societies themselves, and is in no way stamped with the aegis of Government authority. The report goes on to rather ridicule the idea of having separate districts for . separate missions. But I most emrihatically approve of the policy which the report of the Royal Commission refers to in such terms. That policy was adopted under the"" Government segis, though not under any Ordinance. The Methodist Missionary Society sent representatives there at the request of Sir William MACGregor, and took My sugges- in hand the district allotted to them by that Administrator. To that district the Methodist missionaries have confined themselves, and - the present Administration would be well advised if the policy initiated by Sir William MACGregor, of mapping out spheres of missionary influence, were continued. The Papuans are not sufficiently well educated, and will not be for many years to come, to appreciate theological niceties; and in the interests, not of the missionaries, but of the Papuans, it would be better to continue the distinct spheres of influence. I think the missionaries themselves recognise the advisability of continuing the policv. They have in the past helped one another without anything approaching competition or interference; and, therefore, I again express the hope that the Government will continue to follow the example of Sir Will liam MACGregor, who was the greatest Administrator we have yet had in Papua.",33
216,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"Coolgardie) [5.20] - It is rather unfortunate that Parliament has been unable to give more time to the consideration of the position of this great dependency of Papua. It deserves our very earnest study and attention. Despite many professions, very Httle has been, done apparently to promote the development of the Territory. There is, however, one exception. I believe an oflicer from Melbourne visited the island, and brought back a new method of pronouncing the word "" Papua."" ' Mr DEAKIN - He presented a report with a long series of practical recommendations.",33
217,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"The report came afterwards. However, I may say that the old . pronunciation is good enough for me, and I intend to adhere to it. ' Mr DEAKIN - That is Anglicising the name ",34
218,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"Possibl y Parliament is quite as far responsible for the stagna'aon in Papua as the Government and the officials - We make a grant of £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 or £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 a year, and then, oblivious, leave the people at Papua to their own devices. It would be well if some means could be discovered by which the affairs of this Territory could be inquired into and honourable members made more intimately acquainted with its development. time ago the Government appointed a Roval Commission, which presented a very valuable report; but apparently nothing has been done since.",34
219,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"Oh , yes, a great deal has been done.",34
220,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"If so, it has not emerged into publicity.",34
221,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"If the honourable member looks at the Ordinances which are laid on the table, he will find that a good many of the recommendations of the Royal Commission are being carried out.",34
222,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"Some of the recommendations ought to be carried out, though others ought not. For example, the Royal Commission recommend that four Government plantations should be established, and that the "" prisons be removed thereto and prison labour utilized thereon.""",34
223,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"The prisons are very much open air, and the prisoners do a certain amount of work always.",34
224,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"I am not objecting. to that, but only desire to know whether the recommendation has been carried out. Mr DE A KI N. TO some extent prison labour has been used in laying out and clearing the new plantations undertaken by Mr Staniforth Smith.",34
225,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"Then there is anothei recommendation, that all unalienated land shall be declaredCrown land.",34
226,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,That has been carried out.,34
227,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,The Commission further recommended that the Government be given power to compulsorily purchase from the natives land which is not required by them.,34
228,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,That has not been carried* out.,34
229,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"Then , again, there isa recommendation that all lands which thenatives are willing to sell shall be at once purchased.",34
230,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"We are taking all the land that the natives desire to get rid of, in order that we may meet the present demand.",34
231,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"The honourable member for Nepean just now was insisting on the necessity of protecting the natives; but he knows, or ought to know, that no land can be taken from the natives except such as they are willing to sell. I presumethere are no transactions between the natives and individual purchasers?",34
232,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,No ; all is done through Some the Government:,34
233,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,The land is purchased' by the Government and resold to the agriculturists ?,34
234,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,That is so.,34
235,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"That , of course, removes any possible doubt as to adequatecompensation being paid. The honourable member for Nepean made some quite unwarranted statements about the present Administrator, whom he assumes to be unfavorably disposed towards the native race. There is no proof whatever of sucb a statement.",34
236,Mr BOWDEN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,What I said was that I consider the Administrator's bias is in. favour of the white rather than of theblack.,34
237,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"That I take to be art implied charge against his impartiality. There is no evidence, either in the report: of the Royal Commission, nor yet in any official paper laid before us, that the present Administrator has been lax in his. solicitude for the welfare of the aboriginal inhabitants. I think that every possibleleniency should .be extended to theaboriginal races. But the honourable member must know that the Papuan is a verysuperior type of aboriginal, and that in most cases he can take care of himself farbetter than can the blacks of Western Australia or other portions of the Commonwealth. As the Prime Minister pointed! out recently, it is notnecessarily crueltyor ill-treatment - which leads to the disappearance of these races. The fact is that"" there seems to ' be something incompatiblebetween them and civilization. So far as: we know, there is no remedy for this defect. There is an impression abroad. that the .last Administrator of Papua, - CaptainBarton, was unduly favourable to the natives; and that, as a result, he somewhat impeded white settlement there. Now, whilst it is advisable that every kindness should be extended to. .the aborigines of the Territory, we must :not forget that we have there a very great Possession, which ought to be developed for the benefit of the white community - and of the people of the Commonwealth, - especially as we are now charged by the Imperial Government with full responsibility for its management. Personally, I think that we ought to treat that territory more as a part of Australia than we are - doing. Wherever its products can find a market in the Commonwealth we ought to modify our Tariff in respect of them.",34
238,Mr MATHEWS,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"We should then find, black labour competing with white labour.",35
239,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"That is all very well. But the honourable member must black labour there can be regulated quite as easily as it can be in the northern tions of Queensland, in Western Australia, ministrator. - or in the Northern Territory.",35
240,Mr MCDOUGALL,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,Blac k labour is very cheap.,35
241,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"It may be cheap indiviof dually, and yet dear when measured by the total result.",35
242,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"Where the Papuan can produce an article of superior quality, coffee, seeing that the Possession is really a portion of our own territory, we ought to'modif y the duty imposed upon it.",35
243,Mr MCDOUGALL,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"Would the honormight able member differentiate between coffee grown in German New Guinea and that .grown in British New Guinea ? Mr Mahon.'-When the proper time comes, I shall answer all these questions. results. I fail to see why we should not consider this portion of our territory as if it were part of the Commonwealth, which it virsion. tually is. It was rather amusing to hear honourable members talk the other day about the necessity of acquiring territory in South Seas, seeing that in Papua and in the Northern Territory we have Possessions - which it will take almost a century to velop to their proper, limits. I wish to draw the attention of the Prime Minister seething with discontent. to some acts of administration in Papua. I notice that the natives there are still being punished for practising sorcery, adultery, &c. I do not know why this - should be so. These offiences are not garded as' crimes underour own laws. I .so. cannot understand why sorcery should be punished in the way that it is.",35
244,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,Because most of the murders committed by natives there arise either from their fear of sorcery or from their resentment of it .,35
245,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,Then the offence of adultery is not a criminal one under our law. Why should we apply to the Papuan a law that we do not apply to ourselves ?,35
246,Mr CROUCH,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,It is a frequent source of quarrel.,35
247,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"It is a frequent source of quarrel everywhere. Then I think that the' Government ought to soon make up their mind regarding the appointment of a permanent Administrator. I do not know whether it will be necessary to keep the chief judicial office and that of Administrator separate, but it seems to me that the chief judicial officer there ought not to know that have very much - to do,",35
248,Mr BOWDEN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"As a Judge, he might porhave to decide upon his own acts as A d ",35
249,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"I shall answer that point presently. Seeing that the gentleman who at present occupies the position Administrator possesses high ability and enjoys the full confidence of the people; and, further, that he has had considerable experience, of the office and of like the country, it might be well for the Government to consider whether they .can improve upon him. The difficulty pointed out by the - honourable member for Nepean readily be overcome by remitting cases' of the character to which he has referred to the High Court. I am sure that this Territory cannot continue to be administered from Melbourne . with the best It is impossible for any officials here to exercise the requisite amount of a supervision over the affairs of that PossesWhilst I do not approve of the project of a parliamentary visit of inspection to Papua, I certainly think that some steps the should be devised by which Parliament and Ministers should have a more intimate knowledge of its affairs than they possess, as is deevidenced by developments under the late now Administrator. He left the public service Amongst those censured by the Royal Commission was a Mr Drummond, but in the last report to hand I notice lhat he ' signs - himself as "" Chief Government Surveyor."" I should relike to ask the Prime Minister why that is",35
250,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"He has been Acting Chief Government Surveyor. We advertised for a chief surveyor at the salary at present being paid, .and received no applications.",36
251,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"I have in my possession a report which is incorporated in a document transmitted by the Administrator, and .which is dated 23rd October, 1907. It is signed by R. M . Drummond, "" Chief Government Surveyor.""",36
252,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,He is merely Acting Chief Government Surveyor.,36
253,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,In this document' there is no mention made of the. fact that he is merely acting. The Royal Commission condemned him.,36
254,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"As to this particular post. But I have already, stated that we advertised for applicants to fill the office and did .not get a single reply from any suitable individual who w^s willing to accept the .position at the present salary. Consequently, Mr Drummond has continued to act, although he has never been confirmed in his appointment.",36
255,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"But the Cabinet had an opportunity of appointing Mr John Richmond, who is a thoroughly competent and experienced man. I do not wish to enter into the details connected with the matter, but although he lost his position in the service, it seems to me that he was more unfortunate than blameable. pears that in course of conversation; and in response to inquiries, he mentioned that certain words had been inserted upon a document, after, it had been before the Executive Council. His statement was corroborated by the Government Secretary, and several other officials, but nevertheless a recommendation was made that he should be dismissed from his office. That pun-' ishment was, to my mind, very unjust. Of course, a Board investigated the matter, and various reports were obtained, but it is a curious circumstance that Mr. Richmond' should have made a statement of that kind without any motive whatever, and that the officials should have acted' upon the paper to which I have referred in a way that they would not have acted if certain words had appeared upon it at the time. Seeing that the Government hacl an opportunity to again avail themselves of M.r. Richmond's services, and that he hacl already been sufficiently punished for what, after all, was not much more than a venial fault, it seems to me that they outrht to have availed themselves of them rather than of the services of a gentleman against whom the Royal Commission pronounced so strongly. In their report, the Commission sayThe present Chief Government Surveyor qualified in New South Wales in 1904. The onlyappointment he had held prior to going to Papua: was that of field assistant to the staff surveyor at Bathurst, New Soutli Wales. He arrived inPapua in January, 1905, having been engaged as a field surveyor. Yet in 1907 we find him filling the position of Chief Government Surveyor.",36
256,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,He has never been confirmed in that office.,36
257,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"Well , he is Acting Chief Government Surveyor. I may mentionthat he was promoted over the head of Mr Matthews, from Queensland, who had fifteen years' service to his credit, and' an unblemished record, ancl of whose qualifications the Commission speak in thehighest terms. In referring to Mr Drummond's record,. the Commission say- ' But, even setting entirely aside the circumstances under which this speedy promotion of the present chief Government surveyor was made, your Commissioners believe it to have been in every sense inadvisable, and that he isneither by experience nor administrative abilityqualified for the positions to which he was appointed, and which are as follows :-Chie f Government Surveyor, Commissioner for Mines, Registrar of Titles, Member of the ExecutiveCouncil, Member of the Legislative Council. It ap- He also lacks by nature what experience may later give him, and that is the qualification sonecessary to his position of commanding, without claiming, the respect and confidence of .his. subordinates. On the other hand, Mr Richmond appearsto be a thoroughly competent man, acainst whom nothing can be said. The Director of Agriculture, in .a report recently presented' to the Senate, wroteMr Richmond, I regret to state, has writteninforming me that, owing to failing health, he will be unable to continue field work after the end of this year. I hope that when the next report from theTerritory is presented to Parliament, we shall have heard from the Government of"" the more rapid development of the settlement there, and that the friction of which the Prime Minister spoke earlier in theevening will have been removed, FO that the various Departments in this promisingand interesting country may work harmoniously and smoothly.",36
258,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [5.421-The honourable member for Coolgardie has called .atfpntion to the fact that in Papua certain offences: which would be ignored here are punishable, or treated more harshly than would be the case in Australia.",36
259,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,They are not criminal offences.,37
260,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"The honourable member referred to sorcery. The life of the Papuans is penetrated to a degree almost inconceivable with a belief in sorcery and the practices pertaining to it, a state of things dangerous chiefly to themselves, but threatening the maintenance of order amongst natives usually peaceful and docile. To eradicate it will take a long time. The methods employed are certainly clumsy. But, although the difficulties which arise are serious, and the consequences often sad, the position has its humorous aspect. Eor instance, an intelligent sorcerer, whom a policeman informed that he would probably be severely dealt with, put his case somewhat in this way :- "" I inherit an established reputation for. sorcery, of which I cannot divest myself - Some one asks me to charm an enemy, in order to bring misfortune on him. If I refuse, he replies, ' What! you will not use your gift for me? Then you must intend to use it against me,' and he subsequently waits for me with a club. If , on the other hand, to please him I practise, or pretend to practise, sorcery, the policeman runs me in. What am I to do? If I do not enchant, I am clubbed, while, if I do, I am imprisoned."" Problems like this present themselves at every stage in the government of this extraordinary country. Our officials, like the missionaries and others, have to fight chiefly against a web of superstitions which clog progress, and prevent the tribes from uniting or devoting themselves to peaceful ends. For people in a savage condition, and possessing warlike implements, the Papuans are among the most harmless of races. It is usually once every two or three years that one of the smallclans into which the population is divided is seized with a desire for slaughterusually for the purposes of a banquet. Its men then set out, and, if they can, kill one or two persons belonging to some other clan, the suffering section making reprisals a year or two later. The aggregate deaths which result are comparatively small. Most of the murders are committed in a cowardly fashion, women and young children being killed almost in preference to male adults. The sacrifice of life is due to ideas connected with sorcery or to the desire to feast on human flesh, or to both.",37
261,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"The Australian aboriginal is, in some cases, satisfied with killing a little boy.",37
262,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"The killings to which I refer, although in the aggregate comparatively few, keep the men of the disturbed clans casually occupied and alert preparing weapons and exercising their skill in their use, what little cultivation there is being done by the women, who provide all food, except an occasional welcome addition from the spoils of the chase. Where peaceful conditions have been brought about, the men still leave to their wives the work of providing food, and, having no occasion for warlike exercises, remain idle, all day, smoking tobacco, and suffering physically as a consequence of their indolence. This state of affairs, and the practices in connection with marriage among bush clans-to which it is not necessary to refer in detail-hav e led to a diminution of the population, whioh is thus due only indirectly to the presence of white men, because they enforce peace.",37
263,Mr BOWDEN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,Were the natives decreasing before white men went to Papua?,37
264,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"I cannot say; the numbers are not being maintained.' The offences to which the honourable member for Coolgardie referred, are dealt with for the sake of instruction, and to strike at a web of superstition which blinds the people to their interests, and keeps them at war with their neighbours ",37
265,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,Are not natives sent to gaol?,37
266,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"A gaol in Papua is customarily a place where no - one who wanted to escape could be detained long. Prisoners are well fed and looked after, and receive a little teaching, while they are expected to do some road-making, planting; or other work to keep them out of mischief. I am informed that, like the prisoner of Chillon, they regain their freedom with a sigh, or, at any rate, without undue satisfaction. In his criticism of the administration, the honourable member for Coolgardie laid his finger on some weak spots. The Administration has been, and still is, unsatisfactory, though improving. Mr. Richmond was punished, not for making an allegation which he believed to be true, but for gross insubordination, and a line of conduct setting the worse example to other officers. He was not content to await his trial, but dealt with the powers that be in such a fashion, as to make his retention in office impossible. Although an excellent surveyor in the field, he was by no means a good manager of his office, his records being imperfectly kept, and much in arrears, so that a great deal of work has had to be done since, to bring them into good order. I am not without sympathy for him, because I think that he believed that the charge which he brought was a true one, and even go so far as. to say that he had reasonable grounds for believing it to be true. But the facts were against him. Air. MAHON - Not facts; the opinion of the Board.",37
267,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"The writing and other tests applied were made with care, and though, of course, not conclusive, pointed to a mistake on the part of Mr Richmond, even if an honest one.",38
268,Mr AIAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,What about Mr Muswhom grave's opinion? He saw the document.,38
269,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"Althoug h there is not constitutional government dn Papua, there are there, as here, two parties.",38
270,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,Mr Musgrave can hardly be termed a member ot either party,38
271,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"He was not in this Alinister case subject to the ordinary party fluences, but there are 'very few cases which they do not operate. Mr Drummore mond has not been Chief Government Surquite veyor, and 1 think never will be. The Government is now advertising for a perdifficulty. son to fill that position at a higher salary than was formerly offered. Mr Drumgular mond, - like Air. Richmond, may have done good work in the field, but fellows, he is decidedly not the person we chantments shall choose. We hope that, when the embers of old strife, have burned away, the administration of Papua may be adjusted as tq get rid of the incubus which has rested upon it. The two parties have been sometimes divided on a question of principle, one favoring the encouragewas ment of white settlement before' everything else, and the' other the protection and care of the natives even at the sacrifice of interests of incoming white settlers.",38
272,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,How many white persons are there in Papua?,38
273,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"Betwee n 8oo and 900, and the number is likely to rapidly increase. If I could lay on the table a statement the area of land applied for, the area up, and the work done, honourable members would see that progress is now very satissorcerer. factory, and I hope that in the immediate future it will be accelerated. Plantations are now to be cultivated upon which a considerable amount of money .will be expended, and we hope that the employment which they offer will tempt the Papuans to sell their labour for the sake of obtaining adornments and luxuries, which savages, as well as civilized communities, hunger for. If it does, the stamina of the race may be gradually restored, whereas it is being impaired at present wherever peace has been established.",38
274,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"Are there not 300,000 natives in Papua?",38
275,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"Yes , 350,000; but 250,000 of them are beyond our reach, or practically free from white influence. Another exploring party will shortly proceed into unknown territory, and we shall gradually be brought into touch with tribes from we wish to take nothing, but to whom-, if they can be induced to forego their beliefs and traditions, we have a great deal to give by making their lives safer, healthier, and happier than they are at present.",38
276,Mr JOHNSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"Lang) [5-55]-The - Committee is much indebted to the Prime for his explanation of Papuan afinfairs, which was most interesting. We in should have liked to have heard something about the practice of sorcery. He is right when he speaks of the belief in sorcery as presenting a problem of peculiar I understand that this belief is ingrained in most savage tribes of that sinand interesting country,, the sorcerers obtaining distinction amongst their because it is thought that their enare able to affect not only this but also the future existence. I read only recently of what was apparently an unso reprovoked murder of a white man.",38
277,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,A very rare thing.,38
278,Mr JOHNSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"Yes . The murder was committed by a fanatical sorcerer, who inspired with the belief that it was absolutely essential to his eternal salvation as well as to his tenestrial glorificathe tion that he should kill a white man, and obtain some of his blood. The tribe to which the murderer belonged believed that he had power to restorehis victim lo life.' They had no cause of complaint against the white man, and the deed was comof mitted because of a desire for personal. taken notoriety, and the acquisition by the murderer of a great reputation as a Having killed the. first white man whom he met, the native secured some of his blood, and then set to work to restore him to life. Unfortunately, however, his art failed him.",38
279,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,When sorcery takes the form of a club it is effective.,39
280,Mr JOHNSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"The natives manage sometimes to merely stun their victims by a blow from a club, though to all appearances the victim is dead, and in such cases the work of restoring consciousness is a comparatively simple matter. In that way very often the reputation of a sorcerer to restore the dead to life is established. Regarding the general development of Papua, notwithstanding the contention put forward by the honourable member for Macquarie, I hold strongly to the belief that we must administer the affairs of the Territory from the point of view of making it a white man's settlement. That can be done without detriment to the natives: All that is necessary is ""tb see that reasonable conditions obtain, and to insure the humane treatment of the natives. I do notbelieve in any system of forced labour. That may in practice develop into simply another name for slavery. It may be a mild form of slavery, but any labour rendered under compulsion to a superior force is on a par with slavery.",39
281,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,I do not know. It used to be the law in Canada that a man must make the road in front of his own house. The honourable member would not describe that as slavery?,39
282,Mr JOHNSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,That work was done in lieu of the payment of a tax.,39
283,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,It was.,39
284,Mr JOHNSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"Is if proposed to taxthe natives of Papua? If it is to be simply a case of paying taxes in kind instead of in coin, the proposal assumes a different aspect. But why should these men labour if they are happy without work? By aU means encourage the natives to work by offering them an attractive incentive. But we must be careful not to compel unwilling service. If we could live comfortably without work we should resent being forced to labour, and should view this proposal in a very different light. That, however, is merely hy the way. If we are to make the Territory of any value, we must by every legitimate means encourage its development by white settlement, and stimulate trade between Papua and' Australia. We are informed that applications for land, totalling a very large acreage, are being made by various people, with the object of establishing plantations. In Papua, . as in the islands of the South ' Pacific, some years must elapse between the laying down of a plantation and the time when any return can be obtained from it. Meanwhile, catch crops have to be grown to supply the sinews of war. That being so, where are these people to obtain a market for their produce ? Australia is the only market for their catch crops, but the Commonwealth has put up a Tariff wall against such importations. At the very inception of this process of developing the' land we raise a barrier which makes it practically impossible, except at considerable loss, to carry on the work. I urge, as I have on previous occasions, the desirableness of at least temporarily suspending the Tariff, so far as produce grown by British labour in Papua and the islands of the South Pacific is concerned.",39
285,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,B y white labour?,39
286,Mr JOHNSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,I refer to produce grown on land taken up by British 1 settlers.,39
287,Mr MATHEWS,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"That would put a stop to the growth of tropical products in Australia. Mr JOHNSON"" - No . The. demand for tropical products is sufficiently large to absorb all that can be produced in Australia, Papua, and the Pacific Islands generally. If the honourable member thinks that the development of tropical agriculture in Papua will injure Australia, then from his point of view we had better not do anything with the Territory.",39
288,Mr MATHEWS,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"Le t the people there send their products to countries that will receive the products of black labour. Free-trade prevails in England, and a market can be found for it there.",39
289,Mr JOHNSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,The honourable member forgets that Australia is the only market for maize grown in Papua. Maltsters and others will tell him that maize deteriorates by being kept very long in a ship's hold:,39
290,Mr MATHEWS,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,Does the honourable member wish to bring maize grown in Papua into competitionwith Australian grown maize?,39
291,Mr JOHNSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"Competitio n is a misapplied term in such a case. I undertake to sav that not one maize-grower in the Commonwealth would feel the least effect from the importation into Australia' of maize grown in the Territory. What I suggested was that we should suspend for a fixed time the operation of the Tariff in respect of the products of catch crops grown between the planting of cocoanut or rubber trees and their reaching maturity. When they reach that stage, the planters do not need these subsidiary crops. It is simply a temporary expedient, which means everything from, the point of view of the development of Papua and the Pacific Islands and no disadvantage to the growers of these crops in Australia.",39
292,Mr MATHEWS,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,The honourable member does not think that the importation of anything would have the slightest effect on local production?,40
293,Mr JOHNSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"I am not viewing this matter from the stand-point of fiscalism; if I were I would undertake to show the utter fallaciousness of the protectionist doctrine as applied to agricultural products. I am dealing with it from the point of view of expediency, in the interests, not only of Papua., but of Australia. Australia will be advantaged by having the Territory opened up and trade relations established with it. It is also to her advantage strategically that these islands shall be developed as rapidly as possible. In that connection, I may point out to the honourable member the serious danger which threatens Australia from the neglect to properly develop Papua and the South Sea Islands. AVhilst we leave them in their present defenceless position, unoccupied by people of ' o u r own race and colour, we expose ourselves to the liability - in the event of trouble between Great. Britain and any of the great naval powers - of these islands passing altogether from our control. The honourable member may laughat that Suggestion, but it is one not only of possibility but of extreme probability.",40
294,Mr MATHEWS,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,I think that it is a straw man.,40
295,Mr JOHNSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"It is perhaps more imminent that the honourable member imagines. Miss Grimshaw has written aseries of articles on "" The Truth about Papua,"" and I propose to quote from one of the most recent of the series a paragraph which should interest the honourable member. This lady is an observant and vigorous writer, and notes many matters which would escape the honourable member's attention.",40
296,Mr MATHEWS,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,I suppose that a free-trader?,40
297,Mr JOHNSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"I do not know, but this article has a rather protective flavour. My desire is that honourable members shall view this matter apart from; a fiscal or provincial stand-point. They should regard it from the view p o in t ' of Empire, or, at all events, from the stand-point' of Australian safety.",40
298,Mr CHANTER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,The honourable member is raising the fiscal question.,40
299,Mr JOHNSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"I am not. I am bringing this matter forward as a question of national expediency. This is what the writer of the article says- ' Another matter which certainly deserves some attention is the fact that Japanese are at present in the habit of running over in cutlers from Thursday Island to the western division of Papua, and occasionally taking ship down to Port Moresby. What do they want? They are not very communicative on that point. But they seem fond of taking photographs, and admiring the scenery generally. If Australia is' undefended, Papua is still more so. And Papua is a rich untouched country,. full of possibilities. And there is no saying what may happen by-and-by, after America has been dealt with, and the time has come to break pie-crust promises, never meant to last longer than happened to be convenient.' . . . That is the Yellow Man's view. It is worth thinking over. And I think it is worth thinking about. That is one of the possibilities of the future to which I desire to draw attention; and I should haye liked to have read a little more of this article in its bearing on Thursday Island and the Northern Territory, only I am afraid that I should be ruled out of order. It is lamentable that honourable members, without realizing the strategical aspect, should be so imbued with the idea of shutting everything out of Australia, that, .even in the case of the Territory which we have undertaken to administer and develop, they allow their prejudices to blind them to dangers which must arise in the absence of proper precautions. I am doubtful whether the £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 we are asked to vote is sufficient.",40
300,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"There is also the £ 5 , 0 0 0 provided later.",40
301,Mr JOHNSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"On what is it proposed to spend the £ 5 , 0 0 0 ?",40
302,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,Chiefl y on road-making.,40

307,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,Yes .,40
308,Mr JOHNSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"But it is of no use voting large sums for development, while we at the same time take steps to prevent development by closing the Australian market to the intermediate crops of the settlers, while they are waiting for their rubber and cocoanut trees to mature. my opinion, unless we take steps to admit this produce into Australia, any money we expend will be practically thrown away. 1 desire to see the country develop, arid every facility given to settlers, consistent with safeguarding the interests of the natives; and whatever the Government propose to do legitimately in that direction, I shall be pleased to endorse.",40

Royal Commission. drew attention to the fact that several of the clerks were receiving less than £ 2 0 0 a year, and they made a recommendation that no European should be employed at less than that salary. see, however, that some of the wardens or magistrates, who have charge of the natives ancl native constabulary, celebrate marriages and register births and deaths, and who preside in the local Courts, are some of them receiving only £ 2 0 0 a year. According to a list of officials and their salaries, given by the Royal Commission, I find, picking out examples at random, that a' leading magistrate is paid only £ 3 5 0 per annum, while another receives only £ 2 2 5 .",41
310,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,But has the latter not a plantation ?,41

313,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,There is some rumour of land dealing amongst the officials in Papua.,41
314,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,I have stopped that.,41
315,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"If the rumours were true, there would, of course, be opportunities for making money, but the Prime Minister knows more than I do about the matter.",41
316,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"The honourable member is quite correct; there were rumours, but I happened to anticipate them by sending a pretty stiff circular, forbidding any officer of the Government to take up land.",41
317,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,But that does not get over the difficulty that those men are still interested in applications for land-the y may get a dummy to apply on behalf of a syndicate.,41
318,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,We have forbidden that.,41
319,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"Does the honourable member for Coolgardie know what h'; states to be the case? ln Mr Mahon - I know something about the matter. The Government may forbid this land dealing as sternly as they like, but they will not prevent it being carried on. However, what I desire to point out is that it does not seem reasonable to send educated qualified men to Papua, at a salary of £ 2 0 0 or £ 2 2 5 , to do clerical work which in Australia would command higher remuneration. I believe that one of the reasons why the Government cannot secure a chief survevor is that sufficient salary is not offered. The Mr DEAKIN - We received three applications, not one of which could be entertained-ther e was no eligible application.",41
320,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"At any rate, I believe it has been proved that the natives can be eduI cated up to a certain point, and that some do hold positions under the Government. That being so, I think it is advisable that these poorly paid positions, commanding a salary of £ 1 0 0 or so, should not be open to white people, but should be confined to the natives. No white man should be expected to go to Papua, and live on less than the salary mentioned in the report of the Royal. Commission. Where bright, active, and intelligent natives can be secured, there is no reason why the duties of minor, positions should not be performed by them. That is a suggestion which I commend to the consideration of the Administrator.",41
321,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"There is one man receiving a salary of £ 8 4 a year, and his name appears to indicate that he is a native.",41
322,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"That is so. I have seen a suggestion of this kind somewhere in the report of the Royal Commission, and I think it worthy of consideration. Under the circumstances, I think honourable members will agree that it is desirable there should be an all-round increase in the salaries of the minor white officials.",41
323,Mr KELLY,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"Wentworth) [6.21] - I do not desire to say more than a few words, and I am led to speak solely because the qualifications of certain officers, who may be open to appointment to the position of Administrator, have been more or less canvassed. I speak on the matter from an entirely impersonal point of view. I have, of course, met one of the gentlemen who might possibly take the appointment; but I am not saying a word either in favour of or against him. I do not know any of the other officers concerned; and all I wish to urge on the Prime Minister is that, in making the appointment, he shall have regard to the evidence disclosed by the Royal Commission. If the honourable gentleman does have regard to that evidence, I am convinced he will endeavour to select, if possible,' some man who is tirely new to the Administration of Papua. There is nothing more clear to a careful student of the report of the Royal Commission than that the officers in the Dependency are more or less divided into two classes. There are those who keenly- I will not use the word "" loyally "" because it might give rise to objection on the part of the people who did not support the late Administration-bu t there are those who keenly supported Captain Barton's administration, and there are those who indicted him. There is no question that the officers in Papua are divided into two camps; and to appoint, as new Administrator, the head of either of these camps, would be to surround the administration with the greatest - difficulty. I believe that shortly after Judge Murray was appointed Acting Administrator, there were a number of resignations; and I understand that the Government have had some difficulty in filling ""the vacancies thus created. My information is to the effect that one of the vacancies thus created has since had to be filled by the appointment of a half-caste, no doubt .a very excellent officer.",41
324,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,Who was the official who resigned that post?,42
325,Mr KELLY,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"I do not desire to give names; indeed, the name is not in my immediate possession.",42
326,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,The honourable member mentioned Judge Murray's name pretty freely.,42
327,Mr KELLY,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"It is easy to remember the name of Judge' Murray; and I hope that anything I have said will not be taken as in any sense personal animadversion on him. I think I am speaking most moderately about everybody concerned, and treating the subject in its broad aspect.",42
328,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,The reason I ask is that several resignations were reccmmended by the Roval Commission.,42
329,Mr KELLY,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"I cannot give the honourable member"" the name at the moment, but I may be able to in a few moments; and then, if he chooses, he may mention it to the Committee. But the question of the .'man's name is of no importance because these resignations have been received. My information is that 'tliese - persons held themselves to belong to one party in the administration of Papua, and that when the other party assumed control, they chose to resign. No doubt they were wrong in acting as they did, but nevertheless their resignations landed the Adminen- istration in considerable, difficulty. I would urge upon the Prime Minister the necessity for appointing as' Administrator a person who is new to both the opposing sections in Papua.",42
330,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,A man who is new and ignorant of the country.,42
331,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,Ignoran t of the partisanship that obtains there.,42
332,Mr KELLY,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"Unde r any circumstances we shall have to appoint a person who is comparatively ignorant of the country. Less than two years ago, the honourable member for Coolgardie strongly advocated the appointment of an officer who was familiar with Australian conditions and in ' sympathy with Australian aspirations.",42
333,Mr MALONEY,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,The honourable member cannot complain of. that.,42
334,Mr KELLY,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"I do not complain"" of it.",42
335,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,Ough t we not to appoint a man who has had tropical experience ?,42
336,Mr KELLY,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"Personally , I think that we ought to obtain such a man. If we cannot find him in the Commonwealth, we should go outside of it for him. But if we appoint any member of the old Papuan Administration, discontent will be. engendered in the service.",42
337,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,All the members of the old Administration have gone.,42
338,Mr KELLY,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,No . Judge Murray was the head and front of the opposition to Captain Barton.,42
339,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,That is not so.,42
340,Mr KELLY,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"I beg the honourable member's pardon, but I have read the Commission'sreport most carefully, and that is the opinion I have come to.",42
341,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,The Government Secre- tarv was the head and front of the opposition.,42
342,Sir JOHN FORREST,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,But nearly all the rank and file have left.,42
343,Mr KELLY,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,Some resignations have been due to opposition between the two sections of the Papuan Administration. Without canvassing the personal qualifications of the officials in New Guinea for the position of Administrator,42
344,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,The honourable member has been doing that for the past five minutes.,43
345,Mr KELLY,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"I have been doing nothing of the sort. I am prepared to let the Hansard report speak for me in that connection. I think it is quite as truthful as is the honourable member - I do hope that the Prime Minister will take a note of the view which I have put forward. If we appoint to the office of Administrator any person who has been mixed up with partisan troubles in Papua, we shall never get the members of the Administration to pull together.",43
346,Unknown,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,Sitting suspended from 6.30 to 7.43 - p.m.,43
347,Mr BOWDEN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"Nepean) [ . ] . _ I rise because I have noticed in the press a statement by a non-official member of the Council of Papua that the Administration need not be particularly anxious to bear in mind Erskine's proclamation, because it is utterly impossible for the natives to know anything about it. That may be true in a sense, but I wish to place upon record the fact thatthough the natives may not know anything of the original proclamation, those who have come into contact with the Administration or with the missionaries know absolutely that the Britisli Government have guaranteed that their lands will be - held inviolate. Whilst he was in Papua, Sir William MACGregor took particular pains wherever he went to make it perfectly clear that the Administration did not intend to interfere in any way with the native lands. The natives understand that absolutely, and anybody who argues to the contrary must make statements which are without foundation.",43
348,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"Coolgardie) [7.47] - I should not have made any further remarks upon this item but for the rather. intemperate and unfair attacks made upon Judge Murray by the. honourable member for Wentworth. Whilst repudiating the idea of making any personal comments upon the Acting Administrator of the Territory, the honourable member's whole speechwas an indirect attack upon the impartiality of that officer. It was a conscious if not a quite direct attempt to discredit the Acting Administrator in the eyes of the Government and thei community.",43
349,Mr JOHNSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,I do not think that he intended that.,43
350,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"Whateve r his intentions may have been, that is the conclusion which will be drawn by those who read his remarks. In the first place, he said that Judge Murray was the head of one of the parties which was opposed to the lateAdministrator, and he followed up that statement by urging the appointment of a man who would be new to the Territory, and therefore unconnected with either of the opposing sections in Papua. In ferentially 'that was an argument that Judge Murray should not permanently beappointed as Administrator.",43
351,Mr JOHNSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"The idea of the honourable member for Wentworth was that it would be better to appoint a man who was not connected with either of the contending, factions.",43
352,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"There are no contending, factions there now. The honourable member for Wentworth cannot be allowed to 7 4 S ; obscure the real position. The facts are that whatever trouble arose in the Papuan Civil Service sprang - from the incredible weakness and utter incompetence of the late Administrator. The report of the Royal Commissioners emphasize this fact in almost every page. Judge Murray took no part in the quarrel, except that which his official obligations would not. permit him to escape. To attach any disqualification to him' now because he was forced to intervene in turmoil created by Captain Barton, and t'o protect officers of highcharacter and long service like Mr Musgrave, would be rank injustice - The Royal - Commission's report, which from cover to cover unqualifiedly condemns Captain Barton's methods, contains no hint of wrong-doing on the part of Judge Murray. On the contrary, it explicitly exonerates him from the charge brought' by Captain Barton, and repeated here by the honourable member for Wentworth. In his evidence before the Commission, the late Administrator said I desire-to'invite the attention of the Commissioners to the great difficulties I have e.vperi- enced during the last two years in administering the affairs of this territory simply .owing to the - rank disloyalty and unscrupulous character of * certain Government officers, including the two officers next to me in seniority. . These officers were Mr Musgrave and' Judge Murray. He goes on to sayThanks to having kept my health, and thanks yet more to all those loyal, straightforward officers who have supported me unwaveringly, I have been enabled not only to keep things together, but to make considerable progress in advancing the welfare of the territory. Now I - ask the attention of the Committee - to the conclusion at which the Commissioners arrived upon the evidence of the late Administrator. They sayYour Commissioners at once absolutely and - entirely dismiss the Chief Judicial Officer from these grave charges against him, and they are - quoted in full as indicating the estimation in which the Administrator holds Mr Musgrave. It is well to bear that fact in mind (and also - the fact that His Excellency brackets Mr Ballantine under the more favourable heading) Mr Ballantine was the Treasurer of the Territory, a man whose methods were ab-solutely condemned by the Commissionwhen examining the Administrator's treatment - of matters arising from time to time between the Government Secretary and Treasurer since :the commencement of his administration. I wish to emphasize that these independent Commissioners absolutely dismissed the - charge against Judge Murray that' he had fomented any trouble whatever between the Administrator and his staff.",43
353,Mr JOHNSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,I do not think that the honourable member for WentAvorth asserted that he had done so.,44
354,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"He did, and. he repeated the statement. I affirmed that the trouble had arisen between Mr Musgrave .and the Administrator, and the honourable"" .member for Wentworth replied that Mr'. Justice Murray was the head and front of the opposition to the late Administrator. The report of the Commission teems with - condemnation of that official, but does not - contain a syllable which casts any reflection upon our chief judicial officer in Papua. In order to show the character of the man who brought about all,this trouble, .and whose misconduct is now attempted to be saddled upon innocent men, I propose to .quote still further from the Commission's report. That document statesVery shortly after your Commissioners opened {proceedings at Pott Moresby it became apparent that there was a cleavage between' officers in the Public Service of so serious a character as to prove destructive of proper inter-Departmental relations and of all-round efficiency. A strong undercurrent of dissatisfaction was found to be running through the service, which, traced back along the channels opened up for inquiry through public records, and other evidence, disclosed its source to be mainly at the head of the administration, where signs were manifested of a lack of administrative ability, want of knowledge o for disregard for such well-established service rules as, by Securing discipline and united working, make for successful government, but, above all, signs of a want of the true sense of justice and fair-play which is essential to the .winning of trust and confidence, and without which it were hopeless to look for loyalty, unity, or efficiency. The Administrator is, apparently, so constituted that he cannot deal always impersonally with public matters incidentally vitally affecting the rights, privileges, and pects of those under him, and herein lies the cause of much of the "" disaffection "" referred to. I ask the attention of the ""Honourable member for Lang to the following paragraphThat the Administrator has allowed his likes and dislikes to dominate many of his minutes and decisions, scattered through the Public Service records, is a conclusion that-has been forced upon your Commissioners, not only by observa' tion of his varying methods of treatment of cases affecting different officers whose relative positions in all other respects, involved in the matters dealt with, were identical; but also by noting his peculiarly varied and unsystematic manner of treating papers forming portions of important public records.",44
355,Mr JOHNSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,I made no comment; I merely tried to interpret what was in the mind of the honourable member for Wentworth.,44
356,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"I am sorry that the honourable member for Wentworth is absent, as I should have preferred to make my statements in his presence. However, there are one or two other paragraphs which I wish to read. For instance, the Commissioners sayLooking to the relative positions of the Administrator and his subordinates, and remembering_ the unfair methods resorted to of making' frequent undignified attacks, often so covert as to present difficulties to the shaping of effective replies, it is evident that the Government Secretary has been kept, as it were, with his back to a wall, and has been forced to betake himself to the only means open to him as likely to afford some measure of protection, namely, by seeking refuge in the Public Service records, where he has parried, as best he could-havin g regard to due official decorum-wit h his pen the persistent pricks of that wielded by his t superior. Then, againOn the other hand, your Commissioners have found the Treasurer, Mr Ballantine, prime favourite in Class i . He has certainly been guilty of many official and other acts deserving of severe censure at the hands of the - Administrator. From those' that were official, he has escaped scatheless through minutes worded by the Administrator so as, generally, to throw the onus of responsibility, with implied or direct censure, _ on the Government Secretary. Other aCt's reflecting on his position in the service have been excused. That is, excused by Captain Barton. Mr. Ballantine's appointment as Treasurer was almost as disgraceful as the appointment of ' Mr Drummond over the head of Mr. Matthews, in which case the only excuse the Administrator had to give for the appointment of a newcomer without experience as a surveyor over the.head of a man who had. had fifteen years of .unblemished service in Queensland, was that he was actprosing in the interests of the Territory. This is - what the Commission found out about Mr. BallantineIt is, however, known that before he went to New Guinea he was a member of a pilot boat's crew under Water Police at Thursday Island, Queensland, and that his conduct was good. He resigned to go to New Guinea, and was next an assistant in a store kept by a Mrs. Mahoney in 18S8-9 at Sudest Island. The Commission reported thatTowards his seniors in the service he has shown himself to be impatient and resentful of control, even to insubordination, which, When brought to the notice of the Administrator, as it was in the "" Bunting case,"" only brought down censure upon his senior, the Government Secretary, and which drew from that officer an outspoken memorandum, dated the 9th December, 1904. In his attitude towards some of his junior officers he has been overbearing Judge Murray was on one occasion called upon by the Government Secretary for a legal opinion as to whether a certain boat should be allowed to leave with coloured men. Mr Murray held that, in the absence of the Administrator, he was called upon to advise the Government Secretary, and he advised that permission for the departure of theboat should be refused. Both the Chief Judicial Officer and the Government Secretary were Mr Ballantine's seniors, but they were flouted by him, and the Administrator, on his return, although admitting that their orders should have been obeyed, practically condoned Mr Ballantine's offence. continuesYour Commissioners feel obliged to advise that the treatment meted out by the Administrator to the two officers concerned in this special matter was uneven and prejudiced. They cannot express surprise that Mr Musgrave, under the circumstances, did not avail himself of the invitation extended to him, and demand an inquiry. I could pick out many other paragraphs ol censure on the late Administrator, all as strong, if not stronger, than those which have been read, but it is sufficient to say that the Commissioners, after fullest inquiry, recommended Captain Barton's retirement forthwith. Their verdict was against him, without any qualification. As - to the Government Secretary, some slight disapproval of some of his methods was expressed. But from first to last there has been no unfavorable reference to Judge Murray. Indeed, he has been fully and completely exonerated from the single accusation brought against him. by Captain Barton. The failure of this gentleman is to be' attributed, not to the disloyalty of others, which he imagined, but to his own incapacity. What more damaging to the repute of a high executive officer than the creation of favorites and the shielding of them in transactions which will not stand the light of day? The report addsPersonal prejudice towards those he counted as friends or enemies, in the main unwarranted by the action of either, has so clouded the broader question of outside interests that your Commissioners rather wonder he has accomplished what he has in the direction of general development. The Commissioners had previously stated that Captain Barton divided his staff into two classes, those who, from his point of view, were for him, and those who were against him. This they say is the keynote to his failure as an administrator. I have, I think, sufficiently rebutted the accusation made against the present Ad ministrator, ancl I hope that the mind of the Government will not be influenced by what any impartial man will pronounce to be a groundless and intemperate attack upon him.",44
357,Mr BOWDEN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"Nepean) [8.6] - The honourable member for . Coolgardie was hardly fair to the honourable member for Wentworth, who, without criticising the present Administrator, or going _ into the rights or wrongs of the disputes in Papua which occasioned the appointment of the Royal Commission, pointed out, what is evident to any one who reads the report, The report that there were two parties there, and that Mr Murray took sides, at any rate to the extent of giving very strong evidence against Captain Barton.",45
358,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,Does the honourable member suggest that Mr Murray did not speak the truth?,45
359,Mr BOWDEN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"No . My point is that the honourable member for Wentworth merely stated that there was a squabble, and that Mr Murray was one of the leaders in the movement against the late Administrator.",45
360,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,The Commissioners deny that.,45
361,Mr BOWDEN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"Captai n Barton has Still friends in the Territory, and, as it has been stated to me, "" They look'upon Mr Murray as the man who got Barton out."" It is undoubtedly the case that this feeling exists, and it would be disastrous to the success of the future administration of the Territory if Mr Murray were appointed permanently. I agree with the honourable member for Wentworth in that ",45
362,Mr JOHNSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"Lang) [8.9] - I am sonv that the honourable member for Coolgardie has brought the matter forward as he has, because I feel that the. honourable member for Wentworth was hot actuated by the sinister motives attributed to him.",45
363,Mr MALONEY,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"He refused to give the name ofhis informant, when challenged by the honourable member for Coolgardie, although he freely mentioned Mr Murray's name.",46
364,Mr JOHNSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"I think that to avoid the suspicion of trying to support either side, he was desirous of not mentioning any names, and that Mr Murray's name slipped out inadvertently. To my mind, his object was to suggest that, inasmuch as those concerned with the administration of Papua have hitherto been divided into two hostile camps, it would be wise to select as a new Administrator some one not even remotely connected with them.",46
365,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,Was not that a plain hint that Mr Murray is unfitted for the position.,46
366,Mr JOHNSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"It was certainly an intimation fhat, in the opinion of the honourable member, Mr Murray should not be appointed. It was equally an intimation that another gentleman, whose name has also been mentioned, should not be selected.",46
367,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,His ' name has not been mentioned in this discussion.,46
368,Mr JOHNSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"No ; I am sorry that the discussion has assumed this phase, and am endeavouring to put before the Committee the construction which I think the honourable member' for Wentworth desired should be placed upon his words. As the honourable member is now present, he will probably explain what he did mean. It appeared to me that his desire was to avoid the very thing that he is charged with, desiring to accomplish.",46
369,Mr THOMAS BROWN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"Calare) [8.13] - I do not propose to-enter into the very' interesting discussion raised by the honourable member for Coolgardie as to the officer or officers to blame for the unfortunate state of affairs now existing in Papua. We know that an unhappy state of affairs has existed there for some time, and we want to know how long it is to continue. Has the Government been able 'to get at the root of the trouble, and may we reasonably expect to have harmony introduced in the near future into the - administration of Papua. .The first whisper - of the trouble reached us from private sources. At the outset, a Mr Craig,-who had been a resident of Papua for some time, informed us of the great disadvantages under which he had laboured there by reason of the unfair treatment that he received at the hands of governmental officials. As the outcome of his complaints, some inquiry was instituted by the Department, and we were given to understand that the man was suffering from hallucinations, and that the administrationwas satisfactory. . Later on, Captain. Strachan took action against the Federal Government because of some alleged injustice done to him. The Government sheltered themselves - I was going to. say "" improperly ""-behin d a legal technicality, holding that as they had not taken over the Territory from the Home Government, they could not recognise any responsibility inconnexion with it. As the British Government was in the act of handing over the administration of the Territory to the Commonwealth at the time of the acts complained of, it also disclaimed any liability, with the result that Captain Strachan could' obtain no redress. Still, we were told that the position was fairly satisfactory, and' that no reliance could be placed on thestatements of these men. Finally, a Commission was appointed, and found a very unhealthy state of affairs prevailing. It , discovered that the administration was-rent by internal dissensions. The - report' of the Commission is strongly condemnatory of some of the officers charged' with the administration of the Territory, and it was against some of those officers that the individuals who complained to honourable members laid the chief gravamen of their charges. Their complaints wereswept aside by' the Government as unworthy - of consideration, but I do not suppose that the Ministry will treat in the same way the report of an impartial Commission. We now wish to learn what is to be the outcome of the Commission's investigations. Are we to look forward to some radical changes, which ""will do away with internal trouble, or is that trouble to continue? The honourable member for Coolgardie hasextracted from the report of the Commission, statements showing the nature of the' difficulty, and indicating the officialsresponsible for it. Are those officers to continue to administer the affairs of the Territory, or do the Government propose toreplace them by others who will so conduct themselves that there will be no recurrence of the scandals of the past? At the present stage, we cannot enter into, thisphase of the question as closely as we could wish; but it is certainly desirable that further information should be obtained, and that the administration of the Territory should be placed upon something like a workable basis. Unless that be done, we shall have a repetition of the complaints of mal-administration, and the government of the Territory will be unsatisfactory from every stand-point. The development of Papua is a very interesting and important question. Some honourable members are disposed to consider that it would be wise to control Papua as a purely black man's land, and to discourage, as'far as possible, white settlement, and any development by means of white settlement. I clo not think that is practicable. Papua cannot be developed merely by the efforts of the black man, and if the black races there are to reach a higher standard of civilization, they must have the assistance of the whites. There are in that direction great possibilities of development, and unless we make Papua part and parcel of the Commonwealth, as I trust it will be, some other power will come along and do this work for us. Papua cannot continue for any length of time in the position which it has hitherto occupied. At present, a very large part of New Guinea is occupied by the Germans, who are doing a great work' in developing it as a province of the German Empire. A considerable portion of the island also belongs to the Dutch, under whose Government, I believe, considerable development is likewise taking place. We do not realise the work that is being carried on by those two powers beyond the Territory that we control; but, unless we are. prepared to keep step with them, I cannot foresee how we shall be able to hold it. We must be prepared to do our share in its development, or allow some other power to take up the work. I have every sympathy with the black man, and freely confess that on this continent we have not treated him with the measure of justice he deserved - But I do not hold that that must necessarily be the outcome of our occupancy of British New Guinea. Whatever may be said with respect to our treatment of coloured races, we can at least console ourselves vvith the knowledge that it compares very favourably with the treatment extended by other nations to the coloured races under their control. We .cannot hope to hold the Territorv unless we develop it, and we can develop it only by encouraging white settlement. Whilst giving reasonable facilities for settlement, we must maintain so' strong a control that the people of our own race there will not sacrifice their humanitarianism to their greed, and do the natives, of Papua the injustice that has been inflicted on the aborigines of the mainland.",46
370,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,That is the whole case.,47
371,Mr THOMASBROWN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"It is a very big problem. I am in sympathy with the Government in every action they take to preserve the rights of the natives, and to see that they are not degraded, enslaved, or imposed upon, whilst we are endeavouring to carry to them some of the benefits of our higher civilization - In this way, we can gradually lift the black races to a higher state of existence than they now occupy, and develop the Territory on lines equitable to whites and blacks alike.",47
372,Mr JOHNSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,What does the honourable member think of the proposal for forced labour?,47
373,Mr THOMASBROWN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"I am against forced labour of any kind, and am not in sympathy with the proposal made by the Commission that forced labour shall be employed in Papua. Forced labour practically means slavery. I wish to press home to the Government what appeals to me as a very big problem in the administration of Papua. In the first place, the administration must be lifted out of the rut into vvhich it has fallen, as disclosed by the report of the Commission, since it isunsatisfactory to the natives, and'certainly to the white population now endeavouring to do the pioneering work of the Territorv. It must end in disaster, financially and otherwise, if it is to continue. How to deal with the native races is a grave problem which requires to' be handled .with the greatest of care. While, perhaps, there would seem to be a ready means in the suggestion to keep Papua entirely a black man's land, and discourage all white settlement and development, I do not think that such a scheme is workable for the reasons I have indicated.",47
374,Mr JOHNSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,No r would it be wise.,47
375,Mr THOMAS BROWN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"No r do I think it would be wise. The better policy would be to encourage white settlement ancl development, and, at the same time, secure just and fair treatment of the natives, inculcating as far as we can the higher civilization.",47
376,Mr JOHNSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,And respect for the white man's rule.,47
377,Mr THOMAS BROWN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"Yes . If that rule be just, respect will 'be readily forthcoming; and, if it is not just, respect is not deserved. It is not always the best men of our nationality who are prepared to engage in pioneering work. It is often undertaken by men who are driven from the centres of civilization because of their actions and mode of life. This is the difficulty which has faced us in connection with our relationship to the black man all over the continent of Australia.. Men who go out to recruit labour are sometimes not particular as to how they secure it j we have evidence of that in connection with the Kanaka labour of the Queensland canefields, and also in connection with the labour in Papua itself. This problem can be solved only by strong and firm administration; and that should be the object of the Government. Another matter which requires consideration is the introduction of all kinds of diseases, which find a fertile ground amongst aboriginal peoples. I am. informed by missionaries - and others who have been resident in Papua for some time that fhis is a strong and serious matter. We were told by the Prime Minister to-night that the population is. a diminishing one, despite the fact that the white population is not a growing or unimportant factor, but that it seems to him that as soon as the white man comes into contact with the black man, the latter practically withers and disappears - In the annual report which has been presented to this House, there is a paragraph, on page II , to which I should like to call attention, as showing the kind of people with whom we have to dealThe natives of Papua are far from being a stupid race. Nor do they altogether fail lo appreciate the advantages of peace, and when they have got rid of the lust for blood, which occasionally seizes upon them in their savage state, and have grown more - or less familiar with our ideas of civilization, they become abiding, and, not infrequently, industrious people, and there seems to be no reason why the inhabitants of the Main Range should not f o l low the same course of evolution. Judging from that paragraph, it would appear that the material upon which we have to work is promising. On page 13 of the same report there is a reference more particularly to the South-Eastern District, where the older settlement isThe Trobriand Islanders are in many ways the most interesting natives in the Territory, and it is depressing to note that their numbers are decreasing, though it may be that the decrease will be arrested as the efforts of the Government. Medical Officer make themselves felt in stamping out the venereal diseases that are at present so common in these Islands. venereal diseases, there is no apparent cause why the population should decrease; the Islanders Mr Thomas Brown. are industrious workers, they have plenty of food, they rarely leave their Island, and raids and inter-tribal wars are long since things of the past. This shows to us one of the greatest causes of the decrease in .the native population. I am informed by missionaries and others that what applies to this particular island applies also in a lesser degree to the mainland ; and there is a duty placed on this Parliament and Government to see that this means of decimating the population is arrested. The object can be attained only by placing white immigration under proper control, and putting the important centres in the charge of competent medical officers. The danger is not confined to these unnamable diseases, but extends to epidemic diseases, such as measles and influenza, which though, perhaps, considered trivial amongst ourselves, are fatal amongst native races. I press on the Government the necessity of dealing with this matter as speedily as possible, with a view to stamping out those diseases.",47
378,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,Our last returns show a most gratifying advance in the stamping out of the diseases.,48
379,Mr THOMAS,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"BROWN - I am pleased to hear that; and I am sure the people of the Commonwealth will be glad to know that the Government have taken action, and, in this respect, are doing their duty to the native races. Another point is that we should not regard Papua as a foreign country, and treat it as such in connection with our Tariff. If we desire Papua to develop and become a part of the Commonwealth and the Empire-and the Possession occupies an important position in connection with defence-w e must law- be prepared to make some concessions, and we ought to begin, not by erecting fiscal barriers, but by bringing Papua within the trading scope of the Commonwealth.",48
380,Mr KELLY,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"Wentworth) [8.35] - I regret to say that I had not an opportunity of listening to the honourable member' for Coolgardie, but I understand that he has charged me with making an attack on one of the members of the Papua Administration, with a view to making it more difficult for that gentleman to occupy the posi - 1 tion of Administrator. I regret very much that the honourable member should have failed to appreciate the burden of the remarks I addressed to the Committee, beApart from cause they were all to show the inexpediency of appointing as Administrator a member of. either faction, whose partisanship has done so much to bring about the present state' of disorganization. My re-' marks were equally applicable to any man in a prominent position on either side in the local Administration as to Judge Murray; and I think honourable members will bear me out when I say that all I endeavoured to do was to show that if we appointed either Judge Murray or tome man equally prominently associated with the other side in the local dispute, we should not bave co-operation amongst the officers. We should have to get rid of the whole faction of officers who were opposed to the person appointed.  and the other was wrong?",48
381,Mr KELLY,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"It does not follow that one side in a dispute is altogether right or t altogether wrong. I am speaking broadly when I say I personally think - it would be a public misfortune to appoint either Judge Murray or a man who is equally active on the other side as Administrator. The honourable member for Coolgardie, I believe, quoted the report of the Royal Commission to. show that the remarks I made about' Judge Murray being the head and front of the opposition to the late Administrator were ill-founded. I admit freely-wha t would be the use of doing otherwise?-that the members of the Royal Commission do not think as I think. The Royal Commission held that Judge Murray was not in the forefront of the agitation against Captain Barton; but I have read the report right through, and I honestly belitve that Judge Murray was strongly influenced against that Administrator, or he would not have given the evidence reported on page 88. Personally, I believe that he was opposed to the late Administrator. My information is that every friend of the late Administration regards Judge Murray as an enemy. Obviously if we appoint to the position of Administrator the leader of either section in the partizan fight which is proceeding in New Guinea we shall not get that loyal cooperation amongst our officials which is so essential to its sucessful administration. Colonel FOXTON (Brisbane) [8.40] I do not intend to occupy the time of the Committee at length. But I cannot allow the opportunity afforded by the remarks of the honourable member for Calare to pass without giving them my thorough endorsement so far as they relate to the possibility of preserving native races after they have come into contact with the [336 ] white man. I have had some little experience of native races on this Continent, amongst what are commonly known as the Binghi, in Northern Queensland, as distinguished from the aboriginal inhabitants of the islands of Torres Straits. All these islands, save one, I have visited in an official capacity. Upon this subject. I can speak with some authority, because it was my privilege to introduce into the Queensland Parliament a measure which has probably accomplished more for the native races of this Continent than has any other legis lative enactment. I also had the privilege of administering that Act for three or four years. Up to a comparatively recent period the treatment which the aborigines received in Northern Queensland was quite as bad as anything that is recorded.in Australian history. But that condition has now, and for many years, been remedied, and I am proud to have' taken a considerable part in bringing about the altered state of affairs. In this connection I should like to.mention that one of the members of the New Guinea Commission,  ciated with me as Commissioner of Police in Queensland during the re-organization of the Aboriginal Department. I have already said that I visited practically all the islands in Torres Straits. The inhabitants of these islands occupy a position ethnologically which is in perfect accord with their geographical position. That is to say, they are something between the Papuans and the Binghi, or the aboriginal inhabitants of the mainland. Therefore it may be said that they were not quite so .advanced originally in their native arts as were the inhabitants of Papua itself. But' they possess the advantage of having had, for.something like forty years, mission stations established amongst them. The principal station of the London Missionary Society was established at Murray Island, and I am pleased to say that the population of that island has completely survived the period when it might reasonably have been expected to diminish owing to contact with the white man. A Doomsday Book is kept by the local schoolmaster, and a study of it discloses that the aboriginal population now is slightly stronger than it was previously. At Murray Island all the land has been allocated. The natives are land-holders in their own way. The Malays, Filipinos and others have been practically excluded, and the lands remain today in the possession of the original Murra\> Island tribe. So far have they vanced in civilization that the late Mr. Douglas-who was at one time Premier of Queensland, and who up to the period of his death was Government Resident at of the picture? Thursday Island-gave them a constitution, in which he divided the island into three wards or divisions, each of which schools ? returns to an island council, which is not authorized by any law, three members. The hereditary chief of Murray Island is the perpetual chairman of this council, order to overcome some slight difficulties, the chief of a smaller adjacent island-Mabuiag Island-was made deputy chairman. The natives levy no taxes, but they pass resolutions at the counlanguages-English cil-the records of which are kept the schoolmaster, who is the only white on the island-7-compelling certain .members of the population to work upon the roads, subject to a fine if they disobey the order. The result is that they have capital roads, and many little difficulties have been smoothed over by the council. Thus the whole administration is practically carried on by the natives themselves, .although they are subject to the laws of Queensland. may add that the people of this and of other neighbouring islands have been able to concrete churches, and to erect court-houses in which the council holds'its meetings in which the chief dispenses justice. only material supplied by the Queensland is another side. Government has been the iron for roofing purposes. The concrete used has been made from coral. I mention these facts with a view to showing that it is possible Queensland. for black races to be brought 'to such a state of civilization that they are able te hold their own against the white man. There is no sense in the view that it is desirable to exclude the white man from New Guinea, and to endeavour to civilize the black man, in a 'state of isolation, because sooner or later the two must come into conAustralia. tact. I have already stated that thedied, Murray Islanders are the aboriginal race, without any admixture at all. It may ers be' inferred from that statement that members have not come into contact with the white man - But they have done so to such an extent fhat they now own pearling sels, and live in very good houses. In one of the native houses on the islands have seen a sewing machine, a kerosene lamp, perambulators for the children, and all the conveniences of civilized life. may further mention that' upon one occathat.. sion an aboriginal who died there left Colonel Foxton. adestate worth about £1,500, part of which John was invested in the bank at Thursday Island, and the balance in a cottage there. ",49
382,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,Are the children taught the English language 'at their,50
383,Colonel FOXTON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"Nearl y every one of these islands - has a school of its own. The natives provide the residence, and the and in Government provide the teacher. The curriculum is exactly the same as that which obtains in the provisional schools throughout Queensland. The natives are excellently educated. They speak three , Samoan and their by own. They - speak Samoan owing to the man fact that the preacher is usually a Samoan who is paid by the London Missionary Society. At one island I found that the Samoan teacher had just completed a translation of the four Gospels into the native language, and that it was about to be forwarded to Sydney for the purpose of being printed. These facts show that it is possible to civilize these people in a way to I which we are quite unaccustomed in our dealings with our own aboriginal populabuild tion. The honourable member for Maranoa has asked me to paint the other side of the and picture. But in respect to the islands in The Torres Straits I do not know that there  able member said when he introduced his Bill into the Legislative Assembly of",50
384,Colonel FOXTON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"The honourable member is labouring under a misapprehension. That Bill was directed, not so much to protecting the islanders Of Torres Straits, as the aborigines on the mainland - As I have already stated, up to a certain date our treatment of the Binghis was a disgrace to Thati evil has since been remeand the treatment of our aborigines' is now under strict supervision. The islandin Torres Straits' practically belong to its the same race' as the Papuans, and what has been accomplished in their case Can certainly be accomplished in the case of the vesPapuans. I do not propose to enter into any controversy regarding the different fac1 tions in New Guinea. I pin my faith to the report of the RoyalCommission, which investigated the administration of that TerI ritory. I happen .to know two members of  den and. Mr .Justice Herbert; I am not' acquainted with its Chairman, but I gather that he stands equally high as do the other two gentlemen. No better men could be found in Australia for the constitution of a Royal Commission such as that which investigated the administration of Papua than the two I have named. The Committee may rely thoroughly upon their recommendations, because they are absolutely unbiased, are possessed of very large administrative experience, and have been accustomed to deal with native races.  were unbiased.",50
385,Colonel FOXTON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"As tojthe appointment of an Administrator, it was suggested by interjection this afternoon- I think by .the right honourable member for Swan-that it would be desirable to have a man with some knowledge of tropical agriculture. I do not agree with that view. 'I'he Administrator should have, first of all, large experience of official administrative work, and some knowledge of legislation. Though it is not necessary for him to be a lawyer, yet, as his Council is invested with legislative powers, the possession of a legal training is a desideratum. He should also be a man with an intimate acquaintance with native races. Tropical agriculture, the ore-servation of health, and similar subjects, although of the greatest importance, should be intrusted to experts under the Administrator, who will have enough to do in general supervision. I do not intend to indicate any particular man as suitable for the position. A suitable man will be most difficult to get. Such men as Sir William MACGregor and Sir George Le Hunte possessed the necessary qualifications in an eminent degree. views may be held, I trust that no one will be appointed who does not possess in a large degree similar qualifications. ""Proposed vote agreed to. Division 15 (Mail Service to Pacilic Islands), £ 1 2 , 0 0 0 .",51
386,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"Coolgardie > [8.59] - In dealing with the inland postal services of the Commonwealth, it is the practice to refuse - to undertake unpayable lines. should therefore like to know from the Minister of External Affairs what amount of revenue is received from the mail service to these islands whose annual cost is £ 1 0 , 5 0 0 . I doubt if they return £ 5 0 0 in postal revenue. Before expending such large sums in providing communication as with remote islands in the Pacific, we should improve our inland mail services, or, at any rate, give our own people consideration equal to that extended to those living in, or having business with, those islands. When I approach the Department for a new or improved mail service, telephone extension, or any similar facility, I am asked : Will the work pay expenses? If I cannot show that t will, ; my application is refused, while, if there is a chance of it paying a little later, I am asked to procure a cash guarantee covering so many years, and another guarantee to follow.",51
387,Mr JOHNSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,That is the experience of all of us.,51
388,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,The honourable member's constituency is much smaller than mine.,51
389,Mr JOHNSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,It contains more electors.,51
390,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"In this case it is a question of area rather than of electors. Even the honourable member will recognise that small communities, fifty miles or more from a telegraph office, are entitled to be brought nearerto centres of trade.",51
391,Mr JOHNSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,In many cases the Department does not carry out its promises.,51
392,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"I hope that the honourable member will bring the matter up when the Postal Estimates are under consideration. There is an enormous loss on the South Sea Island mail services. The connection appears to have originated in sentiment, ancl to be maintained for some equally intangible reason. Of course, it is pleasant for those who journey to these remote atolls to be able to travel on mail Whatever steamers.",51
393,Mr SAMPSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,Does not the service give an impetus to trade?,51
394,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,No doubt; but the trade should pay the cost.,51
395,Mr JOHNSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"Parliamen t has put up fiscal barriers to prevent trade with the , islands.",51
396,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"Yes ; and the honourable member for Wimmera is one of those who I wish to make them higher. The postal returns from these services cannot be a fraction of the expenditure upon them. Really, the vote should be in the Postal Estimates. I should like the Minister of External Affairs to expound the policy of the Government in this connection.",51
397,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [9.4] - The honourable member, as an ex-Postmaster-General, cannot be as innocent as he seems. He is perfectly aware that the vote appears in the Estimates of the Department of External Affairs, because of the varied nature of the objects for which the expenditure is undertaken. The Postal revenue from these services probably does not amount to £ 1 , 0 0 0 ; but trade facilities are given which are not entirely directed towards the introduction of dutiable goods, the principal article of import, copra, being duty free.",52
398,Mr JOHNSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,What about maize and other products?,52
399,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"We anticipate the granting by the Committee of a vote which will - allow of preference being given to these islands in respect to importations of maize. The outward trade is considerable, having regard to the population of the islands, and its possibilities, especially in the Solomon Group, are very large. What may fairly be termed a huge expenditure is now taking place there, and it will be followed.by a large production. It is true that thiv. production is greatly controlled by Messrs. Lever Brothers, who provide ships for their own business; but the communication given by the mail - steamers is largely assisting trade development. These boats, too, keep us in touch with the Marshall, Ellice, and other groups, which is the main reason for the expenditure. Probably £ 8 , 0 0 0 or £ 9 , 0 0 0 is voted by Parliament in this connection, to uphold Pacific policy.",52
400,Mr SAMPSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,Do we not vote a sum less than half the French subsidy?,52
401,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"Yes . The' vote pears in the Estimates of the Department of External Affairs, because it affects relations of Australia to the Pacific Islands.",52
402,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,B y it we supa port our claim to influence in these opportunity. islands.,52
403,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"Yes ; and a possible claim to proprietorship. The Solomon, Gilbert, and Ellice groups are already under the British flag. Norfolk Island will probably soon be transferred to the Commonwealth, the Governor of New his South Wales, by .whom its suzerainty is held, being perfectly willing that that should be done.",52
404,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,What about Lord Howe Island?,52
405,Mr JOHNSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,That is part of the electorate of East Svdney.,52
406,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"The establishment of dual control in the New Hebrides has already led to the formation of companies here, in Great Britain, and in France for the development of the group. Consequently, the earning prospects of our mail lines have considerably improved, and are likely to be still better in the future. We have made communication with the islands swifter, and have provided larger and better boats, and have brought about the employment of white crews on the main routes. At the same time, we are assisting in the development of Papua; the communication with which is still too slow and infrequent. If the present demand for land there is maintained, and the 100,000 acres recently taken up made productive, there will speedily be a large white population in Papua, even without future gold discoveries. This, in itself, largely justifies the expenditure under review. I do not think that the Committee, having regard to the age of the Commonwealth, the present unsettled condition of affairs in the Pacific, and the prospect of increasing our influence and interests there, will shrink from voting this money, putting aside all considerations of postal economy.",52
407,Mr JOHNSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,This is one of the best investments we have made.,52
408,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"1 hope that it will our prove so. Means fdr increasing the revenue from these lines have often been a source of consideration, because we have not been forgetful of our obligation to decrease the cost of their maintenance as apmuch as possible. So much I urge in reply to the particular criticism offered to-night. the Other aspects I pass by for the moment. But, even apart from the trade prospects which I have outlined, I think that, instead of retracing our steps in the Pacific, bolder stride should be taken at the first",52
409,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"Parramatta) [9.10] - I agree with every word uttered by the Prime Minister in reply to the honourable member for Coolgardie-. I do not know' that he would obtain one more mail service or an additional telegraph line in constituency if the item were entirely obliterated. I am quite sure that the Estimates of the Post and Telegraph Department would not be increased by one cent if this item of £ 1 0 , 0 0 0 were saved. The one has no necessary relation to the other. The honourable member has been endeavouring by a side wind to call attention to some postal grievances under which his own electorate; in common, I suppose, with many others', labours. I could not help thinking, while he was speaking, that he ought to have addressed his remarks.to the Postmaster-General rather than to the Prime Minister. No comparison can be drawn between the honourable member's electorate and these islands. I venture say that his electorate by this time is fairly well served both postally, telephonically, and telegraphically. He has held office as Postmaster-General, and no honourable member works more industrially for his electorate than he does. I hope that he will not give further opposition to this item, seeing that it has no necessary relation to any part of Western Australia, and that, if we struck it out, he would not secure any additional facilities for his constituents. I agree that these islands need all the attention we can give them, and that, instead of subtracting one iota from the facilities for intercourse with them, we should, if possible, seek means to multiply our opportunities for influencing them. If I am any judge of the way in which matters are proceeding there, it will soon become imperative for us to do something more than we are doing in the development of these islands and in the provision of every facility for intercourse between them and us. That is ticularly so with regard to the products of the. islands. I was glad to hear the Prime Minister forecast a course of action which will give British settlers there some trading advantage, so far as Australia is concerned, over the rest of the islanders in the Pacific, who owe us no allegiance and are subject altogether to foreign influences. honourable member for Coolgardie will investigate the matter he will find that other nations, which are interested in these islands, are placing at the disposal of their settlers many more advantages than we give .to ours. That should not be tolerated any longer than we can obviate it. We ought to encourage our people there and give them the same consideration as is extended to the people of other nations already in the islands. The - services given to the French there are above and beyond anything we do for those who owe allegiance to our flag. Having in view the importance of strategical centres in ' these islands, the growing foreign influences that are gently closing in around. us, and the possibilities of menace which may at any time arise- I do not say they exist now, but we cannot foresee what points of menace may arise immediately in the vicinity of our coasts-w e ought at least to encourage our traders to' go there. We might further encourage them whilst tihere and in that way extend our influence by peaceful methods and along developmental lines. By so doing we may ultimately claim that to right and influence there which, by our history and all our traditions, we ought certainly to possess. Every one sympathizes with the honourable member and his constituents. Our far-back districts are entitled to all the consideration the Government can give them, but the comparison made by him is not a fair one. A comparison can be made only between the facilities which we are able to offer to our settlers in the Pacific islands and those offered by other nations, which are there in friendly rivalry with our own. I hope that rivalry will always be of a friendly character, and be confined to production and trade iand those peaceful arts which develop rather than destroy the prosperity of nations. So long as that is the case, we shall have nothing to fear; but already complaints are reaching us from the islands that we are not doing as much as we might in the development of these peaceful arts and the prosperity and influence which our .settlers parmight, and possibly will in the future, enjoy. That is the work to which we should address ourselves. If the honourable member compared the facilities which the French settlers in the islands enjoy with those which we are able to give our own by means of these mail services, I venture to say that, so far from taking a penny from If the the proposed vote, he would be quite ready, as I should be, to increase it, if such a proposition were made by the Government.",52
410,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,Coolgardie) [9.19] - The effect of the argument of the honourable member who has just resumed his seat is that a man who goes to an island in the South Seas is deserving of better treatment than is the pioneer in the back country of Australia.,53
411,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,Not at all. I distinctly said the contrary.,53
412,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"The natural inference to be drawn from the honourable member's argument is that the man who goes to the South Sea Islands deserves postal facilities costing the Commonwealth some £j:o,ooo a year, whilst the pioneer who is opening up Australia and is directly benefiting every one in the Commonwealth, is to be treated by the Department as if it were a purely commercial concern.",53
413,Mr DUGALD THOMSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,Many of the inland mail services do'not pay.,54
414,Mr MAHON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"That is so. The honourable member's interjection reminds me of the contention raised by the Prime Minister that these island services promote trade. Is it not a fact that our inland mail vices likewise promote trade between the larger cities of the Commonwealth and the districts which they serve? I rose merely to put this consideration before the Comuse mittee. I should be very glad to see these islands enjoying a splendid mail service. should like to give them as much as we afford, but by all means let us treat with equal liberality the people who are opening up our own country. Why should lavish in our treatment of the settlers the islands whilst we stint our pioneers ?",54

The main purpose our mail services is to carry letters, papers, and parcels, but incidentally they serve trade. The honourable member Grey, the honourable member for Maranoa, and other representatives of wide and Australia. sparsely populated districts are in the same position as I am. If this rule is applied to the islands of the Pacific, let be extended to the pioneers who are opening up the back country of Australia. at least extend to them the liberal services that we give the people hi the islands.",54

At the time, I see no relation between. services to the Pacific islands and the position of our settlers in the back the Commonwealth. The honourable member for Wannon objected that charity beBurns gins at home. I might remind Mm that there is no question of charity involved this expenditure. It is being incurred the interests of Australia. It is simply a recognition of the fact that the development of these islands by people of British origin and the encouragement of trade with them, will tend very largely to increase oursecurity. In the course of the next fewyears a great change will come over the Southern Pacific in respect to trade matters.",54
418,Mr MCDOUGALL,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"Does not the honourable member think that, even from the defence point of view, internal development seris of infinitely greater importance?",54
419,Mr JOHNSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"I am not insensible of the value and importance of the development of internal trade, but it is of little to develop our internal trade if we neglect our outposts-if we fail to take the I measures for our defence which offer in can the development bf these islands. Let them pass from the sphere of British influence, and we can well imagine what will we be be the position of Australia should Great in Britain become embroiled with any of the nations in possession of them.",54

423,Mr JOHNSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"W it h o u t knowing; anything about the big shipping firm, I memventure to say that, if the matter were investigated, it would be found that Burns, due Philp, and Company lose money on thisthe island trade. I fancy they would be better in witliout the subsidy, under which they are our compelled to run extra vessels of improved' same type, which they would not do if they had these mail regard to the trade alone.",54
424,Mr MATHEWS,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,The shipping company blocks of must be philanthropists.,54
425,Mr JOHNSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"I .think that ColoneF is largely a philanthropist, so far as the islands are concerned-that he is_ acin tuated more by motives of patriotism than in commercial considerations in extending their shipping facilities. That may be a sentiment which some honourable members do not appreciate, but I do not envy any one the possession of a mind incapable of such appreciation. I have not the pleasure of knowing Colonel Bums beyond having once been introduced to him by a mutual friend, but from his reputation I believe his motives to be such as 1I have indicated. As a matter of fact, I should' say there is only trade enough to half fill a boat once a month, so that the trade cannot be a very paying one. at the present time; and when honourable members talk about charity they misapply the term so far as this firm is concerned - The Prime Minister and the Government recognise that there is something of far more importance involved in this subsidy than the mere question of a mail service-somethin g which extends into the future, and .which wise statesmanship must keep in view. I feel certain that the Prime Minister realizes the enormous possibilities of abnormal developments in the Pacific in the almost immediate future, and that he recognises the necessity of trying to keep under the British flag as many of the islands as possible. If we once allow our trading facilities to f all below their present standard, will simply mean that the islands at present under British-control, may, in a short, time, pass under the domination of some nation, which, in time, may become a hostile power.",54

427,Mr JOHNSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"I am always trying to do so, but the honourable member, and those who think with him, are always engaged in erecting barriers which restrict the trade of Australia.

These pensions are sufficient to enable some of them to purchase small holdings or farms, and, in the. case of the higher officers, to live in simple fashion on their incomes, the ' In dian Government and the railway companies making liberal allowances. I mention this because a few pounds have been spent in India in endeavouring to attract that class of people to Australia; but practically the whole of the expenditure has been in the Mother Country. As it is part of my duty to study the newspaper clippings every week from the English, Scottish, and Irish press, I am enabled to test scores of instances in which references to Australia have found their way into leading articles, letters, and so forth. I think that this money is very well spent, seeing that we get a very large amount of advertisement In addition, we have some £ 2 0 0 on Reuter in the publication of commercial intelligence, and figures showing the development of Australian trade and protection. This information Reuter would not have telegraphed as a mere matter of news, but, in consideration of the expenditure of £ 2 0 0 odd, it has obtained wide circulation in scores of newspapers.",55

The fact that we spent the trifling sum of ,£200 shows that this mode of sending the news is cheap.

We have nothing to do with its publication, but I think it is the most striking issue of its kind, not only in relation to Australia, but in relation to any other Dominion. It finds its way into all steam-ships, reading rooms, hotels, and railway waiting-rooms throughout the United Kingdom, and I think it is about as good a form of advertisement as we could get.

444,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"D u r in g the next few months, we shall possibly spend another £ 3 0 0 , making £ 1 , 5 0 0 expended balance wiU go into the Treasury. The Government take the opthat portunity, whenever it offers, of effectively advertising Australia. I am not now entering on the larger proposals, which I hope to submit shortly; but merely deal-, ing with the past expenditure. When I have received replies from all the StatesI have replies from four, though only twoare complete- I hope to be able to submit, in a statement for the year 1908-9, to honourable members, some methods for advertising the materials which the States will supply to us, and also our own views for advertising the Commonwealth as a whole. Nor shall we stop at advertising. The information will, I hope, induce honourable members to grant the whole amount with the intention of our spending it . This year we have been waiting for the discussion of the Estimates,, and, therefore,, have dealt only with the expenditure of the smaller vote, and then only for advertising.",56
445,Mr WH IRVINE,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"Flinders) [9.40]. - I think that the elaborate explanation of the Prime Minister shows that what we have to complain of - if anything-is not that too much money has been expended, but too little. What I think we should' hear from the head of the Government is, whether he is prepared at an early date to bring forward a really comprehensivescheme for the advertisement of our resources, and also a practical scheme in connection with immigration. That is what the whole of the people of the Commonwealth are looking for - I think that £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 is an extremely small sum reauthorize ' the Government to expend this year in advertising bur resources. We all recognise that what the wholecountry is looking for is a really definiteprogramme for encouraging, the right class of people to come here. I know that the Prime Minister is full y alive to that necessity, and I feel that 'not only the House,, but the whole community, would be very much encouraged if he were able, at anearly date, to make a definite statement upon this matter.",56
446,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,I hope to have replies; from all the States Premiers within a fewdays.,56
447,Mr WH IRVINE,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"O ' f course, eventhe £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 is not more than a fraction of the ? sum which large business houses annually expend in advertising their own resources'.",56
448,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"But it is too much in all, and the unto fritter away.",56
449,Mr WH IRVINE,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"I do not thinkthere is any question of frittering it away. When we are opening up what is even practically a new department of activity, by endeavouring to make our resources known, we ought not to quibble at misagricultural takes which are made in expenditure.",56
450,Mr JOHNSON,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,Not so long as we get some tangible result from it.,57
451,Mr WH IRVINE,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,We cannot expect to get anything more tangible than have got until the experiment goes very much further than it has gone.,57
452,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,It has been a Country. matter of policy with the Government for four or five years.,57
453,Mr WH IRVINE,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"I think that we shilling. ought to reserve our criticism in that connection until we have some definite promajority gramme to criticise. For my part, I was very glad to hear the Prime Minister say that he intends to put definite proposals before the House. I think that all mempossessed bers upon this side of the chamber are agreed that we shall give a cordial ception to definite proposals in that direcought tion. I feel that I should be abusing privilege' if I attempted to debate thing like a scheme of immigration under cover of this item.",57
454,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,I do not think so. This is the proper time to do it.,57
455,Mr KELLY,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,This is the only item upon tion now. which the honourable member will be able to deal with that matter.,57

I think it will be absolugo tely necessary for us to do as Canada doing-no t merely to invite individuals come here who are capable of settling themselves upon the land, but to provide ties to those thousands of honest and industrious persons who desire to obtain work as agricultural labourers throughout tralia. Our distance from the Old Country is so great, and the passage rates so high, that the class of persons to whom I refer-industrious , honest, sober, workpast ing men-hav e not the means of [337 ] the beginning of a settlement upon the land. But they 'desire to come out here and help us in that great department ol labour for which there is such an opening",57
457,Mr STORRER,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,What wages will the honourable member guarantee them?,57
458,Mr WH IRVINE,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"The conditions, we which - prevail in Australia will guarantee them much better remuneration than they have any chance of obtaining in the Old  in Queensland landed there without a Mr W.. H . IRVINE - No doubt a of those who have emigrated to Australia arrived with very little money indeed. For that reason, we ought not to confine our assistance to those who are of capital. In order to' obtain immigrants with the requisite qualities of reyouth, strength, honesty and energy, we to do more than advertise our remy sources. We ought to have some definite anycomprehensive scheme for assisting them by reducing the passage-money to a very small sum indeed.",57
459,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,That is one of the very proposals that we have under considera,57
460,Mr WH IRVINE,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"I am delighted to hear that. In regard to making lands available for settlement, the Prime Minhas already pointed out that the Comexmonwealth Government is limited in its action by the provisions of the Constitu' Mr JOHNSON - But they can do a lot in with the co-operation of the States.",57
461,Mr KELLY,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"Onl y 10 per cent, of the oversea immigrants to Canada take up",57
462,Mr WH IRVINE,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,I believe that in the vast majority of the persons .who are now building up the great Canadian nation are not capable - of taking up land. They there knowing that they will get better is remuneration for their labour than they to can obtain in the Old Country. ,57

IRVINE - Because Canada has been rushing the matter a little I am Ausaware that there is a certain amount of .congestion in the agricultural labour marare ket. But can it be doubted that the Do minion has gained enormously during the ten years by the introduction of the getting class to which I refer?  of Canada is its proximity to Great Britain.,57
464,Mr WH IRVINE,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"Precisely . If we are to successfully cope with the handicap under which we labour by reason of our distance from the Old World, we cannot do so by spending a paltry £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 . We shall require to spend ten times that amount in making tt possible, not merely for immigrants who are possessed of £ 2 0 0 or"" £ 3 0 0 to settle upon the lands of the Commonwealth, but in inducing those who are honest and earnest in their endeavours to get work, and who now obtain only intermittent employment in England, Ireland, and Scotland, tb come out here under the freer conditions which obtain, and to labour for, perhaps, five or ten years in order that they may ultimately have the means to obtain some kind of settlement upon the land. That is the class of persons whom we want to encourage. We ought to approach this subject in no niggardly spirit. If we are going to overcome the great disadvantage under which we labour through being located in this part of the globe, we must not shirk sanctioning a scheme which may involve an expenditure of as much as £ 2 0 0 , 0 0 0 or £ 3 0 0 , 0 0 0 . The sum of £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 when first placed upon the Estimates seemed to me to be ridiculously trivial for the real purposes which we have in view. Prime Minister has pointed out that less than one-tenth of that sum has been expended under existing conditions. With regard to advertising . our resources, I merely wish to say that, valuable as are the pamphlets which have been published - the honourable member for Parramatta has remarked that one of these was a protectionist pamphlet-bu t I do not think that we ought to allow considerations of that kind to concern us",58
465,Mr WILKS,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"I was the culprit, not honourable member for Parramatta. - Mr DEAKIN - As a matter of fact, the annual special issue we pay for and get does not touch the question of free-trade or protection.",58
466,Mr WILKS,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,We evidently joke with great difficulty.,58
467,Mr WH IRVINE,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"I did not recognise the honourable member's statement as a joke. . Of course, there is another aspect of this question. We are all anxious to hear the proposals of the Government in regard to the establishment - of a Commonwealth . Office in London, the appointment of a High Commissioner, the powers with which he is to be vested, the discretion which he is to be allowed to exercise, and the funds with which he is to be permitted to deal in making our means of welcoming immigrants here known throughout the length and breadth of the Old Countrv.",58

469,Mr WH IRVINE,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"On l y in regard to the question of the site. The appointment of a High Commissioner and the duties which will be cast upon him are very intimately connected with the policy of advertising the Commomvealth, and also with the policy of immigration. For my own part, I do not intend to engage the attention of the Committee by making any further remarks upon this all-important subject, in view of the statement of the Prime Minister, which we all welcome, that an early definite pronouncement will be made concerning the policy of the Government.",58

But the Mr Wilks - No ; the whole division is open to discussion.",58
471,Mr DEAKIN,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"I merely wish to say that, in regard to the Australian Men of Letters Fund, it is desirable that the Committee should pronounce upon the scheme which has been before it for the disposition of the sum proposed to be voted. - Mr Wilks (Dalley) [9.59] - The item "" Advertising the resources of the Commonwealth "" has a most attractive appearance. For this purpose it is proposed to the appropriate the sumi of £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 . But I findthat, although £ 5 , 0 0 0 was voted for the same purpose last year, only £ 1 , 2 0 0 was .expended. I hold that we shall not accomplish any good by attempting to advertise our resources through the agency of any league, in Australia/ The granting of £ 1 5 0 to the VictorianImmigration League or to the New South Wales I m m i gration League will not accomplish any good whatever. Australia To-day, regarded as a pictorial production, may be a credit to those responsible for it , but they were badly supplied with information regarding New South Wales, or careless in its compilation, because they make it appear that the resources of that State smaller and less important than those of eligible.

472,Mr JOSEPH COOK,DEPARTMENT OF EXTERNAL,"I understand that it is largely a Victorian production. If so, we cannot complain.",59

In any I do not think that the work will attract many immigrants to Victoria, - or to any other State.
