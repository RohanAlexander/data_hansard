Second Reading  Small Business and Consumer Affairs) (9.31 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill is the first of three in the legislation package for the implementation of a cost recovery regime for import related services delivered by the Australian Customs Service, which was announced by the government in the 1996-97 budget. The three bills in this legislation package provide the legislative authority for the imposition and collection of 13 charges and fees for import related services delivered by the Australian Customs Service. The 13 imposts are located in two new charges bills and this Customs Amendment Bill, and will apply full cost recovery for commercial customs activities directly and indirectly required to process imports. This measure is consistent with the general thrust of government policy which increasingly sees the closer alignment of service delivery costs with sectors of the community which generate the workload. For instance, the user-pays system is already used in relation to the recovery of costs of processing passengers at international airports through the passenger movement charge. Similarly, the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service introduced cost recovery in the early 1990s for its work associated with the movement of international cargo. The services to be covered by the new charges in this legislative package are: - the processing of cargo reports (both sea and air), - import entry processing (sea, air and post), and - licensing of approved places for the examination of goods To coincide with this measure, Customs has 1996 taken the opportunity to streamline elements of two existing fees. The first relates to refund of customs duty application fees and the second relates to administrative arrangements for the determination of costs associated with out of hours work by Customs officers or for work by Customs officers at locations where customs work is.;. .ot usually performed. This legislation package sees an extension of the current cost recovery regime for import related services. Customs currently recovers part of the cost of its electronic systemsamounting to approximately $18.5 million in 1995-96-through charges levied on importers for import entries. The extension of the charging arrangements, however, relates only to commercial import processing. It does not cover activity associated with Customs' community protection function relating to the detection and interception of prohibited imports and drugs. The government recognises Customs' important role in this area and has, in the budget, provided funds to Customs to significantly increase the use of sophisticated technology to maintain and enhance its community protection capability. Nor will charges apply to the processing of export transactions. The exemption of exports from the new user-pays system is a recognition of the key role export industries will play in improving Australia's trade balance, creating more jobs and reducing the federal deficit. Customs has undertaken detailed activity based costing of its services to ensure that the costs recovered do not exceed the costs calculated to process import transactions. The cost model used in calculating the charges has been reviewed by two firms of external auditors. The charges are limited to the calculated costs of delivering the functions, and will be reviewed annually to ensure that they only reflect the actual costs of service delivery. Any efficiencies identified in service delivery will be passed on through lower charges. One hundred and three thousand importers generated around 2.2 million customs import entries in 1995 containing 7.2 million entry lines. Ninety-eight per cent of these entries were lodged electronically with Customs. Based on the 1995 data, 95 per cent of entries have 10 lines or less and will incur the minimum charge. The new charges, for the majority of entries, will see the current electronic entry cost rise from $8.75 to $29.65 (sea) or $22.80 (air and post). The present charge of $8.75 only picks up some of the computer costs for entry processing and does not represent full cost recovery. Although the increase in entry costs is significant, in absocollected. lute terms the additional costs will be small for the majority of importers. For example, 65 per cent of importers make four or less entries per year and would incur a total cost increase of less than $85 per annum. After the budget announcement, members of the Customs National Consultative Committee were briefed at a special meeting about the nature of the proposed charges. This committee comprises representatives from the Australian Air Transport Association, the Australian Chamber of Shipping, the Australian Federation of International Forwarders, the Customs Brokers Council of Australia, the International Air Couriers Association, the Australian Chamber of Commerce, the Law Council of Australia and the Institute of Chartered Accountants. Their feedback resulted in some changes being made to the charges for entry processing and the methods of collection. This committee met again in September where the charges were once more the subject of discussion. Informal meetings have been held with various sectors of the importing community, such as the air express couriers, the cargo terminal operators and the Australian International Movers Association, in regard to establishing the most efficient collection methods for the charges. In meeting with a variety of industry sectors, Customs was made aware of some difficulties the collection of cargo reporting fees and screening fees would impose on cargo terminal operators and shipping companies for manual reporting charges and on air express couriers for screening charges. As a result, the legislation now provides that special arrangements may be entered into for the collection of these charges, including periodic settlement arrangements to coincide with the operating environment and billing cycles experienced by many of the firms in the importing community. In addition to meetings called at the behest of industry, Customs has conducted a series of industry briefing sessions in all state and territory capital cities and in several regional centres. These sessions have provided an opportunity for Customs to explain details about the charges and how they will be At the same time, the sessions have provided a valuable forum for feedback from all sectors of the importing community, much of which has influenced implementation decisions. The three bills which comprise this legislation package will provide the legislative authority for the imposition and collection of the 13 charges and fees for the import related services delivered by Customs to which I have referred. In particular, this bill contains: 1. the fees relating to the processing of those entries which are required to move imported goods out of a warehouse and into home consumption; 2. the replacement fees currently contained in the Customs Act for the processing of applications for refund of customs duty and for the provision of officers' services either out of hours or at locations where such services are not usually provided; 3. the administration provisions for the charges contained in the Import Processing Charges Bill; and 4. the requirements of the new Customs depot licensing regime, whose related charges are contained in the Customs Depot Licensing Charges Bill. I present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Mr Crean) adjourned. NA First Reading  first time. Second Reading  Small Business and Consumer Affairs) (9.41 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill is the second of three in the legislation package for the implementation of a cost recovery regime for import related services delivered by the Australian Customs Service, which was announced by the government in the 1996-97 budget. This bill contains seven of the charges dealing with the import entry and cargo reporting regimes in the Customs Act 1901. Different charges will apply for electronic and manually lodged entries and for entries relating to sea cargo and air cargo, including post. These are outlined in detail in the explanatory memorandum which accompanies this bill. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Crean) adjourned. NA CHARGES BILL 1996 First Reading  first time. Second Reading  Small Business and Consumer Affairs) (9.43 a.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill is the third of three in the legislation package for the implementation of a cost recovery regime for import related services delivered by the Australian Customs Service, which was announced by the government in the 1996-97 budget. This bill contains charges associated with the new depot licensing regime for Customs depots which are appointed for the examination of goods subject to Customs control, or BILL 1996 for the consolidation of goods for export, or for the deconsolidation of goods after importation. While these depots are currently appointed, no licensing regime exists. Corresponding changes to the Customs Act 1901, which are contained in the Customs Amendment Bill (No.2) 1996, the first bill of this package, will establish the licensing requirements for these premises and their operators. Given that these places are an extension of the wharfs and airports, and hold cargo which is still under Customs control, the new licensing arrangements will help to ensure that the control of cargo prior to Customs release is acceptable and in keeping witfl' ftte intent of the Customs Act in regard to control and release of cargo. The depot licensing application charges and the annual licence charges contained in this bill are outlined in detail in the explanatory memorandum which accompanies this bill. I commend the bill to the House. Debate (on motion by Mr Crean) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT (WAITING PERIOD) BILL 1996 Second Reading Debate resumed from 30 October, on motion by Mr Abbott: That the bill be now read a second time.  a.m.)-The opposition finds this measure a highly obnoxious one and we will be opposing the Student and Youth Assistance Amendment (Waiting Period) Bill. Basically, it is one of a number of what you might term little nasties in this year's budget and a number of these pertain to the area of student assistance. I say that it is one of a number. I would also instance things such as the abolition of the incidentals allowance for homeless secondary school students. This is the funding that enables disadvantaged students to access things such as textbooks and other requisites for them to participate in education. That is one of the other little nasties. Another one is the abolition of case management of homeless secondary students. Again, you could hardly imagine a more heartless decision than to deprive particularly disadvantaged secondary school students-that is, those who are homeless--of access to comprehensive holistic case management assistance to help them overcome their very many problems. There are other decisions such as the decision to increase the age at which students are deemed independent of their parents from 22 to 25. That measure reverses an important reform introduced by the former government to reduce that age of independence from 25 to 22. When you put all the different measures that the government is instituting in the student assistance area together, you are looking at creating something of the order of 125,000 losers-I think that is the figure from memory. There are a number of things being done in this area which are bad. We do not say that everything that is being done is bad. There are a number of the measures that we have said that we will support, but there are a number that we take strong exception to. This one that we are debating today that imposes a two-year waiting period on migrants before they can access Austudy, we think, is a very bad step. It is, of course, part of of changes in this area, most of which apply to Social Security payments. The coalition did say before the election that they would introduce a two-year waiting period for certain payments but they also specifically precluded certain areas of payment from the ambit of this measure and these included Austudy. This is a clear instance of the coalition breaking their promise, one of the very many . We do not intend to stop reminding this government of instances where it has broken clear election promises and this is another case in point. The thing about the whole structure of income support in this country is that it is important to bear in mind that, in government, we aimed to create a comprehensive income security safety net and that included the many payments made through Social Security and also payments made through the Department of Employment, Education and Training and Youth Affairs, payments such as Austudy, Abstudy, assistance for isolated children and so forth. There is a whole structure there and a key objective that we had in creating that structure was to minimise the likelihood of the creation in this country of an underclass of absolutely destitute people cut off from what we would regard as the normal and appropriate opportunities in life, and that includes access to education and access to assistance for education purposes. Yes, we did introduce a six-month waiting period for certain payments, but we thought very carefully about that and were particularly concerned to at least strike some reasonable balance between creating a deterrent to people seeking to migrate inappropriately on the one hand but avoiding a situation where people were deprived of any source of support for protracted periods of time on the other. It is a very difficult balance and we think extending that period from six months to two years is frankly unconscionable. I think it is important to think about how all these different decisions are going to come together. Of course, there is provision under the government's proposals that people may be able to access special benefit within that two-year period if they can demonstrate some unforeseen and unforeseeable change of an overall package circumstances. That is a very tough test, but I think the important point to make about this, particularly when we are talking about Austudy, is that the people that are being penalised are not just people who might have come here carelessly without thinking through how they were going to support themselves once they got to this country. We are talking here about their dependent children. Even those who are able to satisfy this pretty steep hurdle and qualify for special benefit as a result of unforeseeable circumstances will only be able to get the basic rate of special benefit, equivalent to single person unemployment payment as a maximum, plus the very low rate of basic family payment over and above that, but not the additional level of family payment which is available for people on low incomes and which is highly targeted. That very much more substantial sum which is available normally to citizens of this country if they are on a low income will be denied to migrants in this circumstance. They will also, of course, be denied, as a result of this bill, access to Austudy. So you might have a secondary school kid from a background which is not particularly advantaged, having to overcome the problems of English not being their native language in the first instance, and being deprived of access to additional family payment and also access to Austudy. What will that do to the total income support available to an extended family that might have a number of children? They will get, if they are lucky, the basic rate of special benefit set at the single rate of unemployment payment. To suggest that that is an adequate income support package for a family containing a number of dependent children is just patently ludicrous. This bill will penalise not only the people who, the government might argue, did not think carefully enough about how they were going to support themselves before they came to this country but also their dependent children and it will reduce them to poverty and penury. There is no provision, as I said, other than this access to the very basic rate of special benefit, if they are lucky-if they can show their change in circumstances was unforeseen-to gain any decent level of income support. This completely undermines what we sought to do in government-that is, to create a comprehensive safety net. Do we really want to finish up with a society which has a class of people who are reduced to doing nothing but begging, prostituting themselves or scrounging in order to survive? As I said, this will affect not just the parents who, the government might argue, came here carelessly without thinking through the implications of migration-the government might say there is some element of fault in the way they actedbut also their children. I was recently in the United States. The striking thing as you walk around the streets of the cities of that country is the large number of people you see begging who have no source of support. The United States, unlike us, has not built up a comprehensive safety net. You do get chucked off the unemployment payment after a limited period of time. Even under the Democratic administration over there, albeit with a Republican-controlled Congress, you are now seeing what they term 'welfare reform' resulting in the prospect of large numbers of sole parents also being chucked off any form of income support after a finite period. Do we really want to go down that route of creating a class of people like that? This sort of measure does start to produce exactly that effect. It is singularly ironic that the government is doing things like this measum, getting rid of the incidentals allowance and getting rid of the case management of homeless secondary students at a time when it is also prating about the importance of addressing problems of literacy in our young people. Addressing literacy is a key objective and it is something we attached a very considerable priority to. Clearly literacy is a particular problem for people who do not come from an English speaking background. What on earth is the rationale for denying or reducing the access to educational opportunities of young people who are going to be affected by this measure and who are going to have to overcome that lead in the saddlebag of not having English as their native language in the first place? The educational disadvantage suffered by people from non-English speaking backgrounds is something we gave a great deal of attention to when we were in government. In all parts of the education and training system we introduced special programs to address this particular problem. A great deal was done in the schools area. For example, we had specially targeted programs through the schools program and in the higher education area we had the higher education equity program, which had a particular focus on a number of disadvantaged groups, including people from non-English speaking backgrounds. As a result of what was done through those programs some significant things were achieved. We did achieve demonstrable improvements in educational participation rates by people from non-English speaking backgrounds. There is a particular problem with literacy. We acknowledged that that was something that needed to be addressed. But what on earth is the rationale for implementing a measure like this which denies educational income support to some of the most potentially educationally disadvantaged people by virtue of their lack of English as a first language? What possible rationale can there be for this measure? How can the government justify it in terms of all the other rhetoric it engages in on these matters? There is a longer term agenda of the government in the whole area of student income support spelled out in this year's budget. The government announced that it was going to explore the option of consolidating all youth income support payments under a single so-called youth allowance. The government clearly has in mind there looking at the different kinds of payments that are made to young people-Au study, unemployment payments, et cetera-identifying the least attractive features of each and producing a new payment which is a kind of a levelling down of the provisions of the various existing payments. If you read the discussion paper on the youth allowance that was released, it is very clear that this is its intention. So as well as doing a number of what you might call little nasties in the area of student income support, like the sort of measure we have been talking about this morning which is embodied in this bill, I believe the government has a longer term agenda to perpetrate some very big nasties. There is a great deal of scope to do that if you go for that levelling down approach. Having been on the ERe for a number of years, I know the sorts of options that the Department of Finance can cook up. You can identify the most generous aspects of each payment, whether it be Austudy or unemployment payments. For example, Austudy has a rather more generous personal income test than unemployment payments and it also has a personal income test that operates on an annualised basis rather than on a fortnightly basis. One of the options which was canvassed in this discussion paper was: why don't we move to this fortnightly basis and align the arrangements for students and for the unemployed on the basis of the less attractive income testing structure? On the other hand, the criteria for independence from parents are also different. In this respect, the unemployment payments are more generous. You are deemed independent of your parents over the age of 18; whereas if you are a student the age is 22-and the government is proposing to put that up again to 25. Maybe the government would consider levelling down the accessibility of these payments by choosing the least generous of the provisions in regard to deemed independence from parents. When you read the discussion paper on youth allowance that the government issued in the context of the budget, which canvasses the various options, it is very clear that this is precisely the sort of proposition that they have in mind. We are already seeing substantial changes to Austudy-a number of which are highly objectionable and which vary in their budgetary significance. This one is, I suppose, a middle ranking one. The savings it produces are not trivial but they are not that great when compared with the totality of funding going through this program. There are a number of other measures which produce much larger savings that we find objectionable, such as the proposal to increase the age of independence. There is a whole range of things here which will disadvantage a large number of people. It is singularly objectionable that the government would be doing things that would have the consequence of reducing the children to absolute penury, potentially. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Mr Abbott) in responding might like to describe what measures the government will put in place to pick up the needs of these kids that will be reduced to poverty by this sort of measure. I would also ask him to say whether the children of migrants who come here and are unable to support themselves ought to be penalised for the lack of judgment, you might say, of their parents. Is the government suggesting that? If so, the government might like to provide something in the nature of a moral justification for the stance which is being taken in that regard. I do not believe for a minute that there is any moral justification. This, as I said, opens up the prospect of something which in our society we have tried over the years to avoid, and that is the real prospect of a group of people potentially having to go out on the streets and beg, resort to crime or whatever in order to get some kind of capacity to survive. That I think is fundamentally objectionable. We will be voting against this bill both here and in the Senate. Our objections to this legislation are very serious and very profound.  the opportunity today to comment on the Student and Youth Assistance Amendment (Waiting Period) Bill, which has been introduced by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Mr Abbott) in recent sitting weeks. Before I get to my speech, I should respond to the remarks of the previous  Baldwin), who as minister did his level best to achieve his ideological aims in supporting and creating a social security safety net but, unfortunately, was dwarfed by the indifference of the Labor Party to their core supporters over the last 100 years. Sadly, the 13 years of Labor government managed to achieve a significant and growing gap between the rich and the poor. So when the member for Sydney says that the Liberal Party and the National Party want to reduce people to penury-nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, it is the Liberal Party and the National Party that want to build up, support and create the opportunities for people who are currently living in penury after 13 years of Labor government, so that those people can once again hold their heads high and be full contributors to Australian society. Most of the bills that we have debated in this House since returning here after the March election have been about making good on our campaign commitments to the people of Australia. During that campaign, we signalled our intent to introduce a two-year waiting period on social security benefits for newly arrived immigrants. Legislation to make that happen is current\ybcing considered by the parliament. and thIS bili cOllid be ccmsiderccl its adjunct. By Donald Home's definition or aIiyhody else's, Australia is a lucky country but) a- any gambler knows, streaks come to a close and fortune can flee as quickly as it anived··-as probably most of us discovered on Tuesda:' in the Melbourne Cup. It is a mt-asure of our resilience and depth of resources that lady luck stayed with us long enough to survi ve 13 years of Labor's gambling with our money and our future, and long enough to giVE Australians the opportunity to throw that government out of office. .:; ) Australians went to the polls, not dazed by the coalition's promises of an easy jackpot but with the realisation that it was time to stop rolling the dice. In the early morning of 3 March, Labor landed heavily on its head on the footpath outside the casino. The Howard government was elected with a clear mandate for fiscal responsibility. This government will do better because we realise it is not our money we are playing with-it is more than the future of just the government that is at stake. Thus, we on our side of the House, unlike the member for Banks (M!"" Melham), have learned when to say no. Australia has long been a country of which others are envious. Our population has grown rapidly since Federation as immigrants have come to our shores. We have welcomed people from all parts of the globe, and it is only right that we have done so. I believe thai today Australia is the world's most successful immigrant nation, much more successful than the United States or any other immigrant nation. Rather than the melting pot that the United States claims to be or likes to cali itself, I prefer to think of our nation more a"" a wok, with the human ingredients that make up our society contributing but retaining their individual flavours and distinct cultures, while at the same time combining to produce aver) harmonious whole. Immigration has proven to be a very rich and mutually beneficial experience for this country. Traditions, customs and cultures have; been transported across time and oceans, and have become part of a colourful, but seamless, Australian way of life. Our climate, our landscape and our lifestyles have become magnets for those seeking a new life downunder and provided a new backdrop for old ways. This year 74,000 people will make Australia their new home and, given time, will no doubt make their mark on this country as this country will also mark its mark on them. This government is very supportive of and, indeed, entirely committed to the immigration program. As this government is tightening the belt in nearly every area of administration, it is only fitting that entitlements for our immigrants also come under review. Thus, from 1 January next year, new immigrants wishing to study will be subject to a 104-week waiting period before receiving Austudy benefits. Immigration is unlike tourism. Those attempting to entice a tourist to buy a ticket to take the long flight to Australia often dangle a free rental car or a week's accommodation or, in slower periods, even more lucrative bonuses as a carrot to get tourists to Australia. The immigration department, as all members of parliament would know, does not have to go to any lengths to attract customers; the immigration department is always busy. While immigration numbers rise and fall with ever changing conditions around the world, there are always many more people who wish to settle in this country than there are places available to take them. People come to Australia for many reasons. Some are forced by misery, war or oppression in their native lands to look to our shores for dignity and freedom from tyranny which we offer them. But many others come here on a more voluntary basis because they see Australia as a kind of new frontier where they can make a fresh start-and I like to believe that is what our country still is. Others in increasof ing numbers come to Australia in order to reunite with family members who are already settled here. We are a very generous nation, but we have never offered carte blanche rights to immigration. Our policy was, for many years, very restrictive, dangerously so. But over the past quarter of a century that policy has, quite rightly, become blind to colour and creed. Our approach has become non-discriminatory and bipartisan. We have, for a long time, attempted to balance the wishes and aspirations of those looking toward Australia with the needs and desires of those already living here. This bill requires that new arrivals in Australia provide for their own education in the first two years. Our schools and institutions of learning will still be available. But it will be incumbent on families, friends and communities to provide funding for education in those first two years. I believe that this is a very fair initiative, though some might have trouble calling belt tightening an initiative or, for that matter, believing that belt tightening is necessarily fair. Surprisingly, there are people left in Australia who still believe that we have infinite financial resources-and I am sure that the  ber for Banks will prove that in the debate later; certainly, the member for Sydney has already done so. Unhappily, most of them sit in this parliament but, fortunately, most of them sit on the opposition benches-and there are not too many of them left at this time. I do not believe that this measure will prevent anybody who is genuine about wanting to settle in Australia from applying to come here. There are plenty of clubs and associations that impose a waiting time on those seeking to join. Certainly, full membership in the Australia society is something to be sought after and is well worth the wait. I do not believe that this measure will prevent anyone who is serious about getting an education from doing just that. A glance at any list of high achievers in education will reveal not just Anglo-Celtic names but those many derivations. Education is prized in most societies-in some perhaps even more so than it is here. Though this measure will save $6 million this year and double that figure in 1997-98, the primary motivation behind this bill is fairness. With the new rules will also come the exceptions, based once again on fairness. When the member for Sydney asked that associated question, he failed to make any reference to the exceptions that are contained in this bill. Refugees and humanitarian immigrants and their immediate family members will not be subject to the two-year waiting period; therefore, those most needing assistance with new settlement will remain eligible to receive it. Immigrant spouses and fiancees of Australian citizens who have been living in Australia awaiting permanent residency will also be exempt from these new provisions. Those over the age of 18 who unwittingly became unlawful while still children also will not be subject to this legislation; nor will those aged under 21 who lose access to a parental home and financial support after their arrival in Australia. New Zealanders currently are subject to a six-month waiting period for Austudy. Those who settle in Australia after 1 January next year will also be subject to the same two-year waiting period, dated from the day of permanent settlement and not including absences from Australia. This will place them on an equal footing, quite rightly, with immigrants from other nations. There will be widespread support for this measure in the community. Government certainly has a responsibility to ensure that new arrivals to our nation are treated with dignity and respect, and are assisted along the way so that they can take in and eventually contribute to the richness of Australian life. But families and community are even more important than government in this process. This is hardly news to many immigrant groups. I am sure that it is not news to the member for Banks, who I suspect realises this better than most---<:ertainly better than the Labor Party did during its term in office. While disposing of much of their long-held and much discredited dogma, Labor pushed the pork barrel to new limits, believing that government help was more productive than self-help. It believed that, if there were a vote in it, it could find a way to buy it. That attitude was paternalistic and naive in the extreme. People who can would rather help themselves. I do not think the Labor Party understands this any more. March 2 proved that Labor had lost touch with the electorate; that, despite the claims that it knew all the answers, it was just too smart by half. Leadership is an essential quality, and there are times when government should lead and help shape public opinion. But as Labor discovered, listening is just as important as preaching, and immigration is one of those areas where government should always be attuned to the views of the people. By every reliable measure, it seems that the Australian people-and I am grateful that they are-are happy with the general thrust of immigration policy as it has been implemented by successive governments in the last 25 years, both Labor and Liberal. - ut in recent years, as the framework has be'e- twisted and the numbers coming to Australia skewed in favour of family reunion and away from skilled categories, unfortunately there have been pockets of uneasiness in the community caused by hard economic circumstances, certain misunderstandings of the aims and value of our immigration program and the 20 years of major economic reform that has occurred in this country-reform which some would say has been great for the country. But the people themselves feel a much greater sense of insecurity, and perhaps governments have failed in the last 20 years to bring the people along with them. Some, unfortunately, have sought to exploit this. But, as the continued poor showing at the polls by single issue groups and fringe groups indicates, even in the Lindsay by-election, those attempts have been transparent and have found little favour with the average Australian voter and have found favour with only the particularly ignorant. While this government is committed to all areas of immigration policy, including family reunion, we are seeking to restore balance to overall numbers. Australia benefits most, and certainly more quickly, when our intake contains higher levels of skilled migrants. By restoring some balance to this program, there will be less call for government assistance in terms of financial support to guide new arrivals through the initial years of settlement. Thus, as is our position with other income support, this government believes Austudy should be delayed for the first two years of legal residence, except under the circumstances that demand special consideration that I outlined earlier in my contribution. The vast majority of people who come to live in Australia view this nation as an increased opportunity to prosper. They expect to support themselves and to be helped by family and friends already resident here. There is no good reason to lower those expectations. This bill is fair to the people of Australia, to the millions of taxpayers whose contribuand tions make possible a generous immigration program. It is fair to all those who to live in Australia after 1 January next year whose minor sacrifice will barely be noticed as they embark on their exciting life in a land. We who have lived in this country all our lives perhaps do not understand how truly blessed we are. We take for granted things only dreamed of in some other places. For many new immigrants to Australia, some of whom have had the experience of even their most basic freedoms being suppressed by government, it is enough to live free of totalitarian regime. I commend the bill to House.  to oppose the Student and Youth Assistance Amendment (Waiting Period) Bill. I welcome opportunities to discuss the level to Australia and any other issue associated with migration. It is becoming very fashiontell able in Australia to start belting migrants. I found it very interesting listening contribution of the honourable member  coalition government has increased the numtry bers ever so slightly over and above the not figures of the last government.' We hear words that suggest that migrants a great contribution to Australia, and I think they have, but that they need to suffer belt tightening, that they should have more selfdislocation help, that Australia is a wok and that getting Austudy is like joining a club. I find all comments very interesting. Lest anyone be in any doubt, I rise in this debate to give my clear support for migration. As a result of the last election and as a result of some of the government's measures, there is great concern in the community about migration and what migrants are entitled to. When migrants come to Australia in a Qantas aeroplane they are not met by a department of housing official and given keys to new public housing. They are not met by a representative of the Holden or Ford motor companies and given keys to a brand new car. Nor are they met by an officer of the CES told to report to work at a particular location. Yet many people in the community will come believe that all this happens. I think the first thing I would ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for new Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Mr Abbott), who is at the table, is: what is the justification for this? I believe that the report into student financial assistance in 1991 is still the most current parliamentary committee report that reviews Austudy, and here it is. There is not one submission in this to suggest that the children of migrants-and a this is what we are talking about-are somethe how receiving excessive special treatment over and above other Australians. There is not one submission in this report that suggests There is not one conclusion that says that we need to ensure that migrant families and children of migrants go through a special belt of migration tightening exercise. Will the honourable parliamentary secretary the House where the motivation comes from for this? I think the club analogy mayor to the may not be a good analogy, because many for more migrants seek to come than we ever If being able to migrate to this counis a club, it is a very exclusive club. I do attack that. But I think it is ridiculous to suggest it is almost pro forma-those who have made want to come can gain entry. When they do gain entry there is a whole raft of fees they have to pay-for example, costs. In many instances, they have to settle into a country foreign to them, these learn a language foreign to them and make sure their families are not unsettled by the whole process of this huge move. I consider the fact that people want to choose to come to Australia and make this country their own a great honour. What we are saying in this bill is that, whatever we do to the adults in that family, we have to specially target the children. they are eligible for Austudy-that is, if they are in year 11 and 12-and they financially qualify for Austudy, they should not get it two years. If they finish high school in other country and come here and want to do a TAFE course or a university course and they would otherwise be eligible we are saying, 'No, you don't get it.' Frankly, I do not understand why. If the parliamentary secretary were coming here and saying, 'Look, I have cases of great rorting, great abuse of the system, and have to close a loophole,' then I would say, 'Yes, I am willing to listen to your argument and to consider your move.' If he is saying, 'I have some great principle of fairness equity involved here that singles out children and they will be especially benefited by the implementation of this principle,' then again I would say, 'I am prepared to consider it and form an opinion about it.' But no. It really pandering, I think, to a populist view that migrants get it too easy and, therefore, we will not only introduce measures that punish migrant parents but we will target their children. I think it is very trite when members of government get up and say, 'We are really favour of migration. We think migrants are wonderful people. They have made a great contribution to Australia, but we are happy introduce legislation which targets and singles out migrant children.' I think that is a degree of hypocrisy. I think there ought to be some internal consistency in the argument. I know it is only a petty point, but the member for Sturt said that this measure will save $6 million next year and it will double to $12 mi Ilion the year after, as though there is some huge cumulative effect in these measures. Of course, there is not. The year is a part year-that is what $6 million represents-and $12 million is a full year recovery. The increased savings In future years are rather marginal. Will someone from the government rise in this place and say why it is important that the children of migrants who come here to Australia need to be singled out, when every If other citizen and person in this country in a similar financial circumstance would receive assistance to ensure that their children stay on for to year 11 and 12 or to allow them to go on anto further tertiary study? We do not usually argue about it-you are hacking and slashing at Austudy too--for everyone else, but we do for Austudy, about these children. Is it resented on the govern!J.l'int side that often people who come to Australia have a passion about education and that they very much instil this into their children? Is this an attribute of migration that is resented on the we government side? Are you trying to use some of the gambling analogies of the member for Sturt, trying to put some lead in the educational saddlebags of these children? I am and really interested to hear what the parliamigrant mentary secretary will say to that. As far as I am concerned, I see the future of Australia as being one nation. I see it as is one nation with many cultures. I believe that we have benefited from successive waves of migration. Currently, migration numbers are quite low. If there were one thing we could do for all Australians it would be to create more jobs, not reduce the number of jobs being created, as this government is doing. the But, if we want to secure our future, we in cannot isolate young people in the community and say, 'We will have a suboptimal development of your educational potential,' and then to consider that we will be the lucky country and be able to then carry that into the future. The future of Australia really rests on the way we develop opportunities and the way we develop the talents of our young people and ensure that they have got a good start in the world of work and that they will go through periods of further education and re-education. We should not, at such an early point of their introduction to Australia, start raising the first barriers, increasing the difficulties. The other thing I should point out-perhaps I have not made this clear-is that not every family that comes to Australia as migrants with children of an age perhaps eligible to receive Austudy would receive Austudy or would seek to receive Austudy. Why are we saying that in Australia we can only take people who are effectively, I suppose, fairly wealthy and not give them the start to life in Australia that they might otherwise secure? I will not speak any longer, but I just want to go over the pointsMr Abbott-Come on, Roger, I was enjoying that.  listen to your contribution. Is there a more current review of Austudy than the student financial assistance report? Perhaps I should read out to the parliamentary secretary the names of some of the members of the coalition who were on the committee. The member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) was the deputy chairman of the committee. The Deputy Leader of the National Party, the member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), was on the committee, as were the member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott). This was a total review of Austudy which did not get a favourable response when the report was tabled. Most of its recommendations were subsequently implemented. There was not one submission about the need to target migrant children and deny them Austudy benefits-not one submission. It is not mentioned in the report and it was not drawn to the committee's attention. It was not this that motivated you. What did? Are there some rorts in the system that you want to crack down on? If not, what is the great principle here? What do you expect as a result of these measures? If the bill through this place-and it will because you will ruthlessly wheel out the numbers-and if it goes through the Senate, what will be its impact? Has your department provided advice about the impact of the measures? We know the financial impact, and you are required to put that down with the bill. But what will be the social impact? Will it make no difference? Will everyone who is currently proposing to go on to year 11 and year 12 or embark on a university education continue to do so? Will that be the case? Will there be a drop off? How many will drop off? In what way will the social impact-we know about the economic impact-be of benefit to Australia or benefit to those families? How will electorates like mine, with about 26 per cent of people having a migrant background, benefit from this measure? Can you tell us a direct social benefit? Alternatively, isn't it a fact, as the shadow minister suggested, that this can have adverse social consequences-that, rather than going to school, some may be precluded from going to school and that we will see a greater incidence of gangs? Is that what the government is intending for electorates like mine? If that is the case, I strongly object to this bill, personally and on behalf of all my constituents. Let us hear from the government from the high moral ground. I oppose this bill.",13
2,Dr SOUTHCOTT,STUDENT AND YOUTH ASSISTANCE,"This education bill raises an important question. It raises an important principle: what should be the role of Austudy? For me, surely the role of Austudy is to improve access to education in an equitable fashion. It is interesting to note that during Labor's 13 years there was little advance in the share of students from lower socio-economic backgrounds entering higher education. I believe that Austudy should be targeted to those from less affluent backgrounds who cannot rely on family support or supplementary incomes if that government support is withdrawn. But, without better targeting, we are really letting down those from lower socio-economic status backgrounds. As part of its election policy commitments, the government announced its intention to goes introduce a two-year waiting period before newly arrived migrants could access certain social security payments, and that policy was extended to AU'study as part of the 1996 budget measures. There can be little doubt that the 1996 budget will make the federal government's student assistance schemes fairer and provide a more efficient use of taxpayers' money. Austudy now will be better targeted. The changes to Austudy, Abstudy and the assistance for isolated children's scheme ensure that students and families who have a genuine need for financial assistance benefit the most. I believe it is important to place on the record at the beginning of my comments in support of this bill my high regard and admiration for the dedication and purpose of all those who have migrated to this country and who, in the face of all those difficulties and obstacles that come with migration, have excelled in their chosen field of study.  tioned the 1991 report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training into student financial assistance. It is fair to say that origins of this bill can be traced back to that report. That report highlighted the relative ease with which high income earners could distort their taxable income and therefore enable dependants to receive Austudy. In an article in the Australian on 12 April 1991, Lenore Taylor wrote about students who were in receipt of Austudy 'driving to university in their Volvos'. Many members would be aware of anecdotal evidence of this sort of thing. It is very interesting to look at some of the postcode areas and consider what percentage of university students living in those postcode areas are receiving Austudy. If you look at Melbourne, you see that 89 per cent of university students from areas like Springvale are receiving Austudy; in Sunshine, 79 per cent of university students; in Richmond, 92 per cent of university students; and in Footscray, 97 per cent of university students. That is great. Now I will compare that with other areas where students are receiving Austudy: Toorak, 33 per cent; Malvern, 41 per cent; Kew, 43 per cent; and Balwyn, 45 per cent. I am not suggesting that in the electorate of the member for Higgins (Mr Costello) there are not some people who legitimately deserve Austudy. I am not suggesting there are not some university students who really should have Austudy-it is hard to say without more evidence-but my inclination would be to say that it just might be possible that, in Malvern, there could be some university students who, if Austudy were withdrawn, would be able to find either additional family support or an alternative source of income. I believe what is really important is that Austudy should be better targeted. It is interesting to look at Cabramatta where the situation is very similar. For example, in Cabramatta 84 per cent of university students are receiving Austudy, and in St Ives and Killara the levels are 31 per cent and 27 per cent respectively. It is interesting to note that, of the 2,600 Vietnamese students enrolled at New South Wales universities last year, almost a third came from around the working class Cabramatta area. Today we are debating a reasonable bill. the This bill is in accordance withJ:¥ equity and efficiency measures that this government is seeking to implement in all portfolio concerns. In the same way that we are seeking to expose and discontinue the fOrts of Australian middle-class parents, so too we are eager to expose and discontinue the loopholes that have existed for overseas parents. It needs to be continually remembered and stressed that the correct role for government in providing financial assistance to students-the correct role for Austudy-is to assist those on low incomes, those people who without Austudy would find it very difficult to gain access to higher education. Writing in the journal People and Place in 1994, Ian Dobson, associate to the deputy vice-chancellor, made the simple but valid point that the requirement that overseas born students who do not hold permanent resident status pay a full fee, varying from $9,000 to $25,000 per year, gives such students an incentive to obtain permanent resident status. Later that year, Dobson co-authored a followup article with Bob Birrell, Director of the Centre for Population and Urban Research at Monash University, and made the following statement: The financial advantages to obtaining resident status (relative to full fee overseas students status) are considerable. Residents contribute to their tertiary education via the Higher Education Contribution Scheme . . . Students can either pay this contribution up front to receive a 25 per cent discount ... or defer their liability to be repaid (on a sliding scale) via the taxation system ... However, should a student decide to pay via the deferred tax option, then leave Australia on the completion of their course, they may make no contribution at all. Such situations have come to be known as the astronaut phenomenon; that is, affluent parents returning to their native country after being granted Australian permanent residency status, leaving their children behind to gain a discounted tertiary education. It is a matter of regret that some wealthy overseas-born parents have manipulated Australia's migration program to obtain HECS places and Austudy for their offspring. In February last year, the West Australian reported a spokesman for the then Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, one Ross Free, as saying: It is a worry ... We want Austudy to go into the hands of the right people. Payments could be a little more generous if those not entitled to it were not receiving it. I do not know Mr Free personally. I have heard his name mentioned in this House over the last couple of months, but I could not agree more with his spokesman. The true role of Austudy is to target it at those who really need it. For every person the government gives shelter to who really does not need it, someone else is left out in the cold. A safety net is vital. It has been important over the last century, but it should not be confused with a blanket that is so encompassing that it actually smothers. Writing in People and Place in 1994, Bob Birrell and Ian Dobson examined the issue of Austudy dependence amongst students in Australia and were forced to conclude that there exists a significant loophole in the Austudy system. They wrote: When persons claiming AUSTUDY report that their parents live overseas Austudy officers require the applicant to produce income and asset records from the home country. Also, parents living in Australia are required to declare income and assets held overseas. Compliance is far more difficult in those cases than it is in cases where people draw an income only in Australia and who hold assets only in Australia. In those cases Australian tax records and certifying accountants are involved. In cases involving foreign income and assets, Austudy officers have to depend on unreliable foreign tax records for income records and on certifications by foreign accountants specified by the applicant for asset records. So, in effect, compliance is largely voluntary. Short of investing substantial funds in overseas inspections, there is not much that the Australian government can do to rectify the situation. That is what Birrell and Dobson said. It has been calculated the Commonwealth government allocates almost $1.5 billion in Austudy benefits each year to students in universities, TAFE colleges and government and nongovernment schools. In the Australian of 1 July this year, Dobson and Birrell, referring to their previous research, wrote that 12 per cent of the age eligible students attending the top category of private schools were receiving Austudy. In addition, Dobson and Birrell said: (I)n 1995, 49 per cent of Malaysia-born and 55 per cent of Hong-Kong-born university students were receiving Austudy, yet most were recently arrived, from relatively affluent backgrounds (and in many cases likely to leave Australia on completion of their degrees). Indeed, only 4 per cent of both the Malaysian and Hong Kong students were living in low SES postcode areas. That is the lower 25 per cent of postcode areas. The authors continued: Part of the problem is that Austudy eligibility is based on taxable income, thus opening up opportunities for affluent families who can arrange their finances to minimise their taxable income. In the case of overseas-born students, the problem is that Austudy officials have difficulty assessing the financial situation of families with income or assets overseas. This problem could be solved by refusing access to Austudy to recently arrived migrants, as with the two year waiting period the Coalition is seeking to implement for welfare payments. I welcome overseas students to Australia. I believe that they have made an enormous contribution to Australian life and Australian society. The introduction of the Colombo Plan in 1950 had an enormously far-reaching impact in our region and in Australia, and it accelerated Australia's orientation, engagement and role in Asia. It is interesting to note that several ministers from governments in Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia received their education on Australian campuses. They would have had much experience of life in Australia. The interaction of overseas students with young Australians over the last half century has witnessed Australians and Asians for the first time learning side by side and forming personal relationships. The consequent heightened awareness of Asia amongst Australians of that generation has underpinned Australia's engagement in our region. It has underpinned the changes that we have seen in Australian society over the last 50 years in moving from being a predominantly European society to one that is much more diverse. In my view, it is a diversity that has been achieved by a remarkable degree of tolerance. I believe that plan was enormously far-sighted because personal relationships that are formed between people studying, people interacting and people working together are just as important in forming ties with a region as relationships between heads of state and government. I am very proud to have been at Adelaide University during a great expansion in the overseas student program. It was as president of the Medical Students Society that I welcomed many of the students that we had coming from Malaysia as fee paying students. It was a very positive thing for the university. Australia now has the ability to offer quality education to students in our region but at a premium to that available in the United States. I believe that this measure will not discourage those overseas students-and I previously mentioned some cases in an article-who want to come to Australia, but it will close this loophole whereby people can receive Austudy and then never pay their HECS back by getting permanent resident status. This bill introduces a two-year or 104-week waiting period for access to Austudy, which will apply, with limited exceptions, to all migrants who arrive in Australia on or after 1 July 1997. The present six-month period will continue to apply to New Zealand citizens who permanently settle in Australia before 1 January 1997. It is important to note that this bill makes special provision for migrants who are New Zealand citizens because, unlike other migrants who must hold a permanent visa to settle permanently in Australia, New Zealand citizens enter Australia on a special category visa which entitles them to remain here indefinitely. In other words, a special category does not distinguish between entry as a permanent settler and entry in a temporary capacity. However, it is intended that as far as practicable migrants from New Zealand should have the two-year waiting period applied to them in the same manner it is applied to migrants from other countries. Recently, I received a letter from the Flinders University Postgraduate Students Association wherein the author attacked-much in the same way as the member for Sydney (Mr Peter Baldwin) and the memsea for Chifley did this morning-the government for introducing the bill we are currently debating. The association argued: Access to education and training is of vital importance for migrant people who often have difficulties obtaining employment after arrival in this country. It would seem absolutely contradictory for the government to deny new migrants in their first two years the financial means to obtain the education and training needed to gain employment and to fully participate in society. The reservation contained in this statementnamely, 'it would seem ... contradictory'-is wisely observed. The member for Chifley spoke about there being a lack of evidence on the performance of the offspring of migrants who have come to Australia. I point out to him that in the August 1995 edition of the Bureau of Immigration Research Bulletin, Dr Siew Ean Khoo commented on the report that she had co-written entitled The second generation in Australia: educational and occupational characteristics. In her report, Dr Khoo explains how the 1991 census reveals what was largely already suspected anecdotallythat is, it is actually the second generation Australians of non-English speaking origins who are achieving the educational credentials well beyond their parents' generation and indeed their parents' generation's expectations. This should come as no surprise. This is something that I welcome. The member for Chifley was right when he said that there can be enormous dislocation for some migrants when they come to Australia. That is true. It is not as if a migrant arrives on our shores and suddenly decides that he is going to go to university and go to law school, that he is going to go to universiour ty and do some professional course or that he is going to go to university and do a BA. There is a period of adjustment. Introducing a two-year waiting period for access to Austudy will close that loophole, which I mentioned earlier, for some overseas students, but it will be fairer in that it will allow Austudy to be better targeted at those who need it. It is a sensible measure. That same report found that those second generation Australians of non-English speaking origins were outstripping third or earlier generation Australians of the same age group in the area of academic achievement and excellence. That is something which all members of this House should be proud of. We are a nation of migrants. It is significant that the children of migrants can outperform those early arrivals. That is something that should be welcomed. The member for Sydney said that this was one of the nasties contained in the budget. This is not a big measure in the budget. The number of people it will pick up is relatively small. That is evidenced by the fact that it will reduce outlays by $6 million this year and approximately $12 million over the next two years. I commend this bill to the House.",24
3,Mr ABBOTT,STUDENT AND YOUTH ASSISTANCE,"Warringah-Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs) (10.52 a.m.)-in reply-The Student and Youth Assistance Amendment (Waiting Period) Bill denies Austudy to most migrants until they have been here for two years. In other words, it extends to Austudy the same waiting period which the government proposes to also have in place for Department of Social Security benefits. Australia is an immigrant society. We always have been and we always will be. It is worth remembering that some 40,000 or 50,000 years ago--no-one knows exactly when-the Aborigines migrated here from somewhere in Asia. Two hundred years ago a group of people came here from England. Every year since then, migrants have been arriving in Australia, enriching our culture and boosting our economy. Immigration adds an heroic dimension to national life. Immigration gives us something of the same spirit which the Statue of Liberty exudes over the American nation'Bring us your poor, your huddled masses.' We are a less demonstrative people than the Americans but arguably a more successful society because we do not bring immigrants here to dump them in ghettos and we do not bring immigrants here to leave them on the bottom rung of the socio-economic ladder. This bill maintains the generous traditions of Australian society because it exempts from that two-year waiting period all those who come here as refugees and under special humanitarian programs. No-one who is already here will be ambushed by this measure; it only applies to people who arrive after 1 January 1997. I should also point out that, in drafting this bill, the government has taken into account some of the useful suggestions made by the opposition in the minority Senate report into the relevant DSS legislation. This bill also maintains the best traditions of our migrants, who have always understood that hard work and commitment to Australia is the secret of success. When the First Fleet disgorged its motley crew on to the shores of Botany Bay and then Sydney Cove 200 or so years ago it was not a very auspicious start to the modem Australian nation. Those people were chosen by the finest judges in England, yet within 100 years they had built a nation that was the envy of the earth. They had built a nation that had the highest standard of living on earth. They did not do it by going on welfare. They did not do it by taking Austudy. They did it by rolling up their sleeves and getting on with things. In more recent times migrants from many different countries-from much more diverse sources-have perpetuated those great traditions. Particularly our Asian migrants in recent times have recalled us to the great traditions of small business, of the extended family and of loyalty to one another that perhaps we in Australia were in danger of forgetting. Migrants to this country have done us proud and they have done themselves proud. Both those things have occurred because of the hard work and the commitment that they have shown, and that is why most migrants support the provisions of this bill. I tum briefly to some of the comments of members opposite. I have a lot of sympathy  Baldwin) because time and again over the last few months he has been forced to come into this parliament and criticise policies of the new government which are essentially extensions of the principles begun by the former government. The member for Sydney has tried to tell the parliament that it is fine to restrict migrant access to the major DSS benefits for six months but it is in some way evil, wrong and immoral to restrict migrant access to Austudy for two years. It is terrible, shocking, unjust and wrong to have a twoyear waiting period but, of course, it was absolutely sensible and right to have a sixmonth waiting period. The problem that members opposite have is that they have only discovered this sacred principle that migrants should be entitled to every form of benefit immediately on their arrival since they became the opposition. That forces one to the conclusion that they do not really believe it.  people, Tony. We are talking about students.  kids?",28
4,Mr ABBOTT,STUDENT AND YOUTH ASSISTANCE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I listened in perfect silence to the contributions of members opposite. I think they could extend the same courtesy to the government. We made it very clear pre-election that we thought there should be a general two-year waiting period for benefits. This bill is part of Barresi, P. A. implementing that commitment. Indeed, it was the former government which tried to say that only Australian citizens should be entitled to get Austudy. We are saying that people should get Austudy only after they have been in this country for two years-that is, at a time when they are entitled to become Australian citizens. Both the member for Sydney and the  House that this bill would produce utter penury, utter poverty and utter destitution amongst migrants. Let us make it very clear that this bill applies only to migrants who do not come in under the humanitarian or refugee programs. Migrants who do come in under the general categories are ail, one way or another, supposed to be able to support themselves because they have money, because they have jobs or because they have relatives. If their circumstances change, they will be entitled to DSS benefits. It is as simple as that. For members opposite to talk about poverty, penury and destitution is simple scaremongermg. They are trying to scare and terrify the very people who they say they are trying to protect. .- II Listening to members opposite, I am reminded of the words of one of the first great migrant leaders-the prophet Moses-who said to the people of Israel, 'Sit on your asses and I will lead you to the promised land.' Members opposite seem to be saying, 'Sit on your asses and you're in the promised land.' Quite frankly, it utterly demeans our migrants and it utterly sells Australia short.

5,Mr MELHAM,HINDMARSH ISLAND BRIDGE BILL,"As we have said throughout this debate, there is no need for the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill 1996. This bridge could be built tomorrow if the government wanted it, and they know it. A few things need to be said at this stage, in fairness to some of the things that have been said in this debate. The first thing I want to do is praise the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mrs Gallus), who was attacked NA yesterday by the member for Moore (Mr Filing), I think quite disgracefully, when he said: Unfortunately, the then shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs did not do herself proud by the fact that she refused to take the disallowance motion through this House after it had been passed by the shadow cabinet which, at the end of the day, was an obligation required of the then shadow minister, the member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan). I think the then shadow minister should be praised because what her then shadow cabinet was doing was giving her a poisoned chalice, just as this legislation is a poisoned chalice for the current Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron). There is no need for this legislation. There is no need for this parliament to take sides. There is no need for some of the debate that some of the speakers have engaged in, PAIRS attacking one side or the other. The former minister for Aboriginal affairs, Robert Tickner, was an honourable member of parliament. He was an honourable minister. I have no hesitation in saying he is a good friend of mine. He will be remembered well by the indigenous community. History will treat him well. This government that attacked him when he was minister for not following due process now brings this legislation into the House, not wanting to follow due process. This government that attacked him for taking sides now wants to take sides. It is being inconsistent. The former minister was honourable and he has an admirable track record. In relation to the Ngarrindjeri women, I have met with them and I have visited the Hindmarsh Island area. There is no need for this parliament to sit in judgment of them or on either side of the equation. It is not necessary. It does not help the debate when we have the pious language that was used in the debate last evening and the day before. Justice Mathews says at page 12 of her report: Section 10 does not require that a declaration be made if the preconditions of Section lO(l)(b) are met. Far from it. The Minister's powers are entirely discretionary . Justice Mathews says that because the government is not providing a female minister, and because of Tickner and Western Australia, the women withdrew the limited, restricted knowledge they gave. She also says in her report: In the absence of restricted women's knowledge, other issues assume much greater significance under the application . . . All these matters are discussed extensively in chapters 8 and 9 of the report. After considering them carefully I have concluded that whilst they may well make the area a 'significant Aboriginal area', there is insuf-cient material from which the Minister could be satIsfied that the building of the Hindmarsh Island bridge would desecrate this area according to these traditions. Justice Mathews found that, notwithstanding the obstacles that this government has placed in front of those women. She also found in relation to the credibility of the women, and it is important to put it on the record in view of some of the comments that have been made. Concerning the sincerity of the applicants, she says: It is necessary as a preliminary matter to assess the applicants' sincerity when they say that the .Hindmarsh Island area is significant for them, particularAnd ly as the dissident women in the Royal Com-ssion generally disclaimed any knowledge of the Isla-d as a significant place. And I must say that m general I was satisfied of the genuineness of most of the people who made oral submissions to me when they asserted the significance of this area to them. Further on, at page 123, she says: I also accept that the applicants' opposition to the building of the Hindmarsh Island bridge is, in general, based upon a genuine b-lief - hat the Hindmarsh Island/Goolwa area, mcludmg the bridge corridor area, is of great traditional significance to Ngarrindjeri people. When I met the women, I found them sincere. When I went to Hindmarsh Island, I found them sincere. I do not need to make a judgment; this parliament does not need to make a judgment. I do not need to make a judgment in relation to the dissident women either. I won't and I never will. I res- their views. I respect the different views of everyone in this debate. But do not come in here in a pious, sanctimonious way and try to claim superiority of one group over the other. That is not the way to go. Justice Mathews also blew the lid on the royal commission's finding. She found after forensic testing that Mrs Fisher's account, which she wrote in the late 1960s or early 1970s, was vindicated.",30
6,Mr FILING,NOES,"I detected that was a reasonably wide-ranging set of comments made by the member for Banks (Mr Melham). I reiterate some of the points that I made yesterday in the second reading debate. The first of these points, as I mentioned in the first instance in that debate, is that the secret women's business proved to be a political forgery. The member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) is here at the table. I made the observation at the time that if you could be politically hanged on more than one occasion-which is probably the truth in the case of politics-he was hanged for an offence that he could not possibly have committed. In fact, he took what most members would consider was an honourable course of action, which was to resign to prevent at the time the so-called embarrassment to the opposition of a set of papers that were clearly concocted to achieve a particular objective. that objective was quite clear. The concoction of those papers was to provide the basis on which Mr Tickner, the then Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, could issue an order preventing the construction of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge for 25 years. The member for Banks, as I mentioned yesterday, may well be sincerely representing his philosophical viewpoints or the philosophical viewpoints of some of the Labor Party, but it is quite clear, in my view, that the Labor Party is divided on this issue. The Labor Party, I would say, would consider this--certainly the ones who are rational thinkers in the Labor Party would considerto have been one of the blackest moments in its more recent political history. It used a political forgery to mount a political attack on the member for Barker and, I might add, in order to support a decision by a minister to issue an order based on no evidence whatsoever. In fact, the then minister not only relied on the forgery on which to base his argument but actually did not look at it. Not only is that incompetent but he neglected his duty to the Commonwealth, to the rest of the community, to exercise his powers as a minister in a responsible manner. The purpose of this bill, in essence, is to facilitate the very process for which this forgery was concocted to prevent. I made the observation yesterday-and I will perhaps strengthen that observation because there was a hypocritical element in this-that the process was under way whilst there was a Labor state government in South Australia. It was only when the Liberal government was elected as the government of South Australia that we saw the move towards the blocking of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge construction. The member for Barker, as he has mentioned on other occasions, as the local member did not personally favour the construction of the bridge. But he took on the case and, as a consequence of his actions, the then coalition shadow executive supported a disallowance motion in relation to the minister's order. At the time, there was an extraordinary campaign in the media based on this lie, the women's business, which was used to vilify a member representing the interests of constituents. Of course, the irony of all this is that, because of the actions of the Bannon and Arnold Labor governments, the South Australian government inherited a substantial financialliability. So we have this supreme hypocrisy that the previous Labor state administration, having launched the construction of the bridge, used the Labor Party federal minister in this way to prevent the construction of the bridge and, as I say, at the time incurred potentially a financial liability of many millions of dollars. (Time expired) Clauses agreed to. Proposed new clause 2A.",31
7,Mr MELHAM,NOES,"I move: (1) Page 1, after clause 2, insert the following new clause: 2A Racial Discrimination Act to prevail (1) For the avoidance of doubt, it is expressly declared to be the intention of the Parliament that the terms of the Racial Discrimination Act shall prevail over the provisions of this Act. (2) Nothing in this Act shall be taken to authorise any conduct, whether legislative, executive or judicial, that is inconsistent with the operation of the Racial Discrimination Act. This amendment will be seconded by my colleague the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr). I move this amendment because, sadly, the word of the government cannot be trusted. More significantly, the word of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) cannot be trusted. It is not what you say; it is what you do. You say all the right things, but you do all the wrong things. Coalition policy states that it will respect the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act. That is all this amendment does. The first question I as a shadow minister asked the Prime Minister in this parliament was: My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister give a commitment to this House that the government will not seek to repeal, suspend or override the Racial Discrimination Act of 1975? The opening words of the Prime Minister were: The government has no plans to introduce any amendments to the Racial Discrimination Act ... In response to other questions that he has been asked and in other speeches that he has made, the Prime Minister has said that the government will respect the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act. Our objection to this bill is that it does not respect the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act. It is not consistent with the Racial Discrimination Act, nor has the government in its own proceedings presented it in such a way. On the day before this legislation was introduced the minister sent us a copy and a copy of legal advice on a confidential basis. That legal advice was prepared without the bill being sighted. What is interesting is the minister then issued a press release. He says in the press release that it is not retrospective and that the legislation is not racially discriminatory because it does not stop anyone applying for a protection declaration. He said in his letter to the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) on 16 October: As you will see from the Bill, I have also taken account of your concerns about retrospectivity and the Racial Discrimination Act. The Bill is consistent with the RDA and is not retrospective. What is interesting is that those words are not repeated in the bill or in the second reading speech of the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles), who presented this bill in the House. I am saying that they were intentionally not included in the second reading speech, and the situation is that those words are not mirrored in the legislation. They are not present in the second reading speech because paragraph l5AB(2)(f) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, on use of extrinsic material in the interpretation of an act, says: the speech made to a House of the Parliament by a Minister on the occasion of the moving by that Minister of a motion that the Bill containing the provision be read a second time in that House; In other words, in interpreting this bill the courts can have a look at the second reading speech of the minister presenting the bill. That is why there is nothing in there about retrospectivity. That is why there is nothing in the second reading speech about the RDA. The government is relying on the latter act overriding the earlier act. That is not consistency. You only have to have a look at what the Parliamentary Research Service says: The general view is that the Commonwealth Parliament is a sovereign Parliament and thus may enact later legislation which derogates from or repeals an earlier statute. In relation to retrospectivity, it says: In any event, even if the Bill had a retrospective effect, there appears to be no bar on the Commonwealth making retrospective legislation. The Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge), who is at the table, let the cat out of the bag in his reply last night. He said-and he was indebted to the minister who had given him advice on the matter: If the amendment were totally benign, perhaps we could look at it differently. What the amendment does is - i.e primacy to the Racial Discrimination Act and that is consistent with what it should be. We should not be passing legislation intentionally or unintentionally that cuts away from the Racial Discrimination Act. This is a discriminatory bill. This is a bill that overrides the Racial Discrimination Act. It is not consistent with it. That is why the government has not put those words in the second reading speech. (Time expired)",32
8,Mr KERR,NOES,"Denison) (11.26 a.m.)Notwithstanding that a seconder is not required, I am delighted to speak as if I were a seconder of this amendment. It is important for this parliament to recognise the context in which this amendment is moved. It is moved in a context where we say essentially this whole package of legislation is quite unnecessary. The only reason to bring this legislation before the parliament is, as Mr Filing suggests, to attribute blame. It is a partisan act whose political motive is transparent but in effect it undoes one of the areas where this government had had some moral authority. It had some moral authority because, in its undertakings to this House, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) had said that it never had the intention of undermining the Racial Discrimination Act or to be in conflict with it. In statements before this bill was drafted and brought before the House undertakings were given and legal advice was available that it was not inconsistent with the RDA. The Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge), who represents the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron), assures us that the advice the government now has is that the act is not inconsistent with the RDA, yet like a vampire from a cross the government shies away from putting into the act something that simply says what it has been saying publicly-that this act is not inconsistent with the RDA. Mr MCLachlan-It is not necessary.",33
9,Mr KERR,NOES,"The Minister for Defence interjects and says that it is not necessary. The point is that this whole legislative package is totally unnecessary. The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs could now give authorisation for that bridge to proceed. In fact, had the minister acted expeditiously-and there is a request for authorisation which has been before him for some considerable time-the bridge could have been built now. It could have been going ahead now. This delay is entirely the government's responsibility and any responsibility that flows from it should be sheeted home to the government that wishes to bring legislation into this parliament so it can point a finger an opposition and say, 'You are the persons who remain responsible for the delay.' That is an appalling state of events. I want to say simply as a lawyer that it is entirely implausible to say, 'This legislation is consistent, but we will not in the second reading speech or in the explanatory memorandum commit ourselves in any way to a statement which has that impact.' It is also implausible for the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres· Strait Islander Affairs in this House to say, 'If this were benign, if it had no effect of overriding the Racial Discrimination Act, then we might have accepted your amendment.' The implausibility, the inconsistency and the legal stupidity of that position is so transparent that it does not need somebody such as me, who once had the dignity and honour of this parliament of being the Attorney-General and the Minister for Justice, to point that out. It does not need anybody. Any two-bob lawyer who has just come out of university would be able to make the obvious connection that, if you say there is a complete consistency with the RDA, you should have no objection to placing within the legislation something which makes that transparently clear. But you shy away from anything in the second reading speech or in the explanatory memorandum that gives effect to the legal interpretation that the government says it has. Then you say that, if this regulation was benign, you would accept it. You are basically arguing both sides at the same time. It is implausible; it is foolish. It is against a background where this whole legislative approach is completely unnecessary. It is driven for political motivations and reveals a contempt for the people that the government is purporting to represent who actually want the bridge to go ahead.",34
10,Mr ALBANESE,NOES,"I wish to speak again in this debate about the failure of the government to accept the amendment put forward by the opposition with regard to the Racial Discrimination Act. It seems to me extraordinary that this occurs just one week after we have a bipartisan at resolution carried by this parliament, talking about commitment to reconciliation, talking about commitment to anti-discrimination, talking about commitment to multiculturalism and talking about the opposition of this parliament tQ the increased climate of racism. This increased climate of racism has been engendered by the first speech of the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), and then by the subsequent failure of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to show leadership on the racism issue. Added to that we have had the arguments put forward by the Prime Minister, firstly, on free speech which gave encouragement and the green light to those racist elements in our society to vilify and to attack the most vulnerable members of our society. Secondly, we had the Prime Minister talking about how the education system should not make us feel guilty. It was as if the invasion and occupation of Australia 200 years ago was not resisted by anybody. He said that in the education process in our schools we should not cover the real history of Australia. In the context of that debate, for this parliament not to accept the amendment moved by the member for Banks (Mr Melham), supporting the Racial Discrimination Act and saying that the Racial Discrimination Acteffectively Australia's bill of rights-should not be overridden by this legislation, sends a reactionary message out there to all of our constituents which is in stark contrast with the message which this parliament in a bipartisan way attempted to send last week. The government's justification for knocking back these amendments to the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill-they would accept them if these amendments were benign-suggests that there is something discriminatory about the way the bill is framed. You cannot have it both ways. This whole legislation, as we have pointed out last night and again today, is unnecessary. Hindmarsh bridge can go ahead. There is no need for this legislation to be pursued at all. But then, on top of that, to oppose the amendment put forward by the member for Banks really shows a lack of judgment on behalf of the government. The member for Moore (Mr Filing) might not think there is a debate going out there about race and in particular related to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, but we all know that is not the case.",34
11,Mr FILING,NOES,You should have been here in the last parliament. You would then know what it is all about.,35
12,Mr ALBANESE,NOES,"The member for Moore was here in the last parliament in different colours. He is back again; he has the right to put that view. But on the issue of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders I think it is important that we reach as much common ground between the political parties as is humanly possible. A step forward would be for the government to support the amendment moved by the member for Banks; a step backward would be for the government to oppose it, because that will send all the wrong messages. (Time expired)",35
13,Mr FILING,NOES,"I wanted to make a couple of observations on the comments of the previous speaker, the member for Grayndler (Mr Albanese). This must be one of the most inquired into applications and processes that have been around in recent political history. Quite clearly, the legislation is necessary because of the advice received by the government from the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) that, in order for the Hindmarsh bridge to be built, it would require another report. Then there are all the other ancillary legal issues that arise from that. Having been accomplices to the most outrageous political fraud in recent Australian history, the Labor Party are now trying to save face. They acknowledge the fact that this, in essence, was one of the most unsavoury episodes in its last term of government. The former minister lost hi§, !fat because he lost credibility, and one of the reasons he lost credibility was over this whole fiasco. The fact of the matter is that, at the end of the day, we saw the concoction of a fraud, a forgery, to be used as a political weapon in a divisive and calculated way-in a way that undermined substantially the credibility of what was then the process of reconciliation, a cross-party process to which the Labor Party continually refers but gives lip-service at times when it wants to make political capital out of something quite as sad as this. The previous speaker made some comments on the race debate and the joint house statement, and all the rest of it. Frankly, there is nothing more calculated to undermine the process of reconciliation, the process of improving community relations between indigenous people and the rest of the community, than the sort of process we have seen in relation to the Hindmarsh Island Bridge affair. Quite clearly, this matter has got so long in the tooth that there is nothing more the government can do other than to enact legislation that empowers the construction of the bridge. As was pointed out in the second reading speech of the minister in the Senate, which I commend for reading to the shadow minister: The minister has considered appointing another reporter ... While this appears to be the process least likely to cause concern, the recent history of the administration of the actobviously will 'be no guarantee of a satisfactory outcome' and will cause 'potentially further substantive costs to the taxpayer'. The problem is that we have a process that has taken an extraordinary amount of time to be satisfactorily resolved. We know that there are a number of ways in which people could delay this issue further. It has cost the taxpayat er an extraordinary, extortionate amount of money in order to be able to get to this stage. Now we are in the process of trying to resolve this fiasco from the previous government's use of ministerial powers and ministerial order to prevent the process of construction. I have sat and read the amendment of the member for Banks (Mr Melham). I have given it proper consideration. All I can say to him is: I am not acting in some way that is toeing a party line or as a cipher. But I cannot in all honesty see this as anything other than a face-saving exercise for an opposition that is totally discredited on this issue. In my view-and I know that the member for Banks will probably disagree with this-all I can say is that, from recent public comment on the matter, it is evident there is a division of opinion in the Labor Party in relation to the Hindmarsh Island Bridge affair, and this is a face-saving device to try to give the best possible gloss on this absolutely unsavoury episode. If I had been a member of the Labor Party and the Labor government at the time, as was the member for Banks, I would shy away from this as much as possible because this will go down, as I mentioned yesterday, as one of the great political forgeries in modem times and anybody associated with supporting it would have to have, I think, some very serious problems with their political judgment.",35
14,Mr MELHAM,NOES,"I think the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) would be better off putting his police uniform back on; his legal uniform is sadly not appropriate for him because it was a bush lawyer's opinion that he offered us. I think his opinion is held in good faith and that he is genuine in relation to that. But I must say that he is better off sticking to police aspects rather than legal aspects. This is what I had to say during the racial tolerance debate, a motion that was unanimously carried by this parliament. I said: The Racial Discrimination Act of 1975 is special to all of us. It is pleasing that all sides of this House have in their policy respect for the principles of this act. This act is our bill of rights. This act makes us all equal. As parliamentarians, we should all times strive to maintain the principles behind this motion and every subsequent piece of legislation in this parliament should respect the Racial Discrimination Act. And why shouldn't it? Otherwise, the resolution that we passed last week can be discounted quite properly as weasel words-as, 'Yes, we can say this but we do not really mean it.' If the government accepts our amendment, it will be a clear demonstration. We have been given assurances; we do not accept the assurances. The government says one thing and its actions reveal another. The very fact is that the minister let the cat out of the bag. He was given advice from the actual minister. He said: ... I am indebted to the minister who has given me advice on this matter. Further: If the amendment were totally benign, perhaps we could look at it differently. The amendment is a serious amendment; it says that the parliament should respect the Racial Discrimination Act-and if they are not prepared to support that, what does it say? It lets the cat out of the bag because it says that they are not all that confident that their legislation is not discriminatory. What they are confident of is that the later legislation will prevail. That is what they are saying. They say that it is consistent with the Racial Discrimination Act; we say that it is not. If this legislation was consistent with the Racial Discrimination Act, you would accept the amendment. The minister continued: The second thing that we are advised is that this is a precedent that has not been set and would provide a precedent for other legislation. What is wrong with this precedent in the current climate? Why shouldn't this parliament assert, reassert and continue to reassert what is in every major political party's policy: respect for the Racial Discrimination Act? We on this side want more than words because of where this government is heading in this whole race debate. If they vote against this amendment, they will be seen for just uttering the words but not being fair dinkum. People will not believe you. The minister further stated: Thirdly, if we agreed to the amendment, and in the unlikely event that our advice was incorrectand it has not been good up to nowand the bill was in fact in breach of the RDA, then the bill would be ineffective to close off a section 10 process ... Well then, it should be. If it is in breach of the RDA, if it is discriminatory, then it should be struck down. The point is: it is all so unnecessary because there is no protection order in existence. There is an excellent article written by Alan Ramsey in the Sydney Morning Herald on Wednesday, 6 November 1996 in relation to Boobera Lagoon in New South Wales where the minister has been sitting on a positive report since 22 April. Mr Ramsey says: In the Parliament last night, the House of sentatives was scheduled to begin debating a piece of ""special"" legislation to resolve the Hindmarsh Island bridge controversy. The Government insists the bill is necessary to ensure the legality of the bridge being built. What the legislation really though, is bring Hindmarsh Island back into sharp public focus in South Australia. Further on he states: ... what Herron insists needs special legislation in South Australia does not, it seems, in a parallel case in NSW, need legislation of any kind to achieve the same end. That end is to say ""no"" to Aboriginal claims under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act, whatever their merits or otherwise. Indeed, the minister was taken to court and they were successful in New South Wales. Foster J. on 17 October 1996 in Sydney declined to give interlocutory relief because it was held that the minister had an absolute discretion and that the relief that the Aboriginal people were seeking was not available. (Extension of time granted) The relief was not granted. This is with a positive report because there is no dispute. In that instance there is no protection order. The minister cannot be compelled to issue a protection order. So desecration is occurring at the Boobera Lagoon in New South Wales and indigenous people cannot do anything about it. All they can do is get the mInister to consider the positive report that he has been given, and he will do that in due course after consulting. The same principles apply. The legislation has been tested in the Federal Court. It has gone all the way to the High Court and now this minister has the benefit. That is why, when we say 'Follow due process,' you can use the evidentiary material from the Mathews report. You do not need to breach the Racial Discrimination Act. Let us say that your advice is wrong. In the current climate with this Prime Minister's track record dating back to 1988, isn't this stupid legislation? He gave a sgliffin commitment to the electorate and a solemn commitment to this parliament time and time again to respect the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act, but what happens with the first test he has? He says, 'Sorry. This is unnecesRepre- sary. We are not voting for this amendment.' The situation is that the government need to be very careful because they are going to lose all credibility in relation to this. I think does, it is fair to say, as Frank Brennan says: In receiving advice . . . as to whether the Hindmarsh Island Bridge Bill ""respects the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act"", it would be no defence for the government to be left dependent on ... advice ... that ""The proposed legislation could not be subject to successful legal challenge on the basis that it is inconsistent with the Racial Discrimination Act. As a later enactment, the proposed legislation would not be subject to the Racial Discrimination Act."" It would be regrettable if the government were to legislate a later specific act inconsistent with the Racial Discrimination Act such that to the extent of the inconsistency the latest specific Act were to negate the effect of section 10(1) of the Racial Discrimination Act. The later Act could not be presented as one which ""respects the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act"". That is why the government is opposing this amendment. What we have done is put their weights up. That is material that the minister has been given, not by a legal person. But he has been written to and he knows that. That is why those words 'this is consistent with the Racial Discrimination Act and this legislation is not retrospective' do not appear in the second reading speech. This bill is inconsistent with the Racial Discrimination Act, and they know it. They are just not being fair dinkum. In relation to the Racial Discrimination Act, there is hypocrisy in the government at the moment. In relation to the race debate, we seem to be saying that what has happened to Asian Australians is a disgrace and saying it is mea culpa. But that is capitalism suffering. We are not getting the same mea culpa in relation to Aboriginal people. They are still being blamed. In the last couple of days we have had newspapers running around attacking salaries for the SES officers in A TSICsalaries that are subject to Public Service regulations, salaries that are consistent with what is happening throughout the Public Service. But it is only the ATSIC people who are being attacked. That is what this legislation does. It singles people out. It blames them. What we say is: the government won. The minister is there. He has the absolute discretion. There is no protection order in existence. Follow due process. You have our support. There is no need for this debate. There is no need to take sides. If you want to take sides with the developers, good luck to you. You are entitled to do that, but do not do it by attacking indigenous people. Do not do it by bringing in an act that is inconsistent with the Racial Discrimination Act. Do not come in here and use weasel words in everything but the second reading speechin press releases and when briefing the gallery and then, when you are asked to put up or shut up, you slink away and oppose an amendment that is fundamental, that says that the Racial Discrimination Act is paramount. It is in your policy and it is in the utterances of your Prime Minister. But when you are tested you walk away. You walk away because you are not confident in your legal advice. (Extension of time granted) We are confident in our legal advice. We are confident that, as a result of the tabling of the Mathews report, there is sufficient material. The minister can have this bridge wrapped up very quickly without this special legislation. If they are worried about further judicial review, they should follow due process. We say that he does not need to do anything further because there is sufficient material to invoke the Tickner v. Bropho exception. That would show that further pursuit of this application would be frivolous or vexatious. But the more conservative view is-the view that Father Frank Brennan puts and the view that others put-that you can go through, by receiving the material that the minister tabled in the Senate, another quick inquiry. The Wilson case in the High Court says that it does not have to be pUblic. You can do it within 28 days. That is an option. That does not breach the Racial Discrimination Act. That is safer. What we say on this side is that if you want to persist with this discriminatory legislation, then do it by supporting our amendment, which sends a clear message. It says, and the government can rely on this, 'If we did breach the RDA we didn't mean to do so.' If the Prime Minister's words are to mean anything, if he says he respects the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act, then how can he vote against the amendment we are putting up? They vote against it because they are not sure. Because it involves indigenous people, they want to take the short cut. We on this side will not take any short cuts in relation to the Racial Discrimination Act. We regard it as paramount. Time and time again, we will reaffirm our commitment to the Racial Discrimination Act. That is how you send the message to Asia and to the racists in the community that we are all equal, irrespective of our race and irrespective of our religIOn. What has happened since the Prime Minister has been reinvented, since he resumed the leadership in opposition and since he came into the prime ministership after 2 March, is that there has been a new MCCarthyism in this country, based on the colour of someone's skin. The first targets were indigenous people and the second targets were Asian Australians, and it is a disgrace. It is no good passing resolutions about racial tolerance if, on the first test of the primacy of the Racial Discrimination Act, this government votes against this amendment. What it leaves you open to is the allegation, and the only inference, that you are not fair dinkum, that you do not believe in it, that you are just uttering the words. Your body language and your action says it all. Your action in voting against this amendment says where you stand. Your action in voting against this amendment says that you are not confident in your advice that this bill respects the Racial Discrimination Act. And this bill does not. It does not because it is aimed at a class of person: indigen- Lee, M. J. ous people who enjoy the benefits of the Heritage Protection Act. It is only indigenous Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who can invoke the provisions of the Heritage Protection Act. Legislation aimed at taking away an existing right, aimed at taking away a right that these people currently enjoy, is aimed at a class of person. It is aimed only at these indigenous people. That is what this legislation does. That is why it has got problems with the Racial Discrimination Act and that is why the government will not accept our amendment. The thing is that it is all so unnecessary. There is no protection order in existence. The bridge can be built tomorrow, and the minister cannot be compelled. He cannot be compelled to build the bridge. He cannot be compelled to issue a protection order. If he was silly enough to issue a protection order, the government has the numbers in terms of a disallowance motion. So this is a charade. It is a charade that will further divide the community in South Australia. It is a charade that should be put to an end. The government should back off on this legislation. They should accept our amendment. (Time expired) Question put: That the proposed new clause be inserted. The House divided. [Midday] (Madam Deputy Speaker - Mrs KJ. SulliAyes Noes Majority .........

15,Mr MELHAM,NOES,"I have proposed to add to clause 3, page 2, after the definition of 'pit area', the following definition: Racial Discrimination Act means Racial Discrimination Act 1975. Let us be clear. What the government just did was vote against a clause that respects the primacy of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. What a disgraceful performance from a government which says that it respects the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act. That says it all. You cannot rely on the word of the government. You need to take note of what they do in action, not what they say. They have just voted against it. The Racial Discrimination Act, as we have said on this side, is paramount. I have received certain advice, and it is worthwhile quoting aspects of that advice. One says: I am asked to advise whether it is necessary for the Government, in order to resolve the existing application for a declaration under Section 10 of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act, 1984 of land the subject of a report by Justice Mathews of 27.6.96 (now tabled in the Senate) and to avoid having to consider future applications, to pass legislation exempting the land that would be affected otherwise by such claims from the operation of the Act. I am also asked to advise generally as to the effect of such legislation, if passed, on the Racial Discrimination Act. There has been a deal of litigation and Parliamentary debate. NOES Neither the High Court nor anyone else has impugned the integrity or accuracy of the information in the report. Although it has been suggested that, by reason of the High Court decision, the Report is not a Report for the purposes of the Act it has not been nor rationally could it be suggested that the materials in the Report, the earlier Report, and available from the Royal Commission are not PAIRS exhaustive and available to the Minister. A further report would yield no more nor does it seem that it could reasonably reach any other conclusion. That is something the minister said in his Reid, N. B. second reading speech. It continues: The terms ""frivolous and vexatious"" do not occur in the Act nor is there any specific reference to the abuse of process doctrine but these concepts or analogies appropriate to administrative law are well known in the general law. Neither in courts of law nor administratively does the law require that a decision maker armed with all the material embark on an arid exercise fore-doomed to failure. An application which un arguably could only fail would be frivolous and vexatious and to persist with such an application when ""the material pointed unmistakably in this direction"" would be to abuse the processes required by the act for the purposes of Section 10. These concepts are aimed at (inter alia) avoiding such a waste. In the circumstances, it is my view that the present application is, in light of all the material already available, such an application and thus the machinery of the Act is no longer invoked. There is no practical potential in a new Report or inquiry. The supplementary advice, given after the act was produced, says: I have already advised that to persist with the present application where it is clear that there is, presently, no evidence which would warrant a declaration i.e. capable of satisfying the Minister a declaration should be made, and where after exhaustive inquiries there is presently, unmistakably, no real prospect any such evidence would be produced, is to invoke the machinery of the Act to no purpose and is frivolous and vexatious such that the Minister need take no further steps in relation having the effect of to it. There is therefore no need for legislation. Indeed, it is most peculiar for a Minister to be relieved of a statutory discretion, in a particular case by legislation solely directed to that case, where on the facts no need for the exercise of the Ministerial discretion arises. The only circumstance in which it might be appropriate is where the Minister considers that absent the legislation it might be necessary for a declaration to be made i.e. that there would be substance in an application. . . . to remove the efficacy of an already made application to defeat the statutory consequence is retrospective in that sense. This is to discriminate in this particular case and to do so on the basis of Aboriginality. That is what one senior counsel in New South Wales has had to say about this legislation. Another senior counsel who was consulted by me and the opposition on the questions that arise said: What is the effect of this proposed legislation? Is it necessary? The Act has retrospective effect since it prevents a claim presently on foot from being completed. It also has prospective effect, since it prevents any claim ever being made in relation to these areas, no matter what the basis of the claims might be. . .. the present application can be determined according to law quickly and fairly. In my opinion, this proposed legislation offends against the spirit of the provisions Discrimination Act, 1975. Were it State legislation, I would have no doubt that it would be invalid ... (Extension of time granted) That QC's opinion goes further: The contravention comes from the exclusion or restriction from exercising a legal right which comes from a retrospective legislative depravation of an entitlement to make an application, applied only to one group of persons, namely the aboriginal applicants seeking a declaration in relation to the areas intended to be built on by the Hindmarsh Island Bridge. In conclusion: 1. There is no need for the proposed legislation, which is bad in principle because it retrospectively removes the rights of a small section of the indigenous population, for no apparent important public purpose. 2. The proposed legislation infringes the spirit of the Racial Discrimination Act, 1975 ... That is a second QC's opinion. The key to this is that, if it were state legislation, it would fail for breaching the Racial Discrimination Act. This government relies on the fact that this will be a later act so it will override the Racial Discrimination Act. That is why there is nothing in the second reading speech of the minister giving the undertaking that it does not breach the spirit of the Racial Discrimination Act. It is also unnecessary. We do not need to bring into question the legal opinions on whether this does or does not infringe the Racial Discrimination Act. It can all be done without legislation-and in a quicker way. It is not now a priority of the government. It is not going to get on the Senate paper until next year. The government has been too smart by half. There is no protection order currently in existence. .11 If the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Senator Herron) follows due process-something they attacked the previous minister for-the bridge would be guaranteed. The minister at the table, the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge), really needs to answer a couple of questions in relation to the Racial Discrimination Act. What do you mean by 'benign'? Does our amendment do more than just preserve the RDA? That is the point. That is . . . of the Racial where the game is up. I suggest that, once this goes through the House of Representatives, the government should come and have a talk to us in a proper, constructive fashion. It can be done without the need for sending this signal, without the need for having on our statute books a piece of legislation that breaches the spirit of the Racial Discrimination Act, a piece of legislation that is discriminatory, that is not necessary and that sends the wrong signal to the community and to the world. This bill says, 'If you are in this country and the colour of your skin is black, then you don't count.' That is what happened when the government voted against respecting the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. That is what this debate is all about. The Racial Discrimination Act makes us all equal. No government at a federal level, at a local level, at a state level or at a territory level should ever override or suspend the Racial Discrimination Act. That act makes us all equal. It is the most important act on our statute books. Every piece of legislation that this government brings into this parliament that affects indigenous people, in my opinion, should have the qualifier that we respect the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act. That is the overriding principle that should be guiding us all. That is where this legislation is flawed. This is all so unnecessary. This debate did not need to take place in this chamber. It is a debate that shows this government has no confidence in the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs in his administration of the act. We should be debating the Heritage Protection Act in light of Justice Elizabeth Evatt's fine report that was tabled in the Senate and in this place. It is a fine review. It shows that the act itself is deficient in protecting Aboriginal heritage and Aboriginal culture. It is a shameful day when a political party has its Prime Minister saying, 'We will respect the provisions of the Racial Discrimination Act,' and then comes in and votes against a clause. The minister gave it away, as did the Minister for Defence (Mr MCLachlan) when he talked in his contribution about the later act prevailing. They know exactly what this clause means. They know exactly the dangers of this legislation. My view is that you cannot say enough. It is a precedent we should be setting. It is a precedent that says that if this act inadvertentchose ly breaches the RDA then the RDA should prevail. Today is a sad day for this parliament. The resolution we passed last week has been shown up for what it is-weasel words. (Time expired) Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mrs Sullivan)-The member for Banks circulated an amendment, which he said he was now not going to move.",40
16,Mr MELHAM,NOES,I do not see the point in proceeding with it now in light of the earlier vote. I am happy to withdraw that amendment.,42
17,Mr FILING,NOES,"I think the member for Banks (Mr Melham) has chosen unwisely to dwell on a number of issues that do not contribute to a better understanding of why this debate is taking place and why the government has actually moved this legislation to overcome the dilemma, the paradox, of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge affair. I want to make the point in relation to the member for Banks's contribution that there is no point in relying on the report of Justice Mathews. As he well knows, Justice Mathews' appointment was deemed by the High Court to be invalid. The whole difficulty with this is that, in all the processes of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge affair, those people involved in the Labor Party's campaign on the matter have relied on defective material. We know, for instance, that in the first instance Professor Saunders' report was quite clearly defective. We know from other anthropological research that it did not bear up to proper scrutiny. In fact, anybody who took the trouble to investigate the Hindmarsh Island Bridge affair would know that there was substantial anthropological material available to not only rebut those findings of the Saunders report but also put at rest or put paid to many of the contentions of those involved in the opposition campaign, the Labor Party campaign, to prevent the bridge from being constructed. As I said earlier, the ultimate irony of all this is that the member for Barker (Mr MCLachlan) personally opposed the construction of the bridge in the first place. But he to act in a principled manner and represent the interests of his constituents. The Labor Party, on the other hand, chose to treat this matter in a way that was not only highly politicised and dishonest but also reliant on material that was so substantially defective that it not only made much of the argument ridiculous but, under closer scrutiny, proved the minister to be acting in a manner that no judicial authority would support. In fact, in every single judicial review of the minister's acts in this matter he was quite clearly shown to have acted in a way which was not only contrary to the act but negligent as a result of the way he treated the secret women's business because he did not do the job he was paid to do and supposed to do on behalf the rest of the community. I want to make an observation about the resolution the House passed last week on this matter. If you look carefully at the way the Labor Party is acting, its modus operandi, it is quite clearly using this motion as a lever to try to advance any particular proposition it wants to, in much the same manner as the then Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Mr Tickner, used to do in this place. I can remember standing here asking the then minister",42
18,Mr MELHAM,NOES,Why pass a motion if you are not fair dinkum?,43
19,Mr FILING,NOES,"Hang on a second. I can remember asking the then minister quite rational questions about how this whole thing came to pass. Every time you said something he would immediately label you as some sort of racist. He was the minister. He had the responsibilities under the act and he failed to fulfil his responsibilities. He was an accomplice in the advancement of a forgery. As a consequence of his acts, he encompassed all of the Labor Party members into that forgery. Those members who were here at the time all became accomplices. What more can you say?",43
20,Mr MELHAM,NOES,You wouldn't win that argument in court.,43
21,Mr FILING,NOES,"Earlier you mentioned some bush lawyer aspect. Contrary to you, I relied on the legal advice of somebody of substance-the Attorney-General. I did not rely on discredited advice-not the advice of Justice Mathews, whose appointment was overturned by the High Court.",43
22,Mr MELHAM,NOES,It is not discredited; it was a technicality.,43
23,Mr FILING,NOES,"It was discredited. You cannot have it both ways. It either stands up to scrutiny or it does not. You know very well at the end of the day that this whole matter arose as a consequence of a political forgery. I cannot reiterate this enough. I believe that the Labor Party is trying to rewrite modem history. In a desperate way they are trying to misrepresent something that, as we have all seen with the benefit of review, was not only a forgery and a confection but a calculated one designed to undermine the very processes which we all in here agreed were going to advance the cause of reconciliation and better community relations. (Extension of time granted) In good faith, a number of members participated in the debate last week, designed in their view-in the view, ultimately, of the House in division-to make a statement in relation to particular matters relating to the relationships within our community. In his contribution the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton) chose to use it in a very highly 4. politicised manner. It was used to attack those whom they disagreed with, much the same as Tickner.",43
24,Mr MELHAM,NOES,Is this your speech for readmission to the Liberal Party?,43
25,Mr FILING,NOES,"The member for Banks should know, as he is a member of the caucus of the Labor Party, that his view was rolled over. The rational section of the Labor Party acknowledged the fact that they had been drawn into becoming accomplices in the circulation and use of a forgery. Mr MCLachlan-He didn't even come into the parliament the following day.",43
26,Mr FILING,NOES,"That is exactly right. In fact, we have seen this puny effort by the member for Banks to try to save face in the face of what is quite clearly an overwhelming opinion that the whole thing does not stand up to scrutiny. I want to go back to the reason for the government putting forward this bill. If there was something wrong with it, I would vote against it. But having had some experience in debating this matter, looking into it and researching it, I can only conclude that this is about the best way we can resolve it. If you looked at what I believe is the overwhelming view of the community in relation to contentious issues like this, they look for what I believe is the Australian fair go. They look to see who is not getting a fair go or who deserves a fair go in this matter. At the end of the day, the fair go argument or the fair go measure of decision making would have to fall very substantially on the part of those who want to construct the bridge. As we know, at the end of the day their particular interests were dealt with unfairly and as a consequence of the use of the Hindmarsh Island Bridge affair as a political weapon in the first instance to try to bludgeon the member for Barker, who is a senior member of the coalition, and in the second instance to try to overturn a decision that had been made while a state Labor government was in office. I make the observation to the member for Banks that if he goes back and looks at the history of this matter, he would have to conclude as a reasonable person-I know when you scratch the surface he is completely reasonable",43
27,Mr MELHAM,NOES,"Ha, ha!",44
28,Mr FILING,NOES,"He laughs now because he knows that I am arguing a truth. In essence, he would consider this, as a reasonable person, at the end of the day to be a matter that does not stand up. He would know, for instance, that the decision to construct the Hindmarsh Island Bridge was made under the Bannon Labor government. There was no opposition at the time because the Labor Party supported it.",44
29,Mr MELHAM,NOES,The member for Barker opposed the bridge.,44
30,Mr FILING,NOES,"I know he did; I am not disputing that. In fact, I will advance that as part of my argument. The member for Bonython (Mr Martyn Evans) is in the chamber. He used to be an Independent member of the South Australian parliament and then became a minister in the Arnold government. He would know that this decision was undertaken by the Labor government. They made initial inquiries in relation to whether or not it contravened heritage issues within the state. At the end of the day, 10 and behold, it was used as a political weapon. Unfortunately, it has contributed to the undermining of what was an integral part of the reconciliation process-that was the understanding in the community that there are important matters relating to Aboriginal heritage that need to be protected. If you undermine that process, you undermine the community'S understanding and the community's acceptance. That is why the Labor Party must accept responsibility for undermining the very process they say they are seeking to support. This bill endeavours to reconcile this matter once and for all. Get the bridge constructed, get it off the political agenda and stop wasting your time as well as ours. I know that there will be many Labor Party members who would share my view that the quicker this gets fixed up, the better, because they are sick to their back teeth of this issue too. Clause agreed to. Remainder of bill-by leave-taken as a whole, and agreed to. Bill agreed to. Third Reading Bill (on motion by Dr Wooldridge)-by leave-read a third time. NA AMENDMENT BILL 1996 Second Reading Debate resumed from 19 September, on  That the bill be now read a second time.",44
31,Mr CREAN,BOUNTY LEGISLATION,"This is a government that lacks any vision for the manufacturing industry and any commitment to it. And it lacks a minister prepared to take on Treasury to fight for the manufacturing industry of Australia. The Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 confirms both these facts. That is why we are opposing it. It is not just the axing of the bounties contained in this legislation which betrays the manufacturers of this country. There are also the cuts to research and development, the significant scaling back of the DIFF scheme, the huge cuts to the export market development grants scheme, the cuts to Austrade and the cuts to AusIndustry. All up, $3.9 billion has been cut by way of industry support over four years in the Howard government's first budget. No wonder the manufacturers of this country feel under siege from this government. These are not decisions which are driven by good sense. They are simply driven by the budget bottom line; by a belief that fiscal consolidation will solve all our problems. It will not. These cuts have no regard for the real consequences that will flow. The consequences are a loss of economic growth, a loss of jobs and a loss of exports. The budget was bad in many ways, but it singled out manufacturing for very harsh treatment. According to the Industry Commission, Commonwealth assistance to industry will this year hit an eight-year low. But it gets worse. Next year it will fall by a further seven per cent. The resources sector got off relatively lightly in the budget. The diesel fuel rebate was retained--correctly, in our view-but only at the cost of the 150 per cent research and development tax concession. That was the trade-off to prop up Tim Fischer's leadership of the National Party. It was not a very clever investment either way. So political expediency and the government's lack of vision have hit manufacturing twice. In spite of all of the rhetoric of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) about the need for his government to be seen and judged on the creation of jobs, the Prime Minister is desperate to avoid the T-word: he is not prepared to set a target for jobs. But before the election the government, through the now Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), did set a jobs target to create 200,000 jobs in the manufacturing industry by the year 2000. Having set that target and then come into office, the government has done nothing to achieve it. The industry minister, who has now joined us in the chamber, admits that he has not even bothered to ask his department how the target is to be achieved. They hope that the issue will go away. But the minister must now take a submission to the cabinet unemployment committee, which was recently established by the Prime Minister, in which he outlines a vision for manufacturing and proposes how to achieve the 200,000 jobs he said they would achieve. Industry groups such as the Australian Electrical and Electronic Manufacturing Association, AEEMA; the Australian Information Industries Association, AlIA; the Heavy Engineering Manufacturers Association, HEMA; and the Metal Trades Industry Association, MTIA, together with industry leaders such as Bert Evans, Frank Conroy from Howard Smith Industries and Bob Clifford, the catamaran operator from Incat in Tasmania, have been lamenting the government's lack of industry policy. They have been scathing in their criticism of the government in this regard. Even ACCI, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the government's most dogged defender, have been reduced to saying-only after pregnant pauses-that the jury is still out on whether the government have an industry policy. The jury is not out, because there is no industry policy under this government. This bill proves it. It is just one of many reasons why the 200,000 target will not be met by them. In opposing the bill and tojl-hlight that fact, I am proposing to move die following amendment to effectively have the bill renamed the Bounty Legislation (Export of Australian Jobs) Amendment Bill: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""the House rejects outright the Government's failure to develop and implement a policy for Australian manufacturing industry, and is of the view that because of the inevitable impact this bill will have on employment the bill would be more appropriately referred to as the Bounty Legislation (Export of Australian Jobs) Amendment Bill"". We have repeatedly asked in this parliament of the Prime Minister that he apply his own jobs test to government policy decisions. Having announced his cabinet unemployment committee, he told parliament that his test would: ask of every policy initiative: ... would it contribute to a generation of jobs? This week we asked the Prime Minister to refer to his unemployment committee the impact of the bounty cuts on companies such as Incat, Austal Shipping, Griffin Press and Laser Lab. What was his answer? He says the decisions cannot be disaggregated. So the Prime Minister's claim that his unemployment committee will consider each initiative against his jobs test is meaningless. His response to those who have been hit by the cut is to dismiss them as whingers. The 1,600 bounty recipients are just whingers. One company alone-Austal Shipping in Coogee near Fremantle in Western Australia-has lost $225 million in contracts because of the decision to abolish the bounty: $225 million in contracts lost at a saving to the budget of $9 million. It is not just the company and its employees that suffer; the nation suffers. Yet the Prime Minister wants to dismiss these complaints as just whingeing. Either he does not understand the impact of or know about these decisions because his industry minister does not tell him-he didn't tell him too much about his share dealingsor he does not care. The legislation typifies the coalition's approach to industry policy: that, as in many other areas, there is no role for government and that government should get out of the way. It should abandon the field and let the market rip. That is not Labor's approach. We are committed to a more interventionist industry policy. We have been consulting with industry, both individual firms and their representative bodies. We have been visiting their sites, talking with them about their vision for growth and how to achieve it. Ours is not a tops down, Canberra driven approach; rather, it is about developing a partnership, getting a commitment from industry to set targets for growth in net value added exports, to identify what is needed to achieve those targets and to work with us in government to realise them. Because it is industry driven, not government driven, the intervention or assistance by government will vary. It may mean better addressing market access issues, it may mean measures which encourage innovation and commercialisation across industry sectors. It may come through the leverage of government purchasing, or it may be like the bounty approach which this legislation abolishes, an approach which, while giving some sector specific assistance, does it in the context of what our competitors provide. It can phase down if the other countries do likewise, but it is more about levelling what is already a tilted playing field. In all cases, it will not about propping up inefficient industries or firms; it will be supportive of best practice and international competitiveness. It will require a commitment to improve our net exports. It is an approach which we are committed to developing with Australian based industries and, without such an approach, jobs in manufacturing simply will disappear overseas. Some export strategy by this government! Manufacturing is the backbone of this country's industry. It provides the critical mass. It is the means for value adding to our natural resource base, for becoming a clever country by applying our innovation and research. It is the basis for our wealth creation. It is the basis for our jobs in regions. It is the basis for spawning our small to medium-sized businesses and it is the basis for driving our services sector. This bill runs counter to all of those things. The bill axes four industry bounties. Despite election promises to the contrary, it terminates the ships, books, machine tools and robot bounties from budget night. It also abolishes the computer bounty but not, interestingly enough, until 1 July next year. We have asked in this parliament how the mherent conflict of interest this raises, given the industry minister's considerable interest in companies that claim the computer bounty, can be explained, and he chooses to dismiss such requests. We will continue to pursue him. The Prime Minister says there is no conflict of interest, it is an arms-length arrangement. Noone in the country believes your arms-length arrangement, Minister. What nonsense! The decision to end the ships bounty is indefensible. The government wants to strip away the five per cent support for Australian builders of vessels, nearly all of which are exported. In the eight years since Labor introduced the bounty, the Australian industry in shipbuilding has grown massively. It is now the world leader in high speed passenger catamaran production. Industry production has grown by 200 per cent, exports are up by 150 per cent and employment is up by 50 per cent. Other countries continue to maintain subsidies for their shipbuilding industries, for be the ones that the catamaran producers have to compete with. Norway, for example, has a subsidy of 13.2 per cent; Denmark, 13 per cent; and Italy, up to 25 per cent. That is against Australia's five per cent. Australia can compete with those countries with the higher rates of subsidies with Australia's subsidy at only five per cent, but it cannot compete at zero. The DECO agreement to end shipbuilding subsidies by the end of 1998 will now, I am informed, not go ahead because the Americans will not sign up to it. The minister-great help that he is-has written to Austal Ships confirming that the government thinks Australia should take the lead in dismantling assistance. Taking the lead is fine, Minister, if others follow. If they do not, it is suicidal, yet that is the path you have put them on. This indefensible position becomes totally unsustainable when compared with the government's decision to continue the ships capital grants scheme. Just understand the stupidity of this position for those on the other side who want to chortle. The government has been able to find $23 million to help companies like Shell and BHP import ships that are made in Holland, but it will not find $9 million to back Australian companies exporting ships built here. How stupid is that? That is your decision, and you wonder why the industry is protesting. You wonder why people are up in arms about your policy. It is perverse, even more so when you consider the regional impact. The innovative, export oriented, fast ship and ferry industry, which the bounty has spawned, is based in regional centres such as Fremantle, Hobart, Adelaide, Darwin. The impact on these regions of abolishing the bounty will be disastrous. For example, Austal Ships Pty Ltd, which is based in Fremantle, told the Senate last week when it was looking at this bill: We have lost the opportunity with Stena Line (a major European operator) for two vessels and an option for two more with a total value of around $225 million. Stena advises our vessels are now expensive and they will proceed with the purchase in Europe. Great decision, Minister! Some balance sheet: $225 million lost to the nation by one company alone, in return for $9 million to the budget bottom line. This is a group of people who, in trying to convince you to reverse this crazy decision, came all the way from Perth to explain their position. As I understand it, you kept them waiting for up to an hour and a half and then gave them only 10 minutes. Is this the way you are going to continue to deal with manufacturers in this country? Is this the way you are going to encourage innovation and export and job growth? Is this the vision that you are going to give manufacturers? You are dismissive of them. You will not listen to their complaints and, in the process, we see jobs going overseas. Will the Peter Nixon review, which is looking into Tasmania's industry and which the Prime Minister announced with great fanfare at the Liberal Party Federal Council recently, be allowed to address the assessment of Incat, the catamaran producer down there, the largest private sector employer in Tasmania? I quote again from their r¥Jllonse to the Senate: If the Australian government does not appear to support a shipbuilding industry we may consider relocating overseas. And what would that mean for the 1,000 employees the company has on its payroll? Where have the government members from Western Australia, Tasmania, South Australia and the Northern Territory been in standing up for their local industries in taking these issues on in their party room? Even Richard Court, the Premier of Western Australia, can see the importance of the ships bounty to Western Australian shipbuilders because he has written to the Prime Minister asking for it to be retained. But none of this means anything to the government. It has axed the bounty in pursuit of the budget bottom line. I go now to the question of books and the publishing industry, which has also lost its bounty. In that industry, an atmosphere of certainty is required for long-term investment. That is because the industry operates on the too basis of contracts of up to five years. Printing and publishing companies were operating on the clear understanding that the bounty would continue until the end of 1997. In fact, contracts were entered into on that basis. Ending the bounty nearly 18 months early is a retrospective move. The government has compromised the ability of firms in the industry to make sensible investment decisions. Again, the bounty's termination ignores what our overseas competitors are doing. New Zealand gives a grant of up to 50 per cent on production costs for certain books-you know, the country that they want to compare us with when it suits them. Singapore provides tax breaks and other tax incentives for its local printing industry. The reality is that the playing field is not level. These countries are not dismantling their protection measures, yet Australian printers and publishers are expected to compete without assistance. And this, despite the Industry Commission recommending that the bounty remain until the end of 1997. This is a government that receives reports and ignores them. Printing and publishing industry bodies estimate that around the 2,600 jobs in the industry may be lost: another net reduction in your jobs target, Minister, I might remind you. Griffin Press in Adelaide only last week laid off 140 workers because the bounty has gone. The impact will also be hardest felt in regional Australia. For instance, in Marybor1,000 ough in Victoria, 25 per cent of the work force is reliant on local printing companies MCPhersons and APG. They are already overseas. losing export orders to overseas competitors. I visited these companies to see how they will be affected. The minister hasn't; he is too busy playing the share market. Where are the government members from Bendigo, Ballarat and Adelaide during all of these decisions? Deafening silence on their part. Again, the government has simply cut, regardless of the this decision? consequences. In this case, the consequences are printing industry employees and their families in Adelaide, Maryborough and other parts of regional Australia. In relation to the computer bounty, the coalition went to the election promising to match Labor's retention of the bounty to the end of 2000. But in one of their more cynical moves, they have now decided to end it from mid-1997. The computer bounty along with annual production. other measures of the Labor governmentsuch as partnerships for development, the research and development tax concession, the export market development grants schemeof all assisted in the growth of Australia's tech information industries. All of these programs are now either axed or so cut back that they are insignificant to them. Exporters of computer hardware have increased, as a result of Labor's strategy, nine times in the last 10 years. That is what happens if you give sensible industry assistance. Total industry exports, including hardware, componentry and printed circuit boards, have trebled in the last five years. So these payments by government are not subsidies. They are investments in our future industries, and in those industries which are going to provide meaningful and attractive job opportunities to Australians, in particular young Australians. They do represent a return to the nation. They should not be seen as costs. They should be half of seen as investments in our future. The combined effect of scrapping the bounty and the DIFF scheme and budget cuts to the R&D tax concession, to Auslndustry and to the EMDG will be devastating for Australian industry, many of them small and medium enterprises. AEEMA estimate up to jobs will be lost in printed circuit board manufacturing, including 150 at Ericsson in Melbourne, which may close and move There is also the regional effect. IBM is now reconsidering the future of its plant in Wangaratta in Victoria. That plant employs over 600 people and produces $500 million in export and domestic product. Where is the member for Indi (Mr Lieberman) demanding that the Prime Minister apply his jobs test to The government established an information industries task force to look at industry development and assistance issues, but it is not due to report until April 1997. The bounty continues to the end of June. In the meantime the industry is beset by uncertainty, unable to make investment decisions, yet the information industries are the fastest growing in Australia. They are worth $32 billion in I tum finally to the machine tools and robots bounty, which has also been axed. This has been a critical factor in the development manufacturing companies such as ANCA highin Melbourne, which in five years has grown from 50 to 300 employees, exporting over 90 per cent of its product to the US, Europe and Asia; Farley Cutting Systems, which provides machine tools to the fast catamaran and ferry industries so the axing of this bounty comes as a second blow for them; and Laser Lab, which is in my electorate, whose parent company told the Senate committee that it is considering moving offshore, taking its technology and 50 Australian jobs with it. This is a fantastic manufacturing strategy, Minister! I have not found one decision that is going to add any jobs. How are you going to achieve your 200,000 jobs target when all of the decisions that have been taken in the first budget-which you would not stand up for the manufacturing industry in-have seen only job cuts? The bounty has seen Australia's production of bountiable machine tools increase over the last three years by $50 million and exports have more than doubled. Yet again we have the government ignoring an Industry Commission recommendation that the bounty remain in place until the end of 1997. Not only is there no logic in these decisions but also there is no backing for them. The government has taken them because Treasury has won and because the minister is weak and will not stand up for the manufacturing sector. The government's handling of this matter has been disgraceful. It is not just I who says that; industry is also saying that. Asked how they would describe the government's handling of the abolition of the bounties, these were some of the responses. The Australian Information Industry Association said it was 'abysmal'. Mimosa Publications said, 'It demonstrates a total lack of awareness of the need for a predictable environment. It is extremely short-sighted ... lack of consideration of the impact on employment and the balance of payments.'",44
32,Mr CADMAN,BOUNTY LEGISLATION,Quote the rest of what they said.,49
33,Mr CREAN,BOUNTY LEGISLATION,"I will quote them as long as you like. Austal Ships said it was 'totally lacking of vision and understanding'. This is your government. MCGraw Hill said it was 'appalling' and 'displays a total lack of understanding of the nature of the book publishing and printing industry'. Farley Cutting Systems Australia said the decision was 'disastrous, arrogant and counterproductive' - it fits the industry minister to a T, especially the arrogance. Incat said it was 'very poor and that the decision was made without consideration. Their minds were already made up'-in other words, impervious to representations, gives them 10 minutes after the flight from Perth and could not care less about them. The whole ministry was in Tasmania for the federal council meeting of the Liberal Party. An invitation was extended by Bob Clifford of Incat to all ministers and backbenchers to attend and see what was there. Not one responded. This was their interest. Mr Moore-Wrong! It waS'1() the Prime Minister.",49
34,Mr CREAN,BOUNTY LEGISLATION,"Why did the Prime Minister not send you, Minister? You were such a disgrace and such a handicap that he would not even contemplate that. The reality is that you could not care less about Australia's manufacturing. The Printing Industries Association of Australia said the decisions were 'a disaster'. The decisions this bill seeks to implement are a disaster for our key growth industries. They will result in lost jobs, they will result in lost investment and they will result in lost export-in all, lost opportunities for Australia. What does the Prime Minister's jobs test mean, Minister? He says that all of our decisions have to judged by the simple criterion: will it lead to a generation of jobs? How can you stand up and defend these decisions, because all of these decisions mean cuts to jobs? Not growth in jobs, but cuts to them, cuts to exports and cuts to economic growth. It is little wonder that you have the appalling unemployment figures that have come out today. Unemployment is up again. Youth unemployment is skyrocketing under your government. There is no commitment from the minister to a manufacturing industry strategy that secures the commitment he made during the election campaign to create 200,000 new jobs in manufacturing. Minister, you will not come within cooee of it. You are not prepared to stand up for your patch. You are not prepared to receive delegations to hear how horrendous these decisions are and you sit with the arrogance of the born to rule mentality. You think that things simply happen because you are in government. That is how you sit there. You have a view that all you have to do is get the budget right and the rest will follow. Well, it will not and you should be listening to the industry sector that says it. The evidence for you is overwhelming, but you choose to ignore it. You prefer to pursue short-sighted policies which will cause long term damage. We have referred this bill to a Senate committee so the industry players can put their case and demonstrate why these bounties are so important. You have already had some examples of what they have had to say and you will be hearing many more of them. That is why Labor will vote against this bill both here and in the Senate. I urge members in this parliament to support the amendment. I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""the House rejects outright the Government's failure to develop and implement a policy for Australian manufacturing industry, and is of the view that because of the inevitable impact this will have on employment the bill would be more appropriately referred to as the Bounty Legislation (Export of Australian Jobs) Amendment Bill"". Mr Tanner-I second the amendment.",49
35,Mr CADMAN,BOUNTY LEGISLATION,"Mitchell) (1.00 p.m.)There is absolutely no way the amendment to the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill 1996 moved by the previous speaker, the member for Hotham (Mr Crean), should be agreed to by this House. He is proposing a continuation of policies that brought about deplorable results in Australia. Let the shadow minister be aware that, despite the high growth economies in Asia, which are a wonderful opportunity for marketing manufactured goodsthey are in the biggest demand-the policy that he is advancing meant that Australia's share of manufactured goods imported into the Asian region declined from 2.8 per cent in 1982 to 1.7 per cent in 1992. So much for the policies of the Labor Party. They have been proved a failure and they have been voted a failure by the Australian people. Despite the subsidies, the payouts, the unbalanced budgets and all of the other paraphernalia of the Australian Labor Party's administration, their policies are a notorious failure. We are a declining influence, under their policies, in Asia-the fastest growing market for Australian manufacturers anywhere in the world. In fact, we were so successful under the policies of the Labor Party that our share of the Asian market in manufactured goods actually declined. It fell by almost 50 per cent. In spite of growing opportunities in the world market, Labor has failed to improve international perceptions of our investment climate. The recent Bureau of Industry Economics survey has shown that the majority of business executives in Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States do not consider themselves well informed about Australia's business environment and had negative perceptions of Australian macroeconomic policy performance and the government's attitude to foreign investment. That is the sort of climate the Labor Party created nationally and internationally, and they are trying to have this government bill follow the same policies that proved to be such a failure. It is like a household which is heavily mortgaged, with their furniture on hire purchase, and somebody claims that they should buy a new car and go further into debt in order to get to work faster. That sort of economic folly is something that the Labor Party has to move away from if they are going to gain any credibility with the Australian people. I would remind the House that the policies of the Australian Labor Party in manufacturing industries and across the board have created record increases in taxation. They have produced record unemployment and record overseas debt at a time when the world economy was booming and at the very time when reasonable or moderate policies would have produced much better results for the Australian people and the Australian manufacturing industries. All of those policies proved a failure. It is no good pointing to one or two instances of sprinkling money out through a bounty process and saying that has been successful. If the nation is going broke and unemployment is skyrocketing, you cannot point back to that historic so-called benefit and say, 'If continued, ultimately it will succeed.' That is just a failure syndrome the Australian Labor Party has to move away from. In 1983, there was a $7.7 billion manufacturing trade deficit. That blew out to $27.5 billion in 1995. That is how well the Labor Party is going with some of these policies of bounties and subsidies. They have not got the basics right in the Australian economy, they have not got the challenge there for people to expect that they are going to make profits and to expand their businesses. The raw figures show that from 1983 through to 1995 there was a quadrupling of the manufacturing deficit in trade. So you cannot claim that you were succeeding if that is what the results of your policies were. You cannot claim that the nation needs to go back to those failed policies in order to succeed. They have been demonstrated to be a failure. Imports now account for 35 per cent of the sales of manufactured goods, and that is up from 24 per cent in the early 1980s. So in fact you worsened our current account deficit. That is what your policy has done. This government has been in office for a short eight months; you had 13 years to make changes. The historic effort of those 13 years of work has proved to be a failure. We are importing more; we are exporting less; the share of the market has decreased; we had massive unemployment; we have a huge foreign debt. And the former minister Crean, leader of the union movement, comes in here saying that we ought to continue the policies of the Australian Labor Party. How stupid. Why would anybody want to do that? A demonstrated failure repeated over and over and over again. It seems wrong. He started quoting people who have been affected by the removal of this bounty. No sensible government would want to remove a benefit and damage people's businesses. We have tried to make an interim arrangement for the industry so that the pain is lessened. But no government in its right mind would take these decisions if it did not think there long-term benefit for the Australian people and the Australian manufacturing industries. I refer the shadow minister and the House that to some of the evidence given before the Senate committee. One of the firms that he quoted was Mimosa Publications. After exploring all of the bounty issue, Ms Donovan, who was giving evidence on behalf of that firm, said: I think the disadvantage is not so much tariffs, or the advantageous bounties, it is more the tyranny of distance. Our freight costs of getting materials to markets are high. The time difference is also a problem. If you are shipping books to America, you are looking at a minimum of six weeks. I think that the distance hurts us more.';"" And Senator Murray said: More than the price? And Ms Donovan said: Plus all the holiday pay, sick pay and those sorts of things. But certainly, in terms of competing with Americans, the distance that we have to ship goods is really a major hurdle. Small business and business at large are saying, 'These assistance programs are part of it, but they are a minor part,' and Ms Donovan from Mimosa Publications, affected by the bounty decision, is saying that it is all the industrial relations claptrap that we have to put up with; it is all the red tape we must deal with; it is the taxes and the lead in the saddlebags that is far more significant to us than any small advantage that we may receive from a bounty scheme. So that is why the government has made the decision: it wants to get the basics of the Australian economy right; it wants to get people aware that there are $9 billion or $10 billion worth of outgoings each budget just to keep level with the repayments on our huge foreign debt. Our outgoings in the budget up until now have been about equivalent to our total payment for education or defence just to repay the debt that the Australian Labor Party has run up. And they want to continue these policies for an indefinite period and say that, ultimately, Australia will succeed when the policies have been proven, time and again, to be a failure. That is not the real world and the was a Australian people do not believe that. The shadow minister made such a disappointing speech when he was in the House; a speech which showed that he had not learned anything new. He had no new proposals; he had some rhetoric about this as 'what if' and 'maybe' sort of stuff. It was just a continuation of what we have heard in the past. If he is going to make a real contribution in this parliament, and I know that it is his fierce ambition to make a very significant contribution in this parliament, then the shadow minister will need to come back to some real innovation in his thinking and move away from those failed policies of the past, because regurgitating that stuff will not convince anybody. Ultimately, it will not convince the Mimosa presses or the Ms Donovans or the Bert Evans or anybody else because they know the real problems of this nation are substantially more than whether or not they receive a bounty. The Australian government has made this decision. I would like to run through, for the benefit of the House, the various areas where the computer bounty, the books bounty, the machine tools and robots bounty and the shipbuilding bounty have been changed because it is not as gross as presented by the shadow minister. It is not as difficult as presented by some of the firms that appeared before the Senate committee. It is a change, but change was in the wind and it had been flagged by both the previous government and the Industry Commission. The Industry Commission reviewed the computer industry and reported in June 1995, a little over a year ago. The Industry Commission recommend the bounty be allowed to expire in December 1995. It recommended that the bounty be allowed to run for a few months further. According to the Industry Commission, its recommendation to the government was that the bounty be allowed to expire at the end of last year. However, the then government subsequently introduced legislation to extend the bounty to the year 2000. The opposition of the day agreed with that and, regrettably, we included a continuation of that bounty in our policy. However, we have changed our policy in regard to bounties. Nobody likes doing that to the bounty in regard to computers. It is a shame that that has had to occur but one must look at the total picture and the total goals of the government. This government, on finding it had responsibility for a $10 billion black hole in the budget that it was not expecting to findalthough it was prepared to accept the responsibility and fix it-had to make some hard decisions, and it did make some hard decisions. Unfortunately, the computer bounty has to be terminated and the budget will terminate it on 30 June 1997. It has a few more months to run. It runs, I would point out to the House, far beyond the recommendation of the Industry Commission. As for the books bounty, the draft Industry Commission report released in August this year recommended that the bounty be allowed to lapse when the current scheme terminates in December 1997. However the book bounty is to be ended about one year prior to that recommendation. With the machine tools and robots bounty, the draft Industry Commission report recommends the scheme be allowed to lapse when the current scheme terminates on 30 June 1997. The budget terminates that bounty in August 1996, a year early. As for the shipbuilding bounty, the Bureau of Industry Economics reviewed the bounty in early 1995. The Bureau of Industry Economics concluded the Australian shipbuilding industry had matured and no longer required direct support. The bounty was due to be terminated on 30 June 1997 but this legislation will terminate the bounty on 20 August 1996. There is a shortening of the term of the bounty. It would be impossible to say that is not the case. However, when one looks at all the reports and the previous government's attitude towards the payment of bounties, one would have to say that the writing was on the wall. The writing was on the wall for these industries and they should have been making some sort of changes. If they were not making some sort of plans to take into account that there was going to be a termination of the bounties then that would have been most foolish. It would have been dreadfully sighted management. The bounties were never considered to be an infinite source of assistance. The former government industry minister, Alan Griffiths, said on Lateline in April 1993 in response to a question about the continuation of governThey ment assistance to industry: ... there'll be opportunities for government assist, to offer assistance during that nurturing phase, but of course, taking the shipbuilding example, government involvement there will temporary. That was a warning issued by a previous minister in the Labor government three years ago. The shipbuilding industry was aware that government's intention to terminate bounty process. It is no good coming in here crying crocodile tears that it continued because the industry was on notice. It knew that this was a temporary arrangement and it should have been aware of that and been making plans, and I believe that many in the industry were doing so. The Liberal government has taken additional measures to ensure that Australian industries are prepared for the challenges ahead. In relation to shipbuilding and books, there are generous transitional arrangements. In the case of computers the government has conthe vened the Information Industries Taskforce consider whether and in what form assistance might be required in the future. That task force has been established. I reams of press releases from the minister about it, what it is going to do, what its terms of reference are and everything else. Yet there was not a word from the previous speaker the about whether that task force terms of reference or whether it would meet the objectives of the industry. The member for Hotham just gave that the flick and said, 'That doesn't count at all.' Unlike Labor, this government does not advocate unproductive handouts to industry. The government is committed to providing Australia meaningful policy support and assistance to Australian industry. Our commitment is real because we know where the problems are. We know that the policies of the previous governSome ment failed time and time again. Under the shortMinister for Small Business and Consumer  leased regarding the deregulation of small businesses and business at large to see how they can be assisted by the government. Business people made a number of claims. wanted fringe benefits tax to be cleaned up and something to be done with that. They to wanted red tape to be changed. They wanted the reform agenda to be pushed ahead by this government. This group, which was estabbe lished by the Minister for Smail Business and Consumer Affairs and which reported to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), was looking at the deregulation of business. - ieported that of business people would prefer to have an the optional pay-as-you-go voluntary payment system of taxation. They wanted easier ways should have to handle paperwork. They provided a series of very solid and practical recommendations concerning the conduct of the Australian Taxation Office. They commented on sales tax, the Income Tax Assessment Act and how it worked, and payroll tax. They also had a lot of things to say about industrial relations and employment issues. These issues have even been mentioned in Senate Economics Legislation Committee to in the last few days by people who are claimed by the Australian Labor Party to be most strongly opposed to the removal of the have bounty. Those people have said to the committee, 'The real issues are not bounties.' These are the issues identified by the Small Business Deregulation Task Force. These are matters that are of significance to Australhad appropriate Ian businesses. The Labor Party comes in here crying crocodile tears about what should or should not happen. I would like to remind the House that the Keating government spent $165 million on the new Department of Foreign Affairs building down the road. Businesses in are really happy that public servants in the elite Department of Foreign Affairs are better housed than they were previously. Some $394,000 was spent on a fountain there. $88 million was spent on housing for surplus staff in Canberra and $994,000 was spent on a ladder to get into buildings occupied by terrorists. I have a list of examples as long as your arm. Millions and millions of dollars have been wasted, including the subsidies paid to musicians in the union movement so the Labor Party could claim a donation from those same unions coming into the election campaign. What a dreadful way to use taxpayers' money. Then the Labor Party people come in here crying crocodile tears and saying, 'It's a pity you cut this bounty off.' Australia has greater priorities than this. This government is prepared to make the hard decisions. The minister at the table knows industry. He is gifted with vision for and understanding of Australia's manufacturing industry. He is applauded in every factory into which he goes, both by the workers and the management. I know that he will lead the manufacturing industry out of the morass of failure in which the Australian Labor Party left it when Labor was forced from office on 2 March 1996.",50
36,Mr TANNER,BOUNTY LEGISLATION,"It is indeed a privilege to follow one of the only two speakers that the government has been able to organise to support the legislation is before the House, the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill 1996. If you look at the speakers list, you will see that there is quite a substantial number of opposition speakers and, after the minister, only two speakers on the government side. I wish to speak only with reference to the amendment to the Bounty (Ships) Act, which is part of this compendium legislation with respect to a variety of bounties. This particular amendment specifies that the ships bounty, which commenced at 15 per cent of the value of the vessel from 1989-90 and on a sliding scale is due to reach five per cent for the 1997-98 year and conclude with that year, will be cut short, with the result that $3.2 million will be saved in the 1996-97 financial year and $6.2 million in the 1997-98 financial year. That is approximately $9.4 million in savings. As a consequence of this bill being passed, if it is passed by this House and by the Senate, the assistance that has been provided by the government of this country to the shipbuilding industry since the late 1980s, rather than tapering down, as it was originally intended to do, is going to be peremptorily removed. Over the previous decade we have seen in Australia a virtually new industry emerge in the area of shipbuilding. The Australian shipbuilding industry had been in a significant state of decline for various reasons over preceding decades, but since the mid-1980s we have seen an extraordinarily vibrant new industry emerge, very much related to the previous shipbuilding industry but, I think, entitled to be considered a new industry in its own right. The bounty that has been provided by the previous government that this government proposes to eliminate has been a critical factor in the development of this industry. It is very important to recall that the industries with which the Australian shipbuilding industry is competing internationally are almost universally subsidised by governments, particularly in Europe, and in most cases subsidised to a far greater extent that they have been subsidised in Australia. So they are not competing on a level playing field; the playing field is already grossly tilted against them in most cases. In some instances, the subsidies that can be as high as effectively 50 per cent of the value of the vessel, and certainly nine to 12 per cent is a very common figure. So a subsidy of five per cent, which is what we are arguing about today, still remains a significant subsidy but it is less than that which most of the competitors to the Australian manufacturers are able to avail themselves of. This industry now has roughly 3,000 employees directly employed in shipyards that are largely situated in Western Australia, Tasmania and South Australia. There are also smaller yards in one or two other states but it is notable that it is a regionally dominated industry. It is really not particularly strong in Victoria and New South Wales, the traditional manufacturing and heavy industry states. It is very much a new industry that has been built up in states that historically have not been powerful manufacturing states. As well as those 3,000 employees, there are a further approximately 10,000 employees in related industries, in industries that supply all sorts of component services and assistance to the fast ferry manufacturing industry. Those are things like components, seating for vessels, software and a whole range of things that are provided by these related industries. To date, about $195 million has been paid in the bounty. If you compare that with what has been invested in research and development, in capital investment and in training by the companies which have received the bounty over that period, there has been $167 million worth of investment by those companies in those vital components of competitiveness over that period. In 1995-96, the exports from this part of the industry, from the shipbuilding industry in Australia, totalled $430 million. Of that, roughly. $260 million came from the fast ferry sector. That is a very important export performance and is in an area where traditionally Australia's exports have been very limited indeed. Had this bounty been retained, it would be reasonable to expect that Australia would have been heading towards the half billion dollar mark with respect to exports very shortly, and also reasonable to expect that in the longer term the exports would hi t the $1 billion mark. Australia has a very long boat and shipbuilding history. In 1810, the manufacture of ships was the number one manufacturing industry in the colony of New South Wales. From 1828 to 1838, in Tasmania, roughly 10 vessels per year were manufactured, averaging a weight of 130 tonnes. So there is a long history and a long tradition of building ships and boats in Australia. Yet, 10 years ago, this industry was virtually threatened with extinction, primarily because of changes in world market conditions, but particularly because of state-subsidised competition. Since the mid-1980s, almost out of nowhere and with very limited assistance from government, we have seen the fast ferry manufacturing industry in this country become, literally, world leaders. Australia is the world leader in the manufacture of aluminium ferries; is earning those export dollars I indicated; and is leading the world in technological development and in satisfying customer demand. Australian ferries are now plying routes alI around the world, and demand is increasing. It is something that is not widely understood and it is something that this government really ought to recognise. The leaders in this industry have been firms such as Austral, Oceanfast, Incat, SA Shipsall, as I have indicated, in regional Australia. They all provide important employmenthighly skilled and highly paid jobs to not only the people working for them, but also for people working in related industries. This industry is significantly different from its predecessor: the types of vessels it is constructing are different; the materials and the technologies that are - jg used are different; the firms and their structure and their origins are different; the work force, the nature of the skills and the infrastructure which supports them are different; and the locations, particularly, where the ships are being built and where the economic activity is occurring, are also different. Between 1987-88 and 1993-94, average Australian economic growth was 2.5 per cent. Of the eight maritime sectors recognised by the Bureau of Industry Economics, six of them grew by at least three times that rate: in other words, at least 7.5 per cent. Exports from the sector grew by 10.6 per cent, whereas overall exports grew by seven per cent. In the three years 1988 to 1990, the exportimport ratio in the shipbuilding industry was 0.59. In other words, there was a deficit. From 1991 to 1993 the ratio improved to 0.88 and from 1994 to 1996 it improved to 1.6. What had previously been a $39 million deficit in the period 1991 to 1993 has, in the period 1994 to 1996, become a $137 million trade surplus in shipbuilding. The industry's regional presence is of fundamental importance to economies like Tasmania and Western Australia. It is of vital importance in Western Australia in diversifying the economic base, which, strong as it is, has historicalIy been vulnerable to fluctuations in commodity prices. It is vitally important in places like Tasmania and South Australia, which have suffered some economic decline because of structural international economic change. Between 1985 and 1992, shipbuilding jobs fell by roughly half in Australia, to 5,600. But, as a result of the work of the fast ferry industry and the people in that industry, that statistic has now turned around and jobs are increasing. The jobs tend to be highly skilled and well paid, and there are many small businesses, such as Beurteax Australia, a manufacturer of seats, and software businesses, that are thriving as a result of the demand from the manufacture of these vessels. The industry has succeeded because it has a skilled work force, because of the vision and the courage of the leaders in the industry, and because of the genuine entrepreneurship of the people who have pioneered the industry. It has succeeded because of a sophisticated domestic demand that has emerged from the manufacturing of commercial fishing vessels, recreational vessels, and offshore oil and gas vessels and the like. Government assistance, relatively limited though it has been, has been targeted and intelligent and it has enabled these firms to grow from the bottom up. The key form of government assistance has been the bounty. There have been other forms of assistance, such as assistance with training and provisions of skills, but the key form of assistance has been this bounty. Further growth in this industry is quite realistically anticipated. There are many countries in Asia which are, essentially, water based countries: large island countries such as Indonesia and the Philippines, where the long term prospects for the demand for fast ferries are considerable. We now dominate the world in this industry, and the great tragedy of this legislation will be that, just as we have achieved this position, our competitors, particularly those in Europe who are heavily subsidised, will be given an open look-into resume their previous position. So, just as the Australian industry is establishing itself and has created a dominant position and is leading the world, the government is now going to pull the rug out from underneath its feet. The bounty will be abolished over the period when it would have been phased out, saving roughly $9Y2 million. There has been virtually no consultation with the industry at all. Some extraordinary statements were being made by the minister at the table and by the member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) previously about how everybody in the industry supported all these initiatives, but that wasn't the case when I was down visiting shipyards and talking to the leading figures in this industry only on Monday. Exactly the opposite message was being conveyed. Also, in a broader and more indirect sense, these sorts of industries are going to suffer as a result of the reduction in tax deductibility for research and development, as a result of the slashing of labour market programs, which are of great importance to them in ensuring that they have got access to skilled workers, and as a result of a whole range of other industry assistance disappearing. The Labor government, for example, provided targeted assistance such as nearly half a million dollars through the national skills shortages program to the College of Aluminium Training and others, which was of considerable importance to this industry in ensuring that highly skilled, sophisticated work forces could be developed to deal with the very complex and technical tasks involved with manufacturing fast ferries. The government's response to the concerns of the industry has been not to talk with them, not to consult, not to rethink-it has been to rub their noses in it. It has virtually refused to talk to this industry. It is an absolutely extraordinary fact that when the Liberal Federal Council was on in Hobart recently, nobodynot the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), who was invited, not anybody on his behalf-was prepared to go to Incat and talk to Bob Clifford, who employs a thousand Tasmanians in that industry and is responsible for significant additional employment of others in flowon areas. Nobody was prepared to go and talk to him. . When the leaders of the Western Australian industry, John Farrell and John Rothwell, wanted to talk to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), they got an appointment out of him over here. They had to fly over from Perth, spending a few thousand dollars on air fares. The minister turned up an hour and a half late and he walked in and said, 'Look, sorry, folks, I am very busy, I can only give you 10 minutes.' That is nothing less than an insult. That is rubbing the noses of the industry in the decision that the government has taken without any consultation. To cap it all off, the government was notable for its absence at the landmark Ausmarine conference that I had the privilege of opening in Perth on Monday of this week. But we do see some presence from the government. They are not totally out of the picture, because at that conference we had a very nice book distributed called Australia and the Sea, by Baird Publications. Lo and behold, what do we have in the foreword but a nice picture of the minister-a lovely, smiling picture of the minister saying how important the maritime industries were and how the government is fully behind them, doing everything it can to help; all of the usual platitudes. Everything but assistance everything but consultation. So, while they are there actually ripping away the supports, ripping away the assistance that has been vital to this industry developing as the world leader, ripping away all of this support base and assistance, and refusing to effectively consult the industry, refusing to reconsider their decision, refusing even to look at the impact that this decision is going to have, they are still there saying, 'Don't worry, we're behind you.' The glossy photos are still there. The platitudes in the introduction to the conference book are still there. The reality is that the government does not understand that manufacturing industry in this country has changed dramatically. It still has a 1970s view. It still has a Fraser government view-and that is hardly surprising when you consider that the industry minister is a refugee from the Fraser government. Within months of this government taking office, you have had the Heavy Engineering Manufacturing Association and other associated bodies vitriolic ally criticising the government for a lack of vision in the industry area and for its bias in favour of agricultural and commodity industries. The government does not understand the new industry policy framework that was built in the latter part of the period of the previous government. It does not understand the notions of enhancing competitiveness factors like research and development and skills and management and technological change and export market development. It simply does not understand the significance of these things, which have been going on overseas in Europe, the US and Asia for decades and which Australia was finally starting to get into-belatedly, but nonetheless was still getting into. Now we have got a government that simply wants to go back to the 1970s, and maybe even worse. """" Its only sense of what constitutes assistance and intervention is the old-style MCEwen intervention of jack up the tariffs. As far as this government is concerned, that is its sole picture of what industry assistance consists of. It really does not understand that things in and this country have moved a long way on from that sort of assistance to much more intelligent and sophisticated and targeted assistance that has been of great benefit to the emerging new manufacturing industries such as the fast ferry building industry that we are now seeing developed in this country. They do not understand some of the theoretical developments that have occurred in industry policy. Let us ask the minister what he knows about new growth theory, for example, or strategic trade theory or the landmark works of Michael Porter and the influence that they have had on industry policy throughout the world. There is a range of modifications to the neoclassical economic theories that all of these new developments bring. Certainly, they should influence how we see our industry assistance strategy. The current government is obviously unaware that any of this has occurred. In particular, the government does not understand this new industry, this new aluminium fast ferry building industry. It does not understand the critical role that government assistance has played up till now. It does not understand the enormous amount of government assistance that our competitors receive in places like Europe. It does not understand the enormous strides that have been made by the shipbuilders, the great innovation, the great genuine entrepreneurialism that has occurred in this industry, and particularly it does not understand that we have world leaders on our hands. How many times has Australia been able to claim in an area of manufacturing that we lead the world, particularly in an area that involves building such large, such expensive and such important products as these vessels? How many times have we been able to say that? We should be proud of this industry. We should be trumpeting our success to the world and we should be giving it every form of assistance that we can. In the Senate committee hearings on 1 November, John Rothwell-and this is an interesting contrast to what the member for Mitchell said about what the leaders of the industry were saying-said: The present government has shown very little interest in what the industry is doing. I think that is pretty much an understatement. This is not about picking winners, it is about backing winners, winners who, with a very limited amount of government assistance, have achieved enormous things for this country, for employment and for economic development in regions. It is about backing them. Instead of continuing the modest, the strategically targeted, assistance that the former government put in place, this government is now treating this very important growing industry with contempt. It should restore the bounty and urgently enter into proper consultations and discussions with this industry to consider how government at all levels can assist it to continue to grow. I do not pretend that as a result of these decisions this industry is going to collapse because it is too strong for that, it is too developed now and it is doing too well to collapse. But what this decision will mean is that this industry will be put in a vulnerable position, as against its competitors in Europe, at a critical time. Just when it has established its dominance, just when it is going ahead in leaps and bounds, all of a sudden it is going to be brought back to the pack. The opportunity that we are giving voluntarily to our competitors in Europe will be acted upon. It will be taken up and our industry as a result will stagnate for a period of time and will suffer. It may lose its dominant position and once it loses that position it is very hard to get it back again. It is a crucial time in the development of this industry and it is an absolutely extraordinary decision to withdraw an amount of money which totals less than $10 million over two years. To withdraw that at this time is an act of economic vandalism. In an industry where innovation is critical, where you have very demanding customers, where literally every vessel that is produced has to be an improvement on the previous vessel, where there are low profit marginsthere are not huge amounts of money being made out of this--every effort has to be made to sell the next boat. You do not have customers coming to you saying, 'I want 10 vessels over the next five years' or anything like that. Sales are done on an individual basis. This is a tough industry, this is a difficult industry, and we as Australians should be proud of the fact that our manufacturers from a very limited base have been able to go out and achieve what they have achieved in this area. Instead of the pride, instead of the support, instead of the consultation and discussion and interaction that the industry got from the former government, what it is now getting is not only the withdrawal of the bounty but it is being literally ignored by this government; it is being treated as if it did not exist. Believe me, that is how the leaders of this industry feel. They feel that they have been treated with contempt by this government and that this government simply does not understand what has been occurring in the industry. It has got no concept of what manufacturing well industry is doing in Australia in the 1990s. I urge the House to support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean) and to reject the bill and to support the retention of this bounty in particular and the other-{Time expired)",54
37,Mr MILES,BOUNTY LEGISLATION,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister) (1.40 p.m.)-I rise to support the Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill 1996. The member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) said that the rug had been pulled out from under the feet of some of these industries, that we were ripping away assistance, and that we did not understand. Unfortunately for the Australian economy, the rug was ripped out from under everybody's feet prior to the last election. I will illustrate that by saying that the record which we inherited from the previous government absolutely demanded that there be a new course, a new direction adopted by this government. I have no doubt that that is why the Australian people voted overwhelmingly, right throughout Australia, in every state and territory of this country, for the coalition. There was a tremendous amount of support for a change of government. It was because the Australian people had the rug pulled out from under their feet. The member for Melbourne referred to the shipbuilding industry in Australia. He said it had had the rug pulled out from under its feet. We are asking the shipping industry in Australia to contribute about $9.4 million to this huge debt which we have inherited. At the same time, there was some inconsistency in what the member for Melbourne was saying. He said that this is a vibrant, strong, and dynamic industry. Knowing the Incat industry in Tasmania, I can say that it is a dynamic industry. It has taken a lot of hard work; there is no doubt about that. However, when a country is left with a chaotic set of accounts, the incoming government has a responsibility to do something about it-not to ignore it, not to walk away from it, but to actually address the problem. We will say, over and over again, that this government did not create that $10 billion debt in the current account, but we are taking responsibility for doing something about it. We will address the problem. In the past there was no plan. The previous speaker said that governments ought to pick winners. That is the way in which governments probably operated throughout the 1960s and the 1970s, but I am absolutely amazed that somebody could come into a parliament in a Western country today and suggest that governments ought to be out there picking out which industries are going to be the winners. That is farcical. We are here as parliamentary legislators, and to suggest that we would have better information than the actual market to determine who the winners are is really quite fanciful. That is something from a bygone era It is very clear that, instead of moving on towards a new set of perspectives on the economy, instead of looking towards the year 2000 and onward, the economic approach of the members of the opposition is actually drifting back into the 1960s. We know that the opposit-- is struggling to find any policy position right across the front here in the different portfolio areas. This has been illustrated in this debate. Both the previous speaker and the shadow minister for industry and regional development talked about policies that have led to failure in this country. I would now like to go through some of the circumstances which those previous policies on industry and the underpinning of the economy led to. Those policies led to the worse economic downturn in 60 years. These are the policies which the shadow minister wants us to go back to. He would like us to go into another recession, probably the worse in 70 years. Home mortgage rates-these are fairly relevant-hit 17 per cent under the previous administration, and yet only yesterday we saw mortgage rates drop by another 0.5 per cent, to under nine per cent. The previous government's record was when it was at 17 per cent. Business loans were over 20 per cent. Business loans are down to somewhere about 11 per cent now. They say they want us to go back to their policies-they want us to keep providing all this money, like bounties, to businesses. It was those sorts of policies which actually led business to have to pay 20 per cent in interest rates. This government has had the capacity to pull down interest rates because of our policy. We have taken a tough position. We do not deny that, and we know that there are many Australian people and families and businesses who find some of these things difficult. But they would not have been difficult if the previous management had looked after the books instead of racking up a debt on the bankcard. Then, when it was all out of control, the Australian people said, 'Well, we've got to bring in a new government to try and sort out this mess,' and that is exactly what happened. But today we are seeing a debate where the opposition, the Labor Party, want to take us back to policy positions which would give us these huge interest rates. I have not done any calculations, but I suspect very strongly that the drop in interest rates from the high which we saw under the Labor Party of 20 per cent to between 10 per cent and 12 per cent for business now far greater magnitude and benefit to all businesses from which some of these bounties have been taken than the bounties. I suspect that that is true, if we were to go and those calculations. What are some of the other situations which previous policies led to? Household debt rose over $200 million, equivalent to nearly 70 cent of household disposable income. We noticed that the current account reached $27 billion in May 1995. About 15 months ago, this country experienced the worse current account ever: $2.7 billion in one month, and for that year it was $27 billion. It is incredible that a country so rich in resources could badly mismanaged that we would end up with a $2.7 billion current account deficit for month, and yet the opposition here want us go back to those policies, to go back to to create greater debt. This government in the position of handing on to our children and future generations a debt incurred because we liked to live it up in our time and which our children and our grandchildren are going to have to pay off in the future. We are about doing something about it and we intend to make sure that we make a dent in and reduce debt in this country. The last point in regard to illustrating the rug was pulled out from underneath the feet of the Australian economy is to say that foreign debt over the last 13 years under Labor government went from $23 billion to $185 billion. I notice there are a few people in the gallery at the moment and I know this is going out on radio. It is very interesting to ponder on the thought that the previous administration, under their industry policy and all the rest of it, increased our debt by $162 billion in 13 years. Those figures are beyond what any of us can actually imagine. For the first 83 years in this country our overseas debt went up by $23 billion. Then we had Laborthe previous administration in power here: in their 13 years it went up by $162 billion. That really does underscore the huge problem that we are faced with. Not only that, but a lot of that was Commonwealth debt. Mr Kelvin Thomson-It was private debt.",58
38,Mr MILES,BOUNTY LEGISLATION,"I am glad the member interis of jects. When Mr Keating became Prime these Minister the debt figure for the Commonwealth was about $33 billion. However, 4Yz years later it was $99 billion because he went do and borrowed from overseas banks. He did not tell the Australian people he did that to try to keep the economy on the rails, yet still it was running into debt. In 4Y2 years it went per from $33 billion to $99 billion. That is an also outrageous situation and it is the young people who are sitting in the gallery who are going to have to try to pay that off as they grow up and go into the work force. It is those circumstances which we are annoyed about as a government. There is one be so thing about it: the policy that we have brought in which affects the bounty schemes that is one way in which we can go about reining to in this horrendous debt, this mismanagement them that occurred under the Keating and Hawke is not Labor governments. To make a few points about the bounty schemes themselves, the bounty schemes were introduced to assist industries to remain internationally competitive. They are no longer considered to be an appropriate or cost-effective means of industry assistance. This is confirmed by the recent Industry Commission report which recommended that how bounty schemes be terminated. Bounties are being paid at declining rates of support in line with a general reduction in general tariff the levels. The Labor Party would like us to reduce tariff levels in lots of areas in the economy but they do not want us to reduce the bounties. What we are saying is that as Australians we have to share the burden equally. We believe the impact of bounties on industry development is declining in importance. This means that the cost of compliance and administration is unrealistically high. Terminating the bounties will result in a total saving of $8.5 million in this financial year, $14.8 million in 1997-98, $20 million in 1998-99, $46 million in 1999-2000 and $31 million in each year thereafter. What we have to remember is that while we are cutting these bounties to some in the business sector, at the same time in this budget we brought in a one billion dollar package of tax relief for families. So by cutting in some of these sectors we are able to provide tax relief to many ordinary Australians. The industries affected by the withdrawal of the bounties are strong, viable industries. We have heard that even from spokesmen from the opposition. Restructuring and efficiency improvements that have taken place in recent years will enable them to remain internationally competitive. These industries need to share, along with most other manufacturing service sectors of the Australian economy, some of the hurt and some of the load that goes with the government's economic rescue plan. We are sharing it around. It was a tough budget but it was fair, and that has been recognised by everybody throughout the community. In regard to the shipbuilding bounty, the Australian shipbuilding industry is one of the best in the world in the construction of small to medium lightweight vessels. The innovative use of materials and designs has had a real impact around the world as conventional ferries are being replaced by fast ferries. The economies created by faster turnarounds have created a bigger market for this type of craft and Australia's share of that market has increased from 25 to 30 per cent in recent years. Tasmania is justifiably proud of its ship builder, Incat Tasmania Pty Ltd, a business which manufactures and exports high-speed catamarans to various parts of the world. It has become a successful and profitable business. It is a frontier industry in the fabrication of aluminium, in the design of high-speed catamarans and in entrepreneurial marketing. One of the reasons why Incat is able to be competitive is because of the way in which they organise their industrial relations at that complex, a complex where there is no unionised labour. They are able to organise people so that some of those workers have varied times at which they go to work. Some of them voluntarily opt to work a lot more than the 38 or 40 hours which is average. Why? They do that because they like the business and they get well paid for their work. Obviously, the owner also gets a good product. The business is viable -4 That underpins another area in which the opposition would have us stay back in the troglodyte era of industrial relations when it is clearly time to move on. Australians voted on 2 March to move on and to change things. Incat is a very good example of how that has been changed to produce a very profitable business. Incat, as with other shipbuilders, has to accept a share of the burden in achieving the nation's economic recovery. The abolition of the ships bounty will save $9.4 million throughout 1997-98. The shipbuilding industry in Australia has a positive future and is well able to absorb the measures contained in this bill. The bill provides for transitional provisions to accommodate shipbuilders who, on the day of the budget, either had ships under construction or had already entered into contracts to be completed by 30 June 1997. It gives the builders an opportunity to change the structure of their tendering or their pricing of ships for anybody who wants to purchase one from them. Some people say, 'What about shipbuilders who, for various reasons, are unable to complete ships by 30 June 1997?' This is a feature of the existing legislation and has no connection with this bill or the decision announced in the budget. The withdrawal of the bounty for shipbuilding was recommended by the Bureau of Industry Economics in March 1995-under the previous Labor administration. This was a recognition on the bureau's part that Australia's shipbuilding industry had come of age and that it would be competitive without a bounty being offered. The date which the bureau suggested would be appropriate for the bounty to be withdrawn was 30 June 1997. This is the date on which the current bounty arrangement for shipbuilders is due to expire. It is also effectively the date on which this legislation phases out the bounty. The withdrawal of the shipbuilding bounty will result in the saving of $3.22 million this financial year and $6 million in 1997-98. Compare this with a total turnover in the ship and boat building industry in Australia of nearly $2 billion. Yet the Labor Party complains about taking $3 million off one year and $6 million off another year out of $2 billion. That is $3 million and $6 million out of $2,000 million, and yet members of the opposition are crying and wringing their hands and saying that it is going to destroy the industry. It was the opposition that left Australia with a huge debt of $10 billion. With this debt, the opposition pulled the rug out from under not only industry in Australia, but also from under Australian families. As I was saying earlier, this government certainly did not create this debt, but it will do something about it. We will not make future generations pay the debt which you left to this government. We are doing something about it now. The Labor Party wanted future Australians to have the bankcard mentality. It wanted to spend money frivolously, and not worry about how to raise the money or the taxes. It has been left for the coalition government to clean up the mess that members of the opposition left. There is no doubt that the position adopted by the government on this measure gives a very clear indication that this government is going to address the problems which we faced when we came into government. We will do something about itAn honourable member-What about 12 per cent growth and low inflation?",60
39,Mr MILES,BOUNTY LEGISLATION,"You might talk about that, but what about the 20 per cent interest rate that you left Australian business with? (Time expired)",62

41,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,"The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) will be leaving question time today at 2.30 p.m. In his absence after 2.30 p.m., the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Bruce Scott) will answer questions. MATHEWS, Mr ALBERT",62
42,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS," Mr Speaker, I seek your indulgence to raise a matter that I think will be of very great interest to all members of the House and, indeed, to all Australians. As everyone knows, next Monday Australians will observe Armistice Day, which commemorates the armistice which brought to an end the dreadful events of World War 1. It happens that next Monday will also be the 100th birthday of the last survivor of the original landing on the beaches at Gallipoli. The man in question, Albert Matthewsknown as Ted-who was born on 11 November 1896, is at the RSL Veterans' Retirement Villages in Sydney. This will be the last occasion the parliament will meet before his birthday. It is a moment of extraordinary historical significance that he will tum 100 on Armistice Day. He is now the last person alive who participated in that landing in April 1915. As such, it is an occasion for us again, as we so often do as Australians, to salute the extraordinary courage and commitment of all the men and women who have served this country in all theatres of war. A special place is reserved in the hearts of all Australians for those original ANZACs. They played such a special role in shaping the identity and the distinctive character of the nation that all of us love so much. Mr Matthews was a carpenter before the war began. He continued mainly in this profession after the war, although he also was involved in the travel industry, the selling of books and other entrepreneurial activities. He is a very keen reader, and I know he is very well cared for. He will be celebrating his birthday next Monday at the RSL Veterans' Retirement ViIlages. I will be attending the Remembrance Day service here in Canberra, so I have made arrangements to calI on him on Saturday morning. I will carry to that meeting the good wishes, the thanks, the affection and the tude of all members of this parliament and, indeed, all Australians. Honourable members-Hear, hear!",62
43,Mr GARETH EVANS,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS," Mr Speaker, I seek your indulgence briefly to support the remarks of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard). I would like it very much if you would also convey to Mr Matthews on behalf of the opposition our profound congratulations, best wishes and thanks for a life obviously marvellously weIllived and for a magnificent contribution that he, like all those who are no longer with us, made to the future of this country right back in those ghastly days of Gallipoli.",63
44,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,I will. Mr GARETH EV ANS-I think it is appropriate before battle is joined in question time that we join on occasions like this to express a common sentiment about those who battled for us so many years ago and who made us the kind of country we are today.,63
45,Mr SPEAKER,MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS,The armistice will continue for a moment longer. The Minister for Transport and Regional Development wants to amplify an answer. QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: NA Civil Aviation Safety Authority,63
46,Mr SHARP,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"Mr Speaker, I seek leave to add to an answer I gave to the House yesterday in response to a question from the honourable member for Calare regarding the Civil Aviation Safety Authority.",63
47,Mr SPEAKER,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,Proceed.,63
48,Mr SHARP,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"In my response I referred to a letter I had received from a Mrs Ingles. I said: I received a letter back in July of this year-I stand corrected on that date-from Mrs Ingles. the mother of a pilot who formerly worked for Falcon Air. That is what I said in my answer yesterday. I wish to place on record that Mrs Ingles's letter was dated 10 April. The reply to Mrs grati- Ingles, under the signature of my senior adviser, Mr John Wallis, was dated 12 July. I also stated in my response to the House yesterday: Mrs Ingles did not mention Fa1cQJ.l J:ir by name in her letter. She asked me to undertake an inquiry into all small airlines. So it was not a specific request to investigate a particular airline. In her letter, Mrs Ingles wrote: I feel compelled to request that something be done to investigate all small operations in the airline industry. I table the letters both from my office and from Mrs Ingles. Mr Speaker, that corrects the record. NA Unemployment",63
49,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister share the assessment of his Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Senator Vanstone, that this morning's labour force figures, which show an increase in unemployment to 8.8 per cent, are 'basicaIly very good news'? In particular, is it very good news that youth unemployment, with a 14.5 per cent increase from 87,000 last February to 99,600 now, seems to be well on target to reaching the figure of 158,000 unemployed young people the Prime Minister left behind him when he was last in office in 1983?",63
50,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I can say this: the figures that came out today were a great disappointment to you. I have you on tape. You said, 'I think you can never attach too much significance to any single month's figures, but there is every chance today that today's job figures wilI wipe'-an alIeged smirk off the face of my colleague. The fact is that you were rather hoping they would be a bit worse. That is consistent because you have been talking down the Australian economy and you have been trying as hard as you can to talk down the Australian economy. Mr Gareth Evans- Mr Speaker, I take offence at that imputation on my character that I would ever support worse unemployment figures. I ask that that imputation be withdrawn.",63
51,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is not regarded as a personal imputation to argue a political proposition. Heavens above! I think you are very sensitive. You have been talking down the Australian economy, and you know it. You have been talking it down. You have been saying that everything is dead flat, when we have 3Y2 per cent growth. You have been saying that we needed an interest rate cut because of low activity, when in reality that interest rate cut was a reward for wage restraint and a recognition that we now have a very low inflationary environment. The facts are that employment grew by 25,500 last month. Let me repeat that: employment grew by 25,500. I do not pretend for a moment that you can attach too much significance, as the acting leader himself has said, to one month's figures. Just as you carry on a treat because employment did not rise last month, if we adopted your stupid logic we would carryon a treat because it has risen on this occasion. Unemployment is still too high in this country. But that had been the case for years and years and years. You had 13 yearsMr Gareth Evans-It is going up.",64
52,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is worse, is it? Mr Gareth Evans-Yes, it is. It is going up.",64
53,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"He says that it is worse. Do you know how many net full-time jobs you created between July 1990 and March I996? Seven thousand one hundred. For the last six years that you were in government, you made a net profit of 7,100. You drove unemployment to a post-Depression high. You had 13 years, and you made a complete and utter mess. In replying to the question asked by the Acting Leader of the Opposition, let me say that I am not merely relying on reminding the Acting Leader of the Opposition of the legacy of the Labor Party and the fact that, when you were in power, you drove unemployment to a higher level than it had ever been since the Great Depression. You had 13 years to fix the problem. You left us with an unemployment rate of 8Y2 per cent, having driven it up to 11.2 per cent, and then tried to pretend that, in the good tradition of--{)h! Mr Gareth Evans- Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order, relevant to standing order 145. The Prime Minister has not addressed the question of youth unemployment, which was the nub and substance of the question. He has not even begun to address the eight per cent increase since March and the 14 per cent increase since February.",64
54,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order.,64
55,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is not just a question of rebutting what the opposition says and reminding the Labor Party of its appalling failure in the 13 years that it was in government. You were not in government for 13 months or 13 weeks or 13 days; you had 13 years. That is more than half a generation. You drove it to over 11 per cent and you left it at 8Y2 per cent-and you now have the nerve to lecture us about what to do about it. The gove(l1ment, from the moment it was elected, began to make changes to the Australian economy designed to lay the foundation of job growth. We have set about modernising Australia's industrial relations system. We are going to reform the waterfront and shipping area. We are revamping education and training systems and there is the introduction of the modern Australian apprenticeship and training system. We are revitalising skills for real job opportunities. We are rebuilding rural Australia through a number of initiatives. The logging industry decision-a decision that you opposed-is going to create jobs. Who voted against our logging industry decision in the Senate? The Australian Labor Party. Who voted to destroy jobs in rural Australia? The Australian Labor Party. Who criticised you? Even the CFMEU criticised you and said that you were out of sympathy with the interests of working men and women. It is not only the workers of Lindsay and the workers of the western suburbs who have given you away. As for the workers of rural and regional Australia, you could not give yourselves away in those parts of our nation. Mr Downer-Ask another one, Gary!",64

58,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The Minister for Foreign Affairs is not helping matters. Interest Rates,65
59,Mr GEORGIOU,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Treasurer. Given recent reductions in home loan mortgage rates as a result of the government's budget strategy and encouragement of competition in the provision of home mortgages, can the Treasurer advise the House whether there is any scope for fostering further reductions in mortgage rates?",65
60,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Kooyong for his question because, as all of Australia would know now, we have historically low variable mortgage rates in Australia-and the only people who are upset by that are the Australian Labor Party. The only people who hate low interest rates are the Australian Labor Party . You could not have seen longer faces than those of the Australian Labor Party yesterday as we saw variable mortgage rates tumble, as we saw the opportunity for Australian home buyers to get some breathing space against the high interest rates which Labor had inflicted upon them. We have seen, during the course of this year, standard rates fall from 10.5 per cent to jobs 8.75 per cent. The aggressive competitiondriven mortgage originators have now offered loans below eight per cent for the first in 22 years, since 1974-since the days the fathers of the Creans and the Beazleys used to pad around in the House of Representatives. These are the lowest rates that have been produced since their fathers were padding around in this place in the early 1970sand I am sure their sons will be padding around this place in another 22 years too. This government really does believe that competition can deliver increased benefits to home buyers. In 1988 the average spread on domestic major bank interest rates was around five points. It has been 3.8 per cent in the six months to March 1996 and we had the competition induced reduction in June. Competition amongst financial institul1-ns can drive margins lower. This government is committed to policies to keep the heat of competition up for the benefit of consumers. This government has announced a financial system inquiry to make recommendations to the government in March of next year so that we can tum the levers up in relation to competition and get better benefits for Australian home buyers. These are the kinds of falls in margins which this government wants to see. We realise that the climate has never been better for Australian home buyers, but we want to make it better still. We want to create better opportunities for Australian home buyers so that they will have, together with the family tax initiative, the opportunity through Christmas and New Year to see the kind of recognition that they deserve from a government which is committed to their hopes and aspirations and the sound economic management which will bring it about. Unemployment",65
61,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Isn't it the case that today's ABS figures show that trend unemployment is continuing to rise, trend employment is stalled, and we now have 20,600 fewer full-time jobs in Australia than we had two months ago? How then can the government say that it is bang on target for growth?",65
62,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As I said in answer to the Leader of the Opposition, irrespective of what time political party you are in, unemployment remains a major social and economic challenge for this country. That remains the situation. The member for Batman knows that if you are really serious about reducing unemployment in Australia you have to do two things. The first thing you have to do is achieve, over a sustained period of time, higher rates of economic growth than the rates we have at the present time which are, by world standards, quite high. I don't think anybody from the other side should be heard too loudly to argue that the rates of economic growth in Australia at the present time are anything other than quite high, because in reality there is not an enormous difference between what they are at the present time and what they were six or nine months ago. They are quite high. They are very good. But over a sustained period of time, in order to get unemployment down and keep it down, you need to have even higher rates of economic growth. Part of the way of achieving those higher rates of economic growth is to create the climate where people are induced to take greater investment risks. One of the ways you induce people to make greater investment risks is to reduce interest rates. You should understand that if the cost of borrowing money is reduced people are more likely to borrow. That is exactly the strategy. We have created a budget strategy which has made it easier rather than harder for the Reserve Bank of Australia to reduce interest rates. We are now seeing interest rates coming down. One of the consequences of those reduced interest rates will be higher levels of investment and those higher levels of investment over time will contribute to higher levels of economic growth. That is the first condition. Instead of criticising that, instead down the Australian economy, if you want to create greater job growth you should be talking up the Australian economy. You profess a concern about the unemployed. You shed crocodile tears about young Australians but out of the comer of your mouth you talk down the Australian economy. I really think you ought to examine your own motives. The other thing you have to do if you want to reduce unemployment is remove the structural impediments to job generation. In other words, you ought to support, not oppose, our industrial relations legislation. You ought to admit that your stupid job destroying unfair dismissal law created the problem we are now grappling with, instead of voting to phase-out junior wage rates, as you are doing at the moment in the Senate and thereby threatening 250,000-a quarter of a million-jobs of young Australians. You and your leader asked me questions about youth unemployment but in the other place you are voting to threaten the jobs of 250,000 young Australians. You come to the debate about unemployment with a flawed record, an imprecise policy alternative and absolutely no credibility. Rural Industry: Interest Rates Mr ruCKS-My question is directed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. Given the enormous contribution that our farming sector makes to Australia's well-being and the extremely difficult circumstances farmers have faced in recent years, and still face, I ask the minister: what are the benefits for farm industries in my electorate of Riverina and rural areas generally from yesterday's further reduction in interest rates?",65
63,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. It is very important that this very good news that constitutes the breakthrough of lower interest rates is fully passed on to the rural community. They are in desperate need of relief, and I hope that the banks will maximise the opportunities that arise out of it. Since we came to government, it has added to the earlier rates cut. When fully passed on, that will result in savings of $180 million to $200 million a year. That is very significant for the farm sector. That is of talking money that is desperately needed. Mr Costello-That's great. That is really good.",66
64,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It is-$200 million in interest alone. That is a major injection of money. Mr Costello-Why is the Labor Party against that?,66
65,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes. Why is the Labor Party against that? They were responsible for a lot of this damage in the first place. It reflects the fact that total farm debt as a result of 13 years of your mismanagement coupled with some other major problems in the bush have left us with a farm debt of about $18 billion. It is a very high level. The government is doing its bit. It does have a long-term commitment and this is reflected in a range of our activities, not least of all micro-economic reform and fiscal consolidation but also things like the drought recovery package-$81.5 million, bringing the total of new money since we came to government to $170-odd million. That recognises our commitment to the rural sector. Couple that with things like a business plan for agriculture with landcare and the heritage bill, a reform agenda of far-reaching consequences for the beef and wool industries, a visionary five-year approach to wheat marketing in this country and you have clear evidence of the government's commitment to agriculture. That is reflected in some comments made by John Cobb of the New South Wales Farmers Association. He said that he welcomed the announcement in relation to drought recovery as a recognition that the pain of a severe drought did not stop just because it rained. He went on to say: The terrible drought that still lingers in some of New South Wales was economically crippling to just about everyone it touched. It takes more than just a few short months of good pasture to recover from such a natural disaster and the Federal Government has understood this. That is a very welcome commentary. The banks tell me that they are prepared to give a long-term commitment to agriculture when they are encouraged to do so by a government that has a long-term commitment to agriculture. They did not actually see that in the previous regime's management. On the basis of the clear commitment that they now have from government, it is up to them to pass on the full benefits of the interest rate cut and to pass it on quickly and comprehensively. I do encourage them to match the government's commitment. With our long-term commitment to the substantial rebuilding of agriculture, we really do seek the maximisation of the interest rate reductions. I want to add to that that any further assistance that could be offered in the area of margins and costs would not only be welcome but also be very much in the interests of a vital part of the Australian economy. I note with some interest too what the NFF's John Watson has said about the cut of 0.5 per cent. He said: The decision represented a common sense reaction to responsible fiscal policy. That is what the NFF said. They also said: In addition to this welcome cut lP.lI0fficial rates, there is room for further trimming or"",ank margins, which remain among the highest in the OECD. They went on to say: There is still plenty of room for further reductions in business lending margins, particularly for the rural sector, which generally has a lower risk compared with other loans to business. The sooner that message is absorbed and acted on, the better. NA",67
66,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,"Before calling the honourable member for Curtin, I advise members that we have, from the state of Queensland, in our gallery this afternoon the Hon. Kevin Lingard, the Minister for Family Services and Youth Affairs and Deputy Leader of the parts National Party, and a number of other parliamentarians associated with the parliamentary criminal justice committee. A very warm welcome to you to the hill and may you enjoy your stay with us. Honourable members-Hear, hear! Mr Rocher-Could I defer to my colleague for a particular reason, Mr Speaker?",67
67,Mr SPEAKER,DISTINGUISHED VISITORS,Of course. The honourable member for Hunter. NA Chicken Industry,67
68,Mr FITZGIBBON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker, and I thank the member for Curtin. My question is also directed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. I can assure you, Mr Speaker, he will not enjoy answering this one so much.",67
69,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Let's get on with the and question. I may not enjoy it either.,68
70,Mr FITZGIBBON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I refer the minister his undertaking in this place yesterday with respect to the $100 million salmon industry, which is under threat from the government's proposal to import salmon which may be noise diseased. Will the minister give the same undertakings to the chicken industry, which employs some 50,000 Australians and which is also under threat from the government's proposal to import cooked chicken meat which may be diseased?",68
71,Mr ANDERSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This matter has been to exhaustively canvassed. I simply make the point that it is extraordinarily interesting in their cowardice they want to walk away from the process they put in train. They want to expose us to international ridicule in trade forums where for years, with the support of it. Australia's farm groups, we have pursued a stable and predictable set of international trade laws in the interests of major export industries like the beef industry and the sugar industry-a whole range of Australian indussame tries. We have pursued a set of predictable, realistic and stable trade laws. You put in place a process that you now want to walk away from. In my view that usmakes you a bunch of cowards, especially in view of the fact that your shadow minister over here made it quite plain that the proposal. You know the rules; you set them up. You know full well that there is a process in place for considering these matters. If you want to walk away from it, if you not want to hold to the very rules you set the very process your minister put in place and wanted to proceed with-he is the man you are expressing a vote of no confidence in-then good on you for your very poor interest attitude to Australia's interests.",68
72,Mr FITZGIBBON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, supplementary question.",68
73,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I will hear it.,68
74,Mr FITZGIBBON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I ask the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy: if heMr Reith- Mr Speaker, I have a point of order. My point of order is that it is unseemly out of the spirit of the standing orders for a member to bang his desk to obtain your attention. On that basis he should not be to given a supplementary question.",68
75,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,68
76,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is too much from my left. I did not hear the minister clearly. Would you repeat the point of order? Mr Reith-As the member got to his feet he was thumping his desk to call your attention. That is clearly disorderly and he should not be given a supplementary question.,68
77,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I listened very carefully the minister's point of order. It is a gentle reminder to you all that I will not tolerate that disorderly behaviour in the House. However, in the light of the clear undertaking I gave the member for Hunter a moment ago, I will hear the supplementary question before ruling on",68
78,Mr FITZGIBBON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My supplementary question is, as I said, to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. I ask the minister: if he is not prepared to give the ironclad guarantee to the chicken industry that he gave to the salmon industry in this place yesterday, can he tell us the difference between the two industries and can he tell",68
79,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The question is outside the' guidelines. The minister has he supports answered the question. Small Business,68
80,Mr BROADBENT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addo dressed to the Minister for Small Business up, and Consumer Affairs. I know that small business people in my electorate of MCMillan have been waiting for further interest rate relief and will be delighted with yesterday's rate cut. Would the minister explain to the House the benefits for small business I ask a of the interest rate cut?  MCMillan for his question. I acknowledge that the member for MCMillan is yet another member on this side of the House with small bu-iness experience, unlike the opposition which do not understand small business or the issues that confront it. I am pleased to inform the House and small business, with borrowings of some $51 billion, that under the policies of this government and the fiscal requirements we set, interest rates have fallen twice in the last four months. In fact, the benefit of that one percentage point fall and the flow-on effect to small business, on average, is $5,000 a year. The effect of the interest rate falls will mean that small business will have greater retention of money and profits to drive and grow their business. In addition to that, as my colleague the Treasurer mentioned, with the benefits of lower home loan rates, consumers will have more money to spend in driving business forward. Beside that point, the government's other policy initiatives on industrial relations have given small business huge relief from the exorbitant interest rates that they were burdened with under the Labor government. Now they can start, with confidence, to make expansion plans for their business. Small business know that to keep running budget deficits is not good for them. The government is going to borrow money to fund budget deficits and the community that will pay the price for that will be the small business sector. I am confident that the results of the interest rate reductions announced yesterday and in June will benefit the small businesses in the electorate of MCMillan, the small businesses that the member for MCMillan represents very well. Pharmaceuticals: Sweden",68
81,Mr ROCHER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr SPEAKER twice. My question is directed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Does Australia accept research into and development of pharmaceuticals approved by the Swedish government and its authorities? Is he aware of millions of dollars raised in Australia by Australians being diverted to Sweden for pharmaceutical research? Will the minister take steps to ensure that the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration becomes more user-friendly and positive in dealing with future applications for approvals of pharmaceutical research projects?",69
82,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Without notice I cannot give details about research funds going to one particular country, but I would be happy to find out and let the honourable member know. By and large we try to fund research on the basis of merit on a competitive basis. The predominant amount of research in the country comes through the National Health and Medical Research Council. It is true there is some research that comes from other sources-private sourcesand from around the world. Drug companies are a large part of this. .; With respect to Sweden and the TGA, again without knowledge of the specific details of that, I have difficulty telling the honourable member except to say that I would be concerned that the TGA operates in all its activities in as user-friendly manner as possible. It is something that we talked about in the last election and something we have tried to implement in the last seven months. We have made some progress with the TGA, particularly in how it looks at nontraditional medicines. Again, if there are some further details that the honourable member wanted to provide me with, I will undertake to get him an answer as soon as possible. His All Holiness the Ecumenical Patriarch of the Orthodox Church",69
83,Ms WORTH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware of the visit to Australia of His All Holiness the Ecumenical Patriarch of the Orthodox Church and can he inform the House of the plans for that visit? Is the Prime Minister aware of the importance of the visit to our large Orthodox community?,69
84,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am sure that all members of the House will welcome the visit in a few weeks time of His All Holiness the Ecumenical Patriarch, Bartholomew I. This will be the first occasion that the Orthodox patriarch has visited Australia. There is a nominal grouping of more than one million Australians within the Orthodox rite. It includes a very large portion of Greek Australians, Russians and people from the former Yugoslavia. I am delighted, on behalf of the government, to extend a welcome to His All Holiness. He will be accorded a guest of government status during his visit. He is the spiritual leader of more than 250 million Orthodox Christians around the world. His visit will be a marvellous opportunity to observe the contribution that hundreds of thousands of people of the Orthodox faith-Greek, Russian, Serbian, other parts of Europe and the Middle East-have made to the development of a very diverse, culturally and racially tolerant community in Australia. He will be visiting most states. He will meet a variety of religious, political and civic leaders. I will host a luncheon in honour of him as will the Governor General. I will also be represented at a special wreath-laying service at the Australian Hellenic War Memorial which commemorates those Australians and Greeks who fought together in the battles on mainland Greece and on Crete. On behalf of the Australian government, I want to wish him a very successful and rewarding visit. My only regret is that my departure to the APEC ministerial meeting halfway through his visit will mean that on one part of his journey to Australia, which includes a visit to my own electorate of Bennelong to observe the excellent work of one of the Greek welfare organisations, I will be absent from the country and will therefore not be able to receive him on my electoral home soil, so to speak. I hope he has a very enjoyable visit. He is an honoured guest in Australia. He is a very significant spiritual figure to many hundreds of thousands of Australians and a great person of stature and dignity throughout the world. Moore-Wilton, Mr Max Mr GARETH EV ANS- Mr Speaker, my question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Perhaps you will permit me the indulgence first, however, of saying that, on behalf of the opposition, we also very much welcome the visit to Australia of His All Holiness the Patriarch and hope and expect that the visit will be a successful one. Now back to battle again.",69
85,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Government members interjecting,70
86,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Well, two armistices in one day is a little bit rich. Mr Costello-We are happy to have another one, Gareth.",70
87,Mr GARETH EVANS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Just listen to this one, just listen very carefully. Will the Prime Minister confirm that Mr Max MooreWilton's pay arrangements for his second and third jobs-with the money going directly into superannuation-mean that he pays much less tax than would be the case if the Victorian government instrumentalities in question had paid him salaries? Is the Prime Minister comfortable and relaxed about sanctioning the country's most senior public servant entering into arrangements which are not available to ordinary workers and which are clearly designed to minimise taxation liability?",70
88,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"If you follow that logic, any employer of a person who takes some of his or her salary by way of a direct payment into a superannuation fund is indulging in that kind of practice. Let me repeat the arrangement. The arrangement is that for a transitional period that will end on 31 December Mr Moore-Wilton will continue to occupy two statutory appointments given to him by the Victorian government. He cleared those arrangement- with me and with the Victorian Premier. I do not apologise for those arrangements. He is now earning a vastly lower amount of money as Secretary to the Prime Minister's department than he would have earned if he had continued in the private sector. I have to say to you that, if you think this kind of nitpicking question penetrates in the Australian community, you are even more sadly out of touch than I think most of us believe you to be. Great Barrier Reef",70
89,Mr ENTSCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Sport, Territories and Local Government, representing the Minister for the Environment. Recently a number of concerns have been raised in my electorate regarding the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority's decision to selectively open a limited number of areas of the reef to recreational and commercial fishingMr Martin Ferguson-And increased reef tax. Mr Crean-What happened to the reef tax?",70
90,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,71
91,Mr ENTSCH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I will start again. Recently a number of concerns have been raised in my electorate regarding the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority'S decision to selectively open a limited number of areas of the reef to recreational and commercial fishing for research purposes. Can the minister assure the constituents in my electorate of Leichhardt that the research is being conducted for the long-term benefit of the reef?,71
92,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. The member for Leichhardt, like many Australians, is very concerned about the wonderful geographic phenomenon that is the Great Barrier Reef. This government is absolutely determined to ensure that it is going to have continued access for all Australians. Opposition members-Tell us about the reef tax.",71
93,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"For the members of the Labor Party: this is not a matter about reef tax or anything else; this is a matter of fundamental importance to the environment on the reef. What is proposed by the Great Barrier Reef authority, after having had considerable and lengthy public consultation, is to have some research into the impacts of line fishing on the Great Barrier Reef. I am pleased to report to the House that, after lengthy debate in the Senate yesterday, this research will, in effect, be an environmental impact assessment. It will provide, for the first time, clear information about the ecosystem and how it will respond to fishing pressure. The information is vitally important if we are to have sustainable and managed fisheries on the Great Barrier Reef. I should point out to honourable members and also to others that there are 500 reefs in the Barrier Reef, and that five per cent in the marine park are closed to fishing. Only eight of these reefs will be opened, and only for one year. This will be offset by closing eight reefs that are currently open for five years. Whichever way you look at it, the project will not be impacting on all of the remaining protected areas. The project will, in effect, impact on only 1.6 per cent of those reefs closed to fisheries, and only for one year. Ms Ellis-What happens after that?",71
94,Mr WARWICK SMITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will come to that. The project will look at the population, size, age and reproductive structure of fish on the reef. This is vital information for estimating what level of fishing is actually sustainable. The effects of line fishing.. will tell us what annual rate of fishing cau-es the fish stocks to change and how the fish stocks will respond to future changes in the fishing effort. Importantly, the project will also give us information about the relationship between the catch rate and the number of fish left in the water. The critical point is that GBRMPA is determined to avoid the errors and problems we have seen in other fish areas throughout the world. Without this information, we could see the fishing areas collapse, as has happened in other areas around the world. For the information of members, major matters were raised in the Senate yesterday. Firstly, I want to assure the House that all relevant legislation has been complied with and that the relevant acts will be complied with before any reefs are opened. Information was provided to the Senate yesterday and questions asked in the Senate by the opposition were responded to at length by Senator Hill. He made a number of commitments. The government is committed to ensuring that the information gained from this project is promptly applied to the management of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and that monitoring mechanisms will be put in place to ensure that irreparable damage is not caused. At the conclusion of the project, GBRMPA will move to rezone the green reefs so that they revert to their current status. Finally, for the benefit of the member for Leichhardt and other members, at the end of the first year, Senator Hill, as Minister for the Environment, will table a report in the parliament for the benefit and information of all members. I reiterate to the member for Leichhardt, to all members here and to the nation that the government takes seriously its commitment to the environmental protection of the Great Barrier Reef. This project will add to our store of knowledge to ensure that that can be achieved. Manufacturing Industry",71
95,Mr CREAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism. In the light of today's increase in unemployment and the Prime Minister's jobs test that he would 'ask of every policy initiative and every change the question: would it contribute to a generation of jobs?' is the minister aware of a recent report by the Industry Commission which states that Commonwealth government support for industry this year will hit an eight-year low and that next year it will fall by a further seven per cent? Given that these cuts will lead to further job losses, will the minister take a submission to the unemployment committee of cabinet proposing a vision for manufacturing industry and ways of achieving his target of 200,000 new manufacturing jobs by the year 2000?",72
96,Mr MOORE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Labor Party never learn. Every time they stand up to ask a question it is about the same old hackneyed way they have gone about all their lifespend some more money. In their years in government, they spent $70 billion more in the last five years than they raised. The outcome was that the government was left with a colossal deficit. The government has taken this matter up. We have produced a budget outcome which is already showing dividends in the form of reduced interest rates. The great question facing industry in Australia is investment. You will only get investment in Australia if you get a proper hold on government spending, if you get a proper response to microeconomic reform and if you get the labour law reforms through the Senate and allow labour markets to pick up. Investment will then flow and lead to jobs. That is something you never thought of. Immigration",72
97,Mr ZAMMIT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. Is the minister aware that the opposition and the minor parties in the Senate today have disallowed important migration regulations? What effect will this have on the ability of the government to manage its migration program in the national interest? Are the actions of the opposition and the minor parties in line with their previous public statements and policies.,72
98,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am aware that today in the Senate certain regulations that were enacted to deal with the significant problems that were associated with parts of the migration program have been disallowed. The actions of the opposition and the minor parties have been designed to limit our ability to deliver a migration program of 74,000. It is certainly designed to ensure that we cannot deliver a balanced migration program of 74,000. I want to assure the House that, with the blunt tools we have been left with, we will deliver a balanced program of 74,000 migrants for this year. Senator Bolkus, who moved the motion, is the architect of a program that was running out of control. He did this by the use of the euphemism 'facilitation'. Facilitation meant, when I started to look at the figures, that under his stewardship of the order of a 50 per cent reduction occurred in the number of offshore spouse applications being rejected for non bona fide reasons. In one year alone, we saw a 74 per cent increase in parent visas, which became more than 10 per cent of our total program. We saw a 32 per cent increase in spouse applications, which became more than one-third of the total migrants entering Australia.",72
99,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What about the commitment in your own policy?,72
100,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,We had a situation where six out of every eight applicants for migration entry to Australia came under the preferential and concessional family categories and only two out of every eight were able to enter Australia on the basis of skills that they had that might benefit Australia.,72
101,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,We thought you were profamily.,73
102,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,We had a lower skilled migrant outcome and a more highly dependent migration outcome as a result of the measures that you were implementing.,73
103,Mr KERR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That is not true. You were aware that the policy,73
104,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! I warn the member for Denison!,73
105,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That was the outcome. It was certainly not an outcome which was in the national interest. That is something that ought to be understood. There has been a great deal of concern, and some of it was offered in the Senate today, about some of the unfortunate debate we have had about the migration program generally. I would have to say that one thing that has certainly led to a lack of confidence in the way in which the migration program has been implemented in this country over time is the changes that occurred in the last 12 month.s in the way in which the program was operatmg. That is a matter that we have sought to address. I want to say something else about policies of other parties in this matter. The Australian Democrats and the Greens would have us believe that the number of migrants entering Australia should not exceed the number of permanent departures over the previous year. If you take the view that you ought to have what they call net zero migration, then you could have only 30,000 entrants in the migration program. If you had only 30,000 entrants in the migration program, you would certainly need far more draconian measures than we have put in place. In other words, you cannot argue against measures that are designed to deliver a program of 74,000 and have the public believe that you have any credibility on the issue of a net zero migration program. The Labor Party is faced with exactly the same difficulty. The Labor Party has been prepared to come into this House and say that they believe that the program number that we have set is an appropriate figure. Mr Beazley, the opposition leader, said: This is not a major point of disagreement between the Government and the Opposition. Yet today they have denied us the tools to be able to put in place a migration program of that order in a balanced way. This is the first time in Australian history that we have seen an elected government not allowed to manage the migration program. It is the first time in which we have seen the government of the day not allowed to administer the migration program in the public and national interest. Unemployment"""" It",73
106,Mr WILTON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister and concerns the creation of Australian jobs, a matter of paramount importance to me and I know to my father. I refer to the Prime Minister's jobs test, which states that the government would ask of every policy initiative the question: would it contribute to the generation of jobs? Does the Prime Minister's test apply to the workers in Maryborough in my home state of Victoria where 25 per cent of jobs depend on the book bounty? Will he ask his unemployment committee to urgently review its job destroying budget decisions?",73
107,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"After what we have heard from the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, any member who has the nerve to give us a lecture on destroying jobs ought to hang their head in shame. You are preventing the government of this country from having a more balanced immigration program. You are preventing the government of this country from altering the balance of our migration program in favour of skilled migration. You do not have many credentials to talk about anything. You do not have many credentials to lecture us on unemployment after that little performance. The honourable member asked me a question about a particular group of people in his electorate. Let me say by way of response to the honourable gentleman that his concern for those people is understood, proper and commendable. But I would also remind the honourable gentleman that all of the members of his electorate will, over time, enjoy far brighter employment prospects if the economic objectives of this government are achieved. If you were to pass our budget, if you were to stop filibustering on the budget in the Senate, if you were prepared to pass the workplace relations bill and if you were prepared to vote in favour of all the other measures that are designed to achieve fiscal consolidation, we would have a far greater prospect over time of having even lower interest rates. Lower interest rates lead to more investment and more investment leads to more jobs. Would you like me to repeat that? A fiscal consolidation produces lower interest rates, lower interest rates produce more investment and more investment leads to more jobs. If you want more jobs, more investment and lower interest rates, you will support our fiscal consolidation. Falcon Airlines",73
108,Mr NEHL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development. I refer to the crash near Cairns on Sunday night of a Falcon Airlines Piper Aztec aircraft.,74
109,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,74
110,Mr NEHL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Are you not concerned about people dying in crashes?,74
111,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Cowper will address his question.,74
112,Mr NEHL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will, indeed, Mr Speaker. I refer to the crash near Cairns on Sunday of a Falcon Airlines Piper Aztec aircraft. the minister advise the House what steps he has taken to investigate the surveillance of this operator by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority?",74
113,Mr SHARP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Cowper for his question. The aircraft involved-the Piper Aztec--crashed on Sunday evening just offshore from Cairns. Five people were extremely lucky to survive that crash. There are many parallels between this incident and that of the Monarch and Seaview crashes that saw the loss of seven and nine lives respectively over the last few years. There have been continuing allegations of a conflict of interest and questions about the proper surveillance of Falcon Airlines. Falcon was owned by Mr David Kilin. Mr Kilin was employed by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority as a flying operations inspector on 29 January this year. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority has advised me that he sold his shareholding in Falcon on 2 February to a person who shares the same address as Mr Kilin. I have been advised by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority that this operator has passed surveillance checks over the past six months. CAS A has advised me that a periodic inspection, completed on 16 January this year, found Falcon was operating to a satisfactory standard and there was 'absolutely no reason to increase surveillance'. A former pilot, Mr Craig Ingles, has also been reported as saying in the Courier-Mail that the aircraft in question had a history of mechanical problems and that hydraulic oil was leaking into the cockpit of another aircraft operated by Falcon. Yesterday a member of the public, Mr Valentine Saylor, was reported in the Brisbane Courier-Mail newspaper as saying that, while on a Falcon Airlines flight last September, the door of the aircraft flew open twice. Falcon is reported as denying such an incident took place and there is no mention of such an incident in the reports to me by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. On Tuesday I wrote to the Chairman of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority seeking night documents and information relating to Can CASA's response to complaints about Falcon Airlines. I sought comprehensive documentation and information concerning representations to CASA regarding this operator-what steps were taken at a board level, both to validate claims made against Falcon or CASA employees and what steps CASA had taken to ensure that the supervision of Falcon was adequate and not carried out with any possibility of a conflict of interest. The reply received from the Chairman yesterday evening was inadequate. In light of these conflicting reports, particularly the seriousness of the allegations levelled at Falcon and CASA's surveillance of this operator and the inadequate response by the Chairman of CASA to my explicit concerns, I have decided to order an inquiry by an independent third party. This inquiry will be undertaken by Mr Dennis Wheelahan, QC, and will examine CASA's surveillance of this operator and what steps were taken by CASA to avoid potential conflicts of interest. Subject to Mr Wheelahan being able to arrange his affairs to clear prior commitments, I would expect a report will be provided to me within two weeks of Mr Wheelahan commencing his inquiry. I have advised the Civil Aviation Safety Authority's Director of Aviation Safety, Mr Leroy Keith, of my action and I would anticipate CASA's full cooperation with this inquiry.

I refer the member to his Sydney Airport (Regulation of Movements) which appears on today's Notice Paper. In light of recent announcements by the government, would the honourable member for address Grayndler indicate why it is necessary for his bill to be given priority for debating and passing by this House?",75
115,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I thank the member for Watson for his question. I am particularly pleased,75

He of order thatshould not allude to any content that he may be considering in his second reading speech later today.,75
117,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I begin again by thanking the Watson. I am particularly pleased that he got to ask this question today. As my colleague and friend over many years, I have worked very hard with the member for Watson on issue of reducing aircraft noise in the suburbs of Sydney. The member for Watson great and outstanding record over 25 years in public life of standing up",75
118,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for Grayndler will address the question or resume his seat.,75
119,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"That is the point. That is why we need this bill. This has been an issue for over 25 years. The situation of aircraft noise in Sydney has continued to get worse over more than two decades. There is currently a growth in the number of airport movements in and out of Kingsford-Smith airport of something like 9.6 per cent. That continues to grow beyond that which was anticipated in the environmental impact statement. Mrs Sullivan-A point of orde. Mr Speaker. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the requirements of the standing order that the person responding to the question to why priority must be given. All the remarks that he has made so far go to the substantive matter. Therefore he should be Bill 1996 required to sit down.",75
120,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! I am going to the point of order already made. I am listening very carefully to the response of the honourable member for Grayndler. I take very substantial notice of the leader of government business in the House. I have made some preliminary comments. I want the honourable member for Grayndler to address very precisely the thrust of the question asked of him by the honourable member for Watson. If I hear him meandering, I will demand that he Mr Bevis- Mr Speaker, further to the point Mr Kelvin Thomson-You don't enforce that ruling in regard to ministers.",75
121,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The member for member for Wills! Contain yourself! Mr Bevis-Further to the point of order that the leader of government business raised and the comments that you have just made, the Mr Speaker, I take it that your ruling in relation to the question just asked of the has a member for Grayndler",75
122,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Absolutely. Mr Bevis-Applies to all answers to all questions?,75
123,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,No. Address standing order 143 and you will see why I am providing the member for GrayndlerMr Bevis-The member was answering the question,76
124,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,With the advice that I am giving him. Resume your seat.,76
125,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,If I can continue,76
126,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,And conclude fairly quickly.,76
127,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I will just continue. With due respectMr Tanner-Where does it say that?,76
128,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Standing order 143.,76
129,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My bill, which allows for a cap of 80 movements, would be a line in the sand. It would send a message to residents around the airport that we understand that there is a limit to the capacity also that we need a second airport in Sydney.",76
130,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! The honourable member for Grayndler will resume his seat. The honourable member for Moncrieff wishes to raise a point of order. Mrs Sullivan- Mr Speaker, you would be aware-as should every member of this House-that recently the Procedure Committee reported in detail on this very point. It pointed out what the practice has been on questions to backbench members. The committee recommended, and that was supported by both the leader of government business and the leader of opposition business, that the long standing practice in relation to this type of question should be adhered to; that is, the question should only be of a technical nature and answers should not go to the substance of the bill. Mr Bevis- Mr SPEAKER ",76
131,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Resume your seat: I am addressing a point of order. I am aware of the findings of the Procedure Committee. I am not yet aware that the government has decided whether to accept the advice. But I do understand that Mr Lee- Mr SPEAKER ,76
132,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have not ruled on it either. I do understand it is under consideration. I understand that the recommendation of the Procedure Committee is to retain the standing order. I refer the honourable member for Grayndler to the question. Be very precise and specific in your response where it covers the technical data requested by the honourable member for Watson.,76
133,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Can I say, Mr Speaker, that the members who represent areas around the airport certainly know why there is an urgent need for my bill to be considered by this House. They know that aircraft are going over people's houses",76
134,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We are talking about specifics. If you cannot be more specific, resume your seat. Mr Bevis-I raise a point of order. There is nothing in standing orders 143 or 144 that reads down questions asked of a member in pursuit of standing order 143. There is nothand ing in the standing orders that would support a view that questions asked of a member other than a minister in relation to standing order 143 get read down in relation to any other standing order.",76
135,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,It is not being read down. It just requiresMr Bevis-My earlier point was that your earlier ruling applies equally to questions asked of ministers and answers from ministers. You indicated that was not the case.,76
136,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! We are addressing the response of the honourable member for Grayndler. Resume your seat.,76
137,Mr HOLDING,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"On a point of order: I refer to standing order 143. There is no suggestion in the standing order that the question of relevance, when directed to a member of the House as distinct from a minister, requires any different standard of relevance. If there is any authority for that, I will be obliged if you can inform the House. I do not think there is one-in which case, so long as the member is relevant, he has to be judged by the same standards as are applied to the ministry. There cannot be a separate test in this matter. Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, in response to the member for Moncrieff, you referred to the government's view, or the lack of it, in respect of the report of the Standing Committee on Procedure. In fact, you should know that, on behalf of the government, I wrote to the committee and advised the committee that the government acknowledges and supports the committee's concluding view that the limitations on the scope of questioning, as embodied in standing order 144, should be strictly enforced; furthermore, that if there be any abuse of these standing orders the government reserves the right to revisit the issue; and, lastly, that questions to members on these matters should only be permitted occasionally and be consistent with the terms of the standing orders and the long standing practice and convention of the House that any answer to such a question must be very strictly enforced as to the substance of the question, namely, the procedural matter and the urgency for that particular matter. Mr Leo MCLeay- Mr Speaker, on the point of order that was raised by the Leader of the House: I think the point that the Leader of the House makes about consistency here is absolutely correct. What the member for Grayndler is trying to do, with a lot of objections from the government, is to precisely answer the same sort of question that the Prime Minister, when he was the Leader of the Opposition, had his colleague Mr Abbott ask. We let Mr Abbott ask the Prime Minister his question and we would like to get on with ours, thank you very much.",76
138,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I call the right honourable member for New England. Mr Kelvin Thomson-You've got plenty of experts.,77
139,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! We are addressing a number of points of order simultaneously.,77
140,Mr SINCLAIR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order and it specifically",77
141,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,77
142,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,77
143,Mr SINCLAIR,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I would rather like the House to come to the attention that it deserves. As far as the relevance of questions to members is concerned, I draw members' attention to the comparison between the two particular standing orders: one relating to questions that may be put to a minister, which is standing order 142, and standing order 143, which is questions that may be put to a member. The distinction lies predominantly in the words that are added to questions that may be put to a member when they add the words 'connected with the business of the House'. The restraint in the questions that may be put to a member are entirely contained in that restraint, and it is because of the narrowness of the question and 'connected with the business of the House' that the disposition of the question must be narrowed in a way that the Leader of the House directed and you yourself suggested when you first called on the honourable member. <!J. There have been consistent rulings by successive ministers which have identified that restraint. I suggest to you that there is only a very narrow ambit within which any member can answer a question asked of him by another member. I suggest that the honourable member at the moment is straying way outside that restraint. Mrs Sullivan- Mr Speaker, I rise on the point raised by the member for Melbourne Ports and point out that, as well as the standing orders, we have a House of Representatives Practice and it was to that issue that the Standing Committee on Procedure particularly addressed itself, at the request of the present Leader of the Opposition when he was then Leader of the House. It was something he raised that the committee was pursuing and to which both the present Leader of the House and the present Manager of Opposition Business responded. The situation according to House of Representatives Practice is: Questions most often allowed have concerned private Members' bills listed as notices on the Notice Paper. However, if the answer to such a question would require the Member to anticipate what he or she might say in the second reading speech, the question is anticipating debate and is therefore out of order. Mr Speaker, I submit to you that the member for Grayndler is giving an answer which is out of order. The fact that a previous Speaker once did not follow this does not in any way excuse what the member for Grayndler is trying to do now.",77
144,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! I have listened to all of the points of order. I am very much aware of page 514 of House of Representatives Practice, which has just been drawn to my attention. In the preamble that I gave to the member for Grayndler, I did confine him to certain parameters, which I am following fairly carefully. I want you to address the question in very precise terms and not to anticipate any of the comments that you will make in your second reading speech.",78
145,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I certainly do not intend to anticipate debate, but what I am doing today is exactly what the Prime Minister did in response to a question on 26 September 1995 when he said that he intended to take every advantage of this practice. The reason why we need to bring up this debate-and I will conclude on this",78
146,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Resume your seat.,78
147,Mr ALBANESE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The Prime Minister introduced the curfew bill last year, and on 26 June 1995 he said: It would make it the law of Australia, a law that could not be altered, except by another act of parliament. Mr Downer-What is this if he is not defying your ruling?",78
148,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! You have concluded your response. Resume your seat.,78

152,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I warn the member for Grayndler. Remembrance Day,78
153,Mrs WEST,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Minister, I recently had the pleasure of representing the Prime Minister at a wreath-laying service at Martin Place cenotaph in Sydney. There were a substantial number of people present on this occasion; however, it occurred to me that the significance of such events is beginning to diminish in the general population. Could the minister advise me and the House what the government is doing to increase the awareness of such occasions-in particular, Remembrance Day this coming Monday? Mr Leo MCLeay-Why didn't the minister go himself?",78
154,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for Watson will be going elsewhere in a moment!,78
155,Mr BRUCE SCOTT,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. I thank the member for Bowman for her interest in this very important subject. As she said, next Monday is 11 NovemberRemembrance Day. I can assure all members of this House that it is a very relevant day to all Australians. The eleventh of November is the day to remember the armistice that brought to an end the Great War of 191418-the war that cost 61,720 Australians their lives. It reminds us all of the day that secured peace for the world for 21 years. Remembrance Day is a day for us all to remember-in particular, those who gave their lives so that we can live in peace. It should also be a day for us to reflect on the price the that others have paid for that peace, the value of peace and the commitment to defending peace. Next Monday there will be services held throughout the country to commemorate the peace that that armistice of World War I delivered. I invite all Australians to attend one of these services and reflect for a moment on the sacrifices made by successive generations of Australian service men and service women so that we may live as we do today. I will be attending a service at the Shrine of Remembrance in Brisbane and, following that service, I will be unveiling Australia's National Freedom Wall on Mount Coot-tha. The wall is covered with almost 16,000 plaques that have been purchased by people all around Australia, by local government and by school children. For many Australians, some of those plaques represent the only significant headstone for many who lie in foreign soils and, for those families, that wall is extremely significant. Finally, I remind honourable members of an important Remembrance Day tradition which is not adhered to as often as it could be in recent times. Since 1919, it has been the practice to observe two minutes silence, as the then Governor, Sir Ronald Munro Ferguson, said, 'To remember in silence and with heartfelt gratitude to the men who fell in the Great War.' I encourage some bipartisan support to enlist all members of this parliament to urge their friends, their colleagues, their constituents, wherever they are and whatever they are doing, to pause at the eleventh hour on the eleventh day of the eleventh month in silent contemplation just for two minutes. Remember the gift of peace and the price that was paid for it. Sixty-one thousand, seven hundred and twenty Australians gave their lives. Surely we can all give two minutes of ours. Gun Control Campaign  Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister assure the House that neither his chief political adviser, Mr Morris, nor his parliamentary secretary, Senator the Hon. Nick Minchin, had any discussions or communications in relation to the national gun control education campaign at any time between 28 July 1996 and 10 September 1996 with any employee of DDB Needham Adelaide, any employee of Burson-Marstellar Canberra or any representative of Wirthlin Polling? Can the Prime Minister guarantee",78
156,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,No wonder you ask questions to your own side. You have run out of questions.,79
157,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! The member for O'Connor.,79
158,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I could not hear that point. Could it be repeated?,79
159,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"This is a very serious question. There is too much background noise in the chamber. Will the honourable member repeat the last part of his question?  Needham Adelaide, any employee of BursonMarstellar Canberra or any representative of Wirth1in Polling? Can the Prime Minister guarantee that Mr Morris had no contact with Mr Jonathon Gaul in regard to the gun control campaign prior to 8 August 1996?",79
160,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That is a very detailed question asking for precise answers in relation to alleged conversations or the absence of conversations which mayor may not have any significance. What I will do is take it on notice and come back to him. Borrowing Program,79
161,Mr HOCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Finance. Has the minister seen a recent report that the Commonwealth's net borrowing program will fall dramatically as a result of the government's $4 billion deficit reduction commitment in this financial year? Is this report accurate and is it the case that, as a result of the governmlnt's deficit reduction program, the value of Commonwealth debt repayments is expected to be greater than the value of new debt issued?",79
162,Mr FAHEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I can confirm that I have seen the report in the Sydney Morning Herald that was entitled 'Treasury warns of market shake-up'. I am happy to acknowledge that the report itself was accurate. The financial markets may well be shaken up at the prospect of having to give up some of the lucrative lending to the Commonwealth which they got used to during the years of Labor's dependency on debt and deficit. The Australian Financial Markets Association were told this week that, as a result of the 1996-97 budget, the net borrowing program of the government would fall to just $700 million-down from $14 billion in the 1994-95 year. They heard first-hand from a Treasury official that, between the end of June 1997 and the end of June 2000, the volume of Commonwealth government securities on issue is expected to fall from a current high of 23 per cent of gross domestic product to a low of around 16 per cent of gross domestic product. The commitment of the government to achieving a budget surplus means that in 1997-98 the net value of Commonwealth debt repayments is expected to be greater than the value of new debt issued. That means that we are paying off Labor's bankcard bill, not adding to the· debt. It means the end of the Labor debt drip. It means that the Labor Party policy of intergenerational debt transference is coming to an end. It means the beginning of starting to pay our way, of living within our means. Some in the financial markets might regard the end of debt dependency as a shake-up, but the government offers no apology for this. This government is committed to moving the budget into surplus and reducing public debt. That is the Howard government's contribution to reducing the foreign debt that the Labor Party racked up over 13 years. It is about time that, in the interests of this nation, the Labor Party joined the government in ensuring that the budget we have put in place, the budget that will bring about deficit reduction, is passed as soon as possible. Public Schools Funding  to the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training. Is the minister aware of a table prepared by his department which shows the projected level of growth in Commonwealth schools funding in real terms-and I emphasise real terms, not the nominal figures he loves to quadruple, count and cite? Does this table show the real level of Commonwealth tied funding for schools falling each year from $1.385 billion in 199697 to $1.298 billion in 1999-2000? Will the minister now cease his absurd claims about an extra $2.3 billion for government schools and frankly acknowledge that the cut in tied funding, together with the cut in general revenue assistance to the states, means that the Commonwealth's contribution to the funding of public schools is set to fall substantially? Does this give effect to the coalition's long-term ideologically-driven plan expressed by him secretly in opposition and hidden in the election to deliberately encourage students to move from the government to the non-government sector?",79
163,Dr KEMP,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The ideological Left in the Labor Party is today in complete disarray over schools policy because the fact is that the Commonwealth's spending on government schools over the next four years will be rising in real terms. I have had the department calculate the real increase in funding that be flowing to schools from the Commonwealth through the specific purpose grants program and through the financial assistance grants. I can inform the honourable member for Sydney that the Commonwealth contributions to government schools through these grants programs will grow by four per cent in real terms between 1996 and the year 2000. The fact is that the Left of the Labor Party simply cannot accept the fact that this government has given the highest priority to ensuring quality education and choice for Australian parents. We are determined to raise the quality of schooling in the government sector and in the non-government sector. When you start to see past your ideological blinkers, you will be able to accept the fact that at last someone has picked up the flag on behalf of government school quality and put in place programs that will give government school students literacy and vocational education programs that will lead them on to real jobs.  the answer to this question which refutes what he is saying. The fact is that his government has cut financial assistance grants by $1.5 billion. Leave not granted. Dunlop, Sir Edward 'Weary'",80
164,Mr LIEBERMAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister able to tell the House whether he will be able to join the people of Benalla on Sunday to honour the memory of Sir 'Weary' Dunlop in Sir Weary's old home town?,80
165,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am able to inform the member for Indi that it will be my very great pleasure to attend a ceremony in the very fine city of Benalla in his electorate associated with the unveiling of a very impressive memorial to the late Sir Edward 'Weary' Dunlop. In the words of Sir Ninian Stephen, who delivered the eulogy at his funeral service in Melbourne in 1993, Weary Dunlop probably joins Mawson and one or two Australians as one of the most revered people who have ever given service to this country. It is remarkably appropriate that this ceremony should take place on Remembrance will Sunday. Weary Dunlop's great contribution to humanity occurred during World War II on the Burma-Thailand railway and subsequently as a medical practitioner. He was a very remarkable person. I understand he was the first Victorian to ever play rugby union for Australia. Along with that, he achieved many remarkable things for his country. The greatest thing he achieved was the undying affection, respect and admiration of those people he served on the Burma-Thailand railway and those people he cared for in his robust, compassionate and earthy fashion for so many years after the war. He was a very great Australian. I know that, in attending this ceremony on Sunday, I will be conveying the sentiments of all Australians towards a remarkable member of our own human family. On that note, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. NA",80
166,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"Yesterday the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) raised a matter of privilege in connection with a letter he had received expressing views on maters of immigration and related issues, and concluding with a threat to him. He also referred to telephone calls of a similar nature received in his office. The honourable member subsequently made further comments to me and provided me with a copy of the letter. Firstly, in relation to the letter, the substance of the honourable member's complaint is that the letter amounts to improper interferas ence in the performance of his duties as a member. I have examined a copy of the letter the honourable member has provided to me. The letter is quite irrational and grossly offensive. Whilst I recognise it is important that members be protected from improper interference in the performance of their work, the fact is that this letter, unfortunately, is anonymous. In these circumstances, I am not prepared to allow precedence to a motion on the matter on the basis of the letter alone. However, in discussions which I have had with the honourable member for Calwell, he reported to me that he has been informed by other honourable members that, following the parliament's unanimous passing of a motion on immigration and related issues last week, a number of members have received similar letters and telephone calls. I share the member for Calwell's concern that this may be a broader phenomenon which poses a challenge to MPs in the performance of their duties. I would, therefore, ask those members who have received such letters or telephone calls to contact my office. I will then determine whether to recommend further action to the parliament. QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: NA Member for Capricornia",81
167,Mr SHARP,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"Yesterday, tAe)honourable member for Melbourne asked me a question to which I was unable to provide adequate detail in my answer and I said I would get back to him with a response as soon as possible. Today, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority has provided me with detailed advice on the question asked by the honourable member for Melbourne. Following a report to the Civil Aviation Safety Authority by a maintenance organisation in December 1995 that the honourable member for Capricornia had personally carried out maintenance on his Cessna 310 aircraft, a survey of the aircraft was conducted by the authority which showed that unauthorised, substandard maintenance had been undertaken. The regional Civil Aviation Safety Authority office did not recommend, the honourable member for Melbourne claimed, that the matter be referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions for prosecution. On 3 September 1996, following an investigation of the matter, the District Airworthiness Manager in Townsville recommended: ... on the basis that Mr Marek had no previous airworthiness history of non-compliance, the appropriate enforcement action would be formal counselling of Mr Marek in accordance with CASA's enforcement policy. The Regional Manager agreed with the proposed approach. To further answer the honourable member for Melbourne's questions, the decision not to prosecute the member for Capricornia was not taken, as the honourable member for Melbourne claims, by the Deputy Director of CASA, Mr John Pike, after the March 1996 federal election. As is normal practice, the District Airworthiness Manager discussed with the regional manager the question of what action should be taken in relation to the maintenance deficiencies that had been identified. A range of possible enforcement actions were discussed. The regional manager advised the Deputy Director about the investigation. The Deputy Director asked whether the aircraft involved was used in private or commercial operations. The Direct Airworthiness Manager in Townsville advised: ... Mr Marek had no previous history of airworthiness non-compliance and operated the aircraft privately. Under CASA's enforcement procedures, one of the enforcement actions available to CASA is formal counselling. It is standard CASA practice to engage in a formal counselling process in relation to regulatory breaches, particularly where such breaches do not involve commercial operations carrying fare paying passengers. Such procedures are designed to achieve a higher degree of aviation safety by encouraging voluntary compliance by the industry in appropriate cases. The member asked whether the decision was taken in the face of further protests from the Civil Aviation Safety Authority's regional office which pointed out that another pilot had been prosecuted recently for very similar offences. I am advised by CASA that this is also not correct. I am advised: In discussions between the Regional Office, the District Office and Central Office reference was made to an earlier case which had been referred to the DPP. However, the Regional Manager agreed with the approach recommended by the District Airworthiness Manager in Townsville in this particular case. Those actions were not taken with my knowledge, authorisation or instruction. My office was advised orally by CAS A in early September 1996 of the decision taken to proceed with formal counselling action of Mr Marek. That was the first advice of any airworthiness matter involving Mr Marek. My office was not advised of the detail on the occasion for the counselling but of the fact of it. It was further orally advised by CASA that the results of the counselling had been satisfactory. It would be inappropriate for me to intervene in enforcement actions taken by CASA. No favoured treatment-I repeat, no favoured treatment-was sought for Mr Marek at any time, nor was any given. I, therefore, take this opportunity to totally refute the claims made by the honourable member for Melbourne. In addition, I will table all of the information provided me today by CASA, which further substantiates this answer.",81
168,Mr SPEAKER,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,Order! Airworthiness is something that is very near and dear to the hearts of all MPs at whatever level they travel. This is probably an appropriate time to invite the honourable member for Capricornia to make a personal explanation. NA,82
169,Mr MAREK,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Capricornia) (3.36 p.m.)Mr Speaker, I seek leave to make a personal explanation.",82
170,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Do you claim to have been misrepresented?,82
171,Mr MAREK,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"Yes, most grievously.",82
172,Mr SPEAKER,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,Proceed.,82
173,Mr MAREK,PERSONAL EXPLANATIONS,"The member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner) asked a question of the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) in which he alleged that I had been found by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority to have performed illegal maintenance on my aircraft and that ministerial intervention had procured favourable treatment for me. I am the holder of a current private pilot's licence with a twin endorsement and the owner of a Cessna 310 aircraft. On 30 September, Mr George Ivory and Mr Peter Bryant of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority interviewed me regarding irregularities in the maintenance of my aircraft. The visit, they said, was to ensure my understanding of my responsibilities as a pilot as distinct from those as a licensed aircraft maintenance engineer. They accepted that, with respect to a defect notice, most of the responsibility rested with licensed aircraft maintenance engineers in the past. The interview was concluded satisfactorily by the statement that no action would be taken against me and there appeared to have been a misunderstanding. As far as this case is concerned, it is now closed. At all times I have sought to comply with the obligations set by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority. I recognise the need for my aircraft to be appropriately inspected by licensed aircraft maintenance engineers and for necessary approvals to be issued before flight. I have appropriately met my responsibilities and recognised that it is only if I failed to rectify the defects and did not abide by the regulations, as with any other individual, questions about prosecution would arise. As far as I am aware there has been no basis on which any decision to prosecute me has been taken.

209,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"Chisholm-Minister funding for Health and Family Service- -.45 p.m.)by leave-In September 1936, the Governor General made an Order in Council which established the National Health and Medical Research Council to assume the role of advising the Commonwealth, the states and of the the community on health matters and the allocation of funds for medical research. This year, the National Health and Medical Research Council is celebrating 60 years of providing Australian governments with expert advice across the great range of issues that fall under the health portfolio. At the first formal meeting of the NHMRC held in Hobart in February 1937, the then Commonwealth Minister for Health, Billy Hughes, said: Australia, priding herself on being a nation, ought not to be satisfied to follow, to imitate, to duplicate. She must blaze a track for herself, seek to lead rather than follow: and this calls for the services of specialists of high repute to train, inspire, and guide research along right lines. At the time Australia was struggling with diseases such as poliomyelitis-a struggle which was to continue until the vaccine was introduced in 1955. Whilst we may no longer worry about the spread of polio, the challenges we still face in population health are great. Today skin cancer in Australia is still the highest per head in the world; HIV-AIDS, after 15 years of being with us, still has no cure; and, although reduced, we are still working out why our young continue to die of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. I would like to pay tribute to the dedication and, to a significant extent, voluntary contributions of all members of the council, its many committees and the wider community of health and medical professionals who have assisted the council with its work over these 60 years. When the government announced its health throughout life program it drew attention to its broad priorities for investment in health and medical research and a culture of evidence based practice in health care. The National Health and Medical Research Council has supported these priorities, as can be illustrated by the 1997 research grants. The 1996 budget provided significant funding increases for health and medical research through a number of initiatives, not only for the National Health and Medical Research Council. Australia contributes about two per cent of the world health and medical research effortwell above what might be expected from our population base. This level represents an investment in health and medical research across all disciplines by government, private bodies and the business sector. It means that Australia has a role in the international research scene as a significant player. It punches above its weight. The National Health and Medical Research Council funds about 22 per cent of Australia's health and medical research activity. This research represents the very best of Australian health and medical research with funding being awarded only to those who meet extremely stringent standards. It therefore gives me the greatest pleasure to announce today that I have approved health and medical research awards worth $159.8 million to be made by the National Health and Medical Research Council in 1997. These awards, which include research project grants, large program grants, block grants to institutes and a range of career and training awards are a demonstration of the government's commitment to maintaining Australia's highly regarded health and medical research base. The funding of $159.8 million covers research which is continuing from previous years to the value of $96.6 million; new and renewed research awards totalling $54.7 million; and funding allocated for special research projects. Australia has a worldwide reputation for the quality of its health and medical researchdemonstrated in the last few weeks with the announcement of the award of the Nobel Prize for medicine to Professor Peter Doherty and Dr Rolf Zinkernagel for work they did 20 years ago at the John Curtin School of Medical Research when both were young postdoctoral researchers investigating cells which form part of our body's immune system. Not least as part of Australian research efforts funded by the National Health and Medical Research Council, strokes and heart attacks have been reduced by half over the past 25 years, saving 54,000 lives from strokes alone; cot deaths have been reduced by nearly half in two years; kidney failure has been prevented in thousands of Australians; cost and illness associated with stomach and duodenal ulcers has been reduced by the discovery of a bacterial cause and a short course of treatment. We must recognise that research does not produce overnight results. Funding of research is a long-term investment to gain improvements in health. It is important that the support of basic research such as that conducted by Doherty and Zinkernagel is maintained at the same time as targeting research funding to areas of health concern requiring more immediate attention. A number of significant links have been forged with other countries and other research funding bodies. The National Health and Medical Research Council has established memorandums of understanding on research cooperation with Germany and Switzerland. It has been involved in cooperative workshops with Japanese researchers. It has an arrangement for exchange training fellowships with its equivalent organisation in France and shared funding arrangements with the Menzies Foundation for a training fellowship to be held in the United Kingdom. These are important partnership activities. Also important for Australian health and medical research is the investment of overseas funding bodies in Australian research. I am also delighted to announce that the Wellcome Trust of the United Kingdom has advised me that next year, in recognition of the strength of Australian science and the impetus given by the increased funding for health and medical research in this year's budget, it will commit funding for the support of Australian medical research at approximately 2Y2 times its current level. This increase will bring the Wellcome Trust contribution to Australian medical research to about $10 million per annum. The Wellcome funding will be provided for various purposes. A significant portion will be to enable researchers to purchase major items of equipment-a very valuable contribution to the research effort. Other funding will be for a range of fellowship and training awards, especially for collaborative biomedical research work in the Asia-Pacific region. Australian researchers will also have access to Wellcome Trust grants in the area of population and reproductive health studies. Among the new research grants to be awarded by the National Health and Medical Research Council in 1997 is one to the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research-an outstanding example of Australia's contribution to the international medical research scene-which will receive renewed funding for five years for its wide range of research programs which cover aspects of diabetes, cancer and malaria. The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute will receive over $8 million per annum as a block grant towards its investigations of the complex cellular and genetic mechanisms of the body. Another area of research to receive considerable new funding in 1997 is into musculo-skeletal diseases. This includes $1 million for new studies relevant to arthritic diseases. A number of projects will be funded, including a study at the University of New South Wales, which will assess the most appropriate and cost-effective treatments for common arthritic conditions. Research into asthmatic disease will also receive considerable funding. Over $1 million will be awarded for new research projects investigating aspects of asthmatic disease, including the links between various allergens and the development of asthma, preventive strategies and appropriate medication. Research projects and training awards in the area of HIV-AIDS will amount to $4.7 million in 1997. The problem of youth suicide will also receive attention. Studies will be funded into adolescent depression, deliberate self-harm and substance abuse. One of the projects will include a collaboration with the Victorian Department of Education to provide suicide prevention health education programs in Victorian schools. Another will be investigating the long-term effectiveness of psychological intervention in preventing the development of depression in adolescents. """". I wanted to use this time in the House to reinforce the commitment the government has made to the National Health and Medical Research Council. For all diseases for which we find a cure there will always be new challenges ahead. As a society, we are making real progress in both fighting disease and promoting better health. Life expectancy for a male has increased from 59 years in 192022 to 75 years in 1994. For a female, life expectancy has gone from 63 years in 192022 to 81 years today. As Billy Hughes said when he first addressed the National Health and Medical Research Council: To this Council of War against Disease I come to bid its members welcome... hope that their wisdom, experience and skill will evolve such plans as will result in further triumphs over disease and conduce mightily to the health and happiness of the people of Australia. Sixty years on, the message has not changed. I congratulate the NHMRC on reaching its 60th anniversary. I give particular congratulations to Professor Dick Smallwood, who has chaired the NHMRC for the past three years and is about to stand down as chair, and I thank the very large number of eminent Australians who contribute to its functioning in medical research, public health and health ethics.",85
210,Mr LEE,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leaveOn behalf of the opposition I would like to join the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) in congratulating the National Health and Medical Research Council on its 60th birthday. I also congratulate it on the great work it has done in supporting medical research and the promotion of good health outcomes in Australia over the last 60 years. The National Health and Medical Research Council was created in 1936, as the minister has outlined, to replace the Federal Health Council, which had been created 10 years earlier. The aim was, of course, to expand the role of the former body to include research. The Federal Health Council and its successor, the NHMRC, were created following the recommendation of the royal commission on health in 1926 that a system of cooperation was necessary between the states, which, under the constitution, had legislative powers in regard to health. But it was the Commonfor wealth which had the resources to ensure effective administration. The NHMRC provides an excellent example of effective federalism. The council includes representatives from federal, state and terriWar. tory governments, as well as representatives of the medical schools and the various medical colleges. Its recommendations have encouraged legislative changes in all jurisdictions. This has clearly proved to be a sound and very successful model in this and other areas. It is perhaps indicative of the bipartisan support that the NHMRC was to enjoy that the first council meeting was opened by Billy Hughes in February 1937. I think the Acting Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) would agree with me that we in the Party would consider there was no Australian politician who could claim to be the embodiNHMRC's ment of bipartisanship more than Billy Hughes. Mr Gareth Evans-Multipartisan. Mr Sharp-You have to draw a line.",87
211,Mr LEE,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"He did draw the line at the Country Party; I would have to agree with that. He described the role of the new body being 'to promote the health of the people of Australia and to protect them from disease, and to advise, coordinate and direct research into the cause of and cure for those diseases which levy so heavy a toll upon the comAustralia's munity and which have hitherto baffled medical science'. I understand that the initial grant to the NHMRC was only £30,000 and that the inaugural council dealt with 68 applications for funding. The applications ranged from requests for grants of a measly £75 through to the princely sum of a massive £1,000. During the Second World War the NHMRC played a very important role in proving the importance of carrying out medical research in Australia for Australia's needs. A great deal of work was done on looking at ways to minimise the risks to Australians serving in time of war. In particular, a lot of work was done in developing the first anti-gravity suits fighter pilots and work was done by Farley on the control of malaria during the campaign in Papua New Guinea. All of these things contributed greatly towards minimising the risk of death for Australian ex-service men and women during the Second World In 1992 the then minister for health, Brian Howe, established the NHMRC as an independent statutory body with the following four obligations laid out in the National Health and Medical Research Council Act 1992: to raise the standard of individual and public health throughout Australia; to foster the development of consistent health standards between the various states and territories; to foster medical research and training in public health research and training throughout Australia; and to foster consideration of Labor ethical issues relating to health. This statement of objectives highlights the crucial role in combining medical research and public health. This combination has encouraged the effective translation of research into practical health measures which have seen the NHMRC play such a crucial role over the last .60 years in helping Australia and the world to combat cardiovascular disease, sudden infant death syndrome and as kidney failure, to mention just a few. The council's research efforts have been vital in establishing the international reputation of Australian medical research and has provided research funding to several of Nobel laureates, including Sir Macfarlane Burnet. As recently as this morning, Australia's most recent Nobel prize winner, Peter Doherty, praised the NHMRC as a great Australian institution, a sentiment with which I am sure all members of the House would agree. The council's current research program includes a focus on issues of immunity, new medical technologies, healthy ageing and the health of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The advisory program is concentrating on a range of contemporary issues such as immunisation, diabetes and depression, as well as strokes, heart disease and cancer. In assessing the importance of the NHMRC, the best thing I can do is quote another great former minister for health for Australia, and that is Neal Blewett, who, on the occasion of the NHMRC's 50th anniversary, said that the work of the council was now so vital that 'if it were not here, then it would have to be invented'. Labor's commitment to the NHMRC was well demonstrated in the 1995 budget, our last budget, which increased research funding by about $60 million. Whilst the opposition is pleased with a number of initiatives related medical research, which the minister has mentioned in his own contribution today, the Labor Party remains concerned that the government's changes to research and development tax concessions and changes to funding for universities will have a significant and, unfortunately, negative effect on medical research in our country. The minister also mentioned in his speech substantial funding for asthma. I am very pleased to note that one of the asthma projects is being undertaken at the University of Newcastle, just north of my electorate. Several studies have also been carried out in the northern portion of the central coast of New South Wales on the impact of fallout from power stations on asthma in young children. One of the most pleasing press releases I have received in recent times was one I received yesterday showing that, for the first time since the outbreak of the AIDS pandemic, deaths in Australia from this terrible disease have fallen in the past year. The issue of AIDS highlights the value of the NHMRC's advisory role in contributing to Australia's world leading response in minimising the effect of the disease. Ms Macklin-Thanks to Dr Blewett.",88
212,Mr LEE,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"And as the member for Jagajaga interjects, in no small measure due to the great efforts of Neal Blewett and past members of the bipartisan parliamentary support group on AIDS. It also demonstrates the importance of the council's research role in the search for a cure. I would like to join the minister in congratulating the Wellcome Trust for its decision to increase funding for Australian medical research. On behalf of th& \lpposition, I would like to congratulate the NHMRC on its 60th birthday and the contribution that it has made to the health of Australians, and offer the continued support of the opposition for the vital work which it is undertaking. NA Economy",89
213,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE," Mr Speaker has received a letter from the Acting to Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans), proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The deterioration of the Australian economy, and particularly the outlook for jobs, under Coalition management. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number o/members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",89
214,Mr GARETH EVANS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"This coalition government has only been in office now for eight months but it already has firmly established itself as a low growth, low jobs government absolutely obsessed with reducing the size of government but not at all obsessed about the plight of those more than 800,000 Australians who are now unemployed and not at all obsessed about addressing the fears of those who are deeply anxious that they might be unemployed if the economy continues to deteriorate in the way that it has been ever since it has been in office. It is, after all, quite an achievement to take an economy that had grown at an average of four per cent a year over the last three years of the previous government's term of office and which was moving ahead at close to five per cent annual growth in March, and slow it to a crawl in a matter of months. But that is what this government has done. It is quite an achievement to take an economy where unemployment had dropped from 11 per cent to 8V2 per cent over three years, in which 700,000 new jobs had been created over that period and which was well on its way to achieving a target of no more than five per cent unemployment by 2001, and transform it into an economy where job growth has slowed to a walk, where unemployment, as we have seen this morning, has now increased to 8.8 per cent, where youth unemployment has dramatically increased and where nobody is now predicting better than eight per cent unemployment by the end of the century with many more pessimistic predictions even than that. But all of that is what this government has done. It is not an exaggeration to say, as I have been saying, that the Australian economy is dead flat-flat as the Nullarbor Plain and flat as a billiard table at the moment. That is the anecdotal evidence and that is the statistical evidence. The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has become very fond of saying-he was saying it again in question time today, as indeed all governments under stress tend to say-that the opposition has been talking down the economy. I reject that charge. I reject it absolutely. But I have certainly been expressing a number of concerns about the current condition of the Australian economy, and in that I have not been alone. Let me remind you of some of the other people who have been expressing concerns in recent days about the Australian economy. Rory Robertson of Bankers Trust: . . . the economy is screaming out for a decent stimulus ... Saul Eslake at ANZ: ... economic activity remains sluggish ... Chris Caton, again of Bankers Trust: · .. retail activity is still moribund ... Deborah Stirling of Coles Myer: · .. overall it is still pretty tough going ... Max Walsh, from the Sydney Morning Herald: The economy is under-performing what was expected in August. John Watson of the National Farmers Federation: · .. business surveys continue to paint a picture of declining production and only moderate outlook for sales in 1997. Michael Heffernan of Shaw Stockbroking: · . . we are not travelling as well as we should . . . After the interest rate cut, Bob Herbert of MTIA said: The interest rate cut represents a recognition of the toughness of economic conditions for large sections of Australian industry and the fact that an early recovery cannot be taken for granted. Ron Silberberg of the Housing Industry Association, no traditional friend of the Labor Party, said: There's a lot of evidence that the economy has virtually stalled. Unemployment rates seem stuck at an uncomfortably high level. Retail sales are very sluggish. This was needed to try and kick start the economy. Then, of course, Jeff Kennett, never backward in coming forward in commenting on the state of the economy under Treasurer Costello, said: We needed to really give the economy a bit of a boost. So much for me, so much for the Labor Party, so much for anyone else on our side of politics talking the economy down. The truth of the matter is that the Australian economy is down-down on its knees, slowed to a walk, slowed to 'a crawl, and it is a function of some lousy economic management on behalf of the coalition. None of what these people has been saying is just rhetoric. If people are doomsaying it is because they are worried. If business representatives and spokesmen are expressing real concern about the economy, it is because there is a mass of hard, factual evidence now available to justify those expressions of concern. Just look at the string of economic indicators that has been released over the last few months. The ABS business expectations survey shows that business is preparing for the smallest December increase in sales since the survey commenced in 1993. There has been the latest National Australia Bank survey, which reports that, weighted for employment size, a net balance of 40 per cent of firms say that the budget will have a negative effect on their business plans. So much for the confidence boost that the budget was going to generate. So much for the animal spirits that were going to come tearing out of their cages, slavering with enthusiasm for the economic task after this government's budgetary excitement. The Westpac-Melbourne Institute consumer sentiment index shows that consumer confidence is 4.2 per cent lower now than it was last February and fully nine per cent lower than it was, in fact, in June. Figures have come out about trend retail sales growth which went backwards in September for only the third time since the Australian Bureau of Statistics started collecting statistics in 1962. I repeat: the trend retail sales growth figures went backwards in September for only the third time since 1962. And you say there is no stress, no strain, no trouble, no flatness in the economy. Who are you kidding? Capital imports-a very significant indicator of plant and equipment investment-were down by 15 per cent in the September quarter as compared with the previous June quarter. The latest long-term unemployment figures, released a few days ago, showed the number of long-term unemployed people has risen each month for the last four months. I am sure my colleague the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) is going to have rather more to say on this subject. Then, of course, there were today's labour force figures, which, again, I know the member for Batman will very much drive home the significance of. Let me state them in summary. These are the figures, of course, which are described by the Minister for Employment, Education, Training and Youth Affairs (Senator Vanstone)-God help heras 'basically very good news' . We had figures today-very good news !-showing that unemployment had gone back up to 8.8 per cent. Seasonally adjusted, yes-it rose this month-but not enough to make up for the 34,000 jobs that were lost last month. Employment is, in fact, 8,600 below its level two months ago. Full-time employment is 20,600 below what it was two months ago. Trend employment has virtually stalled. To meet the government's own budget night stated target for employment growth, it has to achieve a run rate over the year of two per cent growth. At the moment tb run rate is 0.85 per cent. The jobs are simply just not being generated in sufficient numbers even to meet the extraordinarily modest and inadequate target for employment generation that the government has set for itself. Trend unemployment has risen yet again. It is now about 800,000 for the first time since November 1994, and youth unemployment has risen from 26.4 per cent in February87,000 kids then unemployed-to 99,600 kids unemployed now, an increase of 14.5 per cent and an overall figure of 29.6 per cent. That is a particularly disgusting statistic for youth unemployment figures. It should be a particularly embarrassing statistic for the Prime Minister, because it was the Prime Minister, then the Leader of the Opposition, who, just before the election, at the National Press Club, said: We have gone into this election campaign committing ourselves above all other things to doing something effective . . . to reduce the level of youth unemployment. He went on to say: ... I would like to see our performance in that area as being the mark of what we have been able to do as a government. If that is the test that Prime Minister Howard is setting for himself and his government's performance, it is a test which he has already comprehensively failed-with a 14.5 per cent increase, 12,000 more kids unemployed than when he came into office. As we said in question time, there is one target that at least looks like being achieved, and that is getting the number of young unemployed back to the figure of 158,000, which is what it was back in 1983 when John Howard was last in office with some capacity to influence these things. But those are not the only statistics. They are not the only indications of just how flat the economy is. Yesterday we had the DEETY A leading indicator of employment falling yet again, signalling that the labour market will remain sluggish for many months to come. That is a predictive indicator. Then we have had the latest Westpac leading index of economic activity, which, according to Westpac's general manager of economics, Bill Evans, 'offers no immediate prospect of an upswing in the pace of economic growth' and contains the clear message that the 'sustained upswing in activity is not likely before the second half of 1997'. The government has the hide, has the indecency, has the gall to claim yesterday's decision by the Reserve Bank to lower interest rates as being evidence, somehow, of success in economic management. But what was involved in the Reserve Bank decision yesterday was not in any sense a reward for good economic management-other than a continuation, of course, of the low inflation environment, which was the legacy of the Labor government, something that takes years to achieve and cannot be achieved in a matter of months. We broke the back of it. That continued. Yes, that was there as the underlier. But it was not a reward for good economic management by this government; it was a rescue mission for an economy in distress. Of course it is the case that lower interest rates are very helpful for Australian families buying their homes. We welcome them unreservedly-we want them. But what Australian families also want is greater economic security, and you cannot have greater security without a stronger economy. You need strong growth, rising incomes, if you are going to achieve increasing living standards and if you are going to achieve the most heartfelt objective of all for Australians, and that is falling unemployment. The government is simply not committed in terms of either its micro-economic management or its macro-economic management to growth and jobs. If you are looking at its performance so far as micro management is concerned, you have the extraordinary saga, revealing itself over recent days, of just how empty the government's commitment is to doing something about jobs in this respect. When the government was panicked into announcing the creation, at the end of last month, of an employment--{)r, more accurately, unemployment---committee of cabinetand it has not met yet, apparently-the Prime Minister said this: ... in future what the government would endeavour to do is to ask of every policy initiative and every change the question: would it contribute to a generation of jobs? This past fortnight, the opposition has been attempting to establish just what that commitment actually means in practice. We have asked a whole series of questions, you will recall, about how this particular jobs test has been applied to the decisions, for example, to abolish the book bounty, given its impact on the workers of Griffin Press in Adelaide and Maryborough in Victoria; to increase the reef tax, given its impact on the tourism industry workers in North Queensland; to abolish the ships bounty, given its impact on the workers at Austal Ships in WA, and Incat in Tasmania; and to cut R&D support and the machine tools bounty in a way that has had a massive impact already on the workers of Laser Lab in Melbourne. We have asked questions about each one of those specific policy outcomes and, in each case, the Prime Minister has contemptuously, maybe with the occasional crocodile tear to accompany it, dismissed that concern saying that the individual consequences of these budget decisions were unimportant by comparison to the overall economic strategy of fiscal consolidation which over the long run, he keeps telling us, will yield employment benefits, employment advantages. All those battlers who have lost their jobs since 2 March, and all those who are going to lose them as a result of these various measures biting successively, are not going to be very reassured by that particular bit of Treasury-speak. As John Maynard Keynes said, 'In the long run, we are all dead,' and that is the only prospect that the Prime Minister, Mr John Howard, is offering us. In the process of dismissing the opposition's concerns about these specific policy outcomes, the Prime Minister has demonstrated, above all else, the complete emptiness, the cant, associated with his own jobs test. It has been emptied of any meaningful content. Like the Prime Minister's word in so many other areas, it stands as a bloated, empty, hypocritical and insincere piece of bluster. As to macro-economic management, what we obviously need if we are going to be able to generate the jobs and the growth to get the economy moving again is a genuine commitment, with the policy strategies to go with it, to growth of not the three per cent plus that presently seems to satisfy the Treasurer and which he is regarding as a good and credible model and the very model of a model performance, but a sustainable four per cent plus. We know from hard experience, from just the sheer arithmetic of it, that you cannot make an impact on unemployment or jobs growth of the kind that will reduce those utterly unacceptable unemployment rates at the moment unless you have a macro-strategy, a fiscal strategy, in place which actually has you bouncing back to four per cent or better growth. You simply cannot do it at three per cent. What this government has done is commit itself, through its budgetary approach, to a set of outcomes which will take at least half a per cent of growth out of the economy this year and next and make absolutely unattainable that four per cent. Moreover, it has made it unattainable for the next two years. On its own projections, that is the outcome we are looking at right out to the end of the century with results that we all know deeply unhappily are going to be the case so far as unemployment is concerned. We are looking at unemployment of eight per cent plus, maybe nine per cent plUS. It is a disgraceful record. The government ought to hang its head in shame for perpetrating it. (Time expired)",89
215,Mr FAHEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is very clear from that contribution by the Acting Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) that neither he nor the Labor Party have learnt one solitary thing from the decisions the people of Australia made on 2 March. He spent 14 minutes going through a series of statistics that he had in front of him that were supposed to support the argument that he was trying to make about the economy at present and spent the last minute saying what the government has to do to get growth back to four per cent. He made no suggestion of how it might happen. He made no reference to the fact that on 2 March this country found itself with an 4. additional $10 billion of debt as a result of 13 years of Labor mismanagement. He made no reference at all to the fact that II we continued down that path of deficit and debt that Labor had taken us down there was going to be nothing left within a few years for the people of Australia that needed the services of government. He gave no regard whatsoever to the impact debt has on business, industry and government. He made no reference whatsoever to the mismanagement that had gone on in all of that time or to the disgraceful mess that Labor left the country in as a result of that mismanagement during their term in office. I expected more from the Acting Leader of the Opposition this week when I looked at reports from last Sunday'S papers and saw the Acting Leader of the Opposition vowing to silence his detractors from the opposition factions within the Labor Party, to take the move that was there to stack the branches, et cetera. He was going to silence the detractors this week. But what did the Acting Leader of the Opposition do in the first question time this week when he could have shown his credentials in this chamber and made a significant contribution that made some sense to the debate in here? He waved imperiously to someone on the back benches to ask the first question in question time this week. In the course of that particular day, he asked three questions, the third of which was ruled out of order. The week did not get any better. In fact, he has had only one success this week. He tipped the winner of the Melbourne Cup. That is the only time he has got close to doing anything right this week. A little later in the week I noted with some interest that he did a doorstop relating to deeming rates. It was most interesting to see the report in the Adelaide Advertiser this morning on that particular doorstop. This, of course, is from the spokesman on matters economic for the Labor Party. The Adelaide Advertiser said: Mr Evans got in trouble trying to answer a question about whether the Government should cut deeming rates-but was hazy about what it meant. ""I thought it was this Government (which made the change) but it was our Government. .. "" he said. ""The reason for talking at cross-purposes was on a different wavelength."" I can assure you that all members on this side of the House believe you are always on a different wavelength. The report went on: Mr Evans said he had given ""an inadequate answer"" but explained he ""wasn't frankly focused on the issue"". ""I wobbled a bit on that because 1 thought they were talking about something different,"" he said. There have been some lousy reviews for the Acting Leader of the Opposition this week. I think the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) can take some comfort from the fact that he is in another country and need not worry about what might be happening back home, because this week the Acting Leader of the Opposition and the spokesman on matters economic has not laid a glove on the current debate in respect of the economy or any other matter. The question of the economy must always start at 2 March. It starts at that debt which we inherited as a government. We came down here to do a number of things only to find a bar on the high jump so high that it was a daunting task just to look at it. We inherited $10 billion worth of debt. We took the brave decision, because it was the right decision, to bring about fiscal consolidation and to do something about that debt-a debt that had climbed by some $70 billion in the last five years. The Acting Leader of the Opposition can say all he likes about matters relating to growth and what the rate of growth should be. The simple fact is that the growth figures of previous years have been at an enormous expense to the Australian community-an expense of an additional $70 billion of debt. As I have said on a number of occasions, the only growth industry in the Australian economy under Labor was the debt servicing section under the current Leader of the Opposition, the then Minister for Finance. The simple fact is that this year's budget requires payment of $10 billion in debt servicing alone. It requires the equivalent amount of the education budget for debt servicing. It requires half the health budget just for debt servicing on the debt that has was 1 been racked up by Labor in the last five years. It required this government to do something about getting the base in order before we could move this country forward. The budget delivered by the government does just that. The budget delivered by the government has been accepted widely by all sections of the community. It is recognised that it was the budget that had to be delivered in the circumstances of the economy and the state of the national accounts. There was no choice other than to plunge this country headlong into difficulties it would never recover from. That budget provides for a small surplus in 199899. That budget contains within it growth that by any comparison with OECD countriesthree per cent and 3Y2 per cent through to the turn of the century-is quite an acceptable growth, in fact, a very high growth. The Acting Leader of the Opposition can talk about his four per cent growth achieved by an injection of money that was borrowed to the point where we have to service those debts, as I have just explained. We saw Working Nation. This was the huge design that was put together to satisfy all the difficulties on employment that this nation has. Five billion dollars was factored into the years of Working Nation. What did it do for unemployment? It did not bring it below 8.5 per cent. We were stuck permanently at around 8.5 per cent for 18 months prior to the election. I suppose Labor can take consolation in the fact that they presided over the highest unemployment figures since the recessionunemployment figures of 11.2 per cent. That is a disgrace. It is a disgrace that in the past five years under Labor only 7,000 real jobs have been created. They can throw all the figures they like out there. The reality is that they have created only 7,000 real jobs in five years of administration. I can say that the honourable member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) had a bit to do with that in his former life and the role that he played there. There is a need for us to get the base in order. The government has done that in a number of ways. We have addressed the paucity of national savings-again, by reducing the reliance on deficits that the former Labor government placed for so many years. They were addicted to deficits and debt. By moving into surplus we are making our contribution to national savings. There are a number of other matters that have to be addressed as well. Labor continues to try to block what is necessary to get this country really moving again, particularly in the area of industrial relations. There is no way in the world that businesses can proceed forward under the law as it now standsLabor's law. It simply said, 'Employ someone if you wish, at your peril. Take your risk, but you have little difficulties, other than through massive payments, of getting rid of someone who does not perform for legitimate reasons. It is simply not possible.' Why would anyone employ in circumstances like that? People did not. Small business did not. We have delivered to small businesses. We have given them the way ahead. We have put that downward pressure on interest rates which has brought about a reduction in home mortgage rates from 10.5 per cent to 8.75 per cent in our eight months of government. That delivers to the ordinary families of Australia a $140 reduction in the payments that they have to make. Nothing could be more significant from the point of view of the average family in this countrythe average person on a home mortgage-than to have a reduction of $140 in that period. We have seen the official interest rates go down by one per cent through two instalments in that time. We have seen inflation brought down from above three per cent to below three per cent. We have seen moderation in wage growth. All of those factors are there. There is certainty about the forecasts ahead to the extent that investment is possible with certainty by small business in particular. We have received the report of the deregulation task force under the chairmanship of Charlie Bell. They have said, 'We are sick of red tape. We are sick of having to spend the time looking after what government requires us to look after instead of getting on with what we do well.' That is a very significant report. The government will work through that with a commitment to reduce the red tape that is associated with businessby 50 per cent in our first term. 4 I The climate and the base have now been established. Of course, for us to be able to progress on all of that, one of the most important things is for the budget to be delivered intact. Yet day after day we see Labor railing against the measures that have been taken in the budget to bring us into that surplus over the economic cycle which is so important whilst we are in that period of growth, as we are. It is essential that we get back into balance over the economic cycle and get into surplus, as we predict in that budget forecast, by 1998-99. Day after day, particularly in the Senate, we see attempts being made to pull back on the savings and to pull back on the bottom linethe honest and transparent bottom line that Labor never produced. They were never interested in underlying balances; they were only interested in headline balances. They sold off the assets as quickly as they could but as quietly as they could because they had to look after what was happening within their own ranks and the disquiet that was there in terms of those sales. They sold off the assets in the past simply to produce money--cashfor the consumption of programs that they could not resist. We have got a very responsible economic management program in place. It is contained in the budget. The community is waiting to see, and looking forward to seeing, if we can deliver that surplus by 1998-99. The community knows that there is a responsible government in place here in Canberra now and that there will be an economic climate for growth-sustainable growth, not the type of growth that we have seen over the past few years with figures of four per cent, no reduction in unemployment, interest rates going higher and higher and inflation creeping up. The result was that there was simply no future in anything that was done in the way of investment by small business. They have faith in what we are progressing through this budget and through our economic management. We will demonstrate that faith with stable low interest rates and sustained low inflation, under the direction of the Reserve Bank and the target that it has set itself and made very clear, to a point where people can invest with certainty. Certainty is something that has been lacking within the business community and the entire Australian community for far too long now. The matter that the Acting Leader of the Opposition raises today is more a wish than reality. It is a wish that Labor continue to try to propagate. They try to put out the story that all is doom and gloom. They do not like the fact that in the budget investment in the business sector is forecast at 14 per cent. They are not prepared to talk about the debts that they ran up in the past. They want to talk down the economy today to continue to discourage the community out there. The community recognised that your management was not worth anything. They demonstrated that in their vote on 2 March. They have made it abundantly clear that they want us to progress. They said that in Lindsay only a couple of weeks ago. They made it very clear they want us to get on with the job. They want us to put our budget in place. If the Labor Party were serious in any shape or form about the future of this country and about the future of jobs for young people, people of all ages, then they would immediately start to assist the government to progress the budget through the Senate. They would immediately start to do something about the workplace relations bill in the other chamber. They would allow it to be put in place at the earliest possible time instead of standing up and constantly talking down the economy as much as they possibly can. The reality is that the base is in place. (Time expired)",93
216,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Well might the Australian community ask, 'When is this government going to face up to the fact that the only issue that counts at the moment is the question of jobs, jobs and more jobs?' I'll tell you what: the Australian community expects this government to face up to the fact that jobs are the priority rather than consuming itself with a mistaken view-which is poll driven-of a deficit fetish. I'll tell you what: I listened with interest to the Minister for Finance (Mr Fahey)-someone not known to have a desire or an ability to make decisions, as was proven in the state of New South Wales. I would like to refer the Minister for Finance to his suggestion that Australia is a country hocked to the hilt. I understand why he is running away today in the same way he ran away from Macquarie Street. It is because he doesn't like facts. I think he ought to table in this House a report by the Treasury on Monday this week which went to the very question of debt. I know he does not like reading these reports. He is not really a person who concerns himself with facts, especially the facts with respect to his own register of property holdings. That report by Treasury says: Australian general government net financialliabilitiesthat is Treasury-speak for net debt; I am sure the Minister for Finance, who just ran from the chamber, wouldn't understand thatas a per cent of nominal GDP are relatively low by international standards, being lower than all OECD countries other than Japan, and lower than the OECD average. I will later seek leave to table that Treasury report. But, in doing so, I say that I think the Australian community is entitled to say to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) today, 'Why are you coy on prospects with respect to jobs?' Why did the Sydney Morning Herald of 10 October have a heading which stated 'More pressure for rate cut-Jobs growth elusive'? I think the Australian community is entitled to say to the Prime Minister, 'Where have the jobs gone?' More importantly, in light of the establishment by the Prime Minister on 21 October of an unemployment committee of cabinet, the Australian community is entitled to ask, 'Where are the jobs going to come from?' That is the real question. I'll tell you what: the Prime Minister does not know and, more importantly, the minister with responsibility for employment in the government-that well known heavyweight, Senator Vanstonewants the Australian community to have faith that she is concerned about the issue of employment. I'll you what: the Australian community listening to the minister for employment today on the ABC radio program The World Today would have very serious doubts. We know she likes to live in fantasy land, and we know that she is not too concerned with the facts from time to time. But I'll tell you what: what is a bigger worry is that she doesn't know what they are going to do as a government in their cabinet unemployment committee established on 21 October. Here is what she had to say about the question of coming to terms with reducing the level of unemployment. It goes to the question of responsibility. What did she say on the ABC today? She said: And all we're saying is, it won't change just because you've got different people sitting in government, swapping sides in the Chamber. I'll tell you what: she ought to be of the chamber because, without a doubt-and the facts prove it today beyond any doubtunemployment is rising and it is rising fast. Then Senator Vanstone was questioned about the Prime Minister's pivotal cabinet committee to reduce unemployment, which is, all of a sudden, going to meet this afternoon. I'll tell you what: it's going to meet every month from here on into try to create the impression, when the unemployment figures come out, that the government is going to do something. I would have expected that, when unemployment went up to 8.8 per cent today, the minister for employment-it is her responsibility--could have at least said to the ABC, 'I've got a few ideas and I want to tell the Australian community, which is concerned about unemployment, what I'm going to recommend to the cabinet's committee on unemployment today to reduce unemployment.' What was her answer? She said: Look, I think the Prime Minister's entitled to be a bit annoyed if I share with the world at large what I'm going to tell a cabinet subcommittee. I'll tell you what: the real problem is that not only doesn't the minister for employment know; she's got an even bigger hide, because this is what she also said on ABC radio at noon today in response to questions about the totally unacceptable level of unemployment: So, basically very good news. I'll tell you what: I do not accept that basically it is very good news that today 20,600 fewer full-time jobs exist compared with what we had two months ago. I do ff- accept that it is basically very good news today that we have 9,000 fewer jobs overall than we had two months ago-you know, the real jobs that the Prime Minister said he was going to create instead of destroy. I do not accept that it is basically very good news today that unemployment has gone from 8.7 to 8.8 per cent. But worse still-and the minister likes to talk about the trend rate-what is the trend rate today? 'Basically, very good news,' says the minister. I'll tell you what it is: it is 8.7 per cent, which is the highest level in 18 months. Very good news! I'll tell you what: I would hate to see bad news. But it is worse still. The Prime Minister, on election eve, said on this side to the National Press Club: We have gone into this election campaign committing ourselves above all other things to do something effective. He was not talking about his ministerial code of conduct, because we know that is in tatters. He went on to say that he was talking about reducing the level of youth unemployment, and he said: I would be a very disappointed man if I had not made very serious inroads into the level of youth unemployment in this country because I would like to see our performance in this area as being the mark of what we have been able to do as a Government. Well, this is the mark of what this government has done on the question of youth unemployment. I find it strange that the minister for employment also said today that this is 'basically very good news'. I'll tell you what: young Australians are suffering most of all from the failure of this government to perform on the employment front. 'Very good news,' the minister says, that youth unemployment has shot up to 29.6 per cent-29.6 per cent and it is very good news! Reducing youth unemployment was supposed to be a priority. I'll tell you what: it is not a priority, but the way it is going, the Prime Minister will break the record he set when he last was Treasurer with respect to youth unemployment. You know what? He is not far off that record. We have tipped 99,600 today. He is fast moving to his last record, of 158,000. I know he does not like to be reminded of records, but I think the Australian community is entitled to know where all the jobs have gone. We do not accept that they ought to go to the graveyards. We expect that this Prime Minister ought to learn from his past mistakes and state to the Australian community that jobs and jobs alone are the priority at the moment. The reason is that the Australian community is no longer prepared to accept his con. The decision of 21 October to establish an unemployment committee was a sham and it will be seen by the Australian community for what it is. They had to wait until today to call a meeting of the unemployment committee to try to create an impression in the Australian community that they are going to do something about jobs. The Howard government's first budget is unfair to people who want jobs. It is unfair to our young people and it is unfair to the mums and dads of Australia who put such an effort into educating their children with a view to giving them a long-term meaningful job opportunity. The Australian community says to the Prime Minister today, 'Stop the con. Answer the question: where have the jobs gone and-more importantly-where are the jobs going to come from?' Because I'll tell you what: they have seen through him. The deficit fetish will not assist him in reducing unemployment. If you care about jobs, you support private industry, you support public sector employment and you support service to Australians, irrespective of whether you live in regional Australia or metropolitan Australia.

218,Mr SOMLYAY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Fairfax) (4.43 p.m.}-The matter of public importance before us today concerns the deterioration of the Australian economy. How come you say that you can see deterioration in the Australian economy now and you could not see it for the past 13 years? Do you remember the years between 1989 and 1993 and the deterioration in the economy then? The opposition has no credibility on employment. The opposition has no credibility any longer on economic management. Former Prime Minister Keating always boasted that he had his hands on the economic levers and had the Reserve Bank in his pocket. If one were to believe him, you could only conclude that he might have had his hands on the levers but he did not know which levers to pull and in what order. I think a couple of levers were stuck. You were locked in by the accord and all you had available to 'you to manage the Australian economy was the lever of interest rates. The Hawke and Keating governments will be remembered for one thing: they demonstrated that, like every other Labor government in Australian history, Labor cannot manage money. They cannot manage the economy, they cannot manage employment. But they can spend your money. In the tradition of the Labor governments of Whitlam, Wran, Cain, Kirner, Bannon and Burke, the Hawke-Keating years ensured one thing only, that the tradition of Labor continued-a tradition of financial irresponsibility, big spending, big debt, big taxes, budget deficits and deceit. I mention deceit because this government came to power on 2 March expecting a budget surplus only to find that the budget was $8 billion in deficit, and this blew out to $10 billion. That should never happen again to any incoming government. The Acting Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans), mentioned John Maynard Keynes in his speech to the House. At first I thought he said 'John Cain'. That gave me a bit of fright because I will never forget the promise in 1989 that Wayne Goss gave before the Queensland state election. He said very proudly to the people of Queensland, 'Just as business has prospered under the stewardship of John Cain in Victoria so too will business prosper under a Goss Labor government in Queensland.' How prophetic! It is a different story under the coalition. Yesterday all Australians were rejoicing at the latest good news on the economic front-the reduction by the Reserve Bank of official interest rates by 0.5 per cent. This is, of course, very important for the housing industry and the building and construction industries-the engine of growth in so many parts of Australia, particularly in my own electorate. It is meaningless to consider job figures alone and to try to analyse them in isolation. Employment figures must be looked at in a wider context. The linkage of jobs to other factors was clearly expressed in an article in the Sunshine Coast Daily today where the Queensland Master Builders Association executive director, Greg Quinn, was commenting on the good news on interest rates. I quote from the article: While the rates drop put housing at its most affordable, the return of confidence in the housing market was due to far more. Mr Quinn said the biggest factor for home buyers-job security-had been strengthened by the proposed industrial relations legislation, co-written by the government and the Australian Democrats. This is a very important linkage. Not only are new jobs important, but also the importance of job security is a critical factor for growth and consumer confidence, and therefore for the future of jobs. Labor does not understand that the level of unemployment is a function of many factors. I have been in this place since March 1990 and, for those six years, I saw the HawkeKeating governments lurch from crisis to crisis, putting totally inadequate bandaids on the balloon with one hand while pricking more holes in the balloon with the other. In March 1990 when I came to this place again, unemployment was running at 6.2 per cent; in March 1991 it was 9.2 per cent; in March 1992-10.5 per cent; in March 199310.9 per centMr Lieberman-Who was in government then?",98
219,Mr SOMLYAY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We know who was in government then: it was the --Qor Party. In 1994 it was 10.4 per cent; in J9'!}5-8.7 per cent; and in 1996-8.5 per cent. So we inherited an unemployment rate of 8.5 per cent. But, remember, it peaked in December 1992 at 11.2 per cent. The opposition has no monopoly on compassion for the unemployed. My colleagues and I on this side of the House, in electorates all over Australia during Labor's dark years, had to cope with Labor's army of unemployed. Day after day, month after month, year after year in my electorate I saw the devastating effects on Labor's army of unemployed of unemployment, not only young people who wanted jobs but also middle-aged people-Labor threw them on the unemployment scrap heap. I vividly remember a man coming into my office. He was a bit like the Acting Leader of the Opposition in that he was unshaven. He came to speak to me about unemployment. I said to him, 'I don't think you will ever get a job if you walk around without having a shave.' He said, 'Do you know why I don't shave? I'm 45 years of age and I've never been out of a job.' He said, 'I look in the mirror now and I see myself. I cannot stand to look at myself. My dignity is at its absolute lowest ebb.' Ms Macklin-What about the Deputy Speaker?",99

This is what we lived through for a period of six years from the time that I came into the parliament. Labor does not understand that unemployment is a function of many factors. In December 1992, when the unemployment level was 11.2 per cent, had all those people who were unemployed stood in a line, one metre apart, that line would have stretched from the electorate of Holt to Newcastle.",100

230,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,BOUNTY LEGIS LA TION,"The Bounty Legislation Amendment Bill is another bill which demonstrates yet again the dramatic differences between the Labor and Liberal parties. Last week we were debating legislation which increased the of HECS charges for tertiary students and which brought to a grinding halt that revolution in participation which Labor had achieved in tertiary education with hundreds of thousands of additional tertiary places. Just a day or two ago we were debating the withdrawal of the operational subsidy for community based, non-profit child-care centres, once again where Labor had a legacy of achievement. We had inherited a paltry 46,000 child-care places and built that up during our term in government to some 270,000 child-care places. With the loss of the operational subsidy, once again that revolution in participation comes to a grinding halt. We now have a bill before us which relates to industry policy. Labor cut tariffs too enthusiastically in my view, particularly during the 1990-91 period, and it did a lot of damage in my electorate. Our industry policy needs to pay appropriate regard to what other nations are doing. We cannot afford to be suckers here. I am arguing and I will continue to argue in Labor Party forums, before the Productivity Commission and elsewhere that the post-2000 tariff arrangements should not be further reduced unless there is clear evidence of a level playing field internationally. But Labor did not just cut tariffs and leave Report industry to its own devices. We wanted manufacturing industry to succeed and in particular we wanted it to export. Our industry assistance programs have been extraordinarily successful-I will provide some figures on that later on. But now we have a government which has no vision of industry policy, which comes stamping into this delicate area like a bull in a china shop, smashing the crockery, smashing the furniture that we had put in place to allow our manufacturing industry to grow and to export. Make no mistake. The abmition of the bounties, which is the subject of this bill, the slashing of the export market development grants, the slashing of the research and development tax concession and the abolition of the development import finance facility, DIFF-all these things will jeopardise the competitiveness of Australia's manufacturers, level placing them at a disadvantage with our overseas competitors. The Liberals have come into government claiming to know something about the needs of business. But when it comes to manufacturing industry, they are like invading hordes of Huns and Visigoths looting, pillaging and smashing everything in sight. They do not appear to have any comprehension, understanding or appreciation of the value of that which they are destroying, of the art and the refinement which has gone into the creation and development of these schemes. I want to tell the House something about a particular company in my electorate-Farley Cutting Systems, which is based in Glenroy. It commenced business in 1983 in Glenroy. Its mission statement is to be a leading world supplier of systems for cutting flat metals and  Farley and achieved early success in penetrating the Australian market with sales of cutting machines into specifically targeted sectors such as shipbuilding and the heating, ventilation and air conditioning industry. That success was based on the relatively quick market acceptance of the innovative and versatile Farley Wizard profile cutting machine. Building on the acceptance by the local market, Farley Manufacturing commenced exporting the Wizard in 1985 initially to a similar range of customers in the United Kingdom. Later on, they moved into Europe and by 1989 exports had surpassed domestic sales and total turnover exceeded $A 13 million. They opened additional offices in Germany and France. Later they moved into the United States and their most recent stage of market development has been an expansion into the Asian region over the past three years. They have established a network of agents and achieved machine sales in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, China, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia. A family of 10 machines is now marketed under the Farley banner together with a comprehensive suite of applications software programs. Farley machines are now productively utilised by steel service centres, heavy fabrication and engineering operations, mining and agricultural equipment manufacturers, structural steel fabricators, contract cutting shops and the like. In the course of that company's progress, they have collected numerous awards for both technical and export performance including two Australian Design Awards, the Prince Phillip Award for Design Excellence, the John Hart Technology Award, the Austrade Export Award, the BHP Steel Award and the Governor of Victoria's Export Award. In 1994 and 1995 they received high commendations in the Engineering Excellence Awards conducted by the Institute of Engineers, Australia. Today, Farley Cutting Systems has 300 machine installations in more than 20 countries around the world, a staff of 75 people and turnover in excess of $12 million with exports accounting for approximately 75 per cent of sales. They are actively involved in ongoing research and development activities, including with a range of external partners, and are implementing various manufacturing improvement programs to enhance competitiveness-not a bad achievement at all. If you look at the value to them of industry assistance-and I visited this company both before and since becoming the member for Wills-their estimates in 1995-96 were $325,000 from the machine tool bounty, $100,0000 from the export market development grants and $900,000 from the tax concession for research and development. With respect to export market development grants, they claimed substantial assistance under the program from 1984 to 1991, which was a critical phase in enabling them to establish an export focus-an activity which has become the cornerstone of their business. The new market provisions of the export market development grants are now being utilised to assist them in establishing new export markets such as Malaysia, China and India. In relation to research and development, they are beneficiaries of the GIRD program and the cooperative research centres program. Both of those schemes have been invaluable to them in enabling them to develop a highly differentiated product and to maintain the leading edge in their field of technology, which is a key element in their international competitiveness. Mr Farley, the company's founder and managing director, told the Senate Economics Legislation Committee just last Friday: We budgeted this year on $19 million sales and $800,000 profit. But the duty on imported components, $70,000 cost. Reduction of EMDG, $50,000. Reduction of the R&D credit, $70,000 ... $20,000 in extra compliance cost for the R&D. So much fonhe government getting rid of red tape for small business. The thing which really knocks them around is cancellation of the bounty-$300,000 straight off the bottom line. Mr Farley further said: The things that government actually did will reduce our profit by 60 per cent. The other thing that they have done which is even more disastrous, or that has happened, is just the total collapse of demand ° in Australia. Our demand in Australia is running at 1 per cent of our budgeted rate. The orders are a bit lumpy, so you cannot take one month after another, but we have not had a significant order since the election. We normally get in Australia about $400,000 a month. One month it is $1.2 million and then the next two months it is nothing. But since the election we have not had one significant order. The thing that has saved us is our exports to Asia. I might say as an aside that I had a street stall in Glenroy last Saturday and some people came up to tell me that 'Pauline Hanson is right'. It might be too much to hope that the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) is taking note-she is not here in the chamber-but I hope at least those constituents of mine who consider themselves part of her cheer squad might reflect on what it would mean for Glenroy if the Asian countries on which this company depends decided to take their business elsewhere. Mr Farley went on to say: The biggest impact is Australia. It is terrible, it is really disastrous. We are just going backwards at a huge rate of knots. We have sold more machines in Malaysia in the last four months or six months than we have sold in Australia. Later, Mr Farley told the committee: This year we have had the dollar go up, the 150 per cent reduction, the demand in Australia go down and the bounty eliminated without notice. You can plan ahead for a certain amount of things, but you cannot plan ahead for the sort of quintuple whammy that we got in the last six months. On being questioned by the committee about that falling off of demand since March, he repeated: . . . since March we have not had a significant order. I do not think any of our customers predicted at the time of the election that they would change their plans depending on the election. Most of them being businesses and most of them, on balance, being supporters of the coalition, one would have expected a lift in their confidence and investment plans, but it has just failed to happen and it has gone backwards. Our order rate in the last six months is less than it was at the bottom of the recession. Let me repeat that-'less than it was at the bottom of the recession'. Mr Farley went on to talk about the benefits of the bounty. He said: Last year we opened an office in Singapore. In four years we had sold $400,000 worth of stuff in that region. We put that guy there and he has got $3 million worth of orders. We planned, when we did our budget in April this year, to do the same thing in Korea and the same thing in China. We have just had $500,000 taken out of our cashflow. He went on to say: The good thing about bounty is it comes quick. You spend some money and you get it back 60 or 90 days later. But with the R&D tax concession or any of the other grants schemes or EMDG or whatever, you have got to finance the expenditure for 12 to 18 months to three years to five years, if it is a tax concession. The bounty was absolutely instrumental in us growing from a nine-person company in 1985 to a 100-people company now. In 1985 we had exported one machine. Now we have got 300 machines overseas. We just went through the order book this morning and there are 17 machines on order and the very cheapest and smallest of them is the only one on order for Australia. His comments were supported and echoed by Mr Boland of ANCA, who told the committee: . . . I think that with the internationalisation of manufacturing, which is very solid, we are very ephemeral and ANCA could vanish, and there really would not be a ripple in the water. In the broad stream of the economy, we could vanish. The equipment we make is primarily sold in the US and Europe and Asia, and there would be other suppliers to take our place over there. But what you would lose is the employment. We employ 300 people directly, another 200, so you would lose those 500 jobs. You would lose all the taxes we pay, you would lose the technology, you would lose the export revenue we gain. Those remarks echo comments I have heard from the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) that Australia's survival is not compulsory. Certainly, our survival as a manufacturer is not compUlsory. These comments were also echoed by the Metal Trades Industry Association which described the cumulative effect of the loss of such measures-the DIFF, the EMDG, 150 down to 125 for research and development, industry assistance schemes such as the bounty-as being profoundly anti-business, profoundly anti-manufacturing and profoundly against the interests of Australia. Interestingly enough, when Mr Farley was asked about the industrial relations changes, he said: With regard to the benefit of the industrial relations changes, in my view it is not neutral; it is possibly negative because the lack of certainty of the Accord type process is encouraging people who are in demand-and some of the highly skilled people we use are in demand-to be much more aggressive. You can see this from the metal trades workers' 15 per cent claim, which they would never have pursued under the Accord. So in my view it is negative. There is much more turmoil in the job market for people who are in demand than there has been in the last 10 years. I say to the government: do not come in here saying, 'Well, we're taking away your bounty and your concessions and your DIFF and your export market development grants, but you'll be all right because we've got rid of the accord.' The fact is that the government has taken away from manufacturers the A, B, C, D and E of their competitiveness and international exporting success: A for the accord; B for the bounties; C for the concession for research and development; D for the DIFF, the development import finance facility; and E for the export market development grants. So how do you destroy our manufacturing industry? It is not as easy as ABC. It takes A, B, C, D and E-but they are doing it. We now have a government which is illiterate. When it comes to industry policy and manufacturing, they will put us in the Z class down with Zaire and Zambia. This is a bill which not only terminates the machine, tools and robotics bounty, about which I have been speaking, but also terminates the books bounty and the ships bounty with effect from 20 August this year, and the computer bounty with effect from 1 July next year. The abolition of the books bounty will have a significant effect on regional areas, such as Maryborough in Victoria where 25 per cent of the local work force is dependent, either directly or indirectly, on the book production industry. It is extraordinary that the government should be treating Maryborough, which supports a Liberal member of parliament, so poorly. But, in fact, it is similar to the very poor way in which the state Liberal government has treated the people of Maryborough by withdrawing the rail service which used to go through Maryborough to Mildura. Maryborough has a population of 8,800 people, of which some 2,500 are in the town's work force. Two major book printers have plants in Maryborough and employ directly 550 persons, with another 100 being employed in ancillary businesses such as typesetting and film reproduction; they also use casual labour in peak periods. So some 25 per cent of the work force of the town is directly dependent on book production for its livelihood. Therefore, the people of Maryborough will be most adversely affected through the loss of the book bounty and the passage of this bill. Finally, it is scandalous that in Australia we can have a minister in charge of this bill who has a direct conflict of interest arising from its provisions. The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) has a $100,000 interest in Bligh Ventures. Companies associated with Bligh Ventures in the previous financial year received more than $1 million from the government in computer bounty funding. The computer bounty was not the only bounty, but one of five, to be axed in the budget. Interestingly, it is the computer bounty that gets a stay of life; it gets an extra year. Why is that? Is it because Jtec Pty Ltd, in which Bligh Ventures has an 18.2 per cent holding, is a beneficiary to the tune of $1 million? The Prime Minister's code of conduct says, 'It is important that ministers and parliamentary secretaries avoid giving any appearance of using public office for private purposes.' Yet yesterday the Prime Minister tells the House that he regards it as a 'badge of honour' - that is, ministers should have private shareholdings and be out there making money on the side. He has turned his code of conduct into a national joke. Even without a code of conduct, the concept of conflict of interest is nearly as old as Westminster democracy itself, and it is fundamental. It is that there should be no conflict of interest between the public interest or national interest, which a minister is sworn to serve above all else, and a minister's private interests. But what has happened here? Bligh Ventures has kept the computer bounty. As the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) put it so eloquently three weeks ago, it is the only Bligh that has kept its bounty. That is just not good enough. There should be mutiny over the abolition of these bounties and the Prime Minister should be playing Fletcher Christian and setting adrift in a very small boat a minister whose shares in Bligh Ventures make him totally inappropriate to command the course of this nation's manufacturing industry.",101
231,Mr MARTYN EVANS,BOUNTY LEGIS LA TION,"Industry development is vital to the future of this nation. By that I do not just mean industry development across the broad parameter of policy development in this country but something which is clearly and specifically targeted to ensure that Australia can take proper advantage of those natural areas where we excel as a nation and also those areas where we need to ensure that the industries we have already supported are able to grow in the future. Industry development depends on a number of things. Apart from broad macro-economic policies, which must be tuned to sustain the nation's economy, we also need a degree of certainty, and certainty is one thing which this government is not delivering to industry. It is the absence of certainty more than anything else which will undermine the development of future industry policy in this country. Industry needs to know the ground rules on which it is able to work. Industry suffers sufficiently already from the vagaries of modem day economies, the uncertainties which plague any industrial enterprise in the 1990s. Those are part of the scene for any industry, for any business, for any government, and everyone takes some account of those. But, in doing this and planning your business for the future, you need to be able to know that you can rely on government, you can rely on the word of this parliament, to set the parameters for the future in law and to ensure that where, for example, in this case, bounties are paid by this parliament, by the government and the taxpayers of this nation for the production of certain goods those will continue in the terms which the legislation sets out. That is something which this government has undermined in a very serious way in this current budget. To do so, I think, will have very detrimental effects on industry policy in Australia. It will also have very detrimental effects on employment growth. We have recently seen the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), particularly in question time, lecture this parliament about how cutting the deficit, interest rate reductions-fiscal consolidation, as he is wont to call it; all of these things-will lead to a better economy for Australia, how reducing the budget deficit will ultimately help to bring down interest rates, therefore create a climate where industry and employment growth are more certain and more possible. He uses that as a basis for explaining why his government has withdrawn these bounties, why it has withdrawn R&D tax concessions, why it has walked away from some of the parameters which this parliament has previously set in law and which business has taken as a given in its planning for the future. """" The reality is that there may be some argument-and the opposition does not disagree-that we need to ensure that the budget is brought back to balance over a period of time. That is something which was very much part of our policy make-up as well and the Acting Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans), the shadow Treasurer, has put this to the parliament on many occasions. But what the Prime Minister ignores in his broad generalisations is the very specific effects that some of his policies will have on individual industries and on their ability to grow and generate jobs. The reality is that while there might be a defensible case in terms of broad macro-economic policy you have to look very closely at what your particular policies are doing in relation to individual industries to assess how those changes are going to impact on Australians and on their jobs. I would put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that decisions to withdraw bounties like these will be decisions which cut growth in this country, which cut exports from Australia and which ultimately cut jobs. That is where this legislation fails the Prime Minister's very own tests and where it fails the test which this parliament should ultimately set for this kind of legislation. It is also retrospective legislation. It has a very unfortunate impact on regional centresanother area where the Prime Minister has previously touted this government's interest. It is a policy which I think regional Australia should firmly reject, it is a policy which industry in this country should firmly reject, and it is certainly a policy which this opposition firmly rejects. This bounty legislation, which covers a wide variety of industries-this is an omnibus bill-is withdrawing bounties in relation to ships, in relation to books, in relation to robots and machine tools and in relation to computers and associated equipment. Those are all areas in which Australia has been able to develop policies which have led to exports, to job growth and to wealth creation in this country. They have also led to something a bit more intangible-innovation and the growth in innovation in this country. There is nothing more harmful to the growth of innovation, which of itself is, as I have said, more intanGriffin gible but in the long run probably more important to our future wealth creation tunities, than the removal of certainty, the removal of these incentives which people have seen put into place only to have them withdrawn without notice at a critical time in the development of this nation's industry policy. We have companies in Tasmania-Incat, for example, and Austal in Fremantle-that have undertaken very innovative work in the shipbuilding area only to find themselves now very much at a disadvantage when competing with their European colleagues who are able to put ships in the water with much more substantial subsidies from their own national governments than our companies are able to obtain from our government. Indeed, we are finding a situation with the ships capital grants legislation-now that that has been renewed because of the furore that broke around that-that in fact this government is able to find money for companies like BHP and Shell, et cetera, to buy their ships overseas but it is not able to find money to ensure that very innovative and progressive companies in this country are able to produce products in this nation for our benefit and long-term growth of exports and jobs in Australia. It is also particularly relevant, I think, examine the impact of this on the regional economy. I have already indicated the impact it will have on the shipbuilding industry in the regional economies of Tasmania and Western Australia. The withdrawal of the books bounty will have a particular impact in Maryborough in Victoria, as my colleague who has just resumed his seat, the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson), has indicated. The withdrawal of the books bounty will have a very severe and damaging impact on that regional economy. Adelaide, in my own home state, will also suffer from the withdrawal of the ships bounty and the books bounty. We have a number of innovative companies in Adelaide who are beginning to compete in the area of ship production and who have already made substantial inroads into exporting books. Press, for example, is an organisation that has a very substantial reputation in South oppor- Australia. They were in the newspapers recently with the management indicating their complete lack of satisfaction with the conduct of the Brown Liberal state government, who have declined to assist that company. Indeed, they have declined even to visit Griffin Press premises until early next year. This indicates the complete lack of interest which our local state government unfortunately has in assisting very substantial businesses, like Griffin Press, who have done a lot to improve the export opportunities in the publishing trade over recent years, as have many of their colleagues. One thing is common to all of these: we have seen substantial growth in industries like shipbuilding, book publishing and IT industries. We have seen substantial growth in these industries under the regime of bounties which were established over the course of the last decade. The sunrise industries-IT industries-have been able to flourish and grow while some of the more established ones-the shipbuilding industries and the publishing industries-have been able to sustain their position, recover ground from those overseas the competitors who are undermining them and take their industry forward. In doing this, they take more than their industry forward; they to take their region forward and take employment growth forward. It is employment growth which I think is the underlying key to all of this. If we turn our attention to the IT industry, which is a special interest of mine as shadow minister for science and information technology, we see that it is a very major potential industry for Australia. But there are a number of constraints we need to examine in relation to it. This bounty has been around since July 1994. It replaced a scheme based on the Automatic Data Processing Equipment Bounty Act 1977. This was due to continue until the year 2000. It has been extended by this government for an additional period, but that period certainly falls well short of the original year 2000 cut-off date which this bounty was meant to enjoy and which, no doubt, many industries had planned on. Very substantial growth has occurred in the IT industries in recent years. Looking at some of the figures associated with that, IT industries and markets, through the framework of the IT industry map, reveals that 7,500 businesses were operating in the IT industry since June 1993. One hundred and eighty-nine were in the communications services, 278 were in information equipment manufacturing and over 4,800 were in information services. A critical fact for this government is that more than 95 per cent of these businesses had fewer than 20 employees. Australian revenues from IT markets grew from less than $20 billion in 1990 to over $33 billion in 1995. In 1995, almost 46 per cent, over $15 billion by value, of this total revenue came from communications services; 31 per cent, just over $10 billion, from information equipment; 14 per cent, nearly $5 billion, from information services; and the remaining nine per cent, or nearly $3 billion, from software and content. This is a very massive and substantial industry-one which is primarily focused in many small businesses. As I said, more than 95 per cent of the businesses involved had fewer than 20 employees. This bounty would have cost the government less than $100 million over the next four years, but its withdrawal will have a counterproductive, countervailing impact on the industry way in excess of the revenue the government will save by discounting this bounty so much earlier than would otherwise have been the case. Australia particularly needs to ensure that its IT industries are furthered. We have a very substantial deficit in this country in the import of hardware and software facilities. Australia is a very heavy user of IT equipment--one of the largest in the world, in fact. Unfortunately, most of it is imported. We make very little of it here. Unless we are able to address this deficit in IT equipment, Australia will be the worse for it as we head into next century. Obviously the importance of IT, not only as an industry in Australia but as an aid to manufacturing, as an aid toJwance and service industries, as an aid to the flow of information and the application of that around the country, will be severely undermined if Australia is not able to address the deficit in the information technology industries which we are rapidly accumulating at the present time. The withdrawal of this bounty sends entirely the wrong signals to the information technology industry. The Industry Commission recently examined this very bounty back in 1995. They did not recommend a renewal of this bounty at that time, but they took that decision in the context of all of the other arrangements which were in place to assist industry. For example, at the time they took that decision, the government was offering a 150 per cent tax concession in relation to research and development. Under legislation we will debate when the House resumes in just over a week's time, the government is proposing to reduce that concession from 150 per cent to 125 per cent-a very substantial change and one which was not taken into account by the Industry Commission when it made its report. Likewise, the massive reduction in grants under the EMDG and other AusIndustry initiatives, all of which were cut savagely in the last budget, were all there and put in place to ensure that industries like the IT industry were able to grow and prosper. The combined effect of all of this government's decisions in the budget-the withdrawal of bounties, the withdrawal of tax concessions for research and development, the withdrawal of industry initiatives-will fail completely the Prime Minister's test of: does it affect jobs and does it affect growth? Unfortunately, it certainly does and it affects us very adversely. NA",105
232,Mr SPEAKER,ADJOURNMENT,"Order! It being 5.30 p.m., I propose the question: That the House do now adjourn. Child Care",108
233,Mr LEE,ADJOURNMENT,"This afternoon I would like to use the adjournment debate to speak about the impact of the government's first budget cuts to child care on the federal electorate of Dobell. I would like to address two issues: firstly, the impact of the government's decision to remove operational subsidies for community childcare centres; and, secondly, the impact of the government's decision to cut child-care assistance to a maximum of 50 hours per week. Mr Miles-We have just had this debate.",108
234,Mr LEE,ADJOURNMENT,"The parliamentary secretary at the table said we have just had this debate. I would not have mentioned, except for his interjection, that the minister responsible, Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan), has just left the chamber. Given that she was aware I was going to speak about child care, perhaps the minister will come back at 6 o'clock to respond to the points we are making. We live in hope. In many ways we do not hold the Minister for Family Services responsible. We would have hoped that in the Expenditure Review Committee she would have tried to defend community child-care centres across the country against these cutbacks. We can only try to give her the benefit of the doubt and suspect that she might have fought against these cuts but, unfortunately, whatever position she took in the ERC, the facts of life are that child care in Australia has been cut as a result of the decisions of the government. I would like to tum first of all to the government's decision to remove operational subsidies from community child-care centres. In my own electorate, community child-care centres are run by the local councils on the central coast. They receive a subsidy from the federal government to help low income earners afford child care. Most central coast community child-care centres cater for noughtto two-year-olds, which is the most expensive group to provide quality child care for. Community based child-care centres in my electorate include those at Bay Village, Gorokan Care and Learning, the Spotted Gum Child Care Centre, Tom Stone Child Care, Watanobbi, Kanwal Care and Learning, Tyrell Place at Bateau Bay and also Karinya Child Care in East Toukley, which I had the honour of opening a few years ago. This is now within the electorate of the honourable mem centre is also providing quality child care to people who live in my electorate. There are about 600 young kids receiving quality child care in these centres. It is those children who will be the hardest hit by this government's decision. Wyong Council, which operates these centres, estimates that the government's decision to remove the subsidies will add another $20 to $25 a week to child care or the $80 to $100 a month per child for each parent. Many parents in Wyong, Lake Haven, Gorokan and Bateau Bay just will not be able to afford this. They will be forced to leave full-time work to stay home with their kids or trust their children to ad hoc child care. One of the ironies is that, as a result of this decision, the new Kanwal Care and Learning Centre, which the subsidies of the former federal Labor government helped fund in January 1996, will now be struggling to survive without having to charge those high fees which some parents will simply be unable to afford. They will have to question whether they will be able to send their children to this new centre. I now tum to the second issue, that is, the government's decision to cut child-care assistance to a maximum of 50 hours per week for all parents. I know that the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Latham), like myself, has many parents who have to spend many hours each day travelling to and from work. These will be the parents who will be hardest hit by the decision to impose this new limit of 50 hours per week. The government's decision, of course, is another broken election promise, not just to the parents on the central coast of New South Wales but right around Australia. They said that a Liberal-National Party government would maintain the system of child-care assistance. But, in fact, what they have done is hurt those parents on the New South Wales central coast. Fifty per cent of parents work outside the region, usually in Sydney. These parents face an eight-hour working day and two to four hours of travelling. It will be their children who will be the hardest hit. I would particularly like to mention Spotted Frog Kindergarten in Gorokan, which provides 39 places for threeto six-year-olds in long day care. Most children are from two income families where parents work outside the area and rely on long day care to be able to work in Sydney. These parents, whose incomes are not high, will be hit by the limit on hours and the means testing of child-care assistance. Many of these parents have recentassociated ly presented me with a petition from 149 families opposed to the government's heartin less child-care cuts. This is along with hunabout dreds of other people in my electorate have asked me to express the strong opposivictims tion of central coast residents to this government's cutbacks.

This is a time when we as a nation can pay tribute and homage to those who gave their lives so that we may be able to live in He said: a free and open society. The Returned Services League, the organisation which I am sure all members of this place would know, was formed especially to service those men and women who served Australia in the defence forces. In 1985 it changed so it could include those service personnel currently serving in the Australian defence forces. The RSL mission statement says: To ensure programs are in place for the well being, care, compe-sation and commemoration of serving and ex-servIce Defence Force members and their dependants; and promote government and community awareness of the need for a secure, stable and progressive Australia. The RSL evolved as a direct result of the camaraderie, concern and mateship shown by the diggers for the welfare of their mates during, at the cessation of and after the 191418 war. That ethos of compassion and service remains the motivating influence of the league. It was only last month that the RSL celebrated its 80th anniversary. The league had its first meeting in Melbourne 80 .,CW""S ago in the 1916, just 17 months after the Gallipoli landing. Rather than becoming a political party, it decided to become a pressure group. The RSL has taken on many issues as a result since then. One recent example is the Black Hawk tragedy. Two of the soldiers that died in that tragedy were from my electorate. Two other SAS soldiers involved in that tragedy were with my children's school and one was, in fact, teaching my son to kick a footy my absence. I know how the RSL feels this particular issue. In fact, the presiwho dent is advocating that the Black Hawk and serving personnel involved in training be eligible for cover under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. The campaign for these families continues. The league takes up many other issues for its members. There are around 232,000 RSL members of the RSL nationwide. The presiin a recent interview in the Canberra Times, said that, while the RSL holds basic values, the league is capable of great change. The name changes over the years reflect that-from Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia to Returned Servicemen's League to Returned and Services League. They reflect deeper changes to meet the contemporary times, which is as it should be. In Western Australia, the league is very active indeed. I have many constituents for whom the RSL is very prominent in their lives. In the last few years, we have heard a lot about the reconciliation with our indigenous people in this country, and the RSL has also been part of this process. In fact, Mr Jack Babbage, who is chair of the Western Australian state branch of the membership committee, seeks to encourage eligible Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander veterans and ex-service members to join the RSL. There were many Australians who fought in wars this century. Many of these Australians were, in fact, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. They should be strongly encouraged to join the RSL, and they should also be encouraged to join the Australian defence forces, as should any Australian who wants to join. I raised this issue with the Minister for Defence Industry, Science and Personnel (Mrs Bishop) a few weeks ago, when I asked what initiatives the government was taking to encourage Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders to join the ADF. To achieve increased recruitment of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people into the Australian Defence Force, the minister said that the ADF had initiated, firstly, the production of a segment for indigenous people's TV programs featuring indigenous people in the ADF today; secondly, the identification of indigenous personnel in the ADF who can be used as role models and used actively in marketing; thirdly, a review of brochures and posters to ensure that Australia's ethnic groups are included in the images of ADF members; fourthly, identification of suitable indigenous ADF personnel to feature in recruiting duties; fifthly, the inclusion of cultural awareness and recruitment courses; and, sixthly, the establishment of a support group to improve the likelihood of training completion and retention of indigenous members in the ADF. So these initiatives to encourage Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders to join the RSL and the ADF reflect an adaptable organisation in changing times. I fully support the RSL moves to encourage returned and current service Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders to join. I am sure the other members of this place will have a similar view. Next Monday is Remembrance Day. Let us use that day to remember and reflect that Australia is indeed a lucky country and a peaceful country, and we should never take that for granted. Labour Market Programs",109
236,Mr ANDREN,ADJOURNMENT,"I rise tonight to draw attention to the loss of the LEAP and REEP labour market programs, which has already impacted heavily on landcare and local government environment programs. There is no doubt the green corps, provided for in the budget, will not be able to replace LEAP. The DEETY A paper 'Questions and Answers, Budget 1996' states that green corps will have 240 places in 1996-97, 1,260 in 1997-98 and 2,000 in 1998-99. This is an extremely low number, given the size of the environmental problem and considering these figures are Australia-wide. The organisation to be appointed to conduct green corps has to be a national one. This means it might have no existing regional structure, commitment or support. I believe local community involvement in the environment is the only way we are going to deliver outcomes, and LEAP in the Cal are electorate video has certainly delivered that. Across this region, 29 landcare and rivercare groups, nine local government councils and 40 community groups have been assisted in projects such as fencing remnant vegetation and tree planting in Capertee Valley; water management and native vegetation restoration, improving farm productivity and creating wildlife habitat at East Saltram Creek, near Bathurst; major wetlands work at Lake Pilans, Lithgow, to rehabilitate a section of Cox's River catchment, and hence Sydney's water supply; and biodiversity studies and platypus surveys in association with Charles Sturt University. If green corps is to be as small as proposed, its impact will be minimal, and in regional terms negligible, compared with the achievements of LEAP in the central west. If green corps does not have a regional and local infrastructure, any flexibility and responsiveness to local needs, as demonstrated in its effectiveness to date, will be lost. I have had submissions from Landcare, the farmers association, councils, the Central West Community College and the general public on the short-sightedness of axing LEAP. They are at the coalface of what Landcare and StreamWatch should be all about. LEAP participants have developed a sense of belonging to a project because that project belonged to their patch of dirt. I have said before-in my first speech in this place, in fact-that LEAP not only should be locally based and generated, but should be long term-two days a week for three years perhaps-so that sense of belonging and ownership can last from commencement to fruition. As one former provider of LEAP programs has told me: Because they are locally based they give young people in rural areas an opportunity to develop skills and new directions, explore options and prepare to leave their home bases where necessary for employment while still contributing constructively to their local community. The providers of the former LEAP programs are already geared up to deliver environmental programs. They have tools and equipment-in one case, five minibuses and trailers. There will not be enough green corps participants in all to fill three minibusesbased on the figures I have seen-west of the mountains let alone in the central west. I said in response to the appropriation bill that the green corps is a great concept, but it needs to be greatly expanded beyond a warm and fuzzy concept into a development from LEAP-locally administered and locally driven with relevant local outcomes. There is a real danger that, by tendering out the green corps program to a national provider, the locally specific needs of landcare and environmental management will be lost. There is a real concern in my electorate that the excellent work begun by LEAP, under the guidance of local labour market providers, will be lost unles- green corps is greatly increased in numbers. I said in my speech during the heritage trust debate that the Murray-Darling 2001 project is in reality a 3001 project-so huge are the problems in that basin alone. LEAP played a significant role in beginning to rectify those problems, which green corps, as planned, certainly will not unless it is greatly expanded and, importantly, localised. Safety Awareness Trucking Industry",110
237,Mr COBB,ADJOURNMENT,"Last Saturday, along with 45 to 50 other members around Australia, I participated in the Road Transport Forum's Drive for Safety Awareness Week. In my case, that involved driving in a Mack truck, a B-double in my case, from Dubbo saleyards into the civic centre building on the edge of the CBD. This particular truck was owned by Walkers Transport and I was accompanied by Gary Walker. I congratulate the Road Trans-ort Drivers Association for being involvtd in such a worthy project. You certainly get a different perspective of road safety from high up in the cabin of one of these trucks compared with being in a car. You become more conscious of things like turning circles, stopping distances and the courtesy and consideration which is sometimes lacking in the car drivers that you meet on the way. In fact, 70 per cent of crashes that involve large vehicles are actually the fault of the other road user. The trucking industry, which I want to address, provides 1.7 per cent of the jobs in this country. They shift $60 billion worth of freight across Australia every year, which is 75 per cent of all our freight. The fact is that we could not survive as a nation without trucking. It is interesting to look at the economics of it. The truck that I was in, the Mack Prime Mover, cost $220,000 and the two trailers of the B-double cost $180,000-$400,000 in total. When you add the cost of registration, maintenance, fuel, insurance and wages of the drivers, et cetera, you can see that, as an absolute minimum, you have to gross $1,000 a day just to recover your costs. To run the truck at $3.20 a kilometre, you have to be doing over 300 kilometres a day every day of the year, or in excess of 115,000 kilometres a year. To make a profit you have to be driving the truck over 200,000 kilometres a year. I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard a short table, which I have shown the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister (Mr Miles), which addresses some of the statistics of single-deck trucks, Bdouble trucks and road train trucks. Description Length(m.) Single deck B-Double 25 Road Train 36",111
238,Mr COBB,ADJOURNMENT,"I thank the House. The table shows quite clearly that two B-doubles on the road, which cart 1,320 sheep, is equivalent to three single-deck trucks, which also cart 1,320 sheep. By putting two B-double trucks on the road instead of three single-deckers, you will get one truck off the road and save about seven metres in length of trucking. So it is an actual advantage to road safety as well as being more economic. Looking at it another way, if you put three road trains on the road, which is equivalent to six single-deck trucks, you actually get three single-deck trucks off the road. Or if you had 15 single-deck drivers in your company and you replace those 15 single-deck trucks with 10 B-doubles, it would mean a reduction of five drivers and you would end up with 10 better drivers, on average, than the 15 drivers that were on the road. So it is cheaper, you get a better quality of driver and you have fewer trucks on the road. These bigger trucks are nearly all equipped with air cushions instead of steel springs, which are softer and less jarring on the road pavement. It is better for the truck and better for the road. Because of air cushions, you can load them up another 11/ 2, two or three tonnes per axle. I would like to also acknowledge the need to upgrade the Newell Highway between Dubbo and Gilgandra. There are three bridges there and some other sections of road that need widening so that we can accommodate B-doubles and road trains on that section of the road. If stock is coming into Dubbo from the north, they have to divert through Trangie, which is an extra 100 kilometres to travel. At Leave granted. The table read as followsNo. of stock carried Gross Weight(t) Sheep Cattle Cost/Km. $ 19 42.5 440 50 2-40 62.5 660 70 3-20 79 880 100 4-40 $3.20 a kilometre, you can see that that adds about 50c per sheep to the freight costs of sheep that land at Fletcher's abattoir in Dubbo. That is eventually deducted from the producer at the other end. This highlights how vital good and adequate roads are not only to safety but also to the economics of the industry in this country. Last year 2,017 people died on the road. We have to aim to get that down to under 1,900 in the future. Alcohol is a factor in 30 per cent of fatal crashes, speed in 25 per cent and fatigue in six per cent. Young people make up 15 per cent of the population and 30 per cent of those killed-and 25 per cent of those killed did not wear seat belts. This was a very worthy exercise that I participated in. (Time expired) Proposed Devolution of Commonwealth Services to the States",112
239,Ms MACKLIN,ADJOURNMENT,"I want to use this time tonight to make an appeal to the government to come clean with the nation and admit that the Council of Australian Government process that it is engaged in is a failure. This government is driven by a ruthless and inflexible ideology that the best government is no government, that the best regulation is no regulation. This government blew its trumpet loudly about transferring everything to the states when it came into government. Now we see from the papers going to COAG next week that this process has been totally stalled. It is time for the government to admit that the states, even the most conservative, do not want a bar of this poisoned chalice. They have gradually come to the realisation that what this government really means when it says 'reform' is 'make do with less' or 'funding cuts'. This government has tried to con the states and the Australian people into thinking that its proposed devolution of Commonwealth services to the states would mean greater efficiency and improved service delivery. The first clue to their real agenda was provided by the National Commission of Audit which said that any devolution of services should be parcelled up with an across-the-board funding cut of 10 per centthis, of course, in the guise of an efficiency dividend. In other words, the states would have their budgets cut. In public housing, this government has decided to abandon a policy that has operated since World War II in favour of a leap into the unknown. This government, it seems, will be leaping into the unknown alone because the states are increasingly coming to the view that the government has no idea of how it intends to effect its changes. Labor certainly accepted the need that the Commonwealth-state housing agreement needed to change. This government is planning to take us in the direction of increasing reliance on market forces to provide housing stock and rental assistance as the only means of accessing housing-a policy tried with disastrous consequences in the UK and the US. This is a direction that Labor and the state governments of all political persuasions are refusing to follow. A similar rejection has been registered with the government's plans to devolve aged care to the states. Since these plans were first mooted by the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wopldridge), I have had meetings all around the states, both with providers and consumers. In all these meetings, those providers and consumers have made clear their very grave concerns with the government's plans of devolution to the states. The proposals that the government is making as part of the COAG process involve fundamental changes but at this stage are incredibly light on detail. I want to tell the House about some statements in the issues paper on aged care that is going to COAG next week. It is interesting to note that, since this paper was first drafted, it now contains a very important disclaimer. It says that the release of this paper: ... does not, however, imply any commitment to transfer of aged care responsibilities. Such a commitment could only occur after further consideration by Ministers in early 1997, including consideration of the outcomes of discussion in response to this paper. Agreement would also need to be reached on approaches to ensuring improved outcomes for people and the adequacy of funding for aged care now and into the future. A little later in the paper it say;:,. Its release does not, however, imply any commitment to transfer of aged care responsibilities-such a commitment could only occur after further consideration ... This is yet further delay on consideration of very important issues. This issue is being delayed further and further. As it says at the end of the paper, submissions on this paper are now not due until the end of February next year. This government is afraid to govern and is using the COAG process simply as a means of avoiding making decisions. I repeat my plea to the government: admit that the COAG process will not work. Take responsibility for aged care. Do not keep up the farce that this important Commonwealth policy should be sent to the states. It should not be. Aged care is far too important to be sent away to six different places to be cared for. This government cannot deliver. The farce that is going on at COAG should stop now. Save Eddie Campaign",112
240,Mrs ELIZABETH GRACE,ADJOURNMENT,"One of the great things about being a parliamentarian is being able to organise ways within your electorate to help those who need assistance. Eddie Hazna, a six-year-old boy living in Albania, was one such person who needed this support. Eddie suffered from the same life-threatening heart condition that claimed the life of his older brother. Doctors in Albania did not have the technology to diagnose, let alone treat, Eddie's condition. The bottom line was that Eddie was in great trouble. In June this year Eddie's aunt, Mrs Hana Hysen, contacted my office to see what I could do for Eddie. We immediately organised a fundraising campaign amongst the Lilley residents and organisations to give Eddie a chance at life. Dr Dorothy Radford of the Prince Charles Hospital offered to diagnose Eddie's condition and do any subsequent operations free of charge so long as money was raised to cover the cost of the hospital. The ballpark figure at that stage was $4,000. The Northside Chronicle, a Quest community newspaper, must be applauded for the professional and caring manner in which they published Eddie's plight. I would like to thank personally the journalist, Michael Crutcher, for his personal involvement. I believe he is now known amongst his peers as 'the Eddie correspondent'. The response to the Northside Chronicle front page story on Eddie was phenomenal. Cash and cheques just flowed into the office for weeks. Many of the donations were anonymous. There were two individual donations which stick in my mind. The first was from a lady who wrote a cheque for $500. When my staff inquired why the generosity of the donation, she replied, 'When I was five I needed a heart operation and the community rallied around me. Now its payback time.' Another donation that warmed my heart was from an elderly man who walked into the office and handed in a bagful of coins and said, 'The boy needs this more than I do.' The bag of coins totalled $37.50. The second phase of the 'Save Eddie Campaign' came in the support of local schools. Clayfield College and Boondall State School both held plain clothes days to raise money for the appeal. The Heart Foundation organised a jump rope demonstration at the Toombul shopping centre and the Brisbane North Chamber of Commerce did a whipround at one of their breakfast functions. The Albanian community provided considerable support and finances. After reading about Eddie's plight, the Islamic mosque at Lutwyche also gave a large donation. In the end, we managed to raise the healthy sum of just over $5,000. We did, however, encounter some problems. We approached airlines to sponsor Eddie and his father on the trip to Australia. Unfortunately, this was not able to be fixed up and Kedron Wavell Services Club had to come to the rescue and pick up the cost of the airfares. This was after they had already made a sizeable donation to the appeal. Eddie arrived in Australia at the end of August and was met by a large contingent at the airport. An hour after the plane had landed and we still had not seen Eddie, we began to think they may have missed the connection in Singapore. However, it turned out that Eddie was very excitable and while his dad waited in line at customs and immigration, he kept running off. As a result, dad had to chase him and kept losing his place in the queue. However, they finally came through customs and the joy on the faces of family and friends was well worth the effort of the fundraising. In such an exercise, unforeseen circumstances were bound to crop up. After his first visit to the doctor, Eddie had to have his badly decayed baby teeth removed because of the risk of infection. We are thankful that the fundraising efforts had been such a success that we were able to accommodate this additional expense. Eddie was diagnosed with a hole in the heart and a twisted aorta. But the good news is that Eddie had a 95 per cent chance of surviving surgery. That is 95 per cent better than if he had stayed in Albania. Eddie had his heart operation on 29 October. The electorate of Lilley is happy that all went well and he will be back at his aunt's home this week. I am proud of the residents of Lilley who contributed so generously to Eddie's appeal. It is heartening to know that as a community we have made a difference in Eddie's life. I am proud to represent such a wonderful and caring electorate. Unemployment",113
241,Ms ELLIS,ADJOURNMENT,"Today I stand quite alarmed. The Howard and Carnell governments in the ACT have done something really wrong and they have got it wrong. Today's ABS unemployment figures give us an 8.5 per cent trend unemployment rate and youth unemployment sitting at 53.5 per cent. It seems that each time the unemployment rates come out I have an opportunity to stand up and say things as gloomy as that. There is absolutely no doubt that their policies that are affecting the ACT and pervading my electorate of Namadgi in such a way that, with policy cutbacks in Public Service numbers and in Public Service expenditure, although interest rates may be down, I can tell the government that so are the values of family homes. The economy in the ACT is suffering unbelievably under the two levels of conservative government in the ACT. When I look at a youth unemployment rate today of 53.5 per cent in the ACT, I ask the question: what future do our school leavers have to look forward to in the next month or two with the sorts of policies that are currently under way? The private sector is retracting as fast as the public sector is, for obvious reasons. I implore both levels of government to look seriously at the policies they have in place because the effect on the ACT and on my electorate is dramatic to the point that there is absolutely no economic future to look forward to. Each time the ABS figures are released, I will stand up in this place and repeatedly deliver this message. Mind you, I do look forward to the day when it will be a positive message.

(2) What was the purpose of the stocktake and what savings are expected as a result of it.",114
242,Mr SPEAKER,DETAILED INFORMATION,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No costs were incurred by the Joint House Department as the stocktake was undertaken by staff of the Hyatt Hotel Canberra's Room Service Section.

(2) In terms of the contract between the Joint House Department, representing the Commonwealth, the Hyatt Hotel Canberra and Advanced Food Systems for the provision of catering services in Parliament House, the contractors are obliged to maintain safe custody and control of cutlery and crockery that have been provided by the Commonwealth for catering services.

There has been a lot of debate about the I would like to make some observations on industry have been participating in, off and failed so dramatically. As I see it now, the demand for textiles throughout the world. Wool fallen dramatically in the importing countries. In China, we see the demand, as best we can major importing country, there has been a 47 and in Korea and Taiwan a fall of 26 per cent. they reflect the overall position of the wool countries for both wool and other textiles that in the wool price and, in many cases, the gradual or so.

The figures, the during the last two decades of the reserve buffer final reserve price scheme-have clearly indicated commodity price, even though Australia within this parliament about reserve price, decline of the profitability of the wool release schedule which, it is my view, has worked stockpile and approximately $1 billion of debt the problem is now within manageable levels. that 187,000 bales per quarter under the fixed been executed.

Quite frankly, electorate the perception is that this bill is cannot ever be voluntary euthanasia across Australia. is not the case. What this bill is seeking to do is to amend 1978, the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) 1979.

Main Committee adjourned at 1.04 p.m. NA The following answers to questions were circulated: Contaminated Sites: Kilburn, South (Question No. 543) Mr Tanner asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 20 August 1996: (1) Have the detailed environmental surveys of contaminated sites at the Australian National Islington workshops at Kilburn, SA, referred to in the Auditor-General's report No. 31 of 1995-96, been completed; if so, what were the findings; if not, when will they be completed. (2) Are these sites (a) within Australian National's property portfolio, other than the ton workshops, or (b) elsewhere for which he has portfolio responsibility which have been used for dumping foundry waste, acids, alkalis, scrap metal, arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, nickel, lead, zinc or asbestos; if so, so in each case, (i) where is the site located, (ii) what is the nature of the dumping, (iii) what surveys have been conducted, (iv) what were the findings, (v) what measures have been proposed to manage, contain or remove the contaminants and (vi) what is the estimated cost of each proposal. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The site referred to in the Auditor-General's report No. 31 is adjacent to, and not part of, Australian National's (AN) Islington workshop. This land is still owned by AN but has been declared surplus to AN's requirements and AN has sought to return it to SA as it is required to do under the SA Transfer Agreement. The decontamination of this site was the subject of a detailed report by the CSIRO dated 12 January 1996. A copy of the report has been provided to the Honourable Member's office. Separately, AN has advised that an environmental compliance audit for the Islington workshops site has been completed. Following the audit, AN engaged a panel of environmental consultants to conduct further investigations. This work is expected to commence soon. (2)(a) AN engaged consultants Rust PPK to undertake a detailed environmental audit of its property portfolio. The report revealed contamination typical of railway activity at 106 NA ing the presence of contaminants such as hydrocarAustralia bons, heavy metals, pesticides and asbestos. However, these sites are located at various properties throughout AN's railway network, not at the Islington workshops. (2)(b) The following information refers to the properties of other bodies within the portfolio. The Australian National Line PQes not have property which has been used for dUdlping foundry waste, acids, alkalis, scrap metal, arsenic, cadmium, copper, nickel, lead, zinc or asbestos. There is, however, some low-level incidental contamination at sites due to general industrial use. On the Australian Maritime Safety Authority'S Isling- (AMSA) establishment a significant property portfolio associated with the operation of lighthouses was transferred from the Commonwealth. These facilities had been operated at various times by State and Commonwealth agencies and the extent of contamination, if any, on these sites is not known. There is some possibility of low level contamination at lighthouse sites due to the use of petroleum fuels, asbestos building material, lead/acid or zinc/acid batteries, and mercury from optical mechanism bearings. AMSA is in the process of commissioning contamination audits, for which results are not yet available, at the following lighthouse sites to establish the extent of any contamination associated with the sites earlier use as manned lighthouses. New South Wales Queensland Cape Byron Booby Island Green Cape Bustard Head Norah Head Cape Capricorn Point Stephens Cape Cleveland Smoky Cape Cape Moreton Sugarloaf Point Sandy Cape Double Island Point Goods Island AMSA is currently transferring the majority of former manned lightstations to the various State governments. Conditions of the transfer are generally that AMSA receives a 'nil' value, with the State accepting any liability for· any contamination that may have been associated with the operation of the sites includ- earlier lighthouse technology. The Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) has developed a Contaminated Sites Register thereby maintaining the current but constantly changing status of contaminated sites. The register provides details on the specific contaminants referred to in the question-arsenic. cadmium. chromium. copper. nickel. lead. zinc. and asbestos. The register does not include the broad terms of foundry waste. scrap metal. acids and alkalis. which could be found on any airport or large tract of land that has or is being used for commercial/industrial activity.

Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Wetland Areas (Question No. 575) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 20 August 1996: (1) What was the incidence of bird strikes at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport during the period from 1 January 1991 to 31 December 1995. (2) What measures will be adopted by the Federal Airports Corporation in response to the development of wetlands in the vicinity of Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport and at Towra Point near Kurnell. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) During the period from 1 January 1991 to 31 December 1995 a total of 278 occurrences were reported to the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation involving bird strike at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. Of these occurrences six resulted in minor damage to the aircraft. (2) The Federal Airports Corporation has advised that Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport will continue to manage the wetlands under its control in accordance with the Botany Wetlands Management Plan. The Federal Airports Corporation has advised that it is not involved in the development of Towra Point near Kurnell. Sydney Olympic Games: Vehicular (Question No. 620) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 9 September 1996: (1) What estimate has been made of the additional vehicular transport that will converge on Sydney in the period immediately preceding, during and immediately after the Sydney Olympic Games. (2) What discussions has his Department had with the NSW Department of Road Transport about the ability of the NSW road system, and Sydney in particular, to handle the increased volume of vehicular traffic. (3) What consideration is being given by his Department or any agency for which he is responsible to assist NSW cope with traffic problems resulting from the Sydney Olympic Games. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Olympic bid materials made it clear that the NSW Government considered that Sydney land transport infrastructure in place now, and planned to be in place by 2000, would be adequate to meet demand generated by the Olympics. (2) The Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) has had discussions with the NSW Roads and Traffic Authority (RT A) regarding ground access links serving Sydney Airport for the Olympic period and  RT A on the need for adequate connecting roads between the airport and the proposed Eastern Distributor and the M5 East.  cost $55 million for road and car park improvements at the Domestic and International Terminals at Sydney Airport. Further road - s within the airport boundary are under consideration for construction by the year 2000. Planning mechanisms are in place to ensure adequate coordination of these works with those contemplated by the RTA. Second Sydney Airport: Air Traffic Projections (Question No. 628) Mr Mossfield asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 9 September 1996: Do reports exist of studies on (a) air traffic projections for the Sydney region or (b) how the air traffic needs of conurbations similar to Sydney elsewhere in the world have been conducted; if not, on what basis did the Government decide to Transport commit taxpayers' money to build a second Sydney airport. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) Yes. Air traffic projections are produced by a number of organisations, including the Department of Transport and Regional Development. During 1994 the then Department of Transport provided aircraft and passenger movement projections for the Sydney Basin to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure (HORSCOTI) as part of the 'Inquiry into the Sydney 2000 Olympics'. In July 1995, the Department provided similar projections to the Senate Select Committee on Aircraft Noise (SSCAN), and to the Sydney Airport Consultative Committee (SACCC). The projections are currently being updated to reflect the latest available statistical information and will be released in the near future. (b) Yes. A significant body of research exists on the development and management of existing multiairport systems in a variety of cities throughout the world. This research will be drawn on in the development of the Environmental Impact Statement. Second Sydney Airport (Question No. 651) Mr MCClelland asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 10 September 1996: Will the construction of a second Sydney airport at Holsworthy affect the navigational routes of planes utilising Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport (KSA); if so, will it necessitate a review of the long term operating plan for KSA being devised by the Sydney Air Traffic Management Task Force which is due to report to him on or about 16 December 1996. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Possible effects of a second major airport at either Badgerys Creek or Holsworthy on the navigational routes of planes using KSA will be considered in the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) currently being prepared for the proposed airport development. Airservices Australia is working with the EIS consultants on this issue and is taking into account potential effects on KSA flight paths from the proposed second Sydney airport. Australian Security Intelligence Organisation: Files (Question No. 656) Mr Robert Brown asked the Attorney General and Minister for Justice, upon notice, on 10 September 1996: (1) Is he able to say whether the Department of Foreign Affairs threatened to issue a Ministerial Certificate in the name of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to prevent the release of 122 pages of Australian Security Intelligence Organization (ASIO) files on the late Bruce Joseph Milliss, in a case brought by Mr Milliss's son before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, on the grounds, inter alia, that their release might jeopardise ASIO's method of operation. (2) Had ASIO intercepted telephone calls to and from the Soviet Embassy and recorded conversations between Mr Milliss and the Soviet Trade Attache, as well as similar conversations with the Polish Consulate in Sydney; if so, is the interception and recording of telephone conversations to and from foreign Embassies and High Commissions a violation of Australia's obligations under international law and Australian law. (3) Have the diplomatic privileges of any other countries been offended by the interception of communications to or from their embassies in Australia. (4) Will he give an assurance that ASIO no longer engages in such practices. Mr Williams-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The Honourable member has directed the same question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The Minister for Foreign Affairs is better able to answer a question concerning actions by officers of his Department. (2)-(4) It has been the policy of successive Australian governments not to comment on operational intelligence matters as to do otherwise might prejudice national security. I intend to maintain that policy. I am advised that documents have been released to Mr Milliss's son. I do not intend to comment on what the documents III question might or might not reveal. Australian Taxation Office: Office Relocation (Question No. 678) Mr Filing asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 12 September 1996: (l) Is the Australian Taxation Office in Northbridge, WA, to be re-located to Cannington. (2) Is this relocation convenient for WA taxpayers. (3) Is rental at Cannington in the region of $325 per square metre while at Northbridge it is $87 per square metre. (4) What savings will result from the relocation. Mr Costello--The Assistant Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (l) The Australian Taxation Office (A TO) is currently considering proposals involving making savings in accommodation and administration expenses by implementing best practice standard. The benefits gained from improvements will be used for additional staff and support for operation of the Taxation System for the Australian community. In relation to buildings occupied in Western Australia, the ATO proposes to actively market both buildings to determine which accommodation to retain. (2) The Commissioner advises that the ATO has no plans to reduce services to taxpayers. The ATO recognises the need for new work practices, greater operational efficiency and increased use of technology in continuing to provide a high level of services to taxpayers. For example, the ATO plans to make greater use of electronic communication in a number of ways, and this could provide significant benefits to the business community in dealing with the ATO. It may mean some services are delivered differently in future, but the ATO remains committed to providing a high level of service to taxpayers. (3) The rental at Cannington is within the region of $325 per square metre and at Northbridge it is of a higher order. (4) Subject to the outcome of further investigations and consultation the ATO anticipates a reduction in overheads, through consolidating staff numbers and flexible work patterns. This reduction will allow investment in new technology and compliance improvement initiatives which will assist in putting more people into jobs dealing directly with the community. Emission Standards (Question No. 772) Mr Jones asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Development, upon notice, on 19 September 1996: Standard Current ADR37/00 ADR37/01 (1) US 1994-6 (2) (1) To be phased in over 1/1/97-111199. (2) The US 1994-6 standards also increase the ""Full Useful Life"" standards from the current period of 5yrs/80,OOOkm to lOyrsll60,OOOkm, while allowing some relaxation of emission limits after 5yr/80,OOOkm. (3) The US 1994-6 standards require total hydrocarbons ::;;0.26g/km, with the non-methane hydrocarbons content being ::;;0. 15g/km. (2) I am not aware of any Australian made vehicle components being exported to the US being rejected. Any company exporting a product needs to ensure that it meets the standards laid down in the receiving country, which may of course be different from those in Australia. Australia is (1) Are emission standards for Australian-made motor vehicles lower than those for vehicles made in the USA; if so, what are the comparative standards. (2) Have exported motor components made to Australian standards been rejected by the USA; if so, (a) are those components now being made to higher standards and (b) why are the higher standards not adopted in Australia. Mr Sharp-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The current emission limits in Australia are generally less stringent than those ie Mte US. New standards which start to take effect in Australia from 1 January 1997 are equivalent to those standards which applied in the US until the end of 1993. The emission limits for passenger cars are listed in the table below, which shows Australia's current standards [ADR37/00], the standards which will start to come into effect in Australia from the beginning of next year [ADR37/01] and the current standards in the US. These later Australian standards are already being reviewed to establish standards which would take effect early in the next century.

Council for the Order of Australia (Question No. 814) Mr Latham asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 15 October 1996: (1) Further to his answer to question No. 679 (Hansard, 9 October 1996, page 5065), are Admiral Sinclair's entitlements and enrolment as a member of the Council for the Order of Australia different to those arising from his appointment as Chair of the Council; if so, what are the details. (2) What are the nature of transport-related costs the Government has agreed to pay Admiral Sinclair for his attendance at inter-State Council meetings. (3) What home base has Admiral Sinclair nominated for the purpose of travelling allowance and transport-related costs.",150
265,Mr HOWARD,CONTAMINATED SITES INFORMATION,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) No. (2)-(3) See my answer to part 2 of Parliamentary Question No 679. Meetings of the Council for the Order of Australia are held in Canberra and Admiral Sinclair attends these from his home near Newcastle, NSW. There are no other ""inter-State"" meetings of the Council for the Order of Australia. Medicare Provider Numbers (Question No. 824) Mr Filing asked the Minister for Health and Family Services, upon notice, on 16 October 1996: (1) Has his attention been drawn to claims that the Government's decision to alter access rules for Medicare Provider Numbers applied to general practitioners is likely to result WA medical students being unable to practice. (2) Is it a fact that, unlike Sydney or Melbourne, there remain shortages of general practitioners in WA which will be exacerbated by alteration of the access rules. (3) Is it also a fact that WA relies on its city based junior doctors to staff a highly successful locum support program for country doctors which has enabled doctor vacancies in all rural towns except Laverton to be filled and that these changes will put these regional medical services at risk. (4) Will he ensure that WA is not disadvantaged by these changes.",158
266,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,CONTAMINATED SITES INFORMATION,"The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Claims that new medical practitioners in WA will be unable to practice medicine are without foundation. There is no reason why any medical practitioner who wishes to do so will be unable to practice medicine. The Budget measure limiting Medicare access for new medical practitioners will only affect a very small proportion of WA medical students. Most medical students will continue to gain access to training places offered by the RACGP and specialist colleges. The handful of new graduates not going on to post graduate training will be able to work in salaried positions such as those offered by public hospitals, government, the armed forces, pharmaceutical companies and academia. Available figures indicate that there are large numbers of vacancies in these areas. (2) In January 1996 the Australian Medical Workforce Advisory Committee issued a report providing medical workforce benchmarks in respect of all medical disciplines including general practice. On page 21 of the report the Committee concluded that overall WA had an oversupply of 163 general practitioners (ie 13.9%). By comparison the oversupply in NSW and Victoria was 20.5% and 17.7% respectively. The fact that shortages remain in certain areas is a problem common to all states, including NSW and Victoria. These shortages are particularly common to rural areas and public hospitals and reflect the mal distribution of the medical workforce rather than an overall shortage. (3) The rural locum support program operating in WA is heavily subsidised by Commonwealth Government funding. Funding for this program has continued in this year's Federal Budget. Furthermore funding for such services is likely to increase by virtue of $20m additional funding per annum being made available as part of the budget measure aimed at redressing the maldistribution of medical practitioners. In addition, I have recently announced that continued access to Medicare will be available to new doctors working for approved rural locum annually in up to 40 programs. (4) It is difficult to envisage why any state would be disadvantaged by these changes-particularly as they are likely to result in a substantial improvement in the distribution of the medical workforce. Furthermore the provision of $20m pa to assist in the redistribution of the medical workforce is likely to produce substantial benefits for rural areas in all States including WA. Unexploded Munitions (Question No. 839)  Defence, upon notice, on 17 October 1996: (1) What means is available to locate and remove unexploded munitions in firing range areas. (2) Has the technology in use improved as a result of the techniques and equipment utilised during the Gulf War in 1991; if so, what is the nature and effectiveness of the improvement. (3) What cleansing rate of unexploded munitions, expressed as a percentage, can be achieved on firing ranges. (4) What is the cost per hectare to remove munitions and how long does it take to clear a hectare. (5) Does the cleansing process involve risk to personnel; if so, what is the level of risk. (6) To what depth and surface impaction can it be guaranteed that unexploded munitions have been removed. Mr MCLachlan-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) There are a number of technologies available for the detection of unexploded munitions, including magnetic resonance, magnetic flux, ground penetrating radar and infra red and thermal imaging. Once detected, unexploded munitions can be uncovered and destroyed or rendered safe using a variety of means, for example with explosives. (2) Most clearance procedures used on the Gulf War battlefield dated from World War II. However, improvements are being effected for both battlefield and non-operational clearance, mostly in relation to methods of detection. The combination of various technologies such as magnetic detection, radar and thermal imaging will result in higher probabilities of detection. (3)-(4) No definite rate of detection or clearance costs and timings can be provided as these depend on the type of munitions, how it was delivered, its size, the soil conditions and the detection and clearance equipment used. Commercial clearance companies will provide a cost for clearance of a particular area of land, dependent on the factors listed. (5) There is always some level of risk to personnel in dealing with unexploded munitions. The risk is related to the type, size and condition of the munitions and the nature of the land. The level of competence of personnel involved in any operation is also a factor. (6) The depth of clearance is - Pindent on the size of the munitions, soil type and other environmental factors, and the type of clearance equipment used.",158
