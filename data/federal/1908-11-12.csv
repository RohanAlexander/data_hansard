0,NA,Unknown,"BOUS E of Heprcsentattbes. Thursday, 12 November, 1008. Mr SPEAKER took the chair at 2.30 p.m., and read prayers. 1 RESIGNATIO N OF MINISTERS . NEW ADMINISTRATION . ced",11
1,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Ballarat-Minister Exan ternal Affairs) [2.31] - Yesterday I waited upon His Excellency the Governor General, and tendered the resignation of Ministers. At his request we retain office pending appointment of our successors. quently he sent, I believe, for the honorswom able member for Wide Bay, and commisand sioned him to form a Government. At the on the subject. honourable member's request I move That the House, at its rising, adjourn until Tuesday next. Question resolved in the affirmative. |82] ADJOURNMEN T. NEXT DAY OF MEETING-CONSTITUTIONA L POSITION OF NEW ADMINISTRATION. Motion (by Mr DEAKIN) proposed - That the House do now adjourn.",11
2,Mr STORRER,Unknown,"Bass) [2.32] - It was not very courteous to those who come from-, distant States not to consult their convenience in fixing the next day of meeting. While Tuesday may suit those whocome from South Australia and New Soutb Wales, it is well known thit the Tasmanian representatives cannot get to their homes and return before Wednesday.",11
3,Mr FAIRBAIRN,Unknown,"Fawkner) [2.33] It would be a convenience to honourable members to know how long the next sitting will last. If it is to be merely a formal one, occupying, perhaps, five minutes, it would not be worthwhile for members to come from distant States to attend it, as those of us wbo live in and near Melbourne could attend in a sufficient number to mako a quorum.",11
4,Mr REID,Unknown,"East Sydney) [2.34] - The probability is that on Tuesday we shall have merely the formal announcement of the names of Ministers; no one expects the new Prime Minister to make his policy speech then. If by common consent it were agreed that nothing beyond the announcement of the names of Ministers should happen, honourable members who reside at a distance would not find it necessary to attend on Tuesday. The important occasion will be when, after Ministers have been duly sworn, and have framed their policy, they submit it to the House. Noone wishes to inconvenience the representatives from Tasmania, and it seems to methat, upon the general understanding to which I refer, it will - be unnecessary for members from other States to come Here on Tuesday. After Ministers have annountheir policy, there will, no doubt, be adjournment for a reasonable period.",11
5,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,For how long?,11
6,Mr REID,Unknown,"The honourable member the for Wide Bay being only commissioned to Subseform a Government, and not having been in , cannot make an announcement, should, therefore, not be interrogated",11
7,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,Surely we can pass our criticism upon the position?,11
8,Mr REID,Unknown,T do not suppose that any one wishes to criticise the new Government until its policv is announced. Any attempt to do so would meet with my strongest chant opposition. The convenience of every honourable member will be met if we arrive at the understanding that on Tuesday next only the formal announcement of the of names of Ministers will be made.,11
9,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Swan) [2.36]. - Thes e repeated adjournments may not commission. inconvenience members who can readily return to their homes, but for those who are. situated as I am, they are very incontion? venient. There is no reason why a compact body like the Labour Party, which has been considering the situation for weeks, should not be able to announce today what names are to be submitted to His Excellency Governor General. If the honourable ber for Wide Bay is as strong as I think he is, he might have settled the matter this time. To adjourn next Tuesday for another week will cause still more inconvenience. We bave lost a week which might have been devoted to public business, and Christmas is now not far off, while there still remains a great deal to be done. When the new Ministers have submitted their policy, and the debate on it has been cluded, there will scarcely remain time do more than pass the Estimates. I do know whether I am at liberty to speak upon the action of the members of the Labour Party in taking office; but I would as clo so now as later on. There is a f u attendance of honourable members.",12
10,Mr REID,Unknown,"It must be remembered that the honourable member for Wide Bay, not having been sworn in, could not to any criticism', and therefore it would be General . unfair to make it. Several honourable members interjecting",12
11,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Interjection marks across the Chamber are out of place on an occasion like this, and I ask honorsuggestion. able members to refrain from conduct that i? unseemly. The question before Chair is the adjournment of the House.",12
12,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"I wish to and know from you, sir, as I .have the fullest confidence in your judgment, whether I am marks which I am about to make. at liberty to make some observations on constitutional position. If I am, 1 speak now, instead of later on.",12
13,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,It will not be a decent thing to do.,12
14,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"That is a matof reading them. ter of opinion. I must be the judge of my own conduct. It is not my intention to the cat jumps. say anything outrageous, but I wish, if in order, to deal with the constitutional tion-no t at great length, although in terms, perhaps. I wish to ascertain, in view of the attempt of the Labour Party to gain office without, in my opinion, possessing a sufficient majority, what promise support it possesses, and what assurance has been given to the Governor General that its leader is in a position to accept his",12
15,Mr CROUCH,Unknown,Surely the right honourable member has no right to ask that ques,12
16,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"If , Mr. Speaker, you think that, although I should be within my rights in taking this line of action, it would be unusual or undesirable, the I shall bow to your great knowledge of memparliamentary procedure.",12
17,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I think the matter by which the righti honourable member has raised is scarcely a question of order. Whether the right honourable member ought or ought not to say certain things of which only he himself knows, is a matter of which he should judge, and not I . As the right honourable member, - however, has asked conwhether I consider the course which he to proposed to take unusual or not, I am not bound to say that that course would seem to me to be unusual, and also undesirable from two points of view. First, that no soon Government has been Â«is yet formed from l l what the right honourable member termed the Labour Party, and secondly, that it would be very improper for the honourable member for Wide Bay at this moment to make a disclosure of anv remarks which reply he mav have made to the Governor",12
18,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"I shall, accept s and reyour ruling, Mr Speaker",12
19,Mr WILKS,Unknown,"It is not a ruling, it is a",12
20,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Then I shall the accept your suggestion, sir, although I take it as a ruling so far as I am concerned, will bow to it if you still hold the same opinion after hearing the further reIt the seems to me. that if I do not do what I will propose to do now, the honourable member for Wide Bay will have no opportunity whatever of considering my views, nor will the Governor General have an opportunity",12
21,Mr JOHNSON,Unknown,Now we see which wav,12
22,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"I think not. posiI have had no interview with anybody, and trenknow no one's views on the subject but my own. I shall have no opportunity of expressing those views with any effect after the mischief has been done, and it seems to me that it is mischief. Of course, the honourable member for Wide Bay cannot take office with a party of twenty-seven against the rest of the House, but he can do so if , besides those twenty-seven, has a promise of support for the policy programme of his party from a sufficient number of other honourable members. "" Mr HUTCHISON - The right honourable member would have risked it all right.",12
23,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"My remarks must be troublesome to those honourable members, judging by the interruptions,",13
24,Mr MATHEWS,Unknown,I did not think the right honourable member would take a defeat so badly.,13
25,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"There is no defeat as far as I am concerned. point I wish to press is that it is rather late to talk about a thing when it has ments. been done. It is better to take the opporassumed tunity, which it seems to me I have on occasion, of protesting against what is about to be done. If , sir, you are still of the same opinion as that which you have just expressed, I shall at once conform to y_our judgment.",13
26,Mr TILLEY BROWN,Unknown,"Indi) [2.43] I should like to pour a little oil on troubled waters, and make a business suggestion. Unfortunately, we have been called here today unnecessarily. I quite understand the disabilities attaching to the formation of a new Government, but I do not think we ought to be called together again until some definite information can be placed before us. I am satisfied that the press will be good enough to inform honourable members as to who are to compose the. new Ministrv, and that time will be permitted to honourable members from other States - to reach their homes. If the House could be adjourned from today until Tuesday week, the leader of the Labour Party, and future Prime Minister, would then be in a position to unfold his policy. In that way the time of honourable members will be saved and a business principle would, perhaps, for once, obtain in this House. ,",13
27,Sir JOHN FORREST,Unknown,"Swan) [2.44] When J was interrupted I wished to ask, Mr Speaker, whether you are still of the same opinion as that which you previously expressed, after the additional remarks that I uttered. [ 8 2 ] -2",13
28,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"I did not understand that the right honourable member desired .1 further ruling from me. If I had, I should certainly have given it immediately upon his resuming his seat. I can only add that I think the course which the right honourable member proposed to take is very he unusual, and, if I might be permitted to or say so-although , of course, I could not rule in such, a direction-as o undesirable.",13
29,Mr DEAKIN,Unknown,"Ballarat-Minister of External Affairs) [2.45] - In moving the motion for the adjournment of the House until Tuesday, next, I did so without explanation, assuming that all honourable members would be perfectly aware from the necessities of the case that all that could transpire on that day would be the announcement of the formation of the new Government, and a motion for adjournThc ment to enable the new Ministers to make themselves acquainted with their DepartI f I had not unfortunately that, some of this discussion might this have been spared. When that explanation is offered, however, the honourable member for Bass will see that the representatives of-Tasmania will not in this case suffer any disability, even if they are not able to be present on Tuesday next. All that we have to secure is that there shall be a the quorum present to hear the statement. Question resolved in the affirmative. House adjourned at 2.47 p.m.",13
