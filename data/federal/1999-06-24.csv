Firstly, I want to say that I attended committee report To have and to hold. I would Attorney-General for acknowledging the outstanding honourable member for Menzies, in this area a short period I was privileged to serve under quite significant. I would like to think I am have never written a couple of chapters The point I would like to link up with is that area where we need to move forward on a broad government is increasing money there but, as at least $3 billion. I think the more governments The second is child support-and I do not want the Family Court.

I want to acknowledge that the Thursday, 24 June 1999 put ACT judges in the same position as Northern in relation to 'prior judicial service'. Act 1903 will expressly exclude conferral of a Court. The question needs to be asked, 'Why does The comment that I make on that is that it is not general criminal jurisdiction. The Federal Court in almost all civil matters arising under federal in some s,ummary criminal matters and also appellate jurisdiction from the ACT Supreme Court The Federal Court does not have the expertise nor the facilities for jury trials which are Federal Court jurisdiction only in civil matters, jurisdiction of state and territory courts in provision cannot be interpreted to give the court laws. I thank the House for the indulgence and and I commend the bill to the House. the Attorney-General will not be disappointed changes encompassed in this omnibus bill. The a portfolio area to make a number of significant example, I note that one of the changes proposed affects the Family Court. I wondered if the launch of the government's response to the like to thank the Prime Minister and the contribution of Kevin Andrews, the of pre-marriage education and counselling. For Kevin on that committee. His contribution was an interventionist chairman, but I have to say I of a report, which is what Kevin did. I feel there are three pillars in the family law front. The first one is Kevin's area. The it was pointed out, breakdowns are costing us put in, the, greater the potential of reward. to get into that-and the third is reforming friend, Barbara Dutton, come into my office. She in some of the more difficult cases. She get some changes in. I was really taken aback on that front. That led to a conference we had players-rethinking family law proceedings'. has given to the Australian Law Reform Attorney-General has been active in reform in REPRESENTATIVES MAIN COMMITI'EE Thursday, 24 June 1999 the family law area. I feel that we need to to deprecate the changes that he has already initiated. I am pleased to say that the conference senator, and we had Commissioner Dr Kathryn Commission, who is the commissioner responsible I was tremendously impressed by her contribution. it had been a written contribution. We invited somewhat disappointed that she declined to contribution. I think the Attorney-General is that we need to make significant changes to to say that it is a Rolls Royce court We also then had a contribution from a she wanted to be anonymous. The two made Other speakers included Michael Green QC, the I was pleased to launch; Sara Blazey from Reid, a barrister. Kevin Andrews contributed quite presented a paper on family law tribunals. It was really interesting to have three members party, able to contribute in a very non-partisan not confined to the club-the judges, barristers much broader. In fact, the conference was Mount Druitt and Area Community Legal contributions of Ahmed Zraika and Ros Gibson. the legal centre, for which I am eternally students-Pat Johnson was the lecturer When we talk about family law we nearly women get everything, the men are not paying at the commonality of the themes that were coming experience of the woman had such a powerful experience. You could have substituted that that Sara Blazey, from the Women's Legal Resource narrow point of view, but that was not the questions after her contribution were surprised people and that the most adversely affeCted conference. The Attorney has introduced legislation to pre-empt any discussion of that, and I cannot be improvements in it, but the point I would we have a m!lgistracy in the Family Court. you do not get a greater feeling that people are you do in any other state.

I think some of the men who asked loaded at the answer. My point is that this affects are the children, which was the theme of our establish a federal magistracy. I do not want to speak for the Labor Party. We see that there will like to make is that, in the Attorney's own state, I think that as you go around Western Australia satisfied with the processes of family law than paper that I delivered about tribunals. limited the government's options in That has occurred under the states, which have quite successfully, without the intervention of for ordinary people. My proposition is that we NA 7524 MAIN COMMITTEE ought to look at setting up state family law tribunals as a pilot, again in Western Australia because the state constitution, if we do not want to go right across the country. The recent High Court add a further spur to such thinking. The challenge for the Labor Party is that was originally considered in family law under adversarial system-we have to come to grips cooperative federalism, even though that has may not always be the case that to deliver Commonwealth umbrella with Commonwealth and their constitutions to look at state family appeal from a tribunal to a District Court, District Court given a family law warrant. appellate structure of the federal One of the great advantages in this era of money or sufficient money in the system is that aid money. If you had a tribunal that operated arbitration, so that you are arbitrating only to, under the state jurisdiction you would not Court, should there be an appeal. The appeal tribunals at the state level have demonstrated as being fair and reasonable. They deliver outcomes but they operate on a shoestring. There are some cases that you are always going can do that in the District Court. This could I might say, though, that Sara Blazey made as assault and battery and sexual assault are the problems of the woman involved. That really there is a principle that you should fast-track to deal with the vast bulk of the issues. The a choice. If someone wants to argue a case in give people a choice. Overwhelmingly, constituents choice. Mr Deputy Speaker, I suppose I could go I just want to say in conclusion that this latest Brandy case, I find desperately disappointing General and the government in terms of establishing work our way through. As far as the Labor Party it is. appropriate, when a government introduces reactive commentary about whether they go far been the process in the last parliament. I think and develop approaches to family law reform. It is disappointing to me that there are not of members of parliament that do want to see Thursday, 24 June 1999 under state constitutions. We can do that the Family Court there already operates under the whole way and introduce it in one fell swoop decision in re Wakim: ex parte MCNally may if we are desirous of really moving back to what Lionel Murphy-that is, a less formal, less with whether or not there is a place for been normally a term used by the coalition. It the best service it must be done under the money. Perhaps we ought to utilise the states tribunals. There would be, of course, a right of and you could have some of the judges in the Then again, maybe you would wish to keep the Family Court for appeals. arguing about whether there is sufficient legal aid we could actually redirect some of that legal on a process of conciliation first, then those things that you cannot conciliate the parties have to have a de novo hearing at the District would be on some point of law. Of course, the that they have processes that the parties accept that, by and large, are n<;>t challenged, to need to fast-track into the court, and you be for anything of a criminal nature in my view. the argument that, where criminal matters such involved, court proceedings actually exacerbate came as a bit of a shock but, by and large, such matters into courts and allow the tribunal other point is that you are actually giving people the District Court, as I propose, let them, but in my electorate would opt to take the on and on. I do not want to earn your wrath but decision of the High Court-which, like the because of the way it constricts the Attorneytribunals-we may very well be able to is concerned, I have to say that I do not think changes, for an opposition to always give a enough or not far enough.

Main Committee adjourned at 12.41 p.m. NA The following answers to questions were circulated: Nursing Homes and Hostels: Demand for (Question No. 307) Ms Hall asked the Mjnister for Aged Care, upon notice, on 7 December 1998: (1) Is there a mismatch between the local availability of, and demand for, nursing home and hostel beds; if so, what steps is the Government ""taking to make beds available where needed. (2) Is it a fact that proportionally the aged population of the electoral division of Shortland is among the highest in Australia but that its per capita nursing home/hostel. bed rate is half the national average; if so, why. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop-The answer to the honourable member's question'is as follows: (1) The Government operates an aged care planning system that targets localities where there is a demonstrated need for new care services. Planning takes account of demographic data on the numbers of aged people in a particular locality and data on Commonwealth and other Government services. Aged Care Planning Advisory Committees in each state advise on the regional allocation of Places per 1,000 people aged 70 and over-June J999 Central Coast High Care (nursing home) Low Care (hostel) Community Aged Care Packages Total Hunter High Care (nursing home) Low Care (hostel) Community Aged Care Packages Total NA new places. The Government then advertises for Beds applications from potential service providers in targeted localities. Applications are competitively assessed against legislated cri-eria. The former Hawke/Keating governments left the Australian community 10,000 aged care places short. They did not meet their own publicly established benchmarks. The Coalition is fixing this and has substantially increased funding to the residential aged care sector. Since the Howard Government was elected in 1996 funding has increased by 42% to $3.5 billion. (2) Legislation requires the Government to plan in terms of Aged Care Planning Regions. The Government does not keep planning statistics on electoral divisions. The electoral division of Shortland falls into two Aged Care Planning Regions: Central Coast and Hunter. Parts of seven other electoral divisions fall into these two regions. The following table shows the provision of operating and allocated aged care places in the Central Coast and Hunter regions compared to the national benchmark, as at June 1999. Operational/Provisional/Advertised Benchmark 37 40 27 50 12 10 76 100 Operational/Provisional/Advertised Benchmark 45 40 41 50 10 10 96 100 Since coming to office, the Howard Government regions-554 to the Central Coast and 687 to the new services to meet the needs of Community Aged Care: Expressions of (Question No. 518) Mr Mossfield asked the Minister for Aged Care, upon notice, on 23 March 1999: (1) When will advertisements seeking expressions of interest in another round of community aged care packages appear. (2) Will non-ethnic specific packages be provided in the local government area of Blacktown, NSW; if not, why not. Mrs Bronwyn Bishop-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) The 1999 Aged Care Approvals Round was advertised on 24 April 1999, in national and regional newspapers. The advertisement called for applications for residential care places and community care packages. For the first time iq this round people can apply for residential care grants, extra service status, approved provider status and restructuring assistance. (2) The local Government area of Blacktown is in the NSW Aged Care Planning Region of Western Sydney. 20 care package places for the general community have been made available for allocation in the region in the current round. has provided an additional 1,241 care places to these Hunter-to help overcome Labor's legacy and provide older Australians in those regions. National Farmers Federation: Grants Interest (Question No. 664) Mr Martin Ferguson asked the Minister for Aged Care, upon notice, on 1 June 1999: (1) Has the Minister or a department or agency administered by the Minister provided grants to the National Farmers' Federation (NFF) or bodies related to the NFF since 2 March 1996; if so, (a) in each case, (i) what was the nature of the grant and (ii) for what purpose was it provided and (b) what total sum was provided. (2) To what boards, committees or other bodies for which the Minister - as portfolio responsibility have (a) Mr DonaldM¢Gauchie (b) Dr Wendy Craik or (c) other officers or staff of the NFF been appointed since 2 March 1996. (3) What sums has the Commonwealth paid in (a) sitting fees, (b) board fees, (c) travel costs and (d) related expenses with respect to each appointment referred to in part (2).
