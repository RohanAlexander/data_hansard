1,Mr SPEAKER,Unknown,"Hon. R. G. Halverson OBE) took the chair at 9.30 a.m., and read prayers. NA AMENDMENT (RESTART AND EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES) BILL 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Anderson, and read a first time. Second Reading",13
2,Mr ANDERSON,FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill is one of very substantial importance for rural Australia. The bill establishes the new farm family restart scheme and the exceptional circumstances relief payment for farm families. The bill introduces an important element of the government's integrated rural policy, Agriculture-Advancing Australia, which will help to build a competitive, sustainable and profitable rural sector. The measures introduced in this bill will ensure that farm families experiencing financial hardship have equitable access to welfare support. The rural sector accounts for a major share of Australia's exports and provides the basis for much of the nation's value adding food and fibre processing industries. Its economic health and profitability is vital to the future reform. prosperity of Australia. The rural sector has faced unprecedented challenges in recent years. While the top 20 per cent of farm businesses are performing well, data collected by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics show the sector, as a whole, has endured a long period of negative profitability. Severe drought, low commodity prices and cost pressures, particularly in the farm finance market, have created a very difficult operating environment for farm businesses. My intention is not to talk down the sector and paint too gloomy a picture; it is simply to acknowledge that the circumstances our farmers have, and in many cases continue to endure, are very difficult. Their resilience in the face of adversity is, indeed, admirable. There is, however, another side to the coin, for while there are challenges to be overcome, there is no poverty of opportunity for our farmers. They are efficient, competitive producers of high quality, clean food and fibre. They are ideally positioned to capture the significant opportunities presented by the rapid growth of Asian food markets and inter. national trade reform. Much has already been done by the government to position rural Australia to succeed in the years ahead. Our preparedness to rein in government expenditure and put the Commonwealth budget on track for surplus, together with the broader micro-economic reforms in areas such as the labour market, is very good news for agriculture. The maintenance of low inflation and continuing reductions in real interest rates have allowed real progress to be made in reducing business input costs, and provided a boost to Australia's international competitiveness through the resulting decline in the value of the Australian dollar. While much has been done to get the big picture right, there is still more the government can do to help secure the foundations of Australian agriculture. This bill is about investing substantial resources where it matters, just as the government has done through the natural resource trust and in areas such as quarantine and meat inspection Agriculture-Advancing Australia is a comprehensive package with four key objectives; firstly, to help farm businesses profit from change; secondly, to provide positive incentives for ongoing farm adjustment; thirdly, to encourage social and economic development in rural areas; and, fourthly, and very importantly, to ensure the farm sector has access to an adequate welfare safety net. Agriculture-Advancing Australia is the direct result of many government initiated reviews of rural policy which have been conducted over the past 18 months. These reviews have drawn on the expertise and experiences of many involved in the rural industry. Extensive consultation with state and territory governments, farmer groups and the public has contributed significantly in shaping the measures introduced today. The initiatives in this bill, the farm family restart scheme and the exceptional circumstances relief payment, have received widespread and generous endorsement from key farming bodies such as the National Farmers Federation. In the past, the interrelationship between rural welfare and business policy objectives has not been fully appreciated. In a sense, the integration of family life and welfare with the management of the farm business has been taken for granted. This interrelationship needs to be recognised in addressing the welfare needs of farming families. It we do, if we are to ensure the current transition in outlook from the family farm to the family farm business runs to a successful conclusion. This means also that welfare measures need to be distinct from measures targeted at improving the profitability of farming businesses. This bill has been carefully designed to meet the coalition's long standing commitment to address these important welfare issues while at the same time taking account of the uniqueness of family farm business structures and the vulnerability of farming families to natural events. Just as importantly, the measures contained in this bill offer carefully targeted assistance to those who wish to adjust out of farming. Additionally, it provides income support for those farm families who find themselves suffering financial hardship as a result of exceptional circumstances which are beyond their capacity to manage. j The new farm family restart scheme is the government's key program for delivering income support to the farm sector. It also provides adjustment assistance to farmers who wish to leave the industry. The proposed amendments offer an innovative approach to assisting farm families. This legislation provides farmers with the opportunity to give serious consideration to the future of the farm and family without having to rush decisions. It recognises that it takes time to come to grips with the possibility of a future that does not entail farm ownership. It allows them to keep working the farm while they review their situation. It relieves the tremendous pressure than can arise from literally not being able to put food on the table. The farm family restart scheme will provide a decision support system for farme-s considering exiting the industry as well as those who need the breathing space to refocus their farm enterprises. This scheme provides access to professional advice for farmers to help them assess the future viability of their business. The farm family restart scheme will begin on 1 December 1997. I will now provide the House with details of the features of is imperative that the new scheme. Income support will be provided to low income farmers who cannot borrow further against their assets. This support will be equivalent to the newstart allowance, plus partner allowance where appropriate. Very importantly, and I know this is of great interest to the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy over thereMr Bruce Scott-A very bad one.",13
3,Mr ANDERSON,FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT,A very bad one. Mr Bruce Scott interjecting,14
4,Mr ANDERSON,FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT,"That is right, so he could put that gloating dial in front of a whole lot more people. Very importantly, under this arrangement, there is no requirement for the farm family to put the farm on the market or undergo an activity test as would be the case if they were seeking support through the social security system. This support will be available to eligible farmers for up to one year. Recipients will face an obligation to obtain professional advice on the future viability of the farm business as well as ongoing professional advice to assist the family focus on either re-building the business where this is possible or leaving the industry. The government will provide financial support to the farm family to access this professional advice, which may include career counselling. A re-establishment grant of up to $45,000 will be available to eligible farmers. This grant will provide positive incentives for farmers to leave farming before their assets are severely depleted. Mr Martin Ferguson-Who'll be doing this next week, John? You'll have Transport, won't you?",14
5,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT,Mr Nehl)Order! The member for Batman! Mr Martin Ferguson-We're just testing to see whether you're awake.,15
6,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT,You will find out just how awake I am if you don't watch your step.,15
7,Mr ANDERSON,FARM HOUSEHOLD SUPPORT,"I emphasise that eligible farmers will be able to apply for lishment grant only during the first two years of the operation of the farm family restart scheme. To receive the grant, those who apply and meet the eligibility criteria will need to sell their farm within 12 months of ceasing income support or from the date of their application if income support is not sought. The re-establishment grant will be subject to a more generous assets test than past re-establishment grants, but any income support provided under the farm family restart scheme will be deducted from the grant. The new assets test will allow farmers to have up to $90,000 in assets to qualify for the maximum grant. The grant will phase down by $2 for every $3 in assets above this threshold. Farmers who have accessed the scheme for less than six months and withdraw will be eligible to apply to rejoin the scheme to complete the 12 months. Farmers who withdraw from the scheme after six months will not be able to rejoin. Support paid under this scheme will be provided as a grant-not as a loan scheme, which was proven ineffective under the former government's farm household support scheme. It resulted in low income farmers incurring debts to the government which they simply did not have the capacity to repay. This government has, in fact, decided to wipe the slate clean in regard to the household support scheme in days gone by and write off those debts. Those who have repaid-there are only a few of them-will receive a reimbursement. The Farm Household Support Act 1992 is also being amended to introduce the exceptional circumstances relief payment. The exceptional circumstances relief payment will be an income support payment available to farmers in areas declared to be in exceptional circumstances. Its rate of payment will also be equivalent to the newstart allowance, plus partner allowance where appropriate. It will be subject to the same income and off-farm assets tests that apply to drought relief payment to ensure it is targeted to farm families who are experiencing financial hardship as a result of. the exceptional circumstance. The exceptional circumstances relief payment will be equivalent to, and replace, the current the re-estabdrought relief payment. The exceptional circumstances relief payment gives recognition to the fact that there are exceptional circumstances which are beyond the scope of normal farm risk management strategies. It will be available to farmers suffering financial hardship as a result of rare and severe events including, but not restricted to, extreme drought. It will allow farming families to focus on the task of managing their businesses in circumstances which are challenging enough without the added burden of worrying about how they will meet their day-today living costs. The duration of this payment will be determined on a case-by-case basis according to the nature of the declared exceptional circumstance. A 12-month recovery period will continue to apply for exceptional drought. Farmers currently in drought exceptional circumstance areas and receiving the drought relief payment will progressively move to the exceptional circumstances relief payment. As their drought exceptional circumstances certificates expire, they will be issued with exceptional circumstances certificates. Farmers completing their recovery period for the drought relief payment or reaching the end of exceptional circumstances relief payment support will be eligible to apply for the farm family restart scheme if they wish to do so. The government will honour its commitments under the rural adjustment scheme. Farmers will still be able to apply for re-establishment assistance under the rural adjustment scheme until 30 November 1997. This will provide a smooth transition to the new farm family restart scheme when. it commences on 1 December 1997. This bill is an essential element in the government's rural policy platform. It is closely linked to other measures in the Agriculture-Advancing Australia package which will help to maximise the sector's contribution to the economic, social and environmental well-being of the nation, especially rural and regional communities. I commend the bill to honourable members and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Ms Macklin) adjourned.

CHILD CARE PAYMENTS BILL 1997 Cognate bill: NA (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS AND TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS) BILL 1997 Second Reading Debate resumed from 29 September, on motion by Mrs Moylan: That the bill be now read a second time.",15
8,Ms MACKLIN,CHILD CARE PAYMENTS,"I will just finish my remarks by quoting some material from yesterday's Sydney Morning Herald which sums up very accurately the problems that have been created for Australian families by this Howard government's cuts to child care. The article states: Back in April, the child-care centre had broken the bad news to the parents. The fees would increase steeply as a result of the Federal Government's decision to withdraw ... subsidies from community child-care centres. The fees for this family for two children had gone up to $267 a week on 1 July this year. The implication for this family was that the mother decided it was no longer worth her while to work. The article continues: Kellie earned $345 net as an accounts clerk ... It was a job she loved for the usual reasons-social, financial and self-esteem. ""I didn't want to leave but 1 couldn't afford to work,"" says Kellie. ""Basically, after expenses, 1 would be working for $20 a week."" ... they blame the Government for Kellie's unemployment: its families policies, and its Prime ... Kellie is convinced John Howard ""just likes women to be out of the workforce. ""I was not the only mother to take their kids out of child-care after the fee increase and other women cut down days."" Out of sight and out of mind, Kellie presents no problem to the Government. She is not looking for Parliawork and appears in no official unemployment figures. Of course, she will not be using child care. Her children will not get the benefit of mixing with other children. In fact, they have to be kept quiet during the day because Kellie's husband is a shift worker. This government is destroying child care in this country by taking huge cuts of $820 million that are driving up the fees for parents like Kellie and her husband, driving Kellie out of work force and driving their children out of child care. (Time expired)",16
9,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CHILD CARE PAYMENTS,Is the amendment seconded? Mr Lee-I second the amendment so ably moved by the member for Jagajaga and reserve my right to speak.,16
10,Mr BILSON,CHILD CARE PAYMENTS,"The member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) is demonstrating with the Child Care Payments Bill that Labor has now stooped to the SSS approach to policy development. That is the 'shower singing syndrome'-that type where only the person making the noise thinks it sounds okay. That is the approach that Labor is now taking to policy development in this country. There was nothing constructive offered by the member for Jagajaga, just the SSS approach-the shower singing syndrome-as a substitute for policy development. The rest of the world hears what is being said and thinks, 'Gee, that's not that flash,' but it sounds to the person making the noise. So I would encourage those opposite to think a little more positively and creatively about the issues facing the country. The Child Care Payments Bill is part of the government's overall program to enhance family life. Contrary to what the member for Jagajaga is suggesting, this government is about making choices available for families, choices that support the decisions families make about how they wish to manage their own affairs and to raise their children. A weekend or two ago, I noted the front page headline in Sydney's Sunday Telegraph suggesting that 'good times are here again'. That headline might have been related to the rising number of imports of champagne, but there are, indeed, good times here again. The one area where I think people understand the constructive and positive work the government is doing is the child-care area. The people that I speak to in my community understand that, with a $1OY2 billion deficit left to this government by the former Labor government, some tough decisions had to be made, difficult decisions, but decisions driven by trying to refine the policies and the programs that this nation offers to its people in a way that they can continue to be afforded for the longer term. People talk about things disappearing but, if you cannot afford them, that is when they become a tenuous and very vulnerable part of your life. When Labor looked at the Australian electorate before the election and said that we were on track for a surplus, we were not. We ended up having an enormous deficit in the budget, which this government has had to address. So when you start hearing those opposite talking about cuts in expenditure, bear in mind these are cuts from forward estimates that were phoney figures because in the last year of the Labor government they missed them by $1OY2 billion. When you start looking forward into the estimates for future years, how can you say there have been cuts? Labor tries to make its forward estimates sound credible when there is this enormous gaping Beazley black hole in the figures for the base year. These things good seem to be overlooked by those opposite, but this government has had to deal with that problem and provide a child-care system that supports choices families make. That is what this Child Care Payments Bill is about. It is good policy. It is a good policy because the government is making sensible decisions that bring about a fairer, more focused child-care assistance arrangement where the community's values are more in line with government policy, where the programs .that we are offering recognise the real circumstances of people. They can be delivered in the longer term because the nation can afford them. The policies are sound and they are affordable. They do not need to be whisked away from the Australian taxpayer and the Australian community because they are not affordable; these are affordable, forward looking policy reforms that are incorporated in this Child Care Payments Bill. Protecting that safety net is also a very important part of our lives, and this government is taking this very seriously. It has done that by making sure that the assistance that is available goes to the people who need the support, that the taxpayer funds that are made available are targeted to those people whose circumstances and needs warrant it. Most people welcome that. That is a renewal of policy. That is an understanding that largess is not a substitute for good policy. Labor, in its child-care arrangements, said, 'Build more child-care centres. Build them anywhere you like. Become property developers. Have a block of land that looks like it might support a child-care facility, that the local planning arrangements will give you that permit. Go and build it and then try to fill it up with people, regardless of whether the child-care centre is actually required.' Just building child-care centres, looking to all of the taxpayers and saying, 'We've got to keep all of these things filled up, so anyone who wants to front up and have some child care, just come on down. The taxpayers will fund that,' is not the way to run good policy. So the government said, 'Child care is very important to Australian families. How can we best deliver it? How can we make sure it keeps pace with the needs of the Australian community?' The government has recognised that in some areas of the community there are too many child-care places available for the level of demand, and in other areas there are not enough. In the community that I represent, we had too many child-care centres. There was an oversupply of places. All of the child-care centres were finding it difficult to stay financlearly cially viable because there were just too many places. If I am not mistaken, in the area that I represent and in the area the member for Isaacs (Mr Wilton) represents at least two child-care centres have had planning permits issued-so they can build more centreswhen we have an oversupply as it is. The government has said, 'Let's plan the provision of these places so they are available when they are needed.' That is why this bill incorporates 7,000 new places for each of the next two years across the nation, but not 7,000 places that will just be dropped somewhere that suits the property developer. No, that is silly. That undermines the system entirely. It makes all centres vulnerable. This is a program that is supported by a national planning system, where funding is prioritised to areas where it is needed. If we have growth in the participation rate and the labour market or if we have growing communities or changing demographics within the communities, we now have the planning instruments to direct those child-care places to where they are needed. That strikes me as frightfully sensible and, again, it is good policy. It is making sure that those services are available to those who need them and that the community's needs for child-care places are matched by their availability. It is not just 'let it rip', because 'let it rip- is no good for anybody. Because the government is convinced the community supports the targeting of assistance, in this bill there are arrangements to make sure that non-work related care is provided for. If people are not looking for work, in training or at education but they need some help with their child-care arrangements, that is provided for. Those opposite cry crocodile tearscrocodile tears you do not see when they are in the shower singing to themselves about their own policies-about how horrible this government has been. Yet we have said that, for those non-work related places, 20 hours a week are available, and that has been provided for in this package. Those opposite wanted to make it eight. The average amount used across the nation is 14 or 15 hours a week. So those people who needed that type of care would have missed out under Labor, but this government said, 'If people have engagements, if they require some respite support or if they need to carry out other matters in their lives, some assistance is available, but it is capped at 20 hours a week.' Those opposite wanted to make it eight. The other thing that is very important to mention is that this government recognises that some families have particular needs. Sadly, throughout our nation, there are children in family circumstances where the kids are at risk of abuse or neglect, of basically not getting the care they require. Most states operate child protection systems. When things get really rotten, someone from the state comes and makes arrangements for the proper care of that child. What has developed in this country is that the child-care system has been used as a bit of a stopgap measure, where those kids who are at risk of abuse or neglect or have special needs could be placed in child care. These are some of the challenges this nation is facing. Sadly, while the family was going through some traumas, often the best care, the best feed, the best attention and the best support for the child's development was actually in a child-care centre. We have recognised that as well in this bill and have said that, for those children who are at risk of abuse or neglect or who have some particular needs, that 20hour limit can be put to one side. This is about the kids. This is about supporting the kids' needs. The only negative reaction I have had about that 20-hour cap is from people who think it is too much. People have rung my office and said, 'I work. I'm out most of the week trying to earn a living and you're making child-care support available for people who aren't out working-and 20 hours a week of it. That's too much.' When you explain to them that most people do not use that amount, that their needs fluctuate or that the people who require that support are in difficult circumstances, is fine. That is generally accepted. But let us understand that, in the broader community, there is some view that 20 hours is actually too much, that the government has overdelivered, that it is providing too much assistance. When you go further into looking at this package, you see that it deals with special needs kids. Innovation and responsive care in child care is a hallmark of the coalition government's approach. For instance, Play Works, Noah's Ark Family Resource and Toy Library for Children with Special Needs are receiving over $900,000 for the three years to April 2000 to provide children's services resource development officers in the Frankston, Mornington, Bayside and Stonnington municipalities. Their aim is to increase access for all children's services offered to children with disabilities and children from nonEnglish speaking backgrounds. Centres are taking up that support so that all families, even those that have children with additional needs, can be accommodated within this system-so support is there and the child-care system is responsive to their needs. That is in this package as well. When you hear people saying that it is the end of the world as we know it, just think about the extra assistance being made available to those families who, because of their circumstances, were not able to access those services and programs that other people were able to. So far, 73 child-care services have received consultancy information and advice to support the inclusion of children with additional needs in that service area. There are already 19 children with disabilities and two children from non-English speaking backgrounds being supported after the program has been in operation for three months. When I travel around the child-care centres in the electorate of Dunkley, I am refreshed by the positiveness of their approach. You have heard those opposite talking about how the community sector just cannot cope with being put on the same level and treated in the same manner as those child-care facilities in the private sector. I have spent a bit of time in my life working in the public sector, and that I must say that nobody in the public sector pulls their pants on any differently to those in the private sector. This condescending approach that you hear from those oppositethat somehow people in the public sector are less able to deliver quality and affordable care and are lessable to be competitive with those in the private sector-needs to be rejected outright as an insult and a misrepresentation of the facts. Mandy Gatliff from the Frankston City Council was kind enough to make some time available. We toured all of the community facilities of the City of Frankston, and I was very impressed. They are offering first-class services to the citizens of the electorate that I represent-and they don't pull their pants on any differently. They are proud of their capacity to provide quality, affordable, first class care to the families of Dunkley. So when you start hearing that the world is coming to an end because people are on equal footing, think twice because that is just condescending nonsense from those opposite. The coalition has a real commitment to child care. Not only are we spending an estimated $742 million this year on child-care assistance to allow fees to be reduced for parents and guardians who have their children cared for in long day care, family day care, occasional care, and in some educational facilities, but also this amount is up by six per cent on last year's figure. That represents a real growth of four times that of the level of price rises. And we are being told we are having a cut. Just remember that when those opposite talk about cuts, they are comparing the figures with their phoney, fudged forward estimates figures which are so much a hallmark of their SSS approach to policy. I commend this bill to the House. I would encourage those opposite to do away with their SSS approach to policy developmenttheir shower singing syndrome-where the noises they make sound great only to those making the noises, but to the rest of us those noises sound like utter nonsense. They should put that to one side and get on with some constructive effort in this area. The families in this nation could benefit from those opposite taking a more constructive and positive approach.",16
11,Mr LEO MCLEAY,CHILD CARE PAYMENTS,"I rise to support the amendment moved by the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) and to oppose the provisions of the child-care payments legislation. Twenty-five years or so ago when my children were born, I was a tradesman and my wife was a schoolteacher. In those days if you were on a tradesman's salary, you and your spouse could make a choice about whether your spouse stayed home-in these more modern times, whether you stayed home-and cared for your children. A person living in Sydney in those days could buy a house for about 1V2 years of that person's salary. Indeed, the house that my wife and I bought a few years before Mark was born cost me $10,300 and my salary as a telephone technician was $8,500 per annum. The same house now costs about $200,000 and a telephone technician's salary is about $35,000. That represents a quantum leap in the cost of housing in the largest city in country. The situation in Melbourne is not all that different; Canberra is getting to be very expensive; and Brisbane is catching up with us. The choices that people had when I was a new parent are very different from the choices that my children will face and the choices some of their friends who are already married and have children are facing in Sydney today. That is caused by changing economic times and a whole range of things. But for the member for Dunkley (Mr Billson) and the government to come in here and say that the government wants to give people choices by reducing the amount of child-care assistance that parents will have is just a nonsense. What has changed from when the·· Prime Minister (Mr Howard) grew up in Earlwood in my electorate to the situation in Earlwood now is the economy of this country. Tradesmen do not have the choice they used to have because the changes that have taken place in this country mean that, if parents want to give their children a roof over their heads, both parents have to work. That is the simple fact of the matter. That might be unpalatable to some people; I think it is unfortunate. But that is the reality of life. What we as a government tried to do was to find ways to assist people who had children to work, where both parents wanted to do that. This is not only about economics but also about a quantum change in the views that women have on their roles in life, and quite rightly so, and the supportive role that men have in this regard. This is also a factor of the vast problem with marriage breakdown in this country where about one in three marriages now break up. In the main, women are the custodial parents and they have to work. Much as the coalition would like to tell us that there is a whole army of women out there living on the supporting parents benefit, that is not true. You exist on that; you do not live on that. If the greatest asset that this country has is our children, then what we should be doing is trying to ensure that, in their formative years, kids get the best chance that they can get in life. With both the societal and this economic changes that have taken place in this country, that means that a child's parent or parents are likely to be working. Fortunately, we have got away from one of those other problems of the 1950s-the problem of the latchkey children-because child care is a way of helping to provide care that in a safe and caring environment for preschool children and for schoolchildren whose parents have jobs which mean that the children need care before and after school hours. This government does not like that because it does not fit into the entrepreneurial view that people such as the member for Dunkley and the Prime Minister have that, somehow or other, we can flip back to the 1950s. It is all right, ,I suppose, that the Prime Minister's wife does not work, and those opposite would like to see that everybody else's wife did not work. They are doing all right with unemployment in trying to make sure that women lose jobs. If I were living in a taxpayerprovided house at Kirribilli on the harbour front in Sydney, that would be a very nice situation. But the view from Kirribilli is very different from the view from Campsie and Lakemba in my electorate. What people should make no bones about is that these bills represent a further reduction and further step in the government's policy of doing away with child care, if they can. It is not about being positive and creative, as the member for Dunkley tried to say it was, and it is certainly not about giving people positive choices. These bills do in fact give low income parents choices: whether one of the members of the family works or does not or whether the kids go to a child-care centre or not. The choice those low income earners in my electorate have is to not be able to send their children to child care because they cannot afford to send their kids to child-care centres any more. The government can try to disguise its intentions by saying it is committed to helping working parents secure quality child care and that the bills represent a major step forward for the provision of child-care services, and that is what the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) said in her second reading speech. But no-one should be fooled. You only have to look at the dollar terms. Less Commonwealth money is going to be spent on child care in 1997-98. Therefore, there has to be a reduction somewhere in what is being offered. We have known since the 1996-97 budget what the government had in mind. These pieces of legislation are putting the finishing touches to what the government started then. What was that? Last year, the government cut $500 million from child care. This year, the government will be cutting a further $321 million. The government claim to have as their objective 'assistance for families with dependent children to participate in the work force and in the general .community through supporting access to affordable quality child care'. Over two years, they have whacked $800 million out of the system. I hope they never try to hurt us. If that is how they are helping low income families, young families with children in child care, young families battling to buy a home and young families battling to give their kids some future security-by taking $800 million out of the system-let us pray they never turn on them. If they nick $800 million to help, my goodness, you would not want to try to hinder them. You certainly would not do that. It would be a joke, albeit a bad one, if it did not adversely affect so many people. Most importantly, the people that this affects are working women in lower income families. The middle class and the upper middle class probably still have a choice as to whether one or other of the spouses works when the children are growing up. But for working class families and low income families there is no choice at all. The government claim they have carried out extensive research and consultations with the child-care industry and with community organisations and families and, as a result, will be introducing a new national planning system. That sounds pretty good, but they say that this assessment of needs is due to be undertaken this month. They have a big planning process and they are going to do it this month. That all sounds very fine until you realise that future decisions on how to slice the ever diminishing child-care cake will be based on this assessment and some will miss out. For example, new places established in areas other than those identified as a result of those processes will not attract assistance in 1998 and 1999. So, we will have a planning process. The trouble is that not everyone is going to be in the process. What we have now is vast uncertainty in this whole area. Once again, the people who will probably miss out will be those low income working-class families. For people who are finding it very difficult to find a job if one of the family is out of work, this is yet another uncertainty put into their lives. It· is another impediment to them achieving what used to be the great Australian dream of buying your own home-a dream that, in the 1970s, I could achieve as a tradesman; a dream that, in the inner city of Sydney now, where I grew up, is getting harder and harder for a tradesman. Certainly a tradesman who is a telephone technician in 1997, who is married and wants a family would not be able to make that choice of having his children stay at home when he has a mortgage of over $150,000. The point that the government needs to stop prevaricating about and the point that people like the member for Dunkley should stop trying to spread disinformation about is that, if less money is going to be expended on child care, fewer people are going to be able to benefit or the same number of people are going to receive a lower level of assistance. I do not know how the government has organised the loaves and fishes trick of the 1990s, but if you take $800 million out and you have the same or more people in the system, then they are all going to get less. The reality is that the government has a plan to drive people out. The government wants to do the same thing with child care that it has done with unemployment. What is happening with unemployment now is that people are just not participating any more. They are opting out. They have tried to get a job and they cannot get one so they are giving up. You will have the same thing in child care. People who cannot afford to go to the child-care centres now will drop out. They will have a choice forced upon them, not a choice that they would prefer to make themselves, because many people are very close to or past the point where they can afford to keep their children in child-care centres. I have a lot of knowledge about child care in my electorate, and I can tell you that I have been to meetings in Hurstville, Earlwood and Campsie at which there were 400 or 500 people. These were not the people that the government· would say were rent-a-crowd. These are ordinary mothers and fathers who are concerned about the future for their kids. One woman who came into my office had had a terrible experience. She and herhusband had had three children in child-care centres. This woman had been happily working in a financial institution. She was not a person who went to meetings; she was not a whinger-as the government would say the other people were. Thinking that they should try the changes that the government was making, she rang the numbers the government said to ring to see whether the new system could help them continue on the way they were. She was told by the government department that she would have to pay over $300 a week for child care-and she was a clerk in a financial institution. She talked it over with her husband and, like the instance mentioned by the member for Jagajaga that was in the Sydney Morning Herald-I think that was about a family at Mount Pritchard-they decided that the only sensible thing for her to do was to resign from her job. Subsequently, she discovered that the advice she was given by the department over the phone was wrong and that she would have been entitled to some assistance. By then, it was too late and she had left her job. She and her husband were out on a limb. The government had given her the wrong advice. She had left her job and was in strife. They followed the revised advice that we got the government to put them on to, and they pursued some other options for assistance which they have been told they would qualify for. They completed forms. They produced documentation. They filled in more forms and produced more documents. And she still got nothing, and she is most unsatisfied. She has lost her job and she has been given the bureaucratic run-around. And that is what the government says is positive and creative? That is what the government says is a choice? It is a choice of madness-that's what it is. Another example of what happens to childcare services occurred in the City of Canterbury in my electorate. It is characterised by a high proportion-about one-third-of families oil low incomes of below $30,000 a year. In the council's long day care centres, 66 per cent of the children receive child-care assistance.Already, withdrawal of the operational subsidy has disadvantaged lower income families in those centres. It has restricted choices of quality child care and has forced some of them to leave work. The subsidies mean a lot to the people in those council run centres. Where the council has had to increase its fees, families have had to withdraw their children---,-nine children were removed from one centre alone--or cut back the number of hours their children attend, which obviously cuts back the amount of work they can do. Many have complained and protested. I know that, because they tum up in my office to do it. But that is not happening just in my electorate. The National Association of Community Based Children's Services recently conducted a nationwide survey to collect data from long day care centres and the users of those centres to analyse the impact of the government's changes to the economy of child care. The survey of 1,084 child-care centres showed that fee increases, brought on by the government's funding cuts, are forcing many women to withdraw from the work force or cut back from full-time to part-time work. Fees in community owned centres have increased by up to $18 per child place per week. In four states the weekly fee for one child in full-time care is $170 or more. More than four families in each centre have reduced hours or left the centre because of rising costs. More than 25 per cent of centres have reduced staff in an attempt to keep fees down. Seventy three per cent of parents exiting care cited increasing fees as the reason. Sixtyseven per cent of families leaving centres are now using informal care. Seventy-four per cent of parents report that fees are due to increase again before the end of the year. Throughout Australia families are being affected, as the cost of care is being pushed beyond the reach of ordinary working families. To remain affordable, centres are being forced to reduce costs and, as a consequence, the quality of care is going down, if the centres are to be affordable for their clients. Many families need to leave the children in care if the parents are to continue in the work force. They can barely afford it now, but they know that these costs are going to go up and up. As I said earlier, the only creative choice their that the government is giving a lot of working-class families in Australia is to return to the latchkey child problem. I do not think that anyone would like to see that, particularly nowadays when life for young children in the large cities of our country is becoming a bit unsafe. You are not quite sure where you would like to have your children cared for any more. The advantage, particularly of community based child-care centres, was that the parents could have a level of confidence in the care that their children were getting. I think this bill is very flawed. It is a disgraceful thing to say that it provides families with choice. It might provide middleclass and wealthy families with choice but, for working-class families, the choice is Buckley's. That is not good enough. It is not good enough for the parents of Australia, but it certainly is not good enough for the children of Australia. The government should really reconsider any further cuts they are going to make into this area of care. The amount of $800 million over two years is certainly enough. (Time expired)",20
12,Mrs ELSON,CHILD CARE PAYMENTS,"I find it quite offensive that the previous speaker, the member for Watson (Mr Leo MCLeay), had to insinuate that parents in Australia do not take responsibility for children and would put them at risk by putting them in backyard places and so forth and not take a general interest in where their children are being placed. No parent-and I am 100 ;-r cent certain about this-would dare put their children in any place where they did not think their children were going to be safe. If they want the choice of leaving their child with a friendly neighbour or a friendly auntie or uncle, or a relative, so be it, let them have that choice without those opposite putting them down and saying they are being irresponsible. For too long in life have we heard that child-care centres are the only place that provide ideal care for children. The ideal place for any child is in the home, whether it is the parents', the neighbours' or so forth. That environment is one of the best. Being a mother of eight I canMr Leo MCLeay interjecting",23
13,Mrs ELSON,CHILD CARE PAYMENTS,"It is quite stupid to say something like that. Having eight children, I found the best care I could give my children was with someone I trusted. That does not mean to say it was in a child-care centre. I can say that I have worked and reared eight children without ever having to resort to the need of a child-care centre, because I found very reliable relatives or friends that I felt I could trust. It is a question of choice and not defaming everybody that wants to mind a child in Australia as not being responsible. I take great exception to the claim that parents are not responsible for their children. Mr Bruce Scott-More smear and innuendo. Mr Leo MCLeay-I raise a point of order, Mr Deputy Speaker. I do not mind the member speaking trying to smear me but, when the minister at the table says, 'More smear and innuendo,' I find that offensive. If the honourable member found anything I said in my speech offensive, that is nothing to what I find she is saying. I want this person over here who called a member on this side a 'grub' yesterday to withdraw his allegation.",24
14,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CHILD CARE PAYMENTS,"Mr Jenkins)Order! The honourable member will resume his seat. I did not hear the interjection. The honourable member has indicated that he is offended by the remarks. I am not sure what the minister actually said, but on the basis that the member has indicated that he has some concerns, in assisting the chamber to get on with its business, I would ask that the minister withdraw. Mr Bruce Scott-I'll withdraw, Mr Deputy Speaker.",24
15,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,CHILD CARE PAYMENTS,I thank the minister.,24
16,Mrs ELSON,CHILD CARE PAYMENTS,"Child care is a very important issue for many Forde residents and a matter in which I take a great deal of care and interest. The member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), in this House on Monday, said that she deplored the government's lack of consultation with the child-care industry. I found this quite strange because I know we have a very hard working minister here, in the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan), who has consulted a lot with electorates all over Australia, and I was pleased to have the Minister for Family Services visit my electorate last month to speak directly with the child-care providers and their families. Such is the approach of our government and our ministers that they are keen to meet directly with local residents in order to keep in touch with Australians, their wants and their needs. This is in sharp contrast to the approach taken by the previous government. It is a refreshing change that the people in Forde have welcomed and appreciated. It is true to say that there have been a number of changes in the child-care industry since we came into government, and it is also true to say that these changes were necessary because the Labor government left the sector in a complete mess. The cost of child care to the public purse had absolutely skyrocketed and child-care centres were a growth industry with centres springing up overnight with very little planning and restrictions. I did hear the member for Jagajaga also say that when they came into government there was a 500 per cent increase in Commonwealth funding of child-care places. If this were true, then all I can say to the member for Jagajaga is that her party did not have a plan nor a consideration for families really needing child care. In my electorate we have child-care centres closing up at the moment. They were allowed to grow all over the place and most of them were only half full, and there are not enough children in my electorate to fill these places. I feel very sorry for these small businesses, but it was through lack of planning from the Labor Party that they are in that position at the moment. There is also an increasing public concern about the uncontrolled growth in the industry and the quality of care offered, and whether the care is really being targeted to those families who really need it. Since coming to office we have worked to address those concerns in a fair and equitable way. As the minister said in a recent speech to the National Conference· of Supplementary Children's Service Workers: The overarching vision of our child care reform is to provide equitable, affordable, flexible and high quality child care, and to ensure that the growth in the child care sector is sustainable. Children are Australia's future-ensuring the best possible care for .children is a national priority. Not surprisingly, though, Labor's contribution to the. debate has been yet another scare campaign. There has been so much misinformation and so many downright lies spread about our child-care initiatives, causing concern for many families. Contrary to what Labor has claimed, we are not slashing, we are not denying families who genuinely need care and we do not have a philosophical bent against child care. Child care is here to stay, and there is no doubt about that. We, as a government, believe that families should have access to a full range of options when it comes to making decisions about the care of their children. That means not only the various choices for professional care but also being able to make the choices for one parent to care for their children full time if that is their preference. Our family tax package, introduced on 1 January this year, makes that option financially feasible. Our approach is about genuine choice. It appears that is something that the Labor Party just cannot comprehend. For years they pushed their own social and political agenda on the Australian people-and let me remind them that that was comprehensively rejected in the March election last year. The amendments to the Child Care Payments Bill that we are discussing help create greater flexibility with regard to families of children with disabilities. These families will be exempt from the 20-hour per child per week child-care assistance for non-working related care. As someone who has worked closely with disabled people and their families for 15 years before entering parliament, I have some understanding of the demands they face. As I said in my maiden speech, I have a great deal of admiration for any parent and family who cares for disabled children. It is a tough job and the pressures are many and varied. It is absolutely crucial that all governments provide as many support services as possible, and these services were terribly neglected. Naturally, access to child care for both the disabled child and any siblings is extremely important. This amendment recognises this special need and is indicative of the government's approach. In general terms, I believe the 20-hour limit for non-work related care is extremely fair. I believe it reflects community sentiment that child care should, at least in some sense, be targeted to those who need it the most. There seems to have been an attempt in recent times to tell parents that institutionalised care is best for their child and that their child should be in care, regardless of their capacity to care for them full time. I believe it is entirely appropriate that we put a limit on access to subsidised care for those children whose parents are not working, except in special circumstances. It sends a message that care by a parent in the home is not second to institutional care, and that it should be encouraged for those who are able to do so. I believe that 20 hours is a fair limit. We should all remember, especially as those opposite bleat about cutbacks, that the Labor government actually planned a 12-hour limit. Yes, that is right, a 12-hour limit with no similar exceptions for families with children with disabilities. On this issue, as on many others, Labor has a huge credibility problem when they criticise the important and fair measures we have taken as a government. They created the problems, and all they can do is criticise the solutions. There is no contribution except criticism-that is all we hear. That should be the Labor Party's motto. The other important amendment in this bill effectively allows a 28-day grace period for retrospective claims for child-care assistance or the child-care rebate in respect of children who have not been immunised. This time will allow parents to either commence a catch-up program, provide evidence of medical contraindication or declare a conscientious objection-once again, a fair measure to provide greater flexibility and ensure that families are not disadvantaged. The decision to tie child-care assistance to immunisation is one that I believe has been warmly welcomed in the community. because the community recognises what the previous government did not: that our current immunisation levels are just not good enough. I congratulate the Minister for Health and Family Services (Dr Wooldridge) for his absolute commitment to raising immunisation levels in order to protect our children. He has a dogged determination to tackle a problem that for too long has been left in the too-hard basket, and he has the support of both sides of this House in doing so. I am pleased to support him in that by promoting immunisation with Forde families through a special newsletter which contains an immunisation schedule and record. It is my way, as a local MP, of helping local families and making them aware of the importance of immunisation. My second youngest daughter was unfortunate to contract whooping cough as a very small baby before she was able to be immunised against it. It was absolutely heart breaking for the whole family to watch her suffering and struggling for breath. She was lucky enough to make a full recovery. In the past year alone many Australian babies have not been so lucky. The importance of ensuring that children in formal child care have been immunised cannot be overstated, not only for the child's sake but especially for the younger siblings who may not even be old enough to be immunised. I am proud to be part of a government that places such emphasis on the welfare of our children and the needs of Australian families. Amendments such as these reflect our practical and fair approach to ensuring a better, more flexible and safer child-care system for all families.",24
17,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,CHILD CARE PAYMENTS,"I rise to support the second reading amendment moved by my colleague the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) to the Child Care Payments Bill. In doing so, I say to the previous speaker, the member for Forde (Mrs Elson), that the endeavours of the Labor Party over the 13 years to March last year were clearly to create a question of choice in the ability of families to access child care. The problem with this legislation is tijat it is about rolling back the question of choice. I refer not just to the growth in places over that 13 years but, more importantly, to the creation of options and genuine choice in the availability of a range of children's services. Initially, obviously, support from the Labor Party went to the community based sector. But, clearly, in the 1990s not only did we build on our success in the community based sector and in supporting family day care but we extended fee relief to the private sector. The difference between the Labor Party and the current government is that, in creating those options, that choice for families, we also sought to focus on the all-important issue of quality. It is for that very reason that, in extending fee relief to the private sector, we sought to develop a system of accreditation. That accreditation was clearly about ensuring that, in return for fee relief to the private sector, private sector operators who sought to avail themselves of assistance fronted up to the need for quality services. On that basis, I very much support the condemnation of the Howard government expressed in the second reading amendment moved by the member for Jagajaga. I do so because I believe that the intent of this bill and of the decisions of the Howard government through their budget processes is to cut child care by a massive $820 million in their first two budgets. In essence, this will lead to less affordable, lower quality child care and the closure of services. This will include services in my electorate of Batman in the northern suburbs of Melbourne and, unfortunately, services in many communities which have a non-English speaking background. There are more than 30 child-care centres around Australia with specific services targeted at ethnic communities. In my part of Melbourne there are Lebanese, Indo-Chinese, Italian, Greek and Turkish centres which will be badly hurt by these cuts. My colleagues in this debate have therefore sought to highlight the various negative features of these bills and the basis for the concerns outlined in the opposition's second reading amendment. These concerns include, firstly, the way they limit the level of assistance and the number of child-care places; secondly, the way they increase fees; and, a needs basis. thirdly, the way the changes are being pushed through without proper consultation, provision of information or scope for child-care centres to adjust to these changes. As the shadow minister for employment training, I particularly want to highlight the fact that, amongst other things, child care ari employment issue. If you want to talk about opportunity and choice, if you want talk about the ability of families to participate in the labour market, then you have also got to face up to the fact that those things are intimately related to the available choices with respect to access to child care. I therework force. fore want to highlight the fact that these bills go against the needs of employees who have children, against the needs of families and against the need to provide genuine choice for all-whether male or female-to participate in the labour market on an equal footing. These bills, I suggest, will force some people to stop working. They will impose limits on work related child care and push many working parents to take their children out of quality care by abolishing the operational subsidy for outside school hours care. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you and I know, child care is an employment issue, for several reasons. The availability of child care cruciala ly affects the ability of women to participate in the work force. It was estimated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in a recent survey that more than 300,000 people, nearly all of them women, do not participate in work force because of a lack of adequate child care. I suggest to the House today that this is a startlingly high number-300,000 people, the clear majority of whom are women. There is also clear-cut evidence that the cuts by the Howard government, with which these bills are associated, are driving this Ian community. number up. The Labor Party, as an integral part of its employment platform and policy, is going to give special attention to particular issues affecting the capacity of women to participate in the work force, just as it did in government. This includes en ing the availability of affordable child care on The Australian child care survey, conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in February, came up with some other startling findings-and these might be news to the and Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) responsible for this bill. For instance, fewer is than seven per cent of Australia's families receive help from the employer with childto care arrangements. We often hear speeches in this House about the need to ensure that flexibility exists in the workplace. I suggest to you that access to child care is intimately related to productivity and flexibility in the The report also noted that less than four per cent of families are actually offered work based child-care facilities. That is despite the fact that in the last decade there has been an incredible growth in women's participation in the work force. Clearly, the previous government did its job to try to ensure that assistance was available, for example, through will growth in community based child care, growth in family day care and by the extension of fee relief to the private sector on the basis of the need to provide quality child care. I point the finger today not just at the government but also at Australian employers. If you want morale amongst your work force, happy work force, a work force that is prepared to front up to its responsibilities aimed at changing work practices and improving productivity, then you also have to accept your responsibility to ensure that adequate the child care is offered on a work basis. The Australian Institute of Family Studies has also pointed out that there is far too little provision by companies of flexible work practices which employees with dependent children actually need. So it is not just the view of the Labor opposition; it is also the view of other reputable groups in the AustralAlmost no mothers with dependent children are entitled to a nine-day fortnight to relieve the the burden of cramming things into the weekend. Far fewer are entitled to a rostered day off than other colleagues, according to the surInstitute of Family Studies. Also, more mothers than other women in the work force have work hours varying from week to week, resulting in a lack of security and stability in working parents' lives. This, I suggest, makes child-care arrangements very difficult. Sara Charlesworth from Latrobe University pointed out that: Making it to the child care centre by 6.00 pm is a cause of enormous stress for many parents of pre school children. She went on to say: ... as is finding family or friends to help out at short or no notice. She also suggests: It is also difficult for workers who work changing shifts or have to suddenly work additional hours to organise child care. It is for those reasons that we have moved the second reading amendment today. The Howard government's Workplace Relations Act was paraded as enabling employers and employees to reach more flexible arrangements to their mutual benefit. The evidence to date suggests that it has had an alternative impact on the needs of working parents and employers. The reality is that it is handing employers more power to impose conditions on workers, which goes against the kind of flexibility which they actually need. The end result of the change to the Workplace Relations Act has been more power and pressure from the employers but no proper consideration of the needs of workers and their families. The end result of that is more stress on Australian families. The Howard government's industrial relations policies are also making it even less likely that in the future employers will meet their social responsibility to provide child care, family friendly working arrangements and other things such as training. Those issues have virtually disappeared from the agenda; it is now about cutting wages, taking security out of people's lives and putting pressure on families. That is the Howard government's industrial relations agenda, which the cuts and changes to child care that we are debating today have added to. Alternatively, the former Labor government was working with employers and unions, workers and their families to promote child care as a central part of work and family initiatives and workplace reform. They 'are integral. You could not have workplace reform, you could not have changes in work practices, you could not have flexibility in working hours unless you also debated in those enterprise arrangements the question of access to child care. Therefore, we were promoting the development of services to meet the real needs of families to enable them to balance the responsibilities of home and work. You cannot detach home from work if you want to ensure that there is productivity growth and attachment by workers to their employers. I suggest to the House today that the Howard government is reversing this progress. I also suggest that only the Labor Party is committed to restoring a real role for the Industrial Relations Commission. This is essential to ensure that more employers make child-care facilities and family friendly hours of work available to workers and to those who want to be workers, who want to participate in the work force. It is interesting to note that with respect to work force participation in the last 12 months it actually decreased by one per cent. I suppose from the government's point of view they applaud that because, whilst unemployment now standards at 8.7 per cent and we have lost 60,000 full-time jobs in the last 12 months, if it had not been for the fall' in the participation rate then unemployment today would be over 10 per cent. From the government's point of view, the fact that people are giving up the desire to work because they feel there is a sense of hopelessness in the jobs market in some way is making it look as though they are making more progress than they are, even though they are going backwards at the moment on the jobs front. I suggest to the House that access to child care is intimately related to that fall in the participation rate. Child care is an employment issue, and it is about time that the Howard government faced up to that fact. Caring for children impacts greatly on the work of most Australians. It impacts on families, it impacts on communities and it impacts on employers. A,survey of 30,000 employees, carried out by the Work and Child Care Advisory Service, has found that nearly 70 per cent of parents arrived late or left work early, more than half took time off when their child was sick, and nearly half experienced stress and anxiety. On average, 2.9 full days were lost and another 2.9 days significantly interrupted because. of difficulties with the care of drenunder school age-telling facts that this government has to face up to. That is all the more reason why employers should do more to help workers with children. It is about ensuring that they produce the goods at a workplace level and that they are able to compete both domestically and internationally. To achieve that you also have to face up to the needs of your workers and their families. That is all the more reason why the availability of work related child care should be expanded, not limited as these bills will do. Another sense in which child care is an employment issue is that many workers are directly employed by child-care centres. They, like so many other Australians, are losing their jobs under the Howard government's cut and slash policies. That is important. In my own electorate, for example, at the moment over 300 people are employed in the community based child-care centres. It is also interesting to note that in the last decade employment in the child-care industry has grown elevenfold. It has been one of the areas of growth in employment in Australia. These changes will impact not only on the needs of workers in general but also on a growth sector for employment and jobs in Australia. Those workers, like so many other Australians, are losing their jobs under the Howard government's cut and slash policies. Many jobs are being lost in local child-care centres, such as those in my electorate in the city of Darebin. The overwhelming majority of child-care centre use in the city is work related. The effect on the local economy and community from the loss of child-care workers' jobs, when the economy and community are already suffering from the closure of government offices, is multiplied many times over. Austudy offices, CES offices, Department of Social Security offices, Tax offices, Family Law Court offices and now child-care centres are suffering, with a consequent loss of jobs as a result of cuts in .government services by the Howard government. More importantly, those cuts impact on local economies. They impact in the city of chilDarebin in my electorate, where there is unacceptably high unemployment. It might not be an issue for this government, but it is an issue for local .families, and it is an issue for the quality and decency of the Australian way of life. As I have said, there is now a real threat to the future working lives of many of the women in child-care centres around Australia because it is an industry predominantly dominated by women in respect of jobs and employment opportunities. We are working closely with the centres in the Darebin area in my electorate, for example, to creatively face this crisis in an attempt to protect those jobs. More importantly, the Darebin area centres serve more than 4,000 local families-a quite significant number-most of whom will find their ability to take part in the excellent local Darebin services limited if they are further cut back. Parents will not feel comfortable going off to work if they feel that the local children's services are not up to scratch. That goes to the issue of accreditation and quality that was pursued by the previous government. Initially, it was opposed by the current government, but it eventually embraced it in the lead-up to the last election. In the north-eastern region of Melbourne, we already have unemployment running at 9.2 per cent. That is way above the average for Victoria and way above the national average of 8.7 per cent. For more people to drop out of the work force due to needless and short sighted cuts to child care will only deplete our economy and community. It will needlessly deprive it of skills and will deprive the women employed in the centres and those who rely on their service from developing and expressing their talents. Child care is about workers' ability to participate in the workplace. It is also about employment. That is why I specifically refer to' my electorate. In the Darebin area, my local government area, there are 32 child-care related centres. Eighteen are private long day care, three are council child-care centres, seven are preschool council centres, and 15 are community preschool centres. Those centres are not an insignificant employer, directly employing 300 staff, with an estimated turnover, on an annual basis, of $17 million. That is quite a sizeable section of Australian community; a growth area of employment; a growth area for necessary jobs. I commend the second reading amendment to the House. It is about time that the Howard government faced up to the fact that its slash and bum policies are impacting on local communities; they are impacting on jobs; and they are impacting on the ability of workers to participate in the community and in the workplace on an equal footing. The Howard government's bill is to be condemned for what it is: a short-sighted approach aimed at cutting services without any consideration for the needs of Australia at large or of the question of decency and our commitment to creating opportunities for all to participate in the workplace, irrespective whether they are male or female, irrespective of whether or not they are a family member. The member for Jagajaga's second reading amendment is correct. This government stands condemned for cutting decent services and undermining the capacity of women to participate in the workplace on an equal footing. I commend the second reading amendment to the House.",26
18,Mr LINDSAY,CHILD CARE PAYMENTS,"The Child Care Payments Bill 1997 marks a considerable change in the provision of childcare services in Australia. In a speech last week, the Minister for Family Services (Mrs Moylan) said that she was committed to ehsuring greater flexibility, better planning, quicker and more relevant information and improved access to services. This bill goes a long way to delivering on that commitment. Growth in and the availability of child-care places is important. It is important to Australia as a whole and to individual parents and families. There will be continued strong growth in the number of child-care places in Australia, amounting to about 83,000 new places over four years: about 44,000 new private centre places and 39,000 new community based places. This growth needs to be controlled and planned. Control and planning are important elements, yet they have been missing in relation to the child-care industry in the past. the Planning under the previous government saw an oversupply of child-care facilities develop in some areas, while other areas virtually went without. In addressing the National Conference of the Australian Early Childhood Association, the minister identified the provision of care for parents who are working, studying, training or looking for work as a priority of this government. Clearly these are the areas which need attention. The open slather approach of the former Labor government did not always target the provision of services towards these areas. The lack of forward planning for the provision of child-care services has created problems for the community and the industry, which is why many operators in Townsville and throughout Australia have welcomed the of restriction to the provision of only an extra 7,000 national private long day care places in 1998 and 1999. High need areas will be targeted based on extensive advice and consideration from planning committees. That is in stark contrast to the hit-and-miss approach which was adopted in the past. That is why the introduction of the 20-hour limit a week for non-work related child care has also been broadly welcomed by the industry and the community. The decision is entirely consistent with the government's targeted approach to child-care assistance. The 20-hour limit is fair, it is equitable and it ensures that assistance is targeted towards those who need it the most: parents who are working, studying, training or seeking work. Exemptions will apply for families in crisis, for children at risk of abuse or neglect and for some situations where one or both parents are disabled. The 20-hour non-work related limit is an important reform because it is also a step away from the unplanned open slather approach to child-care assistance that has developed over the last decade. At the same time, it recognises that parents who choose to stay at home and care for their children do need some time to themselves. I am sure I am not the only member who has heard of instances where non-working parents put their child or children into day care hour upon hour, day in, day out, while the parent goes out by himself or herself. Non-work related care accounts for 21 per cent of child-care assistance outlays in the 1996-97 budget, and it was forecast to increase by some 23 per cent by the. year 2000 and 2001 without any changes. Child care should be there for those working or studying parents who need it most, not for those who simply find it a convenient break from their kids. This is not what child care is for, and the minister should be congratulated for both recognising and doing something to change this. It is a long overdue reform. The tying of child-care payments to immunisation records is also a significant and vital step forward, and the· minister should be congratulated for her contribution in this regard. In terms of promoting and advancing public health policies in Australia, the Howard government's approach to our appalling levels of childhood immunisation has been proactive, innovative and long overdue. The coalition government has embarked on a concerted effort to change this, and part of that effort is to tie child-care payments to appropriate immunisation of our children. Despite the fact that the vast majority of parents support immunisation and vaccination programs, many parents fail to make sure their kids complete a full program. There are different reasons for this. One certain but regrettable factor is that many parents simply forget. While I do not condone this, I do understand it. Parents have to deal with an enormous number of different things on a daily basis. If a child is healthy, often concerns about the potential to contract a communicable disease such as whooping cough, measles or rubella are far from the parents' thoughts. This is where we as a community and as a government need to be vigilant and continuously push the message that it is very important to fully complete a child's immunisation program. I am confident that tying immunisation to child-care payments will be a successful tool in stimulating parental vigilance in relation to childhood immunisation. Last month I reported to the House that the early indications were that the immunisation awareness campaign was having a very positive impact in Townsville and Thuringowa. I am delighted now to report to the House that Townsville topped the state, recording the highest number of vaccinations administered as part of the first of the national immunisation days. There has also been an increase in the number of children presenting at the weekly immunisation clinics in both Townsville and Thuringowa. This is a tremendous result, and I am proud to acknowledge and commend the commitment and the hard work many health care workers throughout Townsville and Thuringowa· have put into achieve this initial outcome. I am also pleased to see the commitment the minister and the government have applied to the provision of outside school hours care. Reforms which improve equity and affordability for low and middle income families using outside school hours care services, with an estimated 70,000 families to benefit from improved child-care assistance, are. certainly welcome. Higher rates of childcare assistance will be provided for families the using outside school hours care services, and eligibility will be extended to the same income cut-off as family day care centres. Outside school hours care plays an important role in the provision of child-care services in Townsville and Thuringowa. There was a lot of concern expressed by the operators and parents prior to the last budget, but these reforms have generally been welcomed and accepted. Progress towards a simpler system of child-care assistance and child-care rebate payments is important and represents another difference between the coalition and the former government. Having talked widely with constituents in Townsville and Thuringowa, I found a high level of public confusion about the current child-care payments system, which the former government has presided over. A lot of people do not know the difference between child-care assistance and the child-care rebate. Some do not even know the child-care rebate exists. A simpler system of child-care payments needs to be adopted, and I am pleased to see the minister and the government moving towards this in making child-care assistance and the rebate payable through the one Commonwealth service delivery agency. There has been much said lately about the cost of child care in Australia, that it is pricing families out of accessing appropriate care. I would like to bring to the attention of this parliament a different perspective in this debate and relate a letter to the editor which appeared in the Townsville Bulletin earlier this week. The letter states: Much media attention has been given to the cost of regulated child care services (for example, day care centres) since the government has restructured (some say reduced) the assistance available for families. For between $150 and $170 you can send your child to a quality-accredited centre. For an average of 50 hours ... this calculates (at the higher end of the scale) to $3.40 per hour. The writer asks: So what do you get for your money? 1. Professional, trained staff, in numbers that allow effective supervision and interaction. 2. Quality accredited facilities. 3. Encouragement for input into daily activities as well as the general running of the centre. 4. A daily program that specifically targets your child's development and education. 5. Large range of indoor aild outdoor facilities that are safe as well as stimulating. This professionalism contrasts greatly from the backyard operation that offers you the $5 per hour bargain. The writer continues: Society still holds the view that day care facilities are just for nurturing when the mother (predominantly) is not available. But early childhood facilities are much more. They offer a planned approach to children's development and education, on an individual basis, conducted by professional trained staff, using the most current information and facilities. With this in mind, society in general needs to look c10selyat our reluctance to pay appropriate child care costs. The writer concludes by saying: Child care costs are not too high ... in fact they are undervalued. How can anybody argue that paying less than $4 an hour for cultivating the next generation is too expensive? This is a very good point. Amongst some of the headlines I have seen over recent weeks there has been one saying that, in some instances, early child care can cost as much as, if not more than, primary school fees. The articles accompanying the headlines have contained the quotes of outraged parents and the equally outraged member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin). I have not heard one member of the opposition argue in this debate that accredited childcare centres are anything less than the quality education and development centres that we expect them to be. Could it possibly be that members opposite still hold the view that day care facilities are just for nurturing when mum or dad is not available? As the writer of the letter to the Townsville Bulletin points out, why is there a reluctance to pay for the quality services our children receive in their early years when we willingly pay the same, if not more, for quality and service when our kids enter primary school? It is a very valid point. Are our children any more or any less valuable? Are our children any more or any less deserving? Does age make a difference to the price we pay for our children? If it does, then why? Why do we complain about paying similar levels for child care as we do for primary school age children's school fees when, quite often, there is only a oneor two-year age difference and the level and amount of attention or care that is required is the same? The letter mentions backyard child care and points to price comparisons. There is not a lot of difference. How many members who are parents here would expect to be able to get a baby-sitter for less than $5 or $6 an hour? I want the opposition to think about these questions and relate the answers back to the whole child-care debate. The member for Griffith (Mr MCDougall) mentioned in his speech a parent who complained to the Courier-Mail that the 20-hour week, non-work related limit on child care would cut into her recreational or leisure time. As a patent myself I really wonder about that. I wonder how that parent views her child-care centre and staff. Does that parent view the staff as glorified baby-sitters, or does that parent recognise that they are professionals working to help develop our children's social and intellectual skills? As I said at the beginning, the government is committed to ensuring greater flexibility, better planning, quicker and more relevant information and improved access to child-care services. Importantly, we need to provide appropriate care for those parents who need it the most-for working parents, for parents point. who are studying or training, or who are looking for work. This bill, in my view, represents a significant step in the right direction in terms of reforming the provision of child-care services in Australia, and welcome the bill's introduction.",30
19,Mr WILTON,CHILD CARE PAYMENTS,"As the father of two very young children, my wife and I know how hard it is to balance our work and family commitments. Like thousands of other parents, particularly in places like Cranbourne, I understand the need for maintenance of a proper child-care system. Unfortunately, this is not an understanding shared by those on the opposite site side the House. Under the guise of more efficientalso, ly allocating financial resources, this governtheir ment is engaged in what can best be described as a deceitful attempt to gut child-care payassigning ments. Over the last two budgets, the razor gang has shaved over $800 million from child care, a cut of so much money out of the child-care budget it could lead to fee increases of up to child care. $40 per week. To a very much out-of-touch government in Canberra perhaps this does seem like much money but, believe me, to many of the families that will be harshly affected this is a significant rise in the cost bringing up their children. It is an unnecesin sary cost and one the parents of Australia, particularly the parents of Cranbourne, could well do without. The flaws and dangers of this piece of legislation are, indeed, gaping, and many of them will have a profound impact on the people of Isaacs, the people I represent. There are a number of aspects of the Child Care Payments Bill 1997 which I find particularly worrying. The bill limits to some 20 hours the amount of child-care assistance per child that parents can receive each week if they are not working, studying or training. If they are involved in any of those activities then they are limited to 50 hours a week of child-care payments. After the 20or 50-hour limit has been exceeded, depending on parents' circumstances, they have got to pay their own way. The government washes its hands after that If this government is serious about fair and compassionate child-care provision in Australia, it must not cap the number of hours for which parents can gain assistance each week. I As all .parents know, you cannot cap the amount of time and care a child needs. Why is this government so insensitive as to think that, . after a certain number of hours each week, parents no longer need support in the care that they administer to their children? The effect of this most drastic measure is the indeed clear. Many women will be forced out of the work force or into part-time employment against their will. Such outcomes fly in the face of the interests not only of the people of of Cranbourne and the women concerned but just as importantly, of family units and children. Some families may be forced into the equally unpalatable situation of their children to inferior, perhaps best described as backyard, child care. One study reveals that 67 per cent of parents who are taking their children out of formal child care are putting their children into informal If those opposite were fair dinkum about not child-care payments, they would not impose such punitive controls just so that they can save a quick buck. New private sector places of in long day care have been limited to 7,000 1998-99. That means that only a further and 7,000 child-care places will receive federal government assistance in each of the next two years. No matter what the demand for child care in the community, no matter how much of it is needed by Australian families, the government is limiting the amount of support it provides to a meagre 7,000 new places. The government intends to save an estimated $212 million in its next four years from this measure. But just remember that, to this government, the dollar sign is all. This cost cutting has nothing whatsoever to do with the efficient allocation of resources. Rather, it is all about taking money out of the social wage upon which so many Australians heavily rely. Given the way that demand for child care has exploded over the last 20 years, it is incomprehensible that this government should be so pusillanimous and so miserly. It is clear that it is motivated by its bizarre, philosophical fixation with cutting back the role of state in society, regardless of the cost to the community. I submit to the House-as I have beforethat, while many on the government benches wax lyrical about their commitment to the individual, a great many individuals will be hurt by these changes. Of course, the government does understand this; it just does not care. This is yet another example of the ideological bankruptcy that, in our view, pervades the ruling parties. The bill also produces provisions for the minister to allocate these 7,000 private sector child-care places to particular regions. Yet the criteria on which these judgments will be based has not even been specified. Given the way child-care services have been butchered to date by government, it is with a sense of great foreboding that I await this announcement. After all, if the criteria stand up to scrutiny, then why doesn't the government come clean and tell us what it is now? How will the minister ensure that no parents in Isaacs will be worse off after these changes? I cannot believe that the cloak and dagger policy being pursued by the coalition is going to ensure that the people of Isaacs get the best possible child care-the sort of child care they deserve. The virtual discretion that the minister has in allocating new funding is indicative of the wider lack of information about guidelines and regulations that we are not aware of. If this parliament is to go down the path of making further changes to the provision of child care, then at least the industry and parents should be provided with some certainty as to exactly how this piece of legislation is going to work in practice. Many families in Isaacs are still reeling from the last round of cuts that the Howard government administered to child care. In the suburb of Mordialloc, in the heart of Isaacs, the Ashmore Avenue Child Care Centreabout which I have spoken before in this place-will be shutting its doors this month because of government cutbacks, because of a $23,000 cut to its operational subsidy. With these new changes the people of the bayside area of Isaacs will be further disadvantaged in the child-care services available to them. Needless to say, this issue has caused much angst in many local communities across Australia, none more than in my electorate of Isaacs. Parents are concerned that there are even further and nastier cuts to come. Perhaps the most unsettling aspect of the Ashmore Avenue Child Care Centre closure is that this is likely to be very much only the thin end of this wedge. If parliament does see fit to pass this legislation, then we will bear witness to the unedifying spectacle of even more closures of centres in even more areas. This is something that the families of Isaacs-let alone any other electorate in the country--can afford. Recently the City of Frankston was forced to increase the fees of council-run child-care centres by six per cent in response to the federal government's spending cuts. Councillor Mark Conroy said about the action, 'It's a bitter pill to swallow, there is no other course of action ... it's a brutal cut by the government.' That flies in the face of comments made in this place this morning by the member for Dunkley (Mr Billson) when he said that his constituents understand the need for these child-care cuts. To add to this, a study released recently by the National Association of Community Based Children's Services has found that more than 4,000 families have withdrawn their children from long day care or have reduced their patronage in the past three months, forcing many women to withdraw from the work force or cut back on fullor part-time work. The sad thing is that, with the changes in this bill, these sorts of problems are only going to prevail and are only going to get much worse. The last time that I addressed this chamber on child care I referred to a visit by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to Cranbourne, a suburb of Melbourne and the location of my electorate office, during the last federal election campaign in order to launch the coalition's policy on child care. It is more than a little ironic that halfway into its term of government the coalition has forgotten child care and forgotten places like Cranbourne. Cranbourne lies in the city of Casey, a municipality with more residents aged between nought and four than any municipality in the country. The only council sponsored child-care centre has been put at risk because, as with the Ashmore Avenue Child Care Centre, the government proposes to cut its funding. The families of Cranbourne needed certainty from this legislation-certainty that the child-care provision would not be threatened any further. Instead, services have been placed in even greater jeopardy. I can assure the government that the people of Isaacs are feeling neither relaxed nor comfortable with this government's assaults on the child-care system. Given the aforementioned cuts, this legislation further condemns families to insufficient child care. My .office has already received complaints about what a disastrous impact this piece of legislation will have. Another source of genuine concern for my constituents is that the lodging of claims must be made within 13 weeks of the child-care sessions that have been completed. Given that some families are struggling to keep pace with living expenses from one day to the next, it concerns me that this limit has been imposed. A longer duration of time for retrospective claims should have been allowed. The Casey council, to which I have just referred, covers a large section of my electorate of Isaacs and has the largest family day care centre scheme in Australia. Casey council represents people who are about as 'middle Australia' as you can get. These people are hurting. The local mayor, Wayne Smith, has estimated that recent changes to child care by the federal government may have made the local scheme $30 a week per child worse off. In a young and rapidly growing area like Casey, these cuts simply cannot be afforded and will not be tolerated by constituents. Arrogant in the extreme in the way that it has kept consultation with the child-care industry to a bare minimum is this government. An unnecessarily high-handed approach has been taken with this bill as it has with many other bills. In Cranbourne, Frankston and the bayside suburbs of Melbourne, the further restrictions now being placed on child care will add to the already substantial hardships of bringing up a family. It becomes very clear from reviewing these changes that taking so much money out of child care will result not only in a more expensive service for parents but also in a generally lower quality of service provision. We are heading towards a situation where, because many parents will no longer be able to afford child care, there could be a fall in the demand for places. If this happens, the likely outcome is that there will be job losses in this industry. This in tum would lead to a lower standard of care provided. An issue like child care is much more complex than just dollars and cents. This point is something that the Howard government fails to appreciate, and the costs will be felt not just now but on a continuing basis in the years to come. The environment in which we bring up our children has a major impact on the adults that they become and the society which is formed around them. At the end of the day, it comes down to the fact that no matter how much you try to play with these figures, no matter how much you fiddle with them, no matter how much you try to justify these changes, you cannot get away from the fact that, when you rip millions of dollars out of the system, you are going to hurt the battlers, the people Mr Howard claimed for a fleeting moment as his own. If the debate has revealed anything, it is that the coalition government, as I say, does not care about the battlers. On an issue of such fundamental importance to families as child-care funding, the government has, again, failed miserably to deliver. In the previous 13 years before the election of the Howard government, the previous Labor administration had taken great pride in its record of building up a child-care system which, by and large, was the envy of the rest of the world. It is galling for those of us on this side of the House to see the attack which is now taking place on such an important component of the rights of families, women and children as child care is. Child care is a crucially important component of the day-today lives of these people, the people whom I represent. In the space of just two short years, the new government has gone a fair way in dismantling the achievements of what was a first class child-care system. I urge the House to put a stop to the destruction of affordable child care in Australia. In concluding, I certainly commend the amendment proposed by the shadow minister to the parliament. Debate (on motion by Mrs Bishop) adjourned. NA NA Motion (by Mrs Bishop) agreed to: That the following bills be referred to the Main Committee for further consideration: Child Care Payments Bill 1997 Child Care Payments (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 1997 NA Second Reading Debate resumed from 25 September,· on motion by Mr Williams: That the bill be now read a second time. upon which Mr Gareth Evans moved by way of amendment: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House notes that: (1) native title rights, including on pastoral leases, are fundamental legal property rights, acknowledged and upheld as such by the High Court, and entitled to the same respect and protection as the property rights of non-Indigenous Australians: any amendment of the Native Title Act in response to the Wik decision or for any other reason must fully reflect that reality; (2) it is in the national interest that the Act balance and reconcile to the maximum possible extent the interests and reasonable expectations of both Indigenous Australians and other major stakeholders-farmers, miners and Australian taxpayers generally; (3) it is both in the national interest, and in the interests of Indigenous Australians, farmers and miners, that there be the maximum possible predictability and certainty about the status of the Act and its practical operation; (4) there is a need, in particular, to guarantee the constitutional validity of the legislation, by ensuring that legislation operates for the net benefit of Indigenous Australians; (5) it is also in everyone's interest that the processes established by this legislation to deal with the registration and determination of claims, and the reconciliation of competing interests, be as effective and expeditious as possible; (6) there are aspects of the Bill which may advance these objectives, in particular by encouraging and assisting the entering into of agreements, and by setting a stricter regime for the registration of claims; (7) nonetheless, the Bill is seriously deficient, and requires substantial amendment, in many respects, including: (i) the reach of the validation provisions beyond that which is necessary for the practical redress of postWik problems; 1997 (ii) the f!1anifestly unacceptable over-reach of the provisions purporting to confirm the extinguishment of native title where exclusive tenure has previously been involved; (iii) the unnecessarily broad application, in relation to coexistence on pastoral leases, of the statutory authorisation of non-pastoral activities; (iv) the unnecessarily broad application of extinguishment in relation to the provision of government services and public works; (v) the indefensibly limited test for allowing statutory access rights for registered claim7 ants; (vi) the dramatic limitation of the right to negotiate, and in particular its effective tion in relation to mining on pastoral leases, which (along with the provisions amounting to direct or de facto extinguishment) significantly tilts the balance of the legislation against Indigenous Australians; (vii) the unacceptable limitation on the effective enjoyment of the right to negotiate which is involved in powers of early ministerial intervention; (viii) the absurd and counterproductive sunset clause, which will simply ensure a proliferation of ambit claims under the Act, and the pursuit of future claims through expensive and complex common law processes; (ix) the inappropriately rigid and legalistic constraints on Registrars in the management of claims; and (x) the inappropriate introduction of formal rules of evidence, and limitations on the extent to which cultural and customary concerns can be taken into account, in the Federal Court claims process"".",33
20,Mr TANNER,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"Melbourne) (11.23 a.m.)Our response as a nation to issues of native title, Aboriginal reconciliation and Aboriginal living standards is fundamental to our future as a nation. This government's response to these issues is wrong on all counts. The response which we are seeing today in this legislation and elsewhere is discriminatory and unfair; it is unworkable and will ultimately be very expensive for this nation, as the report of the Australian Law Reform Commission that this government attempted to suppress indicates; and it is severely damaging to our international standing, which is particularly fragile at the moment because of a number of matters associated with the One Nation party and the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). The Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has been prepared to take the low moral ground consistently on Aboriginal issues, exemplified no better than by his extraordinary hectoring speech at the Aboriginal reconciliation convention in Melbourne. He has persistently chased the redneck vote. He has persistently sought to play to a deep-seated hostility to Aboriginal people which exists in many parts of the Australian community. There is, sadly, an ugly thread of contempt elimina- and disdain for Aboriginal people in many parts of the Australian community and in parts of the Australian character. There is also a huge strand of guilt in the Australian community with respect to the treatment that Aboriginal people have suffered over the two centuries of European settlement. But this guilt is not just the guilt of those who are aware and conscious of the outrages that have been perpetrated on Aboriginal people and those who seek to do something about it, those who seek to rectify the wrong that has occurred; more importantly, this guilt is the guilt of the people with the same strand of character that regards Aboriginal people with contempt and disdain. Think about it for a minute. What are the usual characteristics of guilt? What are the normal features when one feels guilty about something? They are silence, they are denial, they are the projection of one's guilt onto the victim. So the real guilt that matters on Aboriginal issues in Australia is not the guilt of the so called chattering classes-much maligned by older, male, right wing newspaper commentators-it is the guilt of those people who do disdain Aboriginal people, who do regard them with contempt and who do vociferously oppose any attempt to provide Aboriginal people with some degree of justice in our society. As Tacitus said, 'It is human nature to hate the one whom we have hurt,' and as Milton said, 'They who have put out the people's eyes reproach them for their blindness.' It is true to say that contemporary Australians did not massacre Aboriginal people, did not poison waterholes and did not commit some of the more outrageous things that Aboriginal people have suffered throughout our history-although some things are still relatively contemporary. For example, the kidnapping of Aboriginal children because they were Aboriginal and the attempt to forcefully assimilate them into white culture certainly is something for which contemporary generations bear a heavy responsibility. It is true to say that most individuals in society do not have a direct complicity in the outrages that have been perpetrated on Aboriginal people. However, they, we, all of nonAboriginal Australia, continue to benefit from the fact that those outrages occurred. Therefore, we have a responsibility, in whatever way we can, to set right the things that have been done. Much of it cannot be corrected. Much of it is now irrevocable. But, to the extent that we as a nation can remedy the wrongs that have been done and can provide some degree of justice to Aboriginal people, we have an obligation to do so. There is also in the Australian character and in many parts of the Australian community a deep-seated fear associated with attitudes on Aboriginal issues. That fear has its origins in our own moral vulnerability-a fear ultimately that Asian people will do to us what we did to Aboriginal people. We, in some deep, subconscious way, fear that the dispossession that we wrought upon Aboriginal people may sometime happen to us. So you get the conjunction of these two issues leading to a dark strand of racism in the Australian community which has, as its recent evocation, as its recent manifestation, the One Nation party and the outrageous excrescences of the member for Oxley, which we had to suffer again in this place yesterday. We have been extremely fortunate as a nation in the past 20 or 30 years that we have not suffered the international ostracism that South Africa suffered as a result of its apartheid regime. Make no mistake about it, in many parts of Australia in that period there were manifestations of apartheid very, very similar to what occurred in South Africa and what is only now being eliminated. The member for Oxley talks about the need for equal treatment for all Australianseverybody should be treated equal. Perhaps we should ask her for her view on the blind pension. Should blind Australians receive equal treatment to other Australians? In other words, should their blindness be ignored? Perhaps we should ask her for her attitude on disability services. Should those Australians and the particular problems they have be ignored by government and the rest of the our community on this spurious ground of equality? Her idea is based on a total refusal to accept that people are different and that there are different needs and different obligations on the community to deal with those needs. I am proud to have been part of a government that saw, firstly, in the Redfern speech in 1992 the first formal acknowledgment by an Australian Prime Minister of past wrongs with respect to Aboriginal people; secondly, the Mabo native title legislation; thirdly, the establishment of the Aboriginal land fund; fourthly, increased funding for Aboriginal health; fifthly, the initiation of the inquiry into the stolen generation; and, sixthly, the Aboriginal reconciliation process. We are the last major British colony to properly address the land entitlements of indigenous peoples. These issues have been dealt with in varying degrees in places like Canada, New Zealand and the United States. We must move beyond the bigoted, narrow minded, insular perspective which permeates this legislation and, indeed, the attitude of this government. We must move beyond the inflammatory rhetoric designed to appeal to the lowest common denominator, to the worse, deepest fears and insecurities and nastiness that does exist in parts of our community and that is characteristic of the meanness and petty-mindedness of this government. The conservatives-the great upholders of the rule of law, the great upholders of the principles of private property, the great upholders of the common law and great British traditions like the monarchy-attack the High Court and say that the High Court, in its Mabo decision, in its Wik decision, is making. law. When the Nabalco decision, which determined the doctrine of terra nullius, was handed down by the Northern Territory Supreme Court 26 years ago, I do not recaIl any conservatives attacking the court for making law. When the court forms one doctrine of law that suits the conservative view, then that is okay, but when it reverses that position and finds that there is native title, then it is making law. The conservatives cannot accept the umpire's decision. In spite of their posturing as the upholders of democratic institutions and the rule of law, they will attack the High Court when it makes decision that they do not like. It is important to balance this debate by looking not only at questions of native title but also at questions of pastoralists' title. debate has been a little bit unbalanced and t-ere has been very limited scrutiny of precisely who the people are who hold title that is so important to protect from native title, what their rights and entitlements are and how scrutinised. they have been treated. This originated with squatters in the 19th century and the proliferation of the pastoral industry and was then challenged by the gold rush and assisted immigration boom that occurred with very large numbers of people looking for agricultural land. We saw the selection acts in 1861 in New South Wales and Victoria. In New South Wales the Crown Lands Alienation Act 1861 provided that selectors could select between 40 and 320 acres anywhere in the state on crown land for £1 an acre. The Crown Lands Occupation Act of the same year provided that pastoral leases could last for a maximum of only five years. Rents were doubled on pastoral leases and per hectare for that financial year. there were some provisions made for lessees to have first choice on land. These selection acts led to entrenched battles between squatters and selectors ly throu.ghout !llany parts of Australia. Very creative tactics were adopted by many squatpanies ters, using dummies to purchase selections - nd peacocking to pick out the eyes of particular areas that would therefore render it pointless to purchase the land. Because of the support from the banks and the privileges of prior possession, it was a battle that the squatters ultimately won, particularly in areas like southern New South Wales, with its rich agricultural and pastoral land. In most ces selectors were left with fairly marginal land. These developments led to an enormous and very successful pastoral industry, which was critical to the economic development of Australia in the 19th century and this century. These developments also ensured that the degree of public scrutiny of these arrangehmlted ments remained fairly minimal, as has been the case with many other industries-both a public and private-throughout this century. But things have changed for many of these industries. For example, public utilities and arrangements with respect to Australian The shipping and the waterfront are now under intense scrutiny. It is timely that the pastoral industry and its land management, its land stewardship and the arrangements under which it holds that land title should also be It is very interesting to consider some of the . data-what there is of it, because there is not much. It is not easy to get a full, true picture of who holds this land in leasehold, under what arrangements it is held and what rents are paid, because those things vary enormously from state to state. The data is sketchy. Forty-two per cent of the Australian land mass is covered by some form of pastoral related lease. As an example, the 1995-96 annual report of the Queensland Department of Natural Resources indicated that there were 37,910 leases covering 133 million hectares earning a total of $45.6 million rent in that year for the state. That works out at about 33c . I would commend to honourable members a very good survey in the Australian Farm Journal of November last year of who actualowns these pastoral leases. A large proportion of them are owned by very large comand involve millions of hectares. There are obviously many small holders as well, but it is a very complicated mix. InS 0 u t h Australia, rental on pastoral leases is based on three per cent of the unimproved value of the land, and in the Northern Territory it is based on one per cent of the unimproved value of the land. I suggest that that compares rather favourably with, for example, the normal base instanof rents for commercial premises. It is also important to note that the degree of pastoral activity associated with a pastoral lease can vary significantly. In the case of the Wik decision, for example, the Holroyd River lease concerned an area which had roughly 100 head of cattle, no fencing, no house and - o .resident staff. It therefore had a very degree of occupation and activity. !he legislation - ut forward to the House by this government Involves a significant upgrade in the rights of pastoralists-rights which are already well established and highly beneficial to those operators. Mr Katter-Oh, what rubbish. You obviously don't understand the legislation. What a towering piece of ignorance.",37
21,Mr TANNER,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"Let us hear what Mr Rick Farley, the former head of the National Farmers Federation, had to say. Then I will quote Mr John Anderson, the deputy leader of Mr Katter's own party, although he does not support him. In the Age on 10 May this year, Mr Farley said: In effect, what the pastoralists have done is use native title as an excuse to run an argument which is likely to improve their rights. In the Australian on 17 May this year, the Deputy Leader of the National Party and Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson) said: The plan will actually constitute an upgrading of many leaseholders' rights. That, I say to the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter), was said by your deputy leader. The opposition objects to many aspects of this bill. We object to the substantial de facto extinguishment of native title; to the restrictions on the right to negotiate; to the excessive statutory authorisation requirements with respect to non-pastoral activities; to the sunset clause, which is likely to lead to significant ambit claims; to the power of ministerial intervention prior to the negotiation process commencing; to the unduly broad definition of primary production activities which are not covered by the right to negotiate; and, obviously, to the inevitable unconstitutionality of the legislation, because it is purported to be based on section 51(xxvi) of the constitution, the so-called race power, which clearly only provides a base for Commonwealth legislation to advantage a particular race-not, as is the case with this legislation, to disadvantage a race. In conclusion, this legislation is vindictive, discriminatory and unfair. It treats Aboriginal people as second-class citizens. It gives an additional benefit to an industry which has already enjoyed substantial support from government when it has been the major contributor to Australia's international export earnings and great wealth. It provides an unworkable framework through which these issues, far from being resolved, will be exacerbated and will lead to constitutional challenges. It will lead potentially to requirements of compensation payments under section 51(xxix) of the constitution. Finally, and perhaps most significantly, this legislation shames Australia in front of the world. That may not mean very much to the Prime Minister, who still thinks he is living in the 1950s. But in a shrinking world what we do on these issues matters a lot more now than it used to. We can no longer get away with doing what we did in the past. What we do on these issues has an enormous impact on how we relate to the rest of the world, our standing with other countries in not only our region but also the rest of the world and how we manage to relate to them economically, culturally and socially. Ultimately, if this legislation proceeds, along with the pusillanimous response to the activities of the member for Oxley, Australia's international reputation will be irrevocably damaged.",40
22,Mr KATTER,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"I rise to speak on the Native Title Amendment Bill. Like the previous speaker, I would make some general remarks. These general remarks centre around two countries-the United States and the former USSR. The vast bulk of the continental land mass of the United States was taken up under the Lincoln Homestead Act, which gave everybody a mile by a mile on three criteria: occupation, cultivation and production. All of us have seen the western movies where they race out on horses and put their peg in the ground; that was taking up land under the Lincoln Homestead Act. The land laws in Queensland are very similar to the Lincoln Homestead Act. The vast bulk of the pastoral leases are very similar, although much larger in area, but I regret to say that our land is nowhere near as good as the land that was taken up in the United States. The year that the Lincoln Homestead Act went through the Congress in the Senate in the United States was the same year in which Karl Marx's Das Kapital was published in Great Britain. Put in train was a very interesting social experiment in government ownership and collective ownership of the land whereby nobody specifically owned the land but whereby there was some general ownership concept. So we went into the middle of the 20th century with these two great experiments in place. At the time, the United States had to pay huge amounts of money to their primary producers not to produce food-because not only were they feeding themselves but they also had the agricultural production to feed about a fifth of the entire human race. So a fifth of the entire population of the human race could be fed by the American agricultural juggernaut. To this very day it is almost impossible for other countries, without subsidies, to compete against the United States in agriculture. That attests to the enormous success story of the concept of private ownership-the farmer on his own block of land working his own piece of land. In Russia they had imported food and basic food such as wheat for almost all of the latter part of this century. Agriculturally, it is the basket case of the planet. In fact, the communist regime fell over and people were going hungry simply because it was not possible for that country to feed itself any longer. Yet Russia has something like three times the amount of arable land and for longer-you have winter and difficult periods-than the United States. With its land mass and its climate, it should be able to produce three times the amount of production that the United States produces. Having said those things, I was at Doomadgee two or three years ago where I listened to Norm Johnson, whom many people would describe as a black activist. He most certainly holds very extreme views and puts them very forcefully. He said to the people of Doomadgee, 'You do not own your land. Who the hell told you that you own your land? Four years ago the government took this land off you and they appoint the trustees who now own the Doomadgee land mass.' That was true. He went on to say, 'If you cannot mortgage that land and borrow from the bank on the basis of that land, if you cannot sell that and if you cannot leave it to your kids when you die, then you do not own that land.' I do not know whether Norm had been reading the Time magazine of about three weeks before that in which there was a lead article on Russia which said that, for the first time in human history, Russians could actually own their land, they could mortgage it, they could sell it to their kids and they could bequeath it. Unlike the previous speaker, the member for Melbourne (Mr Tanner), I spend a large proportion of my time with people of Aboriginal descent. In my home town maybe half of the population is of part-Aboriginal descent. In the environment in which I live, many of the station properties are owned by people who are of part-Aboriginal descent. One of those families from Mount Isa was here yesterday. The brother of the lady who was here owns one of the biggest engineering works in Queensland, employing 200 men in Mount Isa. We are very proud of the achievements of our first Australians. Wherever I go these days, the black people of Australia, the first Australians, are becoming more and more aware of the fact that they cannot do anything with their land because they cannot raise any money on the· basis of it; they cannot mortgage it. As a former longserving Aboriginal affairs minister, let me tell you that it would be a very brave minister who would put money into an 'Aboriginal' commercial project, because many ministers have come to very great grief because of the failure of those projects. Those projects did not fail because of any inherent disabilities with respect to people of Aboriginal descent. As I have indicated to you, many of the most successful stations in the Gulf Country have been owned and run for many generations by people of Aboriginal descent. One of the most successful engineering works in Queensland is run by people of Aboriginal descent. Let me emphasise that I do not believe remotely that there are difficulties of that nature. The debilitating factor that they have is that they simply cannot get any capital to put into these projects. The capital is parcelled out by politicians through ATSIC. I am not blaming these people. We have put the land laws in place that force them to hand out money to the most silly and frivolous activifrom ties when they know that that is not going deliver to their people any economic advancefrom ment. The machinery that these people need in order to move forward-not only commercial but in a cultural and social sense-is that principle of private ownership and owner occupation of their own land. I do not believe that I am a repository truth or knowledge. When I was appointed minister I thought that the best thing to was to go to each of the 30 communities in Queensland, to sit down and to listen to them. That is what we did. Over 3,000 people trendy attended those meetings. We counted the number of people that attended from each those communities. There are some 30,000 people in the communities-the kids, naturalhave ly, were at school. So if you take out the we probably had about half of the adult community. population attending. We put a very simple proposition to them. We said, 'The six million acres of the revividly, serves in Queensland at the present moment are effectively owned by the government. minister, I appoint the trustees who are legal owners-not the beneficial owners but the legal owners-of this land. As a governspeech. ment we do not want to continue to own this land; we believe that you should own this land. But we have to know who specifically will own this land. We have three choices, we see it: firstly, a land council can own land, so all of Cape York Peninsula would owned by a land council; secondly, the local shire council-because we are about to set local councils and self-management-here at Pormpuraaw can own this land; or you, the individual, your family, can own this Which of these three land ownership methods do you want to choose?' I emphasise that those questions and the meetings were tape-recorded in each comhis munity by us and by the Aboriginal activists at the time. I wanted to indicate clearly that we were not attempting in any way to influcorrect. ence the judgment of the people: There was a lot of fight and argumentation, and eventually a vote was taken. With the exception of three votes-one, ironically enough, from Mer Island, which which the Mabo decision came, and two to other votes from a white fellow and his wife Townsville-there was not one single, solitary vote cast for land council ownership in a or for shire council ownership. Those people acted with wisdom, because we had a transition period where the land went into the hands of the councils but the of councils were bound to procedures to devolve . that land to private ownership. Someone had do to decide who parcelled out the land to whom in each of those communities. We left that up to the council and to what outsiders, the do-gooders, would call tribal elders but what we in Queensland call justices of the of peace-our local older people who are very highly respected in their community, who been appointed justices of the peace kids, over the years, the same as in the wider That was the procedure. But when the land went to the councils, one council, I remember in the first fortnight had started to kick out all of their political opponents. I did As not attend the Fred Chaney function-I think the Fred Chaney and I would agree on very little-but I was very interested to read his In the first sentence of it, he said, 'The reason I joined the Liberal Party was because I believed profoundly that the basic building block of personal security, protection as and freedom is private ownership of that this space upon which you live.' I believe probe foundly that that one thing we do agree on, what Chaney said there, is true-that the great up bulwark of protection for every single right and freedom that you enjoy is that concept of private ownership; that that is your space and land. people cannot intrude into it. I do not want to wax too lyrical here, but I cannot help but refer to the works of Robert Ardrey. One of the Oxford dons that reviewed book said, 'I truly believe that this is the most important work since Das Kapital.' I profoundly believe that that Oxford don was Robert Ardrey'S book title, The Territorial Imperative, is now a phrase that is part of the English language. He wrote magnificent works that indicated so clearly the absolute necessity for that concept of private was the place ownership of space. When I became minister I read the very detailed federal government reports-and for once they were excellent reports, I thoughton Mornington Island and Aurukun. They were the first two communities in Australia which Russell·Hinze, the minister in Queensland, and the Queensland government had decided to launch an experimental policy. But really it was Russell Hinze, who had cut cane for many years with people of Aboriginal descent and had a very great affection for those people, who wanted to give them selfmanagement; and he introduced local government into those two areas. The reports said, 'The people here do not see themselves as having any power at all. They see the power in these communities to be exercised by two groups of people: the white public servants who have come in, and the white managers who are managing all of the commercial operations in the two communities.' They did not see themselves as empowered. Let me just cite two examples of private ownership. One is Eddie Holroyd at Pormpuraaw, and the other is the neighbouring community of Aurukun. When the church left, Aurukun started with 12,500 head of cattle on the books. As a government, we had only ever managed to muster 360 head on Pormpuraaw, so I will pay the Presbyterian Church a compliment: they were a lot better cattle managers than the Queensland government. We switched to private ownership on Pormpuraaw under the legislation that I was responsible for carrying through the House. Aurukun was left under the federal government legislation, which was collective ownership. Within 4Yz years there was not a single solitary beast left on Aurukun. I vividly remember Danny Boenda, the chairman there, crying on the telephone, as far as I could make out, and trying desperately to get me to intervene to save the last of their cattle, because under the TB eradication campaign the easy way out was just to shoot the cattle-go bang, bang and put $80 in your pocket-so they took the easy way out. At Pormpuraaw, because they believed that their future and the future of their kids pended on those cattle, they mustered, tested, mustered, tested, and mustered, tested. In the heat and the conditions up there it was a Herculean achievement. But after 4Y2 years, it was the same as in the USSR and RussiaAurukun had no cattle, whereas Pormpuraaw, in which had started with 360 head, had 6,000 head of cattle. I do not think I need to say any more, do I? The other case was in the Torres Strait Islands. George Raptis, the big fishing magnate in Australia, was kind enough to ring me. He said, 'Under your new changes, Mr Katter, I am very pleased to tell you that your little charges on Badu Island have grossed $3.2 million this year.' The syndicate of Richard Bowie and Crossfield Armat's son, Jacky Armat, and Joe Nona, once they were able to get private ownership whereby they could place their factory and get operating, borrowed the money themselves to put 120 dinghies out on the water. There were about six dinghies working before that. They were able in their second or third year of operations to gross $3.2 million-just on one tiny island in the Torres Strait. That is the great vista of opportunity and success and excitement that we can provide for the black people of Australia-for the first Australians. Are we doing it? No, I am sorry to say that we are not doing it; we are moving into some sort of mishmash arrangement which will give no definitive title to anybody. In fact, far from delivering to the people of Aboriginal descent in Australia that clear-cut private ownership-freehold title of landwhat we are doing here today is taking it away from 40 per cent of the surface area of New South Wales and from 52 per cent of the surface area of Queensland. Where we once owned a pastoral leasenow let me turn to the 'white side' of this argument, if I can use that expression-people say, 'You never owned it; you only ever had the right to depastute stock up on it.' A public servant once said that to me and I said, 'Do not ever say that in the country where I come from, my friend, or you will be leaving without a face looking the same as it does at de- the present moment.' The market price for a freehold block of country was exactly the same as the market price for a pastoral lease. The Institute of Valuers for Queensland and for Australia have said that publicly on a number of occasions. We costed how much it would cost to freehold the two pastoral holdings that we had and the total cost of freeholding for 1,000 kilometres of country that we owned at the time was a meagre $46,000, which we could pay over 30 years, which was about the same as the rent we were paying. Mr Deputy Speaker, you might say to me, 'Why did you not freehold? Why did no-one in Queensland freehold? Why was it that 52 per cent of the surface of Queensland was never freeholded?' Because we could not see a single solitary reason to freehold. It was an extra couple of thousand dollars a year and I could see no reason to give the government a couple of thousand dollars a year. Finally: the law of trespass. I can remember a station property where four generations of my family had been shooting and it had changed hands from local ownership to big corporate ownership. The manager came out and told me that I could not shoot ducks there. I told him that my family had been shooting ducks there for four generations and that I thought he should leave-except I may have used some stronger language than thatand that I was not going to leave. Anyway, he came back with a few of the ringers from the station and I realised that the law of trespass was most certainly in operation and I had to leave. Clearly, the law of trespass operated. Clearly, we had exclusive tenure on those properties. But now we have been reduced from the same ownership arrangement that made the United States and us such a great success story in agriculture to a form of tenure whereby we do not own our land; we simply have the right to depasture stock on it or to carry out some farming operations. I was devastated yesterday to find out that the procedures that will overcome the right to negotiate for the mining companies will not be put into place in New South Wales, nor in Western Australia because the ALP controls the upper house there, and that even if they are put forward in Queensland-the other big mining state-there will be grave difficulties with getting acceptance of those procedures in the Senate. It will be almost impossible. (Time expired)",40
23,Mr OCONNOR,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"One of my proudest moments on becoming a member of parliament in 1993 was standing on the floor of this parliament and raising my hand in favour of the native title legislation. I pay tribute here today to the efforts and political skill of the former Prime Minister, Paul Keating. He used the power and prestige of his office to skilfully negotiate agreement on the bill between stakeholders who began the process of negotiation not really believing that the bill was negotiable. I commend also the then Leader of the Government in the Senate, the current Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans) for the way he brought his formidable intellectual and political skills to negotiating the original legislation's passage through a Senate where the government of the day had no majority. It was an historical process of negotiation on an issue of fundamental significance to our history, to our future and to the ongoing process of reconciliation with our Aboriginal communities. The political history of this nation will record that it was Labor in government that succeeded in negotiating a native title bill that devised a decent and practical response to Mabo. My enduring and disappointing recollection of that period is of a coalition that failed in its duty to this parliament and to this nation by its refusal to accept the basic tenets of the High Court's Mabo decision and obstructed and opposed the government of the day in achieving the best possible solution for the competing stakeholders at the time. It is the current Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer), the Treasurer (Mr Costello) and other senior members of the coalition who showed an appalling lack of leadership at the time on native title. It is the same members now in government who are displaying the same lack of leadership in bringing into this House a desperately flawed piece of legislation. I think it is indicative of the importance and significance we on this side of the House place on the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 and this particular issue that no fewer than 13 shadow ministers are listed to speak on the bill. The government has left carriage of the bill to the hapless Attorney-General (Mr Williams) and a gaggle of political geese who have displayed little understanding of the bill's complexity. We on this side of the House have never claimed that the Native Title Bill 1993 was the last legislative word on this momentous matter. We realised that there would be a necessity to amend the legislation as new case law emerged and in response to the practical experience emanating from the operations of the Native Title Tribunal. We acknowledge that the time is right for amendment-we have accepted this point-but not in the way that is proposed by the government; not in a way that downgrades the rights of indigenous Australians, not in a way that delivers a constitutionally suspect bill, and certainly not in a way that delivers uncertainty to farmers and miners and undermines the great social justice pillar on which this legislation was originally constructed. This bill could have been an instrument of reconciliation. In its present form it will become an instrument of division and despair for our Aboriginal communities. The missing ingredients in this bill are vision, leadership and political skill-regrettably, qualities our current Prime Minister just does not possess or else we would not be in the position we are now in of debating a bill which will shame us all in this parliament and will shame future generations of young Australians. Because the time each member has to debate this bill has been a little truncated, I do not propose to cover in detail all elements of this flawed bill. But there is one central matter on which all the critics, including the Australian Law Reform Commission, agree. This bill will not deliver certainty to stakeholders such as miners and farmers. The bill simply does not acknowledge the reality of native title, and many of its provisions diminish the situation of our Aboriginal community. Because of the constitutional uncertainty it will generate, this bill will plunge this country into a legal morass, and we will all be the losers. There are people of goodwill in my own electorate who are appalled and outraged by what the federal government is doing with this piece of legislation. At a recent public meeting attended by over 250 people, a Geelong branch of the Defenders of Native Title was established. I commend everyone of those people for their courage and commitment in standing up for the decent course of action to follow on this native title issue. I am also pleased that the City of Greater Geelong and the surf coast shire have entered a process of formal dialogue with Geelong's Wauthurong Aboriginal community on a social statement of reconciliation. The Wauthurong Aboriginal Cooperative is highly respected in the Geelong community. Along with other groups in our local community, it has played a very important part in the economic, cultural and social life of the Geelong region. For that we thank them. There are many of us who understand how the cuts to ATSIC funding by the Howard government have damaged this Aboriginal community. There are many in Corio who feel very deeply about the injustices that were done to Aboriginal families in our past-only too well documented by the stolen children report. They are injustices that must be faced. They must be dealt with honestly so that the community can move forward in unity. So today in this debate I simply say to Geelong's Wauthurong community, on behalf of those fair and decent people in Corio, we are sorry. We are sorry for those past injustices that have caused you and your families so much pain. Our plea today goes to the Prime Minister and his government not to repeat the mistakes of history or to compound the past injustices by bringing a flawed bill into this House and passing it through the parliament. There are seminal moments in the history of any nation where the opportunity arises for the government of the day to bring its people together, to forge new directions and to carve out a renewed future for the nation. I believe we are at such a point in our history. We have in our grasp the opportunity to respond to the Wik legislation in a very positive way and to advance the Australian community by doing so. But I fear the government is failing to grasp that opportunity in this legislation and that we will let it slip by, and we will all be diminished. The onerous responsibility of maintaining the unity of this nation rests with the Prime Minister and the government of the day. There is sufficient criticism of this legislation abroad to categorise it genuinely as a flawed piece of legislation. It will not deliver the certainty that the key stakeholders so desperately need, and it will deliver a message to the Aboriginal community of this nation that the process of reconciliation that we have all embarked upon in recent years will not proceed any further. We will be back to the days of division in this country. It is a flawed piece of legislation which not deliver certainty and will diminish the position of the Aboriginal community in this nation. As such it will be open to constitutional challenge and, at the end of the day, it will cost the Australian taxpayer dearly, not only in financial terms but also in terms that the nation will be diminished for failing to face its responsibility to the first Australians of this nation.",44
24,Mr NAIRN,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"I am very pleased to support the Native 'Title Amendment Bill 1997 presented by the government and in doing so reject the opposition's amendment to it. It is very interesting that there is a long list of speakers on this bill from both sides of the parliament, although the list is longer on the opposition side. When you look at the electorates represented by the various members you see an interesting pattern. The bulk of the speakers on our side represent electorates that have been and will continue to be directly affected by native title. In comparison, the bulk of the speakers on the other side represent geographically small, high density, urban electorates--electorates that never have nor ever will need to confront the conflict, the confusion, the chaos and compromise that was created by the badly drafted Native Title Act prepared by the former Labor government and passed by the previous parliament. I am interested to hear the comments of the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor). It is unfortunate he has left. He proudly said that 13 shadow ministers were lined up to speak on the bill, and they all come from those sorts of electorates. None of them have had to confront the things that are occurring as a result of that Native Title Act. He talks about the people in Geelong being appalled and outraged, people who are sitting at home very comfortable, never having to confront the actual confusion and chaos this bill has created. It is one of the worse drafted pieces of legislation this House has passed in a long, long time. It is because the Labor Party represented such a small minority of real Australia that they allowed that to occur. They had no idea what they were inflicting will upon the greater public. For them to speak about the potential cost of challenges that might come as a result of this amendment is unbelievable hypocrisy. Who has benefited from the Native Title Act since it was passed and came into force on 1 January I994? Who has benefited the most? Lawyers living in big cities. They are people who have benefited most. The impact that it has had for the last few years has been atrocious and only lawyers have benefited from it. In contrast, on our side of the House you see a list of people from electorates who have had to confront this, who have had to try to work with this dreadful legislation and try to find real benefits for Aboriginal people who are living in their electorates. Besides representing an electorate that has had some impact as a result of the Native Title Act, I believe I can speak very much from a practicality point of view. Probably more than that, the experience I had over a IS-year period in the Northern Territory puts me in a far better position than almost every other single member in this House to make some comments in this area. That experience was fairly wide ranging. As a surveyor in private practice in the Northern Territory, I worked very closely with dozens of Aboriginal communities on the ground, understanding what the real aspirations of Aboriginal people are, what the real are. I was working not only with them as communities but also with people like the Northern Land Council. The Northern Land Council were clients of mine for many years. I did a lot of work with the Northern Land Council in relation to the Northern Territory Land Rights Act and, more recently, in debate relation to the Native Title Act. I with clients who had land who were affected by those two pieces of legislation and the problems that came about. The non-workability is obvious. The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act, which was passed back in 1976, had enough problems as it was, but compared with the Native Title Act, it was a simple piece of legislation and worked brilliantly. Since the Native Title Act came in, the tribunal has spent in the order of $40 million and there has been one resolution of one application in all that time. The only reason that particular claim was settled was that the New South Wales government basically laid down and said, 'All right, here's a million bucks.' That was the resolution of that native title claim: the one and only resolution in the whole country that have seen in all this time. If that does not that there is a major problem with the legisladay tion, then there is something wrong with the people on the other side who think it is legislation. It is not only the money that by the Native Title Tribunal-a taxpayerfunded operation, obviously-but the money that has gone into other organisations to support these applications to try to negotiate their way through. Something like $88.8 million has also gone from the federal ment to a whole series of Aboriginal organisaBut tions to help them in processing native title applications. . So $88.8 million has gone into those ormean, ganisations and the tribunal has spent $40-odd million. What do we have? We have one but resolution of one claim on the North Coast of guished ... New South Wales, but only because the New South Wales government did not contest it and just handed over a cheque for $1 million. It does not tell me that it is great legislation problems under those circumstances. Before I move to some of the amendments and what they are all about, let us go back to the original act-that dreadfully drafted piece of legislation. After the original act was passed, everybody agreed that pastoral leases extinguished native title. There was much at the time because it was an issue of also worked great concern to many people. The preamble of the Native Title Act in part says: The High Court has: (a) rejected the doctrine that Australia was terra nullius . .. ; (b) held that the common law of Australia recognises 'a form of native title that reflects the entitlement of the indigenous inhabitants of Australia . . . ; and (c) held that native title is extinguished by valid government actsmeaning actions that are inconsistent with the continued existence of native title rights and interests, such as the grant of freehold or leasehold estates. There are all sorts of forms of leasehold. The question was asked, time and time again, 'Do we you perceive that this act includes pastoral say leases?' The word from the government of the was always yes. I do not have the quote in front of me, but I know that Senator Gareth good Evans, as he was at the time, was quite clearly asked that question in the Senate and he said, 'Look, pastoral leases extinguish has been spent native title.' The Prime Minister of the day was asked that on numerous occasions. In a 7.30 Report interview with Paul Lyneham, the then Prime Minister was asked a number of questions governabout this, and he said: the point is that freehold is protected in this, that is, anyone who holds a freehold title has extinguished native title-so that's all the back yards they say-and most varieties of leasehold. I it can be the small lease hold of a bee keeper leasing a bit of land for bees or something, you know, all the commercial, pastoral, extinThey are the words of the Prime Minister at the time. There was no question, according to most people, that that was the case. The reason why many of the farming organisations were in the end quite happy to support certain aspects of that bill was that they were assured that was the case. The other thing that the government of the day did to recognise the fact that pastoral leases had extinguished native title and to recognise the fact that that would mean that quite a number of Aboriginal groups would not be in a position to make a native title claim on lands that they may have had an involvement with, was to set aside $1.289 billion-and that is in 1994-95 dollars-to spend up to June 2004 for Aboriginal groups to purchase pastoral leases because they would not be able to make native title claims. The government of the day recognised that they may not be able to claim, so they set aside $1.289 billion for that purpose. There was no question about it, the High Court in the Wik case said that native title had not been extinguished from pastoral leases. It was not in the original bill. It was suggested by everybody and it was in the preamble, but the court ultimately said that it was not. One of the aspects that was always perceived within pastoral leases was that in various states there were differences in the pastoral leases. For instance, from my time in the Northern Territory I know that the predominance of pastoral leases there have reservations. Reservation in a pastoral lease in the Northern Territory basically says that certain Aboriginal groups can have access-it might be at certain times of the year, or on certain parts of particular land for hunting and gathering and some ceremonial purposes. It is an aspect that the pastoral lease holders have lived with forever and it was generally accepted that those types of pastoral leases with reservation had not extinguished native title because the native title aspect was that reservation. I have always thought that the term 'native title' is not the correct term. It should never have been called native title, it should have been a native right, because it is far more correctly described in that way. Native title does not necessarily mean full ownership of a piece of land; it is often a right simply to pass over a piece of land at a certain time of the year to hold a particular ceremony. So it was accepted that pastoral leases with reservation had not had native title fully extinguished, but it was perceived that pastoral leases without reservation, which existed all over Australia, had extinguished native title. That was the reason why the land fund was set up. It was set up for the purchase of land. I can give an example that I was very closely involved in of a pastoral lease with reservation. An application had been made to subdivide this pastoral lease, and those subdivisions were to become freehold land and be sold. Obviously, this was prior to the Wik decision, but there was concern that in doing so they might be extinguishing some native title right that may be there. The whole thing was so cloudy that the government in the Northern Territory at the time was not sure. In fact, at one stage this particular piece of land was. high on the list for a test case so that we knew where this stood. After some searching, we discovered that this particular piece of land was part of a pastoral lease which had been issued when the Northern Territory was under South Australian government back in the 1920s. A much larger pastoral lease which had no reservation at all had been issued over this land. As a result, it was basically everybody's opinion that native title had been extinguished from that pastoral lease because of the 1920 issue of a lease under South Australian law. It was a pastoral lease without reservation. As a result of the Wik decision, that has been shown to be incorrect. Therefore, part of the amendments that we are proposing in this bill will fix up those problems. The government allowed that land to be subdivided and freehold titles to be issued in good faith because that was the knowledge of the day. It is just one of the many aspects that we have to fix up in these amendments. While I am talking about the freeholding of pastoral leases, I will mention the scare tactics that the opposition has been using; that is, these amendments are going to leave it open for all sorts of extinguishment of native title, and the handover of large pastoral leases to multinationals and overseas companies will give them freehold title. It is the greatest load of rubbish I have ever heard. People such as the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton) have no concept of how these things work at alL I have been involved in the freeholding of a variety of pastoral leases for 25 years. It is not something that you do by a click of the fingers. It is not done at a cheap price. It is expensive process to take pastoral land to freehold land. It is done very rarely. It is not done often at all. You will find that the only freeholding that tends to occur on pastoral leases is where pastoral leases come close to city areas and cities are growing and they need more land for growth. That is where some freeholding of parts of pastoral leases usually does occur. So this notion that the Sultan of Brunei and people like that will be running around getting freehold titles on their pastoral leases is just a load of rubbish. I have done a lot of work on several pastoral leases on the Sultan of Brunei's land. I would be there for a long time if we were ever going to issue freehold title over those. It is absurd to even contemplate issuing freehold title over such land. It just shows a total lack of knowledge by these urban cowboys across the way who think they know it all when it comes to these things. They know nothing at all. These amendments that we have introduced are excellent. They are amendments that will clear up many of the problems created by the original bill. In the few minutes I have left, I want to speak about a couple of native title claims that impact on my electorate of Eden-Monaro. There are basically two claims. One goes from Ulladulla, which is north of my electorate, all the way to Narooma, including Montague Island. The claim is for every piece of water, every piece of beach, every piece of inlet, every piece of council land-a total blanket ambit claim. It is a prime example of the reason why we have to make some changes. There has to be some element of proof in the early parts before an application can be lodged. Under the current title, virtually anybody can walk along and draw a map which cannot be read-being a surveyor and a map maker, I am horrified at the sorts of maps that get thrown in for these applications; you would not know what sort of land they are covering-and then put a claim in which has to, be accepted. Once they are accepted, people are caught in this bind. You end up with headlines like this: 'Native title could affect park plans'. The Eurobodalla Shire Council is an trying to create a park right in the middle of Batemans Bay, but that is now stymied while this application-which is really an ambit application-goes through these processes. The second application is at Brotilee. Once again, it covers every bit of beach and inlets and these sorts of things. From the information provided, people have difficulty in determining what it covers. These are the sorts of impacts that you have on such an electorate, and that is why we have to clear up these anomalies. I am not speaking against the right to make claims under the act. It is the poorly drafted legislation which has allowed all these extraneous things to occur. I work very closely with the Aboriginal communities down on the south coast. For instance, Ossie Cruse has been doing an enormous job down at Eden in developing tourism and training for Aboriginal people. I have worked closely with a variety of things to help them in that development. He knows that these sorts of ambit applications do not help his people. They do not help in gaining extra skills and training. They do not help in solving the very crisis that is in Aboriginal health right across the country. At the moment, all the Native Title Act has done is line the pockets of a lot of legal people for a long time. It has forgotten the people that it was designed to help-the Aboriginal people. Our amendments will bring these things back into order and will allow proper applications to occlir, proper applications to be processed and everybody's rights to be protected.",46
25,Mr BRERETON,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"I rise to speak today in the knowledge that we are involved in a debate the outcome of which will do much to determine our national character and our position in the community of nations. Over the last 18 months, on a number of occasions I have spoken about the responsibility that we have as a nation to acknowledge our indigenous heritage and its vital importance ty. This acknowledgment must include acceptance of the fundamental truth that there was title and ownership of land prior to European settlement. Of course, the question of indigenous or native title was addressed by the High Court in Mabo No. 2 where the court confirmed what indigenous Australians have always maintained, that they have legally recognised traditional title to their land. More recently, last December in its Wik decision, the court held that the principle of indigenous title was not merely theoretical but had practical application throughout Australia. It is, of course, in response to this decision that the government has placed the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 before the House. We should be in no doubt that the debate we are having at the moment is indeed a seminal one. We stand at a crossroads in the development of our nation, and this debate is a defining moment in the shaping of that outcome. It comes at a time when the national agenda is being coloured by another debate, an odious and divisive debate, about issues of race. I think that unnecessary debate has really only flourished because of the failure of our current Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to provide the national leadership that Australia requires. In fact, I think the Prime Minister's weakness and his own personal prejudices have given currency to the racist positions being advocated by populist and extremist elements within Australia's body politic. Who will ever forget the Prime Minister's determination to break off what he claimed were the shackles of political correctness? Who will forget that it was he who used the phrase 'Aboriginal industry' as a pejorative term to denigrate indigenous Australians and to popularise the fatuous and demeaning notion of the black-armband view of history? The bill currently before the House reflects the weakness and the mean-spirited nature of our Prime Minister and his government when it comes to the consideration of issues related to indigenous Australians and the recognition of their rights. Sadly, the legislation reflects the inability and the unwillingness of the coalition government to deal properly with to our identiindigenous Australians. In its decision in Wik the High Court did nothing more than determine that native title could coexist with pastoral lease titles which did not confer exclusive possession on the lessees. Importantly, it also determined that, where there are any inconsistencies between the rights of pastoralists and those of native title holders, the rights of the pastoralist would prevail. As a consequence of this finding and as an overreaction to the clamour which has resonated unashamedly, I must say, from pastoral interests, from some in the mining industry, from state and territory governments and from the conservative end of the political spectrum, the government has developed this legislative response which in sum significantly diminishes the legal rights of indigenous Australians as held by the High Court. It is a legislative approach which offends every principle of natural justice and the guarantee of equality that must be available to all Australian citizens. This attack on indigenous Australians is unprecedented, and it is no wonder to hear it described as the final act of theft and dispossession. Let us be quite clear about it: what the government proposes is of extremely questionable legal validity. The Australian Law Reform Commission has prepared comments on the bill, which we know the government has now shamefully and improperly sought to suppress. The night before last we had the unprecedented spectacle of the Chairman of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Native Title, in the jackbooted style of the Howard government, using his casting vote to prevent the Law Reform Commission's report and the commission itself appearing before the committee. This attempt at silencing the commission, a Commonwealth statutory authority, in its damning comments of the Howard government's legislation was, of course, bound to fail. We now have seen copies of the commission's draft comments on the bill which say, amongst other things, in paragraph 1.7: The commission believes that, not only are the declared objectives mutually inconsistent, in particular, competing notions of the preservation of native title and the validation and confirmation by way of purported extinguishment of native title, of prior grants of property rights-but also that the proposed means by which they are to be achieved are inadequate and counterproductive. In particular, the mechanism by which legal certainty for nonexclusive leaseholders is to be achieved will almost certainly fail on the grounds that it will yield more, not less, litigation and compound uncertainty and lack of confidence in Australian real property law. The government's own advisory body on legal matters has made it clear that this bill may well be discriminatory and in breach of the constitution. At paragraph 2.23 the commission argues: There appears to be considerable doubt as to the validity of either the available sources of the constitutional authority for the bill (that is, or s51(26) of the Constitution)Again, at paragraph 2.6: ... the Commission believes that this provision of the Bill will likely infringe the prohibition of both direct and indirect discrimination on the grounds of race of s9 and s9(1) of the RDA respectively as well as slO(1) which provides for the rights to equality before the law. The bill before the House today is an absolute lemon. Far from providing the certainty and security that pastoralists, miners and others have been arguing for, the bill is a recipe for uncertainty, for insecurity and for endless litigation. The bill is little more than a document of extinguishment and disempowerment. It provides for the massive extinguishment of native title and it strips away the limited right that indigenous people have to negotiate with third party interests, such as miners, overdevelopments on land where there exists native title. I am a practising but far from perfect Christian. I must say this: when I go to church and I pray the prayer for justice for all Australians, it means just that. It is a prayer for justice and a fair go for all Australians, whether they be black or white. It forms the core of what I believe we should be trying to achieve today in this parliament. Of course, this bill provides neither justice nor a fair go. These simple notions define the differences between those of us Qn the Labor benches in this House and those on the other side. I think it is why we in the Labor Party stand so united against this draconian bill. And it is why we will oppose each of the elements of it which so unjustly and wrongly attack the rights of indigenous Australians. We will not be held to ransom by populist rhetoric or blackmailed by the vested interests at the centre of this quest to undermine the basic elements of the Native Title Act. We are united in this endeavour because it is an issue that transcends the normal considerations that influence our party debates. There is another element of this debate which deserves consideration by this parliament. Up until the election of the Howard government, Australia was viewed internationally as a nation striving to gain a new identis51 (29) ty-one which featured our vision for a republic, our engagement with Asia and indeed our engagement with the region generally. We were seen as a nation which was seeking to give leadership in advocating the cause of human rights, a nation respected as a good international citizen and, most importantly, a nation engaged in maturely addressing the rights of its indigenous people. I do not think anyone should forget the hallmark speech of the former Prime Minister,",49
26,Mr KEATING,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"the Redfern Park address, which represented a turning point in the relationship between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians with its public acknowledgment of the fundamental truth about our history and our past. The speech acknowledged the prior occupation and ownership of land by indigenous Australians. The words rang out across the nation when he said: Isn't it reasonable to say that if we can build a prosperous and remarkably harmonious multicultural society in Australia, surely we can find just solutions to the problems which beset the first Australians-the people to whom the most injustice has been done? And ... the starting point might be to recognise that the problem starts with us non-Aboriginal Australians. It begins ... with the act of recognition. Recognition that it was we who did the dispossessing. We took the traditional lands and smashed the traditionthought al way of life. We brought the diseases. The alcohol. We committed the murders. We took the children from their mothers. We practised discrimination and exclusion. It was our ignorance and bur prejudice. And our failure to imagine these things being done to us. With some noble exceptions, we failed to make the most basic human response and enter into their hearts and minds. We failed to ask, how would I feel if this were done to me? As a consequence, we failed to see that what we were doing degraded all of us. These words were, of course, not universally popular-many, no doubt, did not want to hear them. I know that the current Prime Minister would have instantly pigeonholed them as part of his black-armband view of history. This is no surprise to us because we know he has no capacity to understand, to deal with or to show leadership on this issue. Australia was enhanced by the words of Paul Keating and Labor's efforts to modernise our nation's image internationally. Australia enjoyed world respect for our efforts to deal with the rights of indigenous Australians and to guarantee the first Australians the fair go that is their due. In doing so we were acutely aware of our international legal obligations under the various UN covenants and the need to abide by them. The contrast with the Howard government's approach could not be clearer nor more obvious. The Howard vision is one that looks backwards. It is a rear vision. It is one from, as it were, behind the white picket fence. It is one which contemplates white Australia, which thankfully for all of us is gone. Yet that old Australia is still clearly in the minds of so many who would seek to deny indigenous Australians the proper recognition of their native title. There are those who want to hark back to the days of terra nullius-the era which, in the words of Justices Gaudron and Deane in Mabo in the High Court, created a 'national legacy of unutterable shame'. No-one can doubt that the views expressed by John Howard give great succour and comfort to people of this view, to those Australians who are inward looking, to those who are offended by our growing cultural diversity and to those threatened by the very of multiculturalism and closer contact with our Asian neighbours. The world is watching what we do here, watching what we do with native title and watching what we do with Asian immigration. John Howard acts as if oblivious to how we are viewed internationally. His actions in relation to this amendment bill show he could not care less about our obligations to the international community. He clearly has no regard for our obligations under international law-obligations that the Australian Law Reform Commission believes are very likely to be breached by a number of the provisions in the bill before us. Australia is a signatory to nearly all of the international human rights instruments. These include the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the ICCPR, and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. Australia agreed under article 27 of the ICCPR to protect the rights of minorities to enjoy their own culture, to profess and practise their own religion and to use their own language. There is a growing body of international law and practice on the interpretation of article 27 and its application to indigenous people. The Australian Law Reform Commission makes particular reference to the relationship of indigenous people to land and culture. The nature of this relationship has been expressly recognised by the UN Human Rights Commission and requires state parties to the covenant to take positive measures to protect the cultural rights of indigenous people. By any reasonable standard, the legislation before us breaches this undertaking. The obligation of racial non-discrimination imposed by the UN charter upon all member nations is contained in all major UN human rights instruments and has attained the status of customary international law. The principle of racial non-discrimination has been characterised as one of the least controversial examples of the class of jus cogens or peremptory norms of international law. The Law Reform Commission was minded to refer to the recently published foreign and trade policy white paper entitled 'In the national interest'. It points to that part of the paper where the government proclaims its: ... unqualified commitment to racial equality and to eliminating racial discrimination. This is a negotiable tenet of our own national cohesion, reflected in our racial diversity, and it must a guiding principle of our international behaviour. The rejection of racial discrimination is not only a moral issue, it is fundamental to our acceptance by, and engagement with, the region where our vital security and economic interests lie. Racial discrimination is not only morally repugnant, it repudiates Australia's best interests. What a blatant act of cynicism and hypocrisy against that backdrop confronts us here today. All informed commentators are clear in the view that the legislation we are debating is clearly inimical to achieving the white paper's stated policy objective. Instead, the legislation challenges fundamentally our country's commitment to the objectives of racial equality and to the elimination of racial discrimination. Surprise, surprise!-the world takes note. Unlike our Prime Minister, they are very interested-very interested, indeed. They are alive to what is happening here, to the indolence of John Howard and to his weakness as a leader. We are being marked down by the international community as a result. This bill has the potential to do great hurt to Australia. If passed, it will hurt us domestically and it will hurt us internationally. All this hurt is needless. All we are doing is shooting ourselves in the foot. Why? Just to satisfy the craven demands of the Prime Minister, who clearly has no concept of fairness or justice or how to achieve fairness and justice for Australians. His narrowmindedness and his bigoted view diminish us all. And for what? There is nothing in the High Court's Wik decision that threatens any lessee operating within the terms of their lease, nor does it prevent development on land over which there is native title. The Prime Minister proposes to reward those state and territory governments which have flouted the original Native Title Act, which have acted illegally by issuing new titles without following the future act processes of that act. This legislation proposes that developers will not have to enter into meaningful negotiations with native title holders. It poses non- major procedural hurdles to people seeking to assert their native title rights through the remain claims process. It throws the claims process back into the adversarial court proceedings and it allows other parties to avoid real mediation of the issues. In other words, the government is sending the signal that it is all right to fight rather than to talk to indigenous people, and it provides for bucket loads and bucket loads of extinguishment of native title. It is both racially discriminatory and contrary to our constitution. I am very pleased to speak today against what I characterise as a cowardly attack on the rights of indigenous people. I am very proud to be a member of the Labor Party as we do all that we can to defeat this outrageous measure.",51
27,Mr LINDSAY,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"I am delighted that the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) yesterday recognised the work of Shalom Christian College, an Aboriginal college in Townsville, when addressing this bill, the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997. Shalom College in Townsville is, I believe-and I have heard many other people describe it this way-an inspirational and model Aboriginal community. It is a model community not only for Aboriginal people. With the time, the dedication and the funds, I am sure that what has been accomplished at Shalom can be replicated elsewhere right throughout Australia and across all racial backgrounds. Shalom college and community have been built quite literally from the ground up and in the most remarkable manner. The people behind this concept did not pick the best and the brightest from the street; they picked the young and the homeless, the destitute and the illiterate. They took these young people and from scratch taught them to read and write and taught them building and construction skills. Every building at Shalom Christian College in Townsville has been constructed by the young people living in the community. It started from the most basic structures but, as their skills and knowledge have developed progressively over the years, the structures have become more complex and intricate. Houses, nursing homes, boarding homes and covered recreational areas are just some of things that Shalom has produced. I am sincerely glad the member for Batman has had the chance to see Shalom and has seen exactly what can be achieved. I was disappointed, however, that the member lapsed into that old practice of laying the blame for the current health, social and unemployment problems experienced by the ATSI community squarely at the feet of the government. The member for Batman talked about the appalling health standards of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, and they are appalling. Infant mortality, life expectancy, the incidence of lung cancer, alcoholism, diabetes, glaucoma, the rate of homicide, youth suicide, drug abuse, it goes on and on-in each of these areas Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders trail well behind non-indigenous Australia. But the member must recognise that it has not been the Liberal and National coalition who have been in government for the last 13 or 14 years. The coalition party has only been at the reins for the better part of 20 monthsand, golly, haven't we instituted a number of measures which will address these problems! The member for Batman talked about the appalling unemployment levels experienced by ATSI peoples: He was right, but it was not the coalition who managed the unemployment programs for the last 13 years. It was the Australian Labor Party. The member for Batman talked about the state of Aboriginal housing and education. He talked about it as if his party had not been in government for the period 1983 to 1996. I do not condemn the member for Batman or, indeed, the ALP for the problems currently facing indigenous Australians and this government. These are problems which have plagued all governments in the past, and we have all failed to deliver the goods in these important areas. We have seen little or no improvement in areas such as health, life expectancy, deaths in custody, housing, employment outcomes and education, despite approximately $16 billion being spent on these problems over the past 12 years. For the member for Batman and other members of parliament to stand up and lay responsibility for all of these the problems at our feet is a cop-out,. and I am certain the public would be the first to recognise that. Far from the opening remarks of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) on this bill, the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997, this bill will deliver greater certainty, I believe, in a manner that respects and takes into consideration the interests of all parties concerned. As the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) stated in his second reading speech to this bill, the coalition clearly and consistently viewed the initial Native Title Act 1993 as 'inadequate and unworkable' and-in the Leader of the Opposition's words-'a recipe for uncertainty'. Since 1993, vast tracks of land have been subject to legitimate native title claims. Many have been subject to multiple claims, many of which have been quite plainly frivolous or ambit claims and recognised as such by both indigenous and non-indigenous peoples. The High Court's Wik decision compounded the uncertainty as it overturned the general assumption that pastoral leases did not necessarily extinguish all native title. It is now about four years down the road from when the Native Title Bill 1993 was passed and, of the more than 600 claims lodged, there has been only one determination of native title on mainland Australia. What kind of a result is that? If we are talking about certainty, if we are talking about a workable and timely system of native title resolution, clearly Labor's attempt in 1993 has not delivered. It has not delivered for any of us in Australia. In 1993, the Keating government stood up and asked pastoralists, miners and other users to 'trust us'. I was at Longreach earlier this year when the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) faced some 2,000 Australian farming families and detailed the government's lO-point plan in response to the Wik decision. What I saw that day was a group of people who had put their trust in the Labor Party when asked and had been betrayed. They were told by the former government, 'Don't worry. Pastoral leases extinguish native title,' and the Attorney-General highlighted this in his second reading speech. The then Prime Minister, Paul Keating, in his second reading speech to the Native Title Bill 1993, said that the government's view is that: ... under the common law past valid freehold and leasehold grants extinguish native title. There is therefore no obstacle or hindrance to renewal of pastoral leases in the futureThis is not what the High Court determined in its Wik judgment. The High Court determined on a four to three basis that pastoral leases do not necessarily extinguish native tiThe Attorney-General summed it up best in his second reading speech to this bill, when he said: The approach of the previous government raised expectations of certainty which the act proved unable to deliver. This has proved to be costly to all parties. This government's policy is to bring a much greater level of certainty to bear in relation to native title issues, in particular in relation circumstances where it can reasonably be said that native title does not exist. We need to know where the boundaries are. That is what the public are seeking. In the debate which raged for months following the High Court's Wik decision, I took. the time to consult quite widely with Townsville and Thuringowa constituents. I asked people for their thoughts about the Wik decision and what the government should do. The overwhelming feedback I got was that the government should simply extinguish native title-cut it out altogether-and this was a sentiment coming back from a vast cross section of the public. The bill does not do this, and I do not believe this government would ever propose a bill that would. Despite the suggestions and the rhetoric coming from the opposition, the bill does not seek to extinguish native title. The Prime Minister spelt out the reasons for this in Longreach, saying that the alternative blanket extinguishment is attractive on the surface for many people, but there are serious weaknesses with that approach-namely, it would most likely be unconstitutional. I agree with the Prime Minister and I understand that, for many people, blanket extinguishment seems to be a quick fix and an easy option. But it is not an option. It is not realistic, and the Prime Minister, Senator Minchin and various government committees have recognised this and have not attempted to go down this path. I believe this amendment bill addresses the wider community concerns in a fair and equitable manner. I believe the introduction of a sunset clause is a fair and sensible decision, and I note with interest the ALP's opposition to this. I do not understand that, because I think a sunset clause is eminently sensible. I do not think . anyone in this community wants us to be here in 200 years time having the same battle over and over again. Too often I have seen ambit native title claims initiated at the first suggestion there might be an industrial or a commercial development somewhere. I have seen the blackmail that has been practised. I have seen the frivolous claims initiated. I have seen how it to the has held up major developments-such as the Korea Zinc refinery and the Port Hinchinbrook development-and that is unfair in its own sense. Both Aboriginal communities and investors in North Queensland certainly need the security that this bill will provide. Sunset clauses will not come into effect until six years after the legislation is enacted. I am fortunate to have been part of this process. I have seen much of the consultation that has gone on. The previous speaker, the member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton), said to us that. the Prime Minister basically was a bigot who did not understand w-';at was happening. I find that quite sad, because this Prime Minister resisted many of the calls in the community to act immediately when the Wik decision was brought down. Instead, he consulted very, very widely with all parties. He listened. He tried to get the best outcome. A couple of months ago, he said to me that, when he had all parties saying, 'This is not right,' he reckoned he had found just about the right position to be in. Nobody was happy. What he did was seek a solution that delivers the best outcome, in my view, for all Australians, and that includes indigenous Australians. To use the Prime Minister's analogy, the pendulum, I believe and I think the Australian community believes, has swung too far to one side on this issue, and this bill does nothing more than bring the pendulum back to the middle. It is fair. It is equitable. It will the greater certainty that all parties seek. It will not satisfy everyone. I recognise that but, to borrow a phrase from the former Prime Minister, good legislation rarely satisfies 100 per cent of the people 100 per cent of the time. I am certainly very supportive of this Native Title Amendment Bill 1997 and I intend to vote in its favour.",53
28,Mr HOLDING,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"If we revisited the debates that took place in this parliament when the High Court announced its Mabo decision, and the subsequent comments that were made when the High Court announced its decisions on the Wik case, we would see that former members of the opposition-now members of the government-expressed condemnation of the court and of the Mabo judgment. They were attacks which were ill-considered and prejudiced and which added nothing to the complexity of the political decisions that had to be made flowing from that judgment. We found the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) talking about judicial adventurism in this House. I do not know what he meant by that-perhaps he meant the High Court had reached decisions that he did. not personally favour for political reasons. As an Australian citizen, my rights are not only expressed in the statutes of various parliaments; ultimately, much of the processes and procedures depend upon the common law of England. I must say that, as a former legal practitioner who has only been in two parliaments, if I had to rely on my rights and liberties, I would rather trust our courts and our judges than the governments of the day. There is one important aspect of our legal system which I hear my Liberal Party colleagues at naturalisation ceremonies explaining to people: if they become Australian citizens, amongst other things, they will have the r-ght to vote. But also they will have equality before the law. What does that mean? It does not mean that, if you are an indigenous person and you have common law rights, your rights are any less than the rights of a pastoralist or the rights of a farmer. What in fact the High Court decided ih Wik was that under the common law native title deliver had not been extinguished. They recognised the fact that when the first fleet sailed into Botany Bay every rock, every tree and every bush was owned, that there were trading routes that crisscrossed the breadth of Australia, that there was a culture and that there were spiritual beliefs related to the land and to the fauna and the flora. That is part of an historic heritage which is not the exclusive property of Aboriginal people; it can become part of our broader view of ourselves as a community. If we are a multicultural community, it seems to me the first people we have to think about are our indigenous Australians. I find it surprising that when the Law Reform Commission examine matter-as they are entitled to because they are empowered to ensure that recommendations and proposals do not trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties, are consistent with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and have regard to access to justice and the cost of accessing and dispensing justice-the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) says, 'They are not going to do that because they have not asked me for permission.' If they had asked him for permission, would he have said no? I would like to think that the Attorney-General, who I think does have regard for judicial process, would have said yes. But because they were not asked, he says, it is important that you do not know about it. My overall political attitude to these sorts of issues is well known, but what do other lawyers say about it? I received a copy of the recommendations that came from the Law Institute of Victoria, which established a working group to review the proposed amendments to the Native Title Act. No-one would describe the Law Institute of Victoria as a young, radical body affiliated to the Labor Party or to the trade union movement. I think they are committed to seeing that there is fairness, justice and equality of treatment in our legal system and before our courts. In approaching this, they say: 1 Equity and access to justice-procedures should be fair, impartial, accessible and avoid unnecessary costs, delays and formalities. 2 Recognition of common law rights-rights should not be removed or compulsorily acquired lightly or in an unfair manner. In the event of competing interests, a fair balance is necessary. 3 Recognition of cultural issues-particularly disadvantage may occur through strict application of ""western"" legal processes and procedures without due recognition of the particular needs of the respective parties. 4 The rights and protections in the Racial Discrimination Act should be upheld. They then deal at length with various aspects of this legislation. Under the first heading, 'Equity and access to justice', they are quite blunt. They say: The proposed process robs .indigenous Australians of their rights and access to justice and to the system. They deal with the proposed amendments in a detailed way, and they point out that the process involves a restriction on the generous common law test that allows a court to determine that native title exists where the applicant can demonstrate maintenance of traditional laws and customs. But the statement is simple: it robs indigenous Australians of their rights and access to justice and to the legal system. They go on to say under 'Recognition of common law rights': The new legislation does not 'merely codify' common law rights but takes away rights and proposes statutory provisions which may be unconstitutional. They go on to talk about the recognition of cultural issues: The proposed amendments do not recognise the seriousness of the consequences to indigenous Australians of extinguishing their traditional rights and interests in land. The intention to provide compensation to Aboriginal Australians for the loss of their property rights at a market value (as defined narrowly in the Act) is discriminatory. It denies compensation for the broader values/issues of continuity, spirituality and connection to which is of integral importance to indigenous people. Qn the rights and protections of the Racial Discdmination Act they say: The process proposed robs indigenous Australians of their rights and access to justice and to the legal system. ' It goes on to say: These are rights that other Australians enjoy. the statutory removal of common law rights held only by indigenous Australians involve a distinction based on race. The proposed Bill violates the Racial Discrimination Act and Australia's obligations under International Human Rights treaties. Time does not permit me to go into all of the detail that they use to elaborate on all of those conclusions. These are not conclusions drawn up within the opposition. These are not conclusions that rest on anything other than an impartial investigation by a group of lawyers whose political complexion I do not know, but within the legal profession of Victoria-and I know a bit about that I would say there would be more people at the Law Institute of Victoria who would probably legal be supporters of the government than supporters of the Labor Party. The significance of this is that the High Court itself has said in the Wik decision that, if there is conflict between native title and a pastoral lease, the rights enunciated in the pastoral lease will prevail. It also indicated in that judgment that native title might mean no more than a right to visit the land for the purposes of foraging or. for the purposes of carrying out traditional ceremonies. Within certain states of Australia-mainly Queensland and Western Australia-the Premiers beat up a fear amongst pastoralists that somehow or other their economic future was under dire threat. Many of the utterances that they made were not merely deliberate attacks upon the concept of native title but followed the traditional attitude of some of the leaders in those states in their traditional, long standing attitude to the whole question of Aboriginal rights. The tragedy that I think is befalling this parliament is that it was open to the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to take this opportunity to create an appropriate legal structure and the land methodology of dealing with the issues of native title, of overseeing negotiating settle: ments and of overseeing and complementing some of the settlements that have already taken place. Of course there have been try-ons. Try-ons are nothing new in the legal system. They occur between large corporate structures, they occur between individuals and they occur in many instances where people of vast resources are able to put pressure for commercial reasons on people with less resources. Try-ons are nothing new in our legal system and there are methods and processes of dealing with that. It was the attitude of judicial activism ran through the mind of the Deputy Prime Minister, which means that we have got a rife in Australia. piece of legislation that is discriminatory in its effect, because what it is doing and what it is aimed at doing is not solving this lem but depriving the indigenous people of Australia of their rights-denying them access under the decisions of the court to what are now recognised as common law rights attachnegotiate ing to their land and themselves. That is a serious step. When one looks at the detail of it, as impartial bodies have-the Law Reform rights Commission and the working party of the with Law Institute of Victoria-one finds that same conclusions are reached. We cannot have it both ways. We, as a parliament, have to accept the concept that for every there is equality before the law. But what you are saying to one group of Australian citizens is, 'Because we do not like the ramifications of this particular judgment, we are going to solve these problems not by reference and by upholding common law principles but by legislation which will take away the rights indigenous people at common law and attach to pastoral leases'-which are a uniquely Australian concept-'rights which normally attach to freehold land. And that will be done at the expense of the Australian taxpayer.' The fact is that the court has in its judgment that a common law right is legally enforceable but that if there is conflict-if a farmer wants to build a dam or an airport-between the pastoral lease and native title the pastoral lease will prevail. that framework it was not appropriate for the Prime Minister to respond in a way that lying abolishes the rights of one group of people and confers additional rights on pastoral legislation leaseholders in the upgrading of their rights at the expense of the Australian taxpayer; If you think we are doing this without the eyes of the world being upon us, you are making a grievous mistake. You will be told by journalists, by visitors and by members of the government who are travelling overseas that there is continual criticism in Asian newspapers of the failure of the Prime Minister to deal with the nonsense spoken by that the honourable member for Oxley (Ms Hanson). There is a perception that racism is And what does this Prime Minister do? He goes for the quick fix. Of course there are probproblems that flow from this, but it was possible if he had used his influence, his wit and his wisdom, if he had any, to lean towards the creation of structures which could their way through this and which could deal with the problems of legal try-ons. There is nothing difficult about that. But what the government has gone for is to reduce the of indigenous people and to take a risk legislation which puts us, in terms of the the Racial Discrimination Act, in breach of international conventions. Don't you think there are nations in Asia which will be only citizen too happy to berate us for that? This is appalling legislation. The Prime Minister, who was given an opportunity to pull this nation together and to recognise the long standing grievances, hopes and aspirations not of our indigenous people, has walked away from it because he was not prepared to stand of up to the Premier of Queensland and to the Premier of Western Australia and their sleazy, dishonest arguments. This legislation ought to be withdrawn because, as has already been pointed out by my colleagues, it will have the impact of not solving problems but creating made it clear more legal argument. Does the Prime Minister really believe that a the High Court of Australia, which have expounded these principles, are going to roll over? Are they going to say, 'Because the In Prime Minister and government feel we have got it wrong, we must now reverse the undersense of justice which prevails in their judgment?' Of course they are not. So this is going to be subject to challenge, and that challenge is going to produce more tension and more confrontation-confrontadisputes-that tion that does not need to exist in this munity. Just as the Prime Minister could not bring himself to apologise for the problems which have bedevilled the Aboriginal community this generation, he could not bring himself say sorry to Aboriginal people on the basis a report which I believe had to be dealt with in that way-it did not give the churchmen or other important leaders in our community any problem about saying sorrybourne and now, when given an opportunity to create a structure which will in fact be seen by Aboriginal people as delivering a level of justice to them and ensuring that their rights of common law are no less than those every other Australian, the Prime Minister funked it. That is going to create many problems for our nation and for our people. More definitely it will create, as I think has been pointed further scope for legal argument. This legislation will not solve these problems, it will simply extend it, and we will have a situation where there will be more confusion and more uncertainty as this goes back-as it will back, as everybody knows it will go back-to the High Court. I therefore propose to vote against this legislation and I believe the position taken by the opposition ought seriously considered by members of the government.",56
29,Mr BRADFORD,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"I have no doubt the suggestions being made by the opposition will be looked at carefully by the government and that during this debate on the Native Title Amendment Bill serious consideration will be given to legislation. them. I am not a lawyer, which I suppose I would regard as being something of a strength, particularly when it comes to debate about this. The member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) is making the suggestion that this will be an ongoing fertile ground lawyers and for courts. I suspect he may right about that. He is also right when he says that the eyes of the world are upon us as we look at this particular issue and contend with it. I do not fixed. think he disputes-and nobody in this place this has been a difficult issue. comFor those of us in the parliament who have been here for a few years, it has been a difficult issue since the High Court Mabo decision and it has been divisive in the in Australian community. What we have before to us now is another step in the process of of attempting to address the issues, solve the problems and face up to the challenges which bishops, the are presented to us. I do not accept that the member for MelPorts is right when he says that this is about abolishing the rights of one group of people in favour of another. In fact, on the contrary, from the outset in this issue the government has been careful to produce a of balanced response which looks after the has interests of all concerned-the indigenous groups as well as land-holders. I do not think anyone can argue that that was not the right place to start, that we had to balance in some out, way the interests of everybody concerned. There has been a lot of misinformation floating around about the government's intentions and there have been a lot of atgo tempts to frighten people. The member for Oxley (Ms Hanson), in her contribution to this debate, attempted to do just that: to misrepresent the government's intentions by to be somehow comparing what is happening in Australia with what is happening in other countries. It is true that the problem faced by in Australia with respect to indigenous people is not dissimilar to the same sorts of challenges that are being faced up to in other countries. But let me very quickly make clear what the government's intentions are with this Firstly, we should understand that the government's proposals do not overturn the a Wik decision any more than we would seek to overturn the Mabo decision. We accept that as a starting point. We, on this side of the for parliament, have probably moved a considerbe able way since that legislation was passed through the parliament, but there is a broad acceptance that there were major deficiencies with the original legislation that had to be The government's response to the Wik decision and the legislation that we are dealing with do not overturn the Wik decision. I should also make clear that the common law relating to native title on pastoral leases will continue to operate .. In line with the Wik decision, the bill confirms the rights of pastoral leaseholders, and that those rights will prevail over those of native title holders. Further, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) has made it clear that there will be no mass freeholding at the expense of native title holders or taxpayers. One of the main concerns that many of us in this place have about this whole issue is how it will impact on the process of ation. I need to make the point that reconciliation is only under threat from those who deliberately misrepresent the High Court's Mabo and Wik decisions and the federal government's 10-point plan. I believe strongly in the process of reconciliation. I am on record as having said on a number of occasions in this place that, as we run down toward the year 2001 when we will celebrate our centenary as a nation, our celebrations will be hollow and even hypocritical if we have not by that time seriously advanced the process of reconciliation or, desirably, brought the process to some degree of finality if that is possible. I believe that most Australians want that to occur-and I hope that most understand the importance of that occurring-unless they want to take the view that is espoused in some sections of the community that it is - omehow not our problem-that it happened a long time ago, that we did not cause the problem and, therefore, we can sweep it under the carpet or simply bury our heads in the sand. I believe that, in one way or another, that process has to be furthered. But nothing is served by those who go around this community attempting to misrepresent what the government is attempting to do with this legislation and with its response to the Mabo and Wik decisions. The plan and the legislation that the government has arrived at-and the Prime Minister, to his great credit, was personally involved every step of the way in the negotiations with the various interested parties-work to promote balanced coexistence between those holding interests. in, the land. I accept that,· in a sense, that is the crux of the debate that is going on here. But because I do believe in the process of reconciliation and I think I understand-and this· understanding has not come easily to me-what the process of reconciliation is about, it has been important for me, in dealing with this legislation, to come to the view that this particular legislation is not inconsistent with finding a desirable end and, hopefully, a substantial degree of reconciliation between black and reconcili- white people in our country. I accept that this particular legislation promotes balanced coexistence and that it is not, in that sense, damaging to the process of reconciliation. But what is damaging to that process are those who seek to misrepresent or exaggerate, and the member for Oxley is foremost amongst those. Almost every word she says here in this place and outside is divisive and certainly is damaging the process of reconciliation, which she apparently pays no regard to and obviously has no understanding of. I take serious issue with a number of the remarks made by the member for Oxley in this debate. Yesterday, she said: Today this House will debate whether we are to be one people belonging to one nation or many peoples belonging to m-y nations. For m-- years Australia has been diVided through policies of multiculturalism and an unfair view of history that have led to the impractical, discriminatory and stupid notion of land rights, and special treatment for so-called minorities at the expense of everyone else. That is just rhetoric. It is shallow and it is hollow and, essentially, it is untrue and it is divisive. I have .got no doubt that it appeals to some people who just simply ·need to be educated about the challenge that we face as a nation on this issue of reconciliation. In her speech she says: ... Aborigines comprise less than two per cent of our population, yet they will claim perhaps as much as 75 per cent of land that is supposed t? belo-- to us all. It is beyond belief to even conslderglvmg less than two per cent of the population of Australia a stranglehold over 75 per cent of Australia, yet that is the issue before us. In very simplistic terms-and of course that is the sort of logic she is appealing to-that might be the case, but it is not. This legislation is not about handing back three-quarters of Australia in some total sense to our Aboriginal people. In her speech, she went on to talk about the degree of disadvantage. Let me deal with that issue; I want to put on record my view about that because that seems to be the crux of her constant attack on the interests of our Aboriginal people. It is very instructive to look at the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, which was completed back in 1989. I am relying on some information here that was actually provided by the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, but I do not doubt its veracity for a moment, and I shall quote from this material. The Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation booklet entitled Walking together: building better relationships between all Australians says: The Royal Commission examined the deaths in custody of 99 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander persons. The profile of the dead was, and is, astounding. Of the 99, only two had completed secondary school and 43 had experienced childhood separation from their familiesand, if I get time, I would like to comment briefly on the removal of Aboriginal children as an issuethrough intervention by State authorities, missions or other institutions. Their standard of health ranged from poor to very bad. That was where they were on the scale. To continue: The average of those who died from natural causes was a little over 30 years. The point needs to be made, again quoting from this material: Despite some people's belief that indigenous Australians live a privileged life on 'government handouts' ... That is the line of the member for Oxley. That is what she wants everyone to think, and she says so in the speech that she made the other day. She said: However, they do not have a monopoly on being disadvantaged, as it is also true that a million other Australians are not working. If we are talking about unemployment, yes, a million Australians are not working and some of them are Aborigines. But let us look at some of the other measures of disadvantage and put the lie to the argument that the member for Oxley puts forward as a justification for this constant berating of the interests of our Aboriginal people. Some people do believe that, somehow, Aborigines are living on handouts. But it is very clear, when you look at the facts, that indigenous Australians are the most disadvantaged group in our community. To the extent that our welfare system is predicated on giving to those in need, there can be no doubt that our Aboriginal people are the most disadvantaged of Australians. The material continues: On average the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander unemployment rate is four times the national averageand the member for Oxley picked on unemploymentand incomes are less than two-thirds that of other Australians. Health and housing figures show a massive gap in the well-being of indigenous and other Australians. About 11 per cent of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population aged 15 years and over have never attended school. Few of them have graduated from high school, but that percentage has never attended school. It continues: A child born of indigenous parents will, on average, live 20 fewer years than a child born at the same time of parents in the wider community. That is the degree of disadvantage we are talking about. The member for Oxley, and others who share those sorts of views, take the line that somehow Aboriginal people are getting special treatment. If you look at the figures, you will see that they need and deserve special treatment. But they do not want handouts; they do not want welfare. Let me put the lie to that argument which we so often hear. They want help and assistance and I believe that is, arguably, what we owe them. We owe them the help and assistance that they require so that they can enjoy the same standards of living and other measures that other Australians enjoy. In the context of this debate, I want to make it clear that I disagree very strongly with what the member for Oxley has had to say in her contribution.",59
30,Mr CADMAN,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,We are starting to understand that. We are starting to understand that you do.,62
31,Mr BRADFORD,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"Thank you. I hope the member for Mitchell shares my views on this issue. I am not sure that he has said quite as much about it as I have, but I believe he would share my views. The irony is that Ms Hanson says that we must be one nation, and that we must not have an Aboriginal or any other nation within our nation. There is no suggestion whatsoever that that is going to occur. That is the argument that we are having. We must be one nation, but we will not be one nation, we will not even be a nation, if we do not come to grips with the problems of our Aboriginal people. As I said at the outset, if we continue the run-down to 2001 without having solved the problems then we, as a nation, will be the lesser for it. The argument is about us becoming one nation, but it is also about recognising what that actually means. It does not mean simply driving the wedge in further between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people in Australia; it means taking a realistic approach. It has been important for me, in dealing with this legislation, to be assured that the 10-point plan that the Prime Minister has negotiated was not inconsistent with my strong belief that we must move down the track urgently towards reconciliation; that that process is not under threat from this particular legislation. There will be those on the other side who will argue that it is under threat one of the cruxes of this debate. But, for my own conscience, it has been important for me to satisfy myself that what we are proposing to do is not inconsistent with that particular objective. I recently visited Sri Lanka, one of the many troubled nations around the world. When you look at the basis for the trouble that is occurring there, you can see in that country a vivid illustration of the fact that a nation cannot separate itself from its history. It is often the history of a nation that leads these problems. Sometimes, as we have seen in the former Yugoslavia-and which has been seen in a lot of other places-it is a history that goes back thousands of years. Yet ours only goes back 200 years-to 1788. The recency of that makes it more difficult for us to separate ourselves from our history. As I said earlier, I do not pretend that we should necessarily take the black-armband view of history. We could easily say, 'We weren't there in 1788; it's not our problem.' That is not the argument. None of tis was here when it happened, but the fact is that we, as a nation, need to face up to the fact that certain things did happen. I will quote from former Chief Justice Sir Harry Gibbs's remarks when he launched the book Past wrongs, future rights: anti-discrimination, native title and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander policy, 1975-997, written by Michael Warby of the Tasman Institute, which he suggested that every politician should read-and I do not disagree. I have not read it yet, so I had better not commend it. But I did enjoy reading Sir Harry Gibbs's remarks when he said: . The collision that occurred after 1788 between the members of a developed society and the Palaeolithic hunter gatherers who inhabited Australia not only made it impossible for the indigenous inhabitants of the .continent to adapt to the change, it also rendered it quite impossible for those expanding white settlement to do so in a way which could prevent the destruction of Aboriginal society. The resulting disruption of Aboriginal life left an entrenched bitterness on the part of the Aboriginal people, which was exacerbated by the perception that they were despised as inferiors. It was a very good speech and, at the end, he and that is, again, went on to say: These issues tend to provoke bitter divisions in the Australian community, and reason, temperance and goodwill, rather than emotion, exaggeration and animosity, are required to resolve them. I think he is absolutely right. We will debate this legislation in this parliament, and there will be some of that emotion and exaggeration. We have already seen it. I am not berating members of the opposition because, other than the speech of the member for Melbourne Ports, who made some very good to points, I have not heard any of the other speeches. I mentioned the member for Oxley, and I definitely accuse her of emotion, exaggeration and every other decent adjective, I suppose, I can think of. But if we are going to resolve the problem as a parliament and as a nation then we must do so with reason, temperance and goodwill. I happen to think that it is in our nation's absolute best interest to resolve the issue. I accept what the member for Melbourne Ports says, that lawyers and courts may continue to argue, but for my part I think that this legislation furthers the process, and I support it for that reason. I hope that I have made it very clear in my remarks to this House today that, as a conservative member of this place, I understand-and the understanding has not come easily-the importance of reconciliation with our Aboriginal people. (Time expired)",62
32,Mr MCMULLAN,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"Canberra) (1.37 p.m.)It is very interesting when one comes into this place to speak about what is unquestionably a matter of genuine national importance that, even when we disagree about the bill, we can often find many members on both sides of the House who agree on many of the issues that need to be addressed in its approach. I find myself in the pleasant circumstance of saying to the member for MCPherson (Mr Bradford) that, while I disagree with his detailed views about the Native Title Amendment Bill, I endorse many of the remarks he made in his second reading contribution. It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to stand up and say that. There were many principled points he articulated which should be shared by the overwhelming majority of the House, and I welcome that. The problem for me is that, while this is unquestionably a matter of profound national importance, we have here a bill dealing with issues that go to the very integrity and moral and spiritual core of this nation, and to the interests of the most underprivileged members of this nation--our indigenous people. But, in my view, we approach the bill within a flawed context because of its shortcomings. It is a necessary bill; a bill had to be introduced to respond to the High Court decision on Wik, just as a bill had to be introduced to respond to the High Court decision on Mabo-the original Native Title Act. I do not believe, and the opposition does not believe, that this bill comprehensively or adequately responds to all the aspects of Wik, and I support the comprehensive amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans). He makes it clear in the amendment that the opposition acknowledges that there are aspects of the bill which may advance many of the objectives that we share in common, in particular by encouraging and assisting the entering into of agreements and by setting a stricter regime for the registration of claims. However, there are a number of other concerns that we have. We have been asked by the whips not to use the full 20 minutes, to enable as many colleagues as possible to speak to this. I will try to accommodate myself to that requirement. In the all too brief time allocated for discussion of this very important legislation, I want to particularly focus on clauses 7(0 and (g) of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition's amendment, those that relate particularly to the issue of the right to negotiate. I regard it as a very important issue. It is central to this whole debate and brings into sharp focus the essence of the difference between the opposition and the government on the issue of native title. In so doing, it will also point up some of the contrasts in approach that flow through into other legislation and how similar conceptual differencessimilar important differences of fundamental approach to the concerns of Australians and to the reconciliation of differences between Australians in different circumstances-need to be addressed. I cannot help but pause to reflect for a moment on the advice from the Australian Law Reform Commission, which we now have the benefit of, despite-it must be said-the very best efforts of the government to cover it up. The detail of that advice is emerging and becoming more apparent to the public. I do not want to waste too much time discussing the shabby circumstances surrounding the attempt to cover up that advice. The people of Australia can and will make their own judgments about that and about a government which goes out of its way to seek to ensure that an advice by the country's leading law reform body is not provided to members of the parliament to assist them in their deliberation on this bill. It is a government which sought to make sure that it had the opportunity to assess that advice but, when it did not like the advice, it sought to make sure that the parliament and the people of Australia never knew that the advice existed. It is, I must say, a wonderful irony-and it happens so often in our democracy-that the incompetent way that the government has gone about trying to cover up the Law Reform Commission's advice has given greater profile and status to that advice, which otherwise might have gone essentially unremarked. It is a profile and status that that advice warrants on its merits. It is very important advice from the Australian Law Reform Commission. It offers some very damning criticisms of this bill. The most damning indictment offered is contained in the following paragraph. I do not wish to do it an injustice by summarising it. I will read the paragraph in full: The Commission believes that, not only are the declared objectives mutually inconsistent-in particular, competing notions of the preservation native title and the validation and confirmation by way of purported extinguishment of native title, of prior grants of property rights-but also that the proposed means by which they are to be achieved are inadequate and counterproductive. A more devastating critique of a piece of legislation is hard to imagine. What the commission is saying is that the bill is flawed in two fundamental respects. It is flawed in its ends and it is flawed in the means which it seeks to use to achieve those ends. What an achievement! What a sorry reflection of incompetence-flawed in its means as well as in its ends. But, far more importantly, what a serious problem for the future of good governance of the nation, for our hopes of reconciliation and for the legitimate expectations of the indigenous peoples of this country to a say in the use of the land in which they have legally recognised property rights. It is these legitimate expectations on which I wish to focus today, because it is these that are central to the right to negotiate which is presently so important a part of the Native Title Act; The opposition understands and accepts the importance of the right to negotiate. We start from a fundamentally different premise than the government when it comes to recognition of native title rights. As a number of my colleagues who have spoken before me have highlighted, we recognise the notion that native title is a fundamental legal property right recognised by the common law of this country which is entitled to the same respect and protection as other property rights recognised by the common law. The contrast with the government could not be more stark. They refuse to accept that native title is a fundamental legal property right; rather they see it as an intrusion or an encumbrance or an obstacle to the exercise of other property rights not peculiar to nonindigenous Australians. In essence, the government regards native title rights as illegitimate, and that is a great indictment of the government. It is a failure of vision; it is a failure to understand what a strong, united Australia in the 21st century fundamentally requires. But at least it does allow us to of understand why it is that the government is proposing such a wholesale restriction and, in some cases, removal of the right to negotiate. We regard-and I personally regard-the right to negotiate as a necessary and important aspect of common law native title rights. The right to negotiate gives practical effect to native title rights. It gives the prospective holders of native title rights a say in the future use of the property to which their native title rights attach. This is of fundamental importance. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition put it succinctly in his second reading speech when he said that the right to negotiate: . . . amounts to a legitimate form of economic empowerment of a group of Australians who have been spectacularly denied respect and a capacity to advance themselves economically through just about the whole 200-plus years of Australian history. In other words, the right to negotiate is a legitimate means to restore some. balance to a relationship which would otherwise be significantly imbalanced; a relationship which pits long recognised traditional common law rights of property against newly recognised right- of property, which because of the attitude of the coalition and their fellow travellers are struggling for broader acceptance, and a relationship which pits the economic power of mining and pastoral interests against the moral power of indigenous rights to their traditional lands. It comes. as no surprise to me· that the government is blind to the need to redress power imbalance because, in my principal responsibility as shadow minister for industrial relations, this is an issue that I have confronted on many occasions. The government's Workplace Relations Act is also blind to this power imbalance relationship-the relationship between the employer and the employee at work. That power relationship, which is also of profound importance to the way our society works, is similarly misunderstood by this conservative government. On this side of the House, the members have shown by their response and instinctive recognition that the relationship between employer and employee is fundamentally weighted in favour of the employer. Therefore, we see the need to provide employees with fundamental rights to redress this imbalance: the right to bargain collectively, the right to access the Industrial Relations Commission and the right to have wages and conditions protected by an effective award system. But the government is blind to this. They start from the flawed assumption that employees at work are capable of representing their own interests before their employer and that they do not need these rights. That is why they have introduced an act which so fundamentally undermines these rights. It is the same myopic view which explains why they have introduced this bill, which systematically undermines the right to negotiate enjoyed by indigenous Australians. It flows from the same fundamental misunderstanding of the differential power relationships that exist not just in Australian society but in free society. Make no mistake: undermining the right to negotiate is precisely what this bill will do. The scale is unprecedented. The Law Institute of Victoria has identified numerous instances in which this bill removes or restricts the right to negotiate in specific cases; for example, the reduction in the period allowed for negotiation and in the period during which arbitration must take place, the removal of the right to negotiate at both the exploration and the production stages of mining development, the provision to exclude non-exclusive areas on the basis that states and territories will provide suitable alternative this procedures, the provision to exclude mining renewals from the right to negotiate, the widening of the exclusion in relation to private construction of infrastructure facilities and the exclusion in relation to future mining acts. Needless to say, the Law Institute of Victoria comes to the damning conclusion that these provisions of the bill undermine and contravene common law principles in relation to native title. The now infamous Law Reform Commission advice also reserves some harsh criticism for the bill's attack on the right to negotiate. The commission does a devastating job of destroying the government's whole rationale for the proposed changes. It then concludes that the right to negotiate provisions in the bill are detrimental to native title holders. That goes to the whole question of constitutionality, which I do not have time to address but which goes to the core of the Law Reform Commission's and the opposition's criticism of this legislation. Its inherent probable unconstitutionality makes the situation more uncertain rather than less. What an indictment against the government. Its own law reform agency has categorically concluded that the government is proposing to act to the detriment of indigenous Australians- No wonder the government tried so desperately to gag the commission. No wonder it has acted so stridently to cover up the commission's advice. There are many other aspects of the legislation that warrant equal or more detailed consideration than the right to negotiate any provision to which I have referred. But, with 20 and more of my colleagues choosing to speak on this, and with pressure from the whips-quite understandable and proper in this instance-that we do not speak for too long so that many of our colleagues can speak, I will restrict myself to a focus on those two aspects of the amendments proposed by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, endorse his and the leader's remarks in response to the bill as a whole and support the amendments. I hope that the amendment is passed by the House. I hope also that, by the time the parliament as a whole has concluded its consideration of this very important piece of legislation, we have a more adequate, comprehensive package that responds to the High Court's decision in Wik in a way that preserves the core principles of the Mabo No.2 decision and the Wik decision of the High Court, recognises the rights of indigenous Australians as well as the rights of miners and pastoralists and gives us that certainty and that fairness of outcome that properly constituted legislation in response to Wik can and should achieve.",63
33,Mrs STONE,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"This move to debate the Native Title Amendment Bill 1997, amending the Native Title Act 1993, is of enormous significance in the history of Australia's evolution. These amendments will bring us to the stage where not only do the Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders have their status and rights as the previous owners of the land acknowledged in law but that law will be made workable. Once amended, this legislation can do the job that was originally intended. It can become the vehicle for the delivery of some native title indigenous people where acts of title extinguishment have not occurred over the years of closer settlement. As it stands, the act has been nothing more than a mirage, a cruel hoax that promised so much and delivered so very little. After nearly four years and with 612 applications covering 45 per cent of Australia lodged, not one native title has been delivered through the workings of the act. No-one would deny that the previous government had very good intentions when it tried to translate the Mabo 2 judgments into legislation. However, that government's workmanship and its attention to detail was shoddy; it was badly advised. The process of registering, evaluating and granting native title should have been an important part of the reconciliation process for all Australians. Instead, the problems with this act have heightened the cynicism in nonindigenous Australians, in the community as a whole. The act in its current form has pitted one indigenous group against another. The genuine claimants find themselves competing in what I would call a compensation driven frenzy, as dozens of other claimants try to negotiate with those same mining companies. Tragically, references to secret women's business and 'how to pick a sacred site' are now standard in stand-up comedy and office party routines. It is 30 years since Vincent Lingiari led his Gurindji countrymen into history, as he withdrew their labour in a demand for better pay and land rights. Thirty years should have been enough to redress past wrongs. However, today we debate amendments to the 1993 act because we still have not got it right. It is important at this time to pause to acknowledge all the contributions, and reflect on the long and bitter struggle, of generations of indigenous and non-indigenous Australians who laid the foundations for the recognition of the survival of some native title. They had the persistence which ultimately led to the High Court victory for Eddie Mabo. The Aboriginal land rights movement evolved in line with Aboriginal demands for full citizenship rights, decent wages and work conditions, and self-determination. The pleas to for recognition of land rights began long ago. For example, on 5 July 1882, a deputation of Aboriginal community leaders presented a memorial to their member, Mr Alfred Deakin, in the great hall of Victoria's parliament house. They asked to be released from the jurisdiction of the Aboriginal Protection Board and they wanted security of tenure for the lands they farmed at Coranderrk. The media report in The Leader on 15 July-that was a Melbourne newspaper at the timespent many of its column inches marvelling at the formal morning dress, the decent English and the dignified demeanour of those presenting their case to one of Australia's greatest' statesmen. The journalist wondered: Where is the restless, furtive, hunted look about eyes, which we are wont to regard as one of the most characteristic of aboriginal features,. and as a sure index of the aboriginal nature? The deputation's request for self-determination and land tenure was denied. The memorialists were told by the chief colonial secretary that they 'must go back and make the best of it' . The commentator witnessing this exchange was moved to write in his editorial a few days later, in 1882 in Melbourne in Victoria: Such is the case of the poor blackfellows of Coranderrk; and we may state our conviction that did the public but thoroughly understand it, theythe memorialistswould not have much longer to wait before getting (what they want). The public, we believe, would recognise the great principle involved, that the blacks have rights which we are bound to respect, and that to allow them to be deprived of their rights would be a lasting stain upon the whole community. William Cooper, Sir Douglas Nichols, the people of Cumeragundja and many others like them spent the first decades of this century trying to gain security of tenure over the land they farmed on reserves or where they squatted in fringe camps in towns and cities throughout Australia. Spurred on by the US Indian Lands Development Act, they knew their circumstances could be different. Before the 1960s the battle for rights to land focused on eastern Australia, but in the 1960s it turned to the areas where traditional Aboriginal culture still held sway, in northern Australia. In 1963 the Yirrkala in Arnhem Land faced the excision of some 140 square kilometres of their reservation lands. A bauxite mine was to be established in the area. The now famous bark petitions were submitted to this federal parliament. There was widespread media attention. The time had come for the first official inquiry into land rights in Australia to be established. In 1967, when most of us here were still teenagers, Vincent Lingiari put down his stock whip and led his people quietly away from their work at Wave Hill Station. The first demand articulated was for a decent living wage but, as the mainstream media the began to focus on the novel events in this remote comer, they found Vince was determined to lead the community in a long and bitter fight to obtain title to their traditional home country, an area largely under lease to pastoralist Lord Vestey. While the Gurindji continued on strike, camped in the heart of their traditional lands at Wattie Creek, the long awaited Northern Territory High Court judgment on the Yirrkala people's challenge to the excision of their land was brought down. It was the summer of 1972. Mr Justice Blackburn's ruling acknowledged that the Aborigines had a spiritual link to their land but rejected the contention that this involved a property or economic relationship. Thus, Justice Blackburn argued that there was no capacity within Australian common law or property law to recognise indigenous rights to the land. Debate interrupted.",66
34,Mr SPEAKER,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"Order! It being 2 p.m"" the debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order lOlA. The debate may be resumed at a later hour and the member will have leave to continue speaking when the debate is resumed. FLANAGAN, MR BRIAN",67
35,Mr SPEAKER,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL,"We have in the gallery this afternoon a much loved member of our staff. Brian Flanagan has worked in the Department of the House of Representatives since 1966. He started as an attendant and, as part of the regular duties of attendants, worked in the department's transport office. He was later appointed to work permanently in that office. Brian has decided on a change of direction and leaves the department tomorrow. Brian's contribution in the transport office has been valued by members and their staff. Indeed, only yesterday a member sent a card which said, in part, that Brian only knew how to say one word- 'yes' - to members' requests and that perhaps he did not know or understand the word 'no'. This is a testament to the kind of person Brian is and to the way in which he serves the parliament by assisting members with their travel requests. Even under great pressure, when sittings have been changed at short notice and flights and car bookings have had to have been changed, Brian has remained calm and courteous and he has dealt with the aggravation of getting members home as expeditiously as possible. Brian is not a person who takes change lightly. He has lived in the same home in Queanbeyan for over 30 years. His 16-yearold Kingswood functions on autopilot between Queanbeyan and Parliament House, where you can almost set the clock by his early start times. He has some projects in mind for his retirement. He is planning renovations to the house and checking out new cars to replace the Kingswood. I hope that Brian's expertise will be not lost to the department and that there may be an opportunity for Brian to make a contribution in the future. Brian, all members sincerely thank you for your assistance over the many years of service that you have given the House, and I am sure all members join me in wishing you wealth, health and happiness in the future.",67
36,Mr BEAZLEY,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL," Mr Speaker, on indulgence, could I add my remarks to yours. There is no doubt at all that Brian's services to several generations of the people in this chamber are very well known. He has been an outstanding servant of this parliament. It is a useful thing that we have a forum like this in which to thank those who serve us so well and to place our thanks on the record for the public to see. Brian is deserving of every accolade which you extended to him.",68
37,Mr HOWARD,NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT BILL," Mr Speaker, I join with you and the Leader of the Opposition in expressing, on behalf of government members, my gratitude to Brian for what he has done over a very long period of time. This place and its predecessor place would not have functioned effectively and harmoniously so far as the convenience of members was concerned without the very dedicated service of many staff over a long period of time. To have rendered that service over a period of 30 years in the way in which Brian has done is something for which we are very grateful. I wish Brian and his family every happiness in the years ahead of them. Honourable members-Hear, hear! NA Native Title: Australian Law Reform Commission",68
38,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his second supplementary answer on the Australian Law Reform Commission yesterday, when he said that he had received in August a minute containing the following paragraph: The Australian Law Reform Commission has submitted a critical submission addressing supposed breaches of international treaty obligations and questioning the constitutional basis of the legislation. Prime Minister, when precisely was that minute brought to you or your office's attention and by whom? Given that you have delayed the return to order in the Senate until after question time today, can you advise this House whether your search in response to that order has turned up further documents which make your second supplementary answer yesterday on this matter incomplete or incorrect?",68
39,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"In relation to the Leader of the Opposition's question, the document was brought to my attention yesterday. I am not aware of any other documents. I have asked that further searches be carried out; if there is anything further, I will let the House know as appropriate. I take the opportunity of saying that, lest the Leader of the Opposition thinks that he has lighted upon something, the second supplementary answer that I gave to the Leader of the Opposition's question in no way alters the substance of this issue. The substance of this issue is that the Attorney-General of the Commonwealth has acted correctly at all times. What matters is the substance. The substance is that there was no reference on these matters to the Australian Law Reform Commission. It has long been the situation that the Australian Law Reform Commission acts on references. Therefore, I do not know what the Leader of the Opposition is really getting excited about. Family Tax Initiative",68
40,Mr SLIPPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is also addressed to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, have you seen recent reports which have confirmed that the coalition's family tax initiative is helping those families who need it most? How much better off will a low income family be under the family tax initiative? Does this confirm that the coalition government is the only government to have brought true benefits to Aussie battlers?",69
41,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question. I take the opportunity of reminding the House of the enormous benefits to Australian families of the coalition's family tax initiative. That initiative, worth $1 billion of tax relief to Australian families, is a very generous, well targeted initiative which was delivered in full, on time, without deduction, in accordance with the undertaking that had been given by me on behalf of the coalition parties during the election campaign. As members will be aware, under this initiative the government increased the tax-free threshold by $1,000 a child for families on incomes up to $70,000. The family tax initiative also provides additional benefits for single income families. If these families earn below $65,000 a year and have at least one child under the age of five, they are eligible for a further increase in their tax-free threshold of $2,500. This income cut-out also increases by $3,000 for each additional dependent child. This, as I know honourable members on the government side will be aware, translates to a $500 a year increase in disposable income for single income families. The most recent piece of information about this initiative has come to my attention in the past few days. It comes out of a recent presentation at the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling, known as NCSEM. Dr Lawrence interjecting",69
42,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I notice the member for Fremantle is interjecting about NCSEM. I am glad the member for Fremantle has interjected. She might like to interject on this observation of the presentation. It is particularly important for those in the parliament-and most of them are on my side of the Housewho really do represent the average Australian and represent battling Australian families. This is what the presentation had to say, and it makes very interesting reading against the class posturing of those who sit behind the Leader of the Opposition. It said: The overall impact of the measure was progressive as the largest gains in percentage terms were received by the families in the lowest private family income deciles. In other words, what the NCSEM presentation was saying was that this was a measure deliberately and successfully targeted to help the low income section of the Australian community. In other words, it was a progressive, pro-battler tax initiative. It was not a measure designed to help either the big end of town or those people who are able to look after themselves. I think the Australian Labor Party should ponder that presentation, seeing that it tried to destroy the superannuation tax surcharge. What was itMr Costello-Senator Sherry!",69
43,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Senator Sherry rolled the Leader of the Opposition on that, didn'the? The NCSEM finding also contained a damning indictment of the former Labor government. NCSEM said that the bottom 30 per cent of working families with dependent children had lower private family incomes in 1993-94 than they had in 1981-82. On both surveys the Labor Party loses out very badly. Not only is our measure seen as a pro-battler, progressive taxation initiative but the comparison of disposable family incomes for the low income deciles of the Australian community compare very badly in terms of the Labor years against 1981-82, the last full financial year of the Fraser government. Native Title: Australian Law Reform Commission",69
44,Mr MELHAM,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Attorney-General and Minister for Justice. What was the exact date that the Attorney-General or his office became aware that a submission had been made to the Wik task force by the Australian Law Reform Commission? Who brought it to your or your office's attention? Did you or your office have any communication with the Prime Minister or his office before you wrote to Mr Rose of the Law Reform Commission on 28 August making clear your displeasure at the sending of that submission? If so, what was .the nature of that communication?",69
45,Mr WILLIAMS,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,This continues to be much ado about nothing. The answer to the first question is that I cannot tell you precise13 ly what the date was but I know the occasion. I ran into a member of the Wik task force in the lounge at Sydney airport and she told me. That was the first I knew of it after it had been lodged. I had no communication with the Prime Minister or his office prior to writing the letter of 28 August. Aged Care,70
46,Mr RANDALL,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister inform the House of the benefits of the government's aged care reforms which took effect yesterday, 1 October?",70
47,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I say in reply to the honourable member that the reforms to the aged care sector which have been carried out by this government and for which I warmly thank the Minister for Family Services are changes and reforms that were long overdue. They are changes and reforms which the Labor opposition have done their level best to misrepresent and about which they have done their level best to create a campaign of fear amongst elderly people within the Australian community. I want to make it very plain to the House that these reforms will inject a much needed amount of additional capital into Australian nursing homes. Most importantly, the model that has been used in these reforms is essentially the model that was followed by the Keating Labor government. It is absolutely hypocritical of those who sit opposite and who have nothing better to do than to run around scaring older people when, in reality, we are applying a proper income test, we are allowing very generous exemptions, and we are doing what is necessary to rebuild the infrastructure of aged accommodation in Australia. If we followed the rantings of those who sat opposite, we would be condemning old Australians to rapidly deteriorating and dilapidated buildings. We would be condemning many Australians to buildings that did not meet adequate health and other standards laid down by the appropriate authorities in the Australian community. For example, the quality of nursing homes in this country after years of Labor was such that the Department of Health and Family Services recently found that around 300 homes may not meet the standards required to charge accommodation bonds. Are those who sit opposite seriously suggesting that those 300 homes got into that condition in the last 15 months? The reality is that, after 13 years, that was the neglected state of the aged accommodation sector that we have inherited. The easy and cheap political thing to have done would have been to have squibbed it and ignored it, which you did in the final years that you were in government. Of course it is easy to run a scare campaign. It is easy to get photographs in newspapers about elderly people. But if you had any sense of responsibility and any skerrick of decency about this sector, you would recognise that it is necessary to get money into it and that it is necessary to address the declining state of the infrastructure of the aged accommodation sector. I am very proud of the changes that my government has enacted. in this area. The objectives of those changes would be to improve the quality of nursing home buildings. We have provided appropriate fundingin fact, in many areas we have increased it for dementia care. We have guaranteed higher funding of up to $12 a resident a day for homes which care for financially disadvantaged people, and we have provided increased support for people in rural and remote areas. This is the sort of reform that it is easy to squib if you are a gutless government, and it is the sort of reform that was squibbed by the former government. It is not a reform that we have squibbed. We have tackled it with courage. We have laid the foundation for expansions in this area. I believe it will be seen in the years ahead as a very significant reform in the aged accommodation sector. Nursing Homes",70
48,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Minister for Family Services. Minister, are you aware that i- is day two and Phillip House, a nursing home in Sydney, is charging $60,000 for a one-bed room, $40,000 for a two-bed room, and $26,000 for a room with three or more beds in it?",71

61,Mrs DRAPER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Acting Minister for Administrative Services. I refer the minister to last night's press release from the Leader of the Opposition dealing with Senator Sherry's travel claims. Has the leader accurately set out travel allowance entitlements for office-holders of the opposition?,71
62,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question. The statement that the honourable member was referring to is the opposition leader's attempt last night to shore up his colleague Senator Sherry . Yesterday I commented on the senator's claims, particularly on the issue of a capital city. I have confirmed with my department that my comthis not a fourments were accurate. In relation to the travel allowance, it is expected that the system will be treated with honesty and integrity. As I said yesterday, it is up to the senator to justify to taxpayers why he had been claiming up to $320 a night rather than $165 to stay with his mother in Opossum Bay, nearly 50 kilometres from Hobart. It is. not as if he stayed there once or twice. He did so up to 140 nights. Mr Bevis-It is better than Sharpie; at least he was there. Mrs Crosio- Mr Sharp was in Queanbeywhen he claimed to be here",71
63,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,What was his business in Opossum Bay? Mrs Crosio interjecting,71
64,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Senator Sherry claims that he has received advice from the Department of Administrative Services that he actions were approved.,71
65,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The minister will resume his seat. I invoke standing order 304A in respect of the member for Prospect. The honourable member for ProspeCt thereupon withdrew from the chamber.,71
66,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I have been advised that there was no record of any advice given that he had such approval. It is up to Senator Sherry to provide the evidence of the advice that he claims he was given that allowed him to make these claims. The senator has claimed, both in the media and in the Senate, that he abided by the guidelines. The Leader of the Opposition is now seeking to defend his colleague in relation to his colleague's position. Last night he issued a media release, attaching what he claims to be the relevant guidelines. We all know that there are different guidelines relating to and travel allowance claims. It is perfectly obvious why there are different allowances. It is expected that people who are staying in a capital city may incur expenses which are to be recouped through a capital city allowance, which is much larger than would ordinarily apply if you were in more remote and rural areas. In the case of the car allowance, I am sure members and senators know-many living, as they do, in electorates beyond cities and suburbs-that they need transport to meet their parliamentary commitments. The Leader of the Opposition, with advice perhaps, scoured through all the guidelines, and found and used a definition of capital city that obviously suited them. He was wrong on two counts. The definition he chose relates to car entitlements and not travel allowance. The definition he chose relates to senators and members, not officeholders. I want to table the relevant documents. The first is a press release by the Leader of the Opposition, which included this document entitled Senators and Members Entitlements Online. Definitions. The complete section of the document he used, Senators and Members Entitlements Online, makes it clear that the section he used refers to car transport. Can I make that clear? It has a bold headline. You can take this off the computer.",71
67,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,That is not what comes up on the screen and you know that.,72
68,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The advice I have was printed off the computer. That is the document-referring to car transport-that came off the computer, printed online by my staff, as I am advised. The relevant extract is from-let me say this-the correct document for looking at office-holders' entitlements, because there is a separate one dealing with office-holders, and I table that dealing with office-holders. I was reminded that, if one wants to look at the Remuneration Tribunal, on page 15 of the 1996 Decisions and Reports, under the heading 'Remuneration Tribunal Determination No. 21', rates are set out, and definitions, and cars there is no definition associated with that issue contained in it. What that proves, I think, is that the Leader of the Opposition has done a cut and paste job. I would in other circumstances suggest that it was a doctored document. If it were done in this House, it would be a very serious matter of misleading the parliament. He has not done it in the House, but clearly he has been guilty of misleading the pUblic.",72
69,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I call the Leader of the Opposition.,72
70,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,You should resign.,72
71,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,The member for O'Connor! Government members-Resign!,72
72,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Members on my right! Travelling Allowance,72
73,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the same minister, and I am glad he noted that the office-holders book lists no definitions. In the light of the claims that have just been made, is the government now arguing that the Department of Administrative Services has multiple definitions of what is a capital city? If so, will the minister detail them and explain why this is the case? Is it not the fact that the travel section of the on-line guide to senators and members entitlements on MPs' computers contains only one definition of a capital city? The reference to the ABS I released. And are you arguing that it should be ignored for guidance merely because it regulates cars?",72
74,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yesterday I answered a question on this matter. I made it clear and I reaffirmed it today, and I checked with the department to ensure that the advice I gave to the House was accurate in every respect, that there is no definition of capital city for the purposes of that claim. I just reaffirmed that when I set out",72
75,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,So you ignore the guidelines?,72
76,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, you rely",73
77,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, you tell the truth.",73
78,Mr RUDDOCK,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You rely on the integrity and the honesty of the members. Let me make it abundantly clear-and I think any ordinary person listening to these matters would well and truly understand-that for allowance purposes, when you have to stay in a capital city where there are hotel expenses that are well beyond those charged in other places, there would be differential rates, and they would not expect a definition to be used which is used for car transport purposes which has been deliberately fashioned to meet the needs and requirements of members who live in their constituencies and often live in the regional areas close to our capitals. But that does not make them part of the capital; it makes them part of the area for which it is appropriate to provide transport to bring members to the parliament and for undertaking their parliamentary duties.",73
79,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, could I supplement the answer from the Acting Minister for Administrative Services and point out that the press release made by the Leader of the Opposition yesterday did not seek to draw on the on-line definition merely for the purposes of guidance. What his release actually said was: In accordance with this I have attached a print-out of the DAS on-line advice to members and senators And he went on to say-this is the crucial area of misleading of the Australian publicthis: . : . which includes the formal definition cIty for the purposes of travel allowance claims. In other words, you knowingly changed it. You are the Edward Scissorhands of Australian politics. You got hold of this definition and you deliberately set out to mislead the Australian public in a desperate attempt to defend. What you ought to do is require Senator Sherry's resignation and you ought to apologise forthwith to the Australian public for deliberately deceiving them. Productivity and Living Standards",73
80,Mr CHARLES,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer inform the House of the relationship between increased productivity and future Australian living standards?,73
81,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Productivity is a measure of output for any given amount of inputs. Productivity is what adds value and productivity is what actually creates wealth in the community. A recent Industry Commission research paper on Australia's productivity performance released last month shows that underlying annual productivity growth is now around two per cent, and it appears to have lifted recently above the long-term trend. The government believes that, if it is to improve competition in our markets, micro-economic reform will go towards allowing Australia to boost its productivity and to increase wealth in the community. As an illustration of productivity, I thought we might run the ruler over the opposition's performance in parliament this week to measure their productivity against the goals that they stated that they had at the opening of the week. Of course, it all starts with the member for Hotham, to whom we owe a great debt-the author of the latest little morals campaign on behalf of the Labor Party. He was asked on the Channel Nine Sunday program this question-the final issue: Is it true that files from the Department of Administrative Services computers on parliamentarians' travel and charter flights have been downloaded to the opposition via the Internet? Crean: Yes. And it is not the only way we have our information, Laurie. I mean I think it is amazingover the last 72 hours-the extent of the information that's come to us . of capital Just to clarify that, he is asked: You're saying that information from DAS computers was downloaded into your computers in opposition? And he goes: I neither confirm nor deny, Laurie. I simply say we've got a wealth of information. Later on: I said we're getting information from many sources. You can conclude from that what you like. I conclude from that that you do claim to have information downloaded from the DAS computers. You do not deny it; in fact, your first answer was yes. The parliamentary fence, as I said. The receiver of stolen information. The Arthur Daley of the Australian Labor Party. On Sunday, of course, when he was asked about Senator Nick Sherry's claims and why they were so high, he said, 'Oh, Senator Nick Sherry doesn't have a home.' Poor old Nick Sherry. He becomes the Bedouin from Burnie pitching his tent across the north-west coast of Tasmania. But it gets curiouser and curiouser, because although it appears that Senator Nick Sherry did not have a home on Sunday, by Monday he had one, and it was his office or his office was his home or his home was his office. By day the Bedouin of Burnie but, by night, nocturnally, he is just the home-town boy going home to mum at Opossum Bay-the Boogie-Woogie Bugle Boy from Opossum Bay, he becomes known as. When that'becomes known and the Opposition Leader is asked to comment on Senator Sherry, rather than actually discipline Senator Sherry he engages in this extraordinary attempt to try to claim that Opossum Bay is a capital city, Hobart, and that you need $300 to stay in Opossum Bay-presumably because accommodation costs are great. There is no hotel in Opossum Bay; there is not even a motel in Opossum Bay. Then he produces this press release which uses a definition for car transport. He says in his release that this is the definition of 'capicase. tal city' for the purposes of travel allowance-completely false. When you look at the attachment, you can see that the bit making it clear that it was in relation to car allowance Batman! has been cut off the top of the definition before it was photocopied and put out. Can you see what we are dealing with now? Edward Scissorhands-you know, cutting off the top and putting it out. The Leader of the Opposition said on Sunday that he would have the courage to deal with these people; he said that he would have the courage to deal with Senator Sherry-but he did not. The big question today is: can the Leader of the Opposition show any leadership on this issue? The mark of his leadership will be the disciplining of Senator Sherry. If he cannot sack Senator Sherry, he should go. NA",73

83,Ms HANSON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is to the Treasurer. On 28 October 1996, the Sydney Morning Herald quoted Mr Jim Killaly, Assistant Commissioner of the Australian Taxation Office, as saying, 'The figures show most multinationals pay little or no tax.' As the majority of corporate Australia is in foreign hands and the lack of equity in our taxation system is a concern for all Australians, can you confirm whether Mr Killaly's statement is true and, if so, what has the government done to correct this awful inequity since this information was made broadly public nearly a year ago? Mr Martin Ferguson-Does she want to close down Toyota?",74
84,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"First of all, I just want to answer the proposition. I think you said that a majority of or most corporations were foreign-owned in Australia. That is not the The fact of the matter is that we want to encourage foreign investment in this country.",74

Do you want to throw Mitsubishi out of the country? These are jobs-these are jobs for Australians. We want foreign investment in this country. Foreign investment that creates jobs for Australians is a good thing. So, Australian ownership is good and foreign investment is welcome in this country. In relation to taxation, foreign corporations in this country pay the tax that they are assessed under the laws of this country. When you produce figures like that, they invariably show low taxation rates because there might be, for example, negative gearing in relation to that or depreciation in relation to thatwhich Australian companies can claim as well as a foreign corporation. This government is serious about making sure that corporationsand, indeed, individuals-pay their fair share of tax. Let me tell you some of the measures that we have introduced-I hope you supported them. One of them, of course, was the announcement in the recent budget of the changes in relation to foreign source income. We have changed the rules in relation to foreign source income so that, in relation to passive income, you are not treated as an equal country, except New Zealand and the G7 countries with comparable taxation regimes. That was done to tighten up taxation in relation to international tax agreements. We introduced changes in relation to withholding tax to cover royalty payments as well, because it was becoming clear that interest payments could be dressed up as royalty payments and would escape the scope of the interest withholding tax arrangements. We introduced those matters to make sure that corporations are paying a fair share of tax. Australia took the lead in holding a joint symposium between APEC and the OECD to discuss transfer pricing. Australia is considered to be one of the leaders in this area. Whilst the OECD has guidelines in relation to taxation, they are not well known in the APEC countries. So we had a symposium, which I opened, in Sydney last year dealing with international taxation arrangements to to discuss comparable arrangements around the region. There are a lot of people who think, probably, we are too strict in relation to these things, because we are one of the strictest countries. This has been one of the most active governments. There is always going to be a trade-off in relation to taxation and investment. We want to make sure that foreign corporations pay their fair share. We also want to make this a good place to do business for foreign investors. There is always going to be those two competing equity balances which this government is going to make sure that we keep balanced when we are taking economic decisions that are in the interests of all Australians. They are the principles that guide us. Our record is an active one. This government stands tall in relation to tax avoidance. Do I need to remind the House about the measures we took in relation to R&D syndicates? Do I need· to remind the House that this was the government that took on superannuation surcharges? Do I need to remind the House that this was the government that took on dividend streaming, that this was the government that dealt with the trading of franking credits. This was another area in which we tightened taxation: the trading of franking credits, which are of no use to income exempts or outside the country. So we put in place measures after discussion with business after the last election to address it. This is a program that all Australians can and should be proud of and this is an active government. Telstra",74
91,Mr EOIN CAMERON,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Finance. Can the minister assure the House and the people of Australia that in the forthcoming sale of one-third of Telstra the highest priority will be given to ensuring that as many Australians as possible will be given the opportunity to purchase shares?,75
92,Mr FAHEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Stirling for his question. I have noted in recent days there has been some try newspaper speculation which indicates that there may be a limit placed upon large inves; tors in respect of the Telstra issue. I noted . that the Age carried a headline yesterday, I think it was, which said 'Big Telstra investors face limit'. I can confirm to the House that the Age got it right: big investors will face some limits in respect of the Telstra issue. The government has made a decision to put an upper limit in the broker firm allocations for each individual client. That upper limit is likely to be in the range of 5,000 to .10,000 shares for each individual client of a broker firm. I want to confirm that by making that decision the government is again giving a clear massage to the people of Australia that it regards the Telstra offer as a people's float, a people's privatisation, and we are determined to give as many Australians as possible, the mums and dads of Australia, the opportunity to purchase shares in this company, the opportunity to invest in a great Australian company, in a very exciting area which has considerable growth in it. Further, the government is determined to ensure there is a spread of shares in all parts of Australia. I am sure the honourable member for Stirling would appreciate the fact that the government has appointed an independent accountant. That independent accountant is to advise on the broker applications. The criteria that will be used is to ensure that brokers right around Australia, including brokers that service the honourable member's electorate of Stirling, brokers in Perth, in Adelaide and in like cities, are given an allocation to ensure that there is a spread of these shares on offer to the public in all parts of Australia. In addition to that, when the brokers apply for an allocation of shares they will be required to indicate to the independent accountant just what shares they are prepared to give to the Financial Planners Association of Australia to ensure again that the spread occurs. I am sure all honourable members would know that there are several hundred members of the Financial Planners Association spread throughout Australia. They are in towns like Ballarat, Bendigo, Toowoomba and Townsville, not capital cities. Last year investments through the Financial Planners Association of Australia in shares amounted to something like $16 billion. The further point I want to make is that, whilst the offer document indicates that· the minimum level of shares will be 400, or 600 if someone reserved the offer document through the guarantee that applies there, I want to assure the House that this will not become a de facto maximum level. In the event that the offer is oversubscribed· and a scaling back of applications is necessary, that scale back· that does occur will be weighted to ensure that small invest0rs receive as close as possible the number of shares that they applied for. There is significant enthusiasm in respect of this particular offer, as has been evidenced by the media in the past few days. What that translates to in terms of applications remains to be seen over the next few weeks. Again, I assure the House that the government is inclined to ensure in the allocation of shares in this offer that the ordinary Australian, the mums and dads, will be accommodated. We are not about simply looking after the big investors in this country. In the manner in which we put this issue together, it will certainly be about ordinary Australians and the rules will ensure that occurs. Nursing Homes",75
93,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is directed to the Minister for Family Services. What is the minister's reaction to this case brought to my attention this morning? It .concerns a family who yesterday had sought admission for their mother to a nursing home in Melbourne. When told the entry fee was $90,000 and being faced with having to sell their family home, they decided to take their mother home, even though a nurse at the nursing home believes the woman must have proper nursing care. Why has the government put this family in such a terrible situation? Opposition members-Resign, resign!",76
94,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! Order!,76
95,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They wish. I have absolutely no doubt at all that the shadow minister will keep trotting out these particular cases for many months to come. In fact I have no doubt either that many of them will be fed to her from the New South Wales government, the Labor government, who have failed miserably to deliver decent health and aged care systems in that state. Ms Macklin- Mr Speaker, on a point of order that goes to relevance: this is a specific case from a nurse in Melbourne.",76
96,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order! There is no point of order. Resume your seat.,77
97,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Let me reassure the House that, if the shadow minister can produce evidence of nursing homes and hostels not abiding by the law which came into effect yesterday and that are not abiding by the strict requirements that are laid down for establishments to charge bonds, I want to know about that and I want that evidence because the Commonwealth will take action against them, as the law provides. Furthermore, let me clarify the allegations of the shadow minister that it was okay-I am sorry that the member for Prospect has left this place; she needs to be listening to this answer because she clearly does not understand what her own government's policy was in the last 10 years when they were in government-for Labor, when they were in government, to charge bonds in hostels because-wait for it!-people who go into hostels are there because they make a choice to be there. That is what she said on radio this morning. The truth is this",77
98,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,77
99,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Why don't you listen for a change. You might learn something.,77
100,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,77
101,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Why don't you listen? Do you want to know the answer or don't you? The truth is that less than 10 per cent of residents in hostels are there by choice-less than 10 per cent. They go into hostels because they have social housing needs-the 10 per cent that are there by choice. That is why they are in hostels: they have social housing needs. They do not want to be living by themselves; they feel insecure. That reflects the failure of the previous Labor government to develop appropriate housing options for elderly people in the wider communitysomething we have now begun to consider and are working on so that we can ensure that people will have appropriate choices. There are thousands of people in hostels today who are not there by choice; they are there because they are either mentally or physically frail or a combination of both, and most of them are not capable of managing their own affairs. That is the fact. This did not stop the opposition from introducing entry contributions in 1988. Why are they now concerned about extending the measures of this system to nursing homes? Their criticism is nothing but hypocrisy and scaremongering of the very worse kind. As always, access under our legislation to care facilities will be determined not on somebody's ability to pay but on their clinically assessed need to enter a hostel or nursing home. Those in opposition that argue for the continuation of the existing system by default condemn residents to a continuation of the failed Labor system. Immunisation",77
102,Mr LINDSAY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,My question is addressed to the Minister for Health and Family Services. Can the minister inform the House of plans for Australia's second national immunisation day? What has been the response to the first immunisation day?,77
103,Dr WOOLDRIDGE,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. We had the first national immunisation day on 2 August. It was something new for Australia. We had not tried it before. We were pleased with the results. We got every state and territory holding immunisation sites around their region. I am pleased to inform the House and the honourable member that the most successful site in Australia was in Townsville at the Willows shopping centre. That is in no small part due to the great work that the member for Herbert put in promoting the immunisation day. I congratulate him for it and I congratulate Townsville. On 2 August, 140 people were able to be vaccinated at this one site who would have otherwise missed out and, further, another 20 people turned up to check their immunisation status. By linking into the Childhood Immunisation Register they were able to find out that it actually was not necessary. We are holding the second immunisation day on Saturday. Again, it will be right around Australia and also in Townsville. I encourage people who are concerned about whether or not their kids are properly immunised and whether or not they are properly immunised to tum up at one of these sites. We are going to have promotions in conjunction with them. We are getting some fabulous support from Westfield shopping centres. We are going to advertise in local newspapers and on radio. The lessons we learn from this we will incorporate into our third immunisation day that we are going to hold in early December. Hunter Valley Industrial Dispute",77
104,Mr BOB BALDWIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Thank you, Mr Speaker. Ms Macklin-Oh, Mr Speaker. . Mr BOB BALDWIN-You were a bit slow on the jump. My question is addressed to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. Is the minister aware of the CFMEU's planned 72-hour period of industrial action across the New South Wales coal industry and the attempt by the New South Wales Labor Premier to play a role in the strike? Can the minister inform the House as to why the CFMEU and the Premier have only succeeded in damaging the economy of the New South Wales regional areas?",78
105,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the member for his question, The Labor Party was a bit slow on the jump but is quick on the take when the opportunity is there. I thank the member for his question.",78
106,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,They're good with the paste too.,78
107,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"They are good with the paste and the scissors. The latest developments in the coal industry in New South Wales are important and should be reflected on. As members will be aware, there has been a long-running dispute at the Hunter Valley No. 1 mine, and we have seen an attempt by the CFMEU to try to spread that dispute to a range of other coal mines in New South Wales. In the last 24 hours they have in fact announced this planned much wider industrial disruption. In response to that attempt by the CFMEU and the Labor Party to try to widen this dispute, applications have been sought under the new Workplace Relations Act to qbtain from the commission an order under section 127 to require a return to work. What is very interesting is that in response to the 127 application, which has been in the commission in the last 24 hours, we, in fact, saw the unions-under the threat of the handing down of a 127 application-call off their industrial action. We also had, I think perhaps for the first time, a commissioner stating that the commission may, in any future developments in respect of this dispute, act of its own motion; in other words, proceed to issue a section 127 order even without application. The new Workplace Relations Act does provide for the commission to act on. its own motion in specified circumstances. As I say, I think that is the first time that has happened . Why that is important is that the way these disputes have run in the coal industry in the past has been that the CFMEU, where they have a particular problem in a particular mine, threaten the whole industry basically through the usual thuggery and industrial tactics to get their way. What we have seen in this particular instance is the successful operation of the government's new Workplace Relations Act to require people to return to work. That is a step in the right direction. We need in this particular dispute to focus on the real problems of inefficiency and lack of productivity in the mining operations. In the time before last when this matter was in the commission, a representative from the Hunter Valley No. 1 mine made a very interesting point. He said that last year they were making a profit of $1 a tonne. Since that time, in April of this year, they have had a price reduction of $3 a tonne. What that tells you is that the economic viability of these operations is under severe threat. If you look at the international market-and they have to compete in the international market-the truth is that these Australian mines are not just competing against themselves; they are competing against mines in South Africa and Indonesia and elsewhere. Whilst the Labor Party says, 'This is all an ideological campaign,' the truth is that, unless we can get the efficiency into these mines and boost the productivity of these mines, we will see a lot of jobs exported from Australia. Is that your policy: to export jobs from Australia in the coal mining industry? It is certainly not our policy. Our position is to say that these people in this particular mine ought to sit down themselves and fix their problems, not return to a former process which in the past has given us the very problems of the inefficiencies there today. It is not as though people are not being offered a reasonable deal. In that particular dispute, the employees are being offered an extra $170 a week to give them an annualised income of $84,000 a year. The words I now want to finish with and recount are the words of Tony Blair, the new Prime Minister in the UK, who gave a very interesting speech to the Trade Union Congress in Brighton at about the same time as the Leader of the Opposition gave his grovelling speech to the ACTU. These words are words you will never be able to utter. These are the words of Tony Blair. He was quite upfront. He said: You should remember in everything you do that fairness at work starts with the chance the first place, because if we as a government and you as a trade union movement do not make Britain a country of successful businesses, a country where people want to set up and expand and a country that has the edge over our competitors, then we are betraying those we represent. Your comments today betray those that you claim to represent. Naval Contracts",78
108,Mr MCMULLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is not, unfortunately, to Partisan Pete; it is to the Minister for Defence. I refer to the fact that in April this year a joint venture between Serco and P&O-known as Defence Maritime Services-won the navy's port services and support craft contract. After this contract was won, did you attempt to force the navy to introduce a new provision into the contract imposing a requirement on DMS that Australian workplace agreements be used in the engagement of their employees? Why shouldn't DMS and their employees be able to choose a certified agreement, if that is their preference, as the objects of your government's Workplace Relations Act require?",79
109,Mr MCLACHLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for his question. I can confirm that the navy is negotiating a contract with Defence Maritime Services to provide port services and support craft to the navy. I can confirm that the contract will reflect industrial arrangements that are consistent with the current workplace relations climate and legislation. I can confirm that this will be done through Australian workplace agreements, and I can confirm that the cabinet has confirmed that this shall be so. Obviously I cannot comment on the details of the contract, but I anticipate that the contract will be signed shortly. World Trading Day",79
110,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I call the honourable member for Wannon.,79
111,Mr HAWKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, my question is addressed to the Treasurer. Ms Macklin- Mr Speaker!",79
112,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Opposition members interjecting,79
113,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I have called the honourof a job in able member for Wannon.,79
114,Mr HAWKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Can the Treasurer advise the House of contributions the Australian futures and options industry is making to the welfare of people in developing nations?,79
115,Mr COSTELLO,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for Wannon for his question. Last year, CARE International joined with the futures and options industry around the world to create World Trading Day-a fundraising event whereby different exchanges and companies involved in the industry raise money for CARE on a designated day. The Sydney Futures Exchange has struck a partnership agreement with eight other exchanges in the Asia-Pacific region aimed at generating funds for foreign aid in Asia and the developing world. World Trading Day was launched in Sydney this morning. Futures traders in each of the nine exchanges have agreed to donate a percentage of their trade on World Trading Day to humanitarian aid. The money will be managed by the aid organisation CARE International. Organisers expect to raise in excess of $1 million in the Asia-Pacific region. The exchanges participating are Sydney, Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, New Zealand, Hong Kong and Tokyo. CARE Australia is coordinating the participation of all these exchanges. Mr Speaker, this is a practical demonstration of the finance and securities industries of Australia taking a lead in the region to engage in an humanitarian effort on a voluntary basis to give money to those who are in need and to contribute to development in our region. By investing in human capital in our region through improvements in education, health and nutrition, we will be giving opportunities to people who would otherwise not have them. I welcome the stand that CARE has taken in organising this. I congratulate the Australian Futures Exchange. I warmly welcome those members of the industry who will be donating part of their profits on World Trading Day to those great development issues. This is a great humanitarian effort. Mr Speaker, I might take this opportunity in addition to clarify one other aspect in relation to international taxatiop. I was asked a question before by the member for Oxley. I may well have said that foreign companies could negatively gear in Australia. Of course, the government has also tightened thin capitalisation rules which will not allow them to have excess debt within the jurisdiction and to negative gear, so that is another active reform that this government has actually engaged in in order to prevent any negative gearing by foreign companies that might be trading here in Australia. But, in relation to CARE International, I am sure the opposition will join with me in congratulating CARE Australia and the futures and options industry on a great statement-a voluntary contribution to a great cause, the development of humanitarian aid in our region. Nursing Homes",79
116,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, my question is directed to the Minister for Family Services. Is the minister aware that, where a daughter of an elderly parent has cared· for that parent for less than five years, the family home will be included in the assets test? Can the minister explain why, in order to pay an $80,000 nursing home entry fee, the daughter must now sell the family home as this is her father's only asset, and she will have to move out?",80
117,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, I would like to just paint a sketch for the House today in response to the shadow minister's question. Ms Macklin-And will you answer the question?",80
118,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I will answer the question. Since becoming Minister for Family Services 18 months ago, I have had the privilege of travelling around many parts of Australia-from Kempsey in New South Wales to Rockingham in my state and to Tasmania and all other parts of Australiaand I have seen many nursing homes and hostels. I have to tell you, Mr Speaker, that the majority of hostels I have visited have been fine buildings delivering fine care. In contrast, I have visited some nursing homes that paint a very bleak picture indeed about the condition of nursing homes in this country. Many of them are firetraps. One I visited had a number of very frail residents in an upstairs room. There were no lifts and one narrow staircase. Ms Macklin-Could I take a point of order, Mr Speaker, on relevance? It was a very specific question about an assets test that will force a daughter to move out of her father's home.",80
119,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order.,80
120,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I am afraid the safety of frail, older Australians is a very relevant matter, and it is one we on this side of the House take very seriously. Mr Speaker, some of them are firetraps. Some of them have residents living in such cramped conditions that there are eight elderly residents in one room with barely a metre between beds. It is not safe; it does not encourage or allow for safe nursing practices. Mr MCMullan-Why did you cut the funds?",80
121,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"We haven't. Very often, for dementia residents, there is nowhere for them to walk. We know that the physical features of modern, contemporary nursing home and hostel care are. very important in reducing chemical and physical restraint. Of course, that is one of the a.ims of this government, to produce a restraint-free environment. Mr Speaker, more importantly, we have found that not only are residents of nursing homes living in an environment that is unsafe-and these are the most frail and most vulnerable in our community-but also they are not able to live in comfort and with the dignity that they deserve. I have absolutely every confidence in Australian families. The majority of them would not want to see their frail, elderly mother or father or relative living in those kinds of conditions. I have every confidence in Australians in that regard. With the contribution of $13,000, which this government has now set, and unlike Labor which introduced hostel fees where people had to put the whole lot up-front, we have said that people entering nursing homes and hostels can now pay their accommodation bond weekly, fortnightly, monthly, quarterly or half-yearly, or they can pay in a lump sum if they choose. It would seem to me that the maximum a nursing home provider or hostel provider can draw down out of the bond, regardless of what that bond is in total, is $13,000. This means that, if people really want to keep the family home,· if relatives want to keep it as part of their inheritance-and I can fully understand that many relatives would want to do that I am sure they will be able to find the small weekly contribution to keep their frail, elderly mother or father or citizen in decent conditions, not in the appalling and squalid conditions that they lived in under a Labor government. I want to make it clear to the House that, regardless of how much the bond is, the drawdown is $2,600 per annum.· It can only be drawn down for a maximum of five years, which means that no-one who can afford to pay a bond will pay more than $13,000 in total.",81
122,Mr BEAZLEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Yau have to sell your house to get there.,81
123,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"You do not have to sell your house to do it, necessarily. Opposition members-'Necessarily'?",81
124,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Fifty per cent of people entering nursing homes and hostels under the former system chose to sell their homes because they are moving out of their house to go into a nursing home or hostel. At the end of the time, if they leave the hostel or nursing home, the bond is refunded less the draw down or, if they die, the bond is refunded to their relatives, to their estate, as the case may be. We have put into place a policy which allows people entering nursing homes or hostels to have a six-month period before they have to pay a bond. That takes account of people moving out of hospital after acute care. Compared with Labor, we have put in more safeguards, more safety nets and more hardship provisions and we have allowed more flexibility in the system so that our frail elderly citizens can be accommodated decently and can live out those last years of their lives in comfort, with dignity and in a safe environment. Small Business",81
125,Ms JEANES,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Minister for Workplace Relations and Small Business. Minister, is this week's positive reaction to the government's small business initiatives continuing? Will the government maintain its support for small business to be exempt from the unfair dismissal laws, including small business employers in my state of South Australia and, most importantly, in my electorate of Kingston?",81
126,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"I thank the honourable member for her question. What a good representative the people of Kingston, particularly small business, have in the honourable member.",81
127,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Better than the old Gordon.,81
128,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Yes. I am a gentleman, so I will refrain from saying what I was thinking. The endorsements from the small business community have just been flooding in for days, which is good not just obviously from a political point of view but also because of the importance of confidence for the small business community. It must be at least 15 years since the small business community has had a government that is genuinely interested in the prosperity of the small business community and a government that actually understands what that community needs to create jobs and to give this country the sort of confidence that it needs for the future. We have had very strong support from our friends at COSBOA; the Furnishing Industry Association of Australia; the Chamber of Commerce and Industry from Western Australia, which says, 'We congratulate you on the comprehensive and balanced package that you announced yesterday'; the Canberra Times",81
129,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Ha, hal",82
130,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Okay. Prime Minister, we have gathered up here a great constituency, a great coalition of interests, who can see the importance, including the Melbourne Age. Mr Costello-And the ABC?",82
131,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, not them. I even got a letter from some bloke who was going to start up a political party to represent the interests of small business. But when he read the package, he said he did not need to because the small business party was already in Canberra and in government. It has been a very positive response. Mr Crean-Who was it?",82
132,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Come round and see me later; I get a lot of mail. In contrast to that we had quite an interesting response from the other side on this issue. The member for Cunningham, to give him his due",82
133,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,He's a trier.,82
134,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Perhaps stilI feeling the sense of independence that he once brought into this chamber as the Speaker, he got up and basically said that this package is 80 per cent pretty good. Then I reckon he went back to his office and the front-bench started to ring him. I reckon Captain Smirk, the member for Hotham, would have rang him and said, 'You can't say that about the government's package.' I have had reports of people ringing and saying, 'The member for Cunningham and his office have been ringing around small business organisations saying, ""Surely, there is something wrong in the package and, surely, you would like to say it"".' Mr Martin-Would I do that?",82
135,Mr REITH,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"The smile on your face tells it all. I suppose in a sense at the political level it brings a smile to our faces to see them floundering as they have been. When you assess it, the truth is that the Labor Party on this issue are irrelevant. They are far in our wake. They did nothing when they were in government except burden the small business community-they had 17 reviews. When they got into opposition, their first action was to have another review-No. 18. Their one complaint was about retail tenancies and the one piece of paper that they issued on the question of their policy did not actually have retail tenancies in it. When you look at the totality of their position, are they supporting small business on other issues? No, they are not. They made life as difficult as possible on the capital gains tax rollover relief. They have been attacking the fixing up of the nation's finances to reduce interest rates for the small business community. Then when it comes to the issue of unfair dismissal where we are proposing yet another benefit for the small business community-a complete exemption-they are opposing it. In South Australia where the state governhave ment responding to the Prime Minister's initiative actually brought a measure into the state parliament, the upper house with the Labor Party voted against it as well. The person who wants to be Deputy Premier in South Australia, the Labor aspirant in South Australia, on the very issue of whether or not there should be an exemption from unfair dismissal laws for small business said, 'Small business people in this state-some of them who speak publicly on this issue-are too stupid to be able to cross the road.' I conclude by saying that this has been a fantastic week for the small business community. This is the best week that they have had from a federal government in 20 years. If the opposition are fair dinkum about the interests of small business and if they are smart enough, they will cross the road and vote for that unfair dismissal law when it is back for a vote. That really would cap off a great week. Nursing Homes",82
136,Ms MACKLIN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is again to the Minister for Family Services. Is it not a fact that, in addition to people paying large up-front fees, the additional daily fees for nursing homes start on 1 November? Is the minister aware that elderly people who have helped their children with deposits on their homes in the last five years will be deemed to still have that money and their daily fees will be higher as a result? Is it fair that the children will now have to sell their homes and pay back the money?",83
137,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,I am sure that the shadow minister is going to continue with this line inquiry. Ms Macklin-Too right. It is bad policy.,83
138,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"She will continue trotting out these individual cases. If she has some cases, I will look at them. But she has become increasingly irrelevant in this debate, particularly as the government's policy has been endorsed by a very wide range of organisations involved in aged care around the country. I have pages and pages of them, but I would just like to read a couple. This one saysMs Macklin- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. For the third time, the minister refuses to answer the question. It is a very specific question about the new daily start on 1 November.",83
139,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. The minister is drawing on an extensive repertoire of information in addressing your question.,83
140,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Betty Johnson of the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants' Federation, for example, said: Your concern for low income residents and your quick action is greatly appreciated. That was in relation to paying up to $12 a day for people who are financially disadvantaged. Mr Martin-When did she say it?",83
141,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"She said that on 27 June 1997. Dr Keith Woollard of the Australian Medical Association on 30 September, just the other day, said: The aged care reforms . .. is one way which Australia can come to terms with the massive increase in demand for quality accommodation and care of our ageing population. Now we have a government that is willing to make a tough decision that will ultimately benefit all aged care residents by providing proprietors of these facilities no excuse not to improve standards. I go on. The Australian Nursing Homes and Extended Care Association said yesterday: Today's introduction of the aged care reforms is the culmination of many months of consultation between the Government, service providers, consumer organisations and unions. The resultant reform package will herald change in the delivery of of aged care (and we are) confident that the changes will be for the better. Mr Adams-Answer the question!",83
142,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Order!,83
143,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Finally, I will read one more. Dennis Jones from the Australian Nursing Federation in AAP was quoted on 30 September 1997Mr Allan Morris- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Page 4 of your letter says: . . . I intend to require that a minister does not unduly digress from the point of the question directed to him or her . . . Could you please bring the minister to the point of the question? It is about one of my fees that constituents, that is why.",83
144,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"There is no point of order. The minister is not unduly digressing. Mr Lee- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: earlier in question time today we had the situation where the questions got out of sequence. In the past when that has happened, the Speaker has given the side of the House that missed that opportunity a double up.",83
145,Mr TUCKEY,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"No, he hasn't. Mr Lee-That has happened on many occasions when government members have missed the call.",83
146,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point' of order. That is not so.,84
147,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Mr Speaker, before I come to the question, I would just like toMs Macklin-And I hope you will answer the question.",84
148,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Denis Jones of the Australian Nursing Federation on 30 September 1997 said: Mrs Moylan has made a genuine effort to consult all groups involved in the massive overhaul of nursing homes. If the shadow minister was asking a question on behalf of one of her colleaguesMr Gareth Evans- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the minister herself by saying 'before I come to the question' is acknowledging she is not addressing the question. If you cannot knock her off for irrelevance on that, when can we ever get anyone knocked off?",84
149,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,There is no point of order. The minister is tinder considerable pressure and I am sure it was a slip of the tongue. The minister is drawing on a wide range of examples. I would happily encourage the minister to wind up the answer.,84
150,Mrs MOYLAN,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"As it is obvious that the shadow minister was asking a question about a specific constituent of my honourable colleague across the chamber there, I would be very happy to take that question, get the details of it, and answer it in more detail. Parliamentary Standards",84
151,Mr ANDREW,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Mr Martin Ferguson- Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I was clearly on my feet before the member for Wakefield. I ask that you look at this side of the House in the future.",84
152,Unknown,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,Honourable members interjecting,84
153,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"Order! I have considerable difficulty taking my eyes from the lefthand side of this chamber. There is no way known that the honourable member for Batman was first on his feet, as an examination of the tape would show. .",84
154,Mr ANDREW,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"May I say, I may not be the member for Batman, but I am fast on my feet! My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister explain to the House the importance of upholding parliamentary standards and what action should be taken to do just that?",84
155,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"It is now almost 24 hours since Cut and Paste Kim over there released his quite infamous press release. Mr Speaker, this is no small matter. This is a document under the hand of the Leader of the Opposition. This is a document under the hand of a man who not only lacks the moral courage to sack Senator Sherry but, in order to hide his own weakness, is unwilling to acknowledge to the parliament of Australia that he deliberately set out to mislead the people of Australia. There can be no other explanation. This is no mere inadvertent error. This is no mistake of a young mistake maker. This is the deliberately deceptive act of a man who knows that, if he is to match my standards, he ought to sack Senator Sherry. This is the man who has gone on and on about this matter. One of the things that has really fascinated me over the last 24 hours is that we have had this suggestion that perhaps we should not talk about these matters any more. We were not having those suggestions at the end of last week. We have only started to have these suggestions from those opposite and from some who sit above us over the last couple of days because it is starting to scorch the hide of the Leader of the Opposition. That is the reason why this has come along and here you have a clear-cut difference in standards. Whatever the difficulty was, I was prepared to take the difficult action. My opposite number lacks the moral and political courage to get rid of Senator Sherry. In order to cover his increasingly scorched hide, what does the Leader of the Opposition do? He resorts to one of the cheapest pieces of deception imaginable. He fudges a press release. Mr Costello-Edward Scissorhands.",84
156,Mr HOWARD,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,"With an Edward Scissorhands act, he absolutely fudges a press release, and he does not have the decency to stand up here and acknowledge it. I might have expected it of the member for Hotham. I would have expected it of the member for Kingsford-Smith. I certainly would have expected it of the former Prime Minister, but I frankly did not expect it of the Leader of the Opposition. I am on the record as having previously said that, when it came to this sort of behaviour, the Leader of the Opposition actually had higher standards than some of his colleagues. I have to say, more in sorrow than in anger, that he has disappointed me very much. I never thought he would resort to the cheap fudge of putting together a cut and paste press release, and that is what he has done. So as we end this parliamentary week, not only do we have a frontbencher in the Labor Party who has deceived the public and deceived the parliament; we have a weak, gutless Leader of the Opposition who does not have the moral courage to sack that frontbencher, and the Leader of the Opposition compounds his weakness with his deception and dishonesty. Mr Speaker, I ask that further questions be placed on the Notice Paper. QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: NA Travelling Allowance",84
157,Mr RUDDOCK,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"On 25 September, the member for Kingsford-Smith asked me as the Acting Minister for Administrative Services this question: Minister, are you aware of any irregularities travel allowance claims by staff of the former Minister for Transport and Regional Development? If not, will you inquire into the matter and report back to the House? The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows. I have made inquiries into the matter and I can advise the honourable member that there are no irregularities in respect of travel allowance claims by staff of the former minister. For completeness, however, I can advise, as the honourable member would know, that it is long-accepted practice under successive governments that ministerial staff may seek a travelling allowance prior to travel. This is in line with arrangements applying to members of the Australian Public Service under the Public Service Determination No. 1983/10. When the travel does not occur, the staff are required to repay the advances, required by Finance Direction 14B. In the case of one of Mr Sharp's former advisers, there are unpaid advances totalling $5,659.80. The amount of money is being recovered from moneys otherwise due to the former staff member. Under procedures recently introduced, ministerial staff are required to acquit any outstanding advances before further advance is made. Mr Crean-Very regular.",85
158,Mr RUDDOCK,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"Well, if you want to press these matters in relation to amounts of money that have been paidMr Crean-And notified.",85
159,Mr RUDDOCK,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"And not all notified. Mr Crean-Yes, on your side.",85
160,Mr RUDDOCK,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"No. But where it is being argued that there is an arrangement in relation to claims over 10 days, the amount of money is every bit as much. Nursing Hpmes",85
161,Mrs MOYLAN,ADDITIONAL RESPONSES,"In the member for Jagajaga's question to me today-and I want to clear this up in case some families might be alarmed-she suggested that a nursing home in Sydney will move concessional residents around in order to accommodate bond paying residents. I wish for the record in the to reinforce my clear message about the protections for residents under the new Aged Care Act, greater protections than were ever there before. According to section 23.17 of the User Rights Principles 1997: A care recipient may be moved to another bed or room in the residential care service only if: (a) the move is at the care recipient's request; or (b) the care recipient agrees to move after being fully consulted and without being subject to any pressure; or (c) the move is necessary on genuine medical groundsAnd that is assessed by an independent medical practitioner or a professional member of an aged care assessment team. It continues: (d) the place occupied by the care recipient becomes an extra service place and the care recipient elects not to pay the extra service fee; or (e) the move is necessary to carry out repairs or improvements to the premises where the residential care service operates and the care recipient has the right to return to the room ... when the repairs or improvements are finished. A resident may not be asked to move to make way for a resident who has paid an accommodation bond. My department has told me that it has spoken to the executive director of the group which runs this nursing home. She has said that this allegation is wrong. She maintains it is group policy to place people in rooms according to medical need, not according to what they can pay. She says she has a copy of the User Rights Principles and her policies are in accord with those principles. I do not know where the member for Jagajaga gets her story, but she seems to be as ill informed as ever. NA Answers to Questions",85
162,Mr ROCHER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, do ministers invariably respond to your letters seeking reasons for delays in answering questions on the Notice Paper pursuant to standing order 150? If so, are you aware that you are doing better than me-and, I expect, most other members-in my efforts to obtain timely answers from some ministers to my written representations on behalf of constituents?",86
163,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"As you would recognise, I am frequently invited to pursue, on behalf of members, answers from ministers, and I invariably receive copies of the ministerial advice. Ministers, as far as I can recall, are very circumspect and disciplined in their responses, but if there are any outstanding matters I will happily take those up with the member for Curtin. Relevance of Answers",86
164,Mr ALLAN MORRIS,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"Mr Speaker, I preface my question by saying that, in relation to those questions today relating to constituents, the minister has both in writing and has had those for some days. I ask you to come back to page 4 of your letter of 27 May where you state that the answer must not unduly digress from the point of the question. In both the cases that I raised with you, I bed or thought that that was the issue. Perhaps you need to explain to us again what you mean by 'the point of the question'.",86
165,Mr SPEAKER,QUESTIONS TO MR SPEAKER,"I thank the honourable member for Newcastle. I am not going to be drawn into an ongoing argument about this. You would note that I have made a number of comments to the House about relevance, questions and answers. I am not going to be amplifying any of those; I just draw your attention to them and remind you to revisit them. NA",86
166,Mr MELHAM,PRIVILEGE," Mr Speaker, I rise understanding order 95 on a matter of privilege.",86
167,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"I interrupt the honourable member for Banks. I do have before me four matters of privilege; I also have a prime ministerial statement. I was planning, with the agreement of the House, once we have got rid of one or two mechanical issues, to address all four issues of privilege after the Prime Minister's statement, if everybody agrees with that.

169,Mr SPEAKER,REPRESENTATIVES,"Pursuant to section 9B of the Public Service Act 1922, I present the annual report of the Department of the House of Representatives for 1996-97. NA 28th South Pacific Forum, Rarotonga, Cook Islands 17-19 September 1997",87
170,Mr HOWARD,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"by leave-The annual South Pacific Forum brings together the leaders of the region's island countries, Australia and New Zealand. It is a good opportunity for informal discussions which are valuable in maintaining a strong sense of community and common interests in the region. Australia's membership of the forum is an expression of commitment to our partnership with the countries of the region. Australia is part of the region not just because geography makes us neighbours, but also because we have shared interests in the region's stability and in the well-being of its people. There are close links between Australians and the people of the South Pacific through business, tourism in both directions, family ties and the many thousands of island people who have been educated in Australia. Australia recognises that there are harsher dimensions to life in the South Pacific than the idyllic beaches and clear water that tourists enjoy in the island paradises. The other realities for island countries are their isolation, smallness, dependence on the ocean and vulnerability to nature. Australia has always been there to help in times of difficulty, as we are now, for example, in helping Papua New Guinea cope with severe drought. My government is committed to strengthening that partnership. We have maintained aid levels to the Pacific, despite cuts in the overall aid budget. About 40 per cent of our total bilateral aid goes to the South Pacific. We are committed to helping island countries achieve their goals. Our strong partnership with the countries of the region does not mean that we will not sometimes have differences of approach and perspective. But we have common interests in working them through and reaching, if not full agreement, at least an understanding of each other's position. A significant outcome of this year's forum was leaders' endorsement of the action plan for economic reform drawn up by forum economic ministers in their meeting in Cairns in July. Many of the regional countriesincluding the forum's host country, the Cook Islands-have made good progress in reforming their economies over the past few years. The action plan provides a sound and flexible framework for promoting economic development and will help the region respond to the challenges of a fast-changing world. The action plan requires countries to: . develop comprehensive economic reform strategies; invite the private sector to recommend to governments measures to improve competitiveness; adopt a set of best-practice principles for public accountability and transparency of government finances and economic management; pursue open investment policies consistent with APEC principles; work towards a common goal of open and free trade, with each country deciding its own timetable; and, rationalise and progressively reduce tariffs, while recognising the special circumstances of some smaller island economies. Australia has been an active supporter of economic reform and sustainable development of the region's resources. We think the future stability and viability of the region's countries depend on them taking the necessary action now. Australia has not foisted these reforms on the region. The island countries themselves have control of the scope and pace of reform. They will make their own decisions, taking into account their own circumstances and the nature of their societies and cultures. Australia is investing considerable resources in aid programs to back up their efforts. A second significant outcome from the forum was the leaders' retreat statement on climate change. My objective in discussions on this topic was to promote and protect Australia's national interest. Some members opposite have criticised me for this, but I am never going to be apologetic about standing up-particularly aboard-for the national interests of Australia. Australia's negotiating position at the forthcoming climate change meeting at Kyoto has been fully protected. This was my responsibility as Australia's leader at the recent forum meeting. The outcome was therefore good for Australia. But it was also good for the other participants. It was a fair outcome that reflectincluding ed a consensus of views, not one on which particular views were subjugated to others. Despite the claims of some, no threats regarding aid were made or even hinted at by Australia. As the statement emphasises, all forum members share concerns about the impact of climate change. A visit to the region makes one conscious of the sense of vulnerability that the very small island states feel to the potential impact of climate change and rising sea levels. It is not, however, just the small island states who face problems. Changing weather patterns would affect us all, including Australia with our long coastline and vast rural areas. Australia shares with the island countries a strong common interest in an effective international regime for a net reduction in global greenhouse gas emissions. Australia's position is that any regime will be effective only if it is realistic and fair therefore has a reasonable chance of being implemented. There is no gain for the environment from an agreement which is not worth the paper it is written on because the commitments are not credible and the burden of efforts and cost is not equitably distributed. The bottom line is that an unrealistic and unfair agreement will not work. That is not in the interests of the island countries any more than it is in Australia's interests. We firmly believe that any agreement has to provide the basis for involving the developing countries. Everyone who contributes to the problem has to contribute to the solution, and developing countries will account for nearly half of global emissions by the year 2010 compared with less than one-third today. In order to achieve a realistic, fair and environmentally effective agreement, Australia is arguing for different targets for different countries, taking into account each country's circumstances. That is what the Europeans have arranged for themselves in their increasingly well-known 'bubble'. We are asking only thai: the same principle be applied to other countries, including Australia. We are prepared to play our part in addressing this global problem. We are working to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Australia, through the greenhouse challenge program. We are also providing climate change related support through our aid program with projects worth $45 million in the South Pacific. But we will not accept the economic burden of targets which mean Australia is required to shoulder a disproportionate part of the effort and that Australians pay a greater cost than others for doing so. The uniform reduction targets being called for, and apparently by the opposition in this place as well as other countries-IS per cent from 1990 levels by 2010 in the case of the Europeans and 20 per cent by 2005 from the Alliance of Small Island States-would have a dramatic impact on the Australian economy and her people. We would be penalised for being an efficient producer of energy and emission intensive goods, most of which we export to other countries that need the products for their and economic growth. The impact on our energy intensive and resource processing industries would devastate parts of regional Australia. The job losses and dislocation of peoples' lives would be immense, including in the Illawarra and the Hunter Valley in New South Wales, Geelong and the La Trobe Valley in Victoria, the Bowen Basin and Gladstone in Queensland, Port Pirie in South Australia and the Kwinana and north-west regions of Western Australia. New investment in energy intensive industry would be threatened, risking the potential in some estimates for up to 90,000 new long term jobs. According to ABARE, if Australia returned to 1990 levels of greenhouse emissions by the year 2000, it could involve an increase in petrol prices of up to 70c a litre, a similar increase in diesel prices, an increase in natural gas prices of up to 40c a litre and an increase in average electricity prices of up to 100 per cent. That, in a nutshell, is why I, on behalf of our country, am taking the stand that I am on this issue. And what would this destructive result Australia achieve for the environment? The answer is very little. Australia contributes only 1.4 per cent of global emissions. Even we closed down every emissions producing industry, it would have virtually no impact on challenges. global emissions growth. Many emissions producing industries would simply move offshore. Australia's role as an efficient supplier of energy would be taken by others whose controls and technology are not as good as ours. Our differentiation approach would also provide a fair basis for the future involvement of developing countries. The only way to bring them on board is to identify different targets, taking account of their different stages of development and their capacity to contriwarmly bute. This was an important element in the forum statement on climate change. The need to involve developing countries was recoggovernment nised by all forum leaders. The forum statement's call for the Kyoto outcome to peace talks. provide procedures and time frames for drawing in significant developing country emitters in the future is a major step forward in the negotiations leading up to Kyoto. It is the first time that developed and developing countries have joined forces in this way. On another issue of significance to the region's environment, I announced at the forum that Australia is prepared to significant contribution to the building Samoa of a new headquarters for the South Pacific regional environment program, the design for which we have already funded. This program has an important role to play on a wide range of regional environmental issues and forum leaders are in agreement that it needs new headquarters to carry out its tasks effectively. We will also talk to the government of Japan about joining us and New Zealand, and other forum countries which may also wish to contribute, in putting together the necessary funds to ensure that the new headquarters are built as soon as possible. We also discussed at the forum the main challenges to the security of regional countries, especially their vulnerability to increasing transnational criminal activity including for drug trafficking. The outcome of our discussions was the Aitutaki Declaration on Regional Security Cooperation which provides for if the enhancement of existing consultation and coordination arrangements to respond to these Australia is already working constructively with regional countries to address these issues. In regard to the particular threat posed by drug trafficking, I hope that some of the work being done by the recently established drugs task force will be relevant to the needs of the island countries. We would be happy to share the results of that work with them. For almost a decade now the conflict in Bougainville has been a major security concern in the region. Forum leaders therefore welcomed the recent progress made in restoring peace to Bougainville and noted the appreciation of the Papua New Guinea for the assistance of Australia and New Zealand, the latter of which is hosting In my discussions at the forum with the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, Mr Bill Skate, I was greatly impressed by his determination to achieve a peaceful settlement of this long-running and debilitating conflict. I assured Mr Skate of Australia's readiness to support his government's efforts and facilitate the peace process. At his request, we have make a transported PNG government and in Bougainvillean participants to the second round of talks in New Zealand. We hope that the outcome of the talks is another step towards peace for the people of Bougainville. The forum also expressed its support for the readmission of Fiji to the Commonwealth, following the recent successful conclusion of its constitutional review. In my meeting with Fiji's prime minister, Mr Rabuka, I congratulated him on his leadership in achieving an outcome acceptable to Fiji's communities. The news earlier this week of Fiji's readmission to the Commonwealth was therefore very welcome. One of the common interests which draws together the people of the forum member countries is sport. Australians' love of sport, as both participants and spectators, is matched by the enthusiasm of the people of the island countries. The value attached to it is expresswe ed in the declaration on sport and development adopted by the forum. I was therefore particularly pleased to announce in Rarotonga that Australia will underwrite the journey of the Olympic torch, on its way to Australia for the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games, through all those Pacific countries which are members of the international Olympic movement. This will complement the work Australia is already doing under its South Pacific 2000 program to assist the development of the region's sports men and women, and maximise their participation in the Olympic and Paralympic games. The government has made every effort to include Australia's South Pacific neighbours in Sydney's hosting of the Olympics. The torch's journey through the region will provide an excellent opportunity for the island countries to take advantage of being in the world spotlight and boost their tourist flows. The forum also commended to its members Canada's candidature for the UN Security Council and appointed Mr Noel Levi, the former head of Papua New Guinea's Prime Minister's Department, as the next secretarygeneral of the forum's secretariat. The Australian government wishes Mr Levi every success in his new position. In conclusion, I would like to record my appreciation of the excellent arrangements made by the Cook Islands government in hosting the forum and for the skilful chairmanship of the Cook Islands Prime Minister, Sir Geoffrey Henry. I present the following paper: 28th South Pacific Forum, Rarotonga, Cook Islands 17-19 September 1997-Ministerial Statement, 2 October 1997. Motion (by Mr Reith) proposed: That the House take note of the paper.",87
171,Mr BEAZLEY,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,"The visit of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) to the South Pacific was yet another sad reflection of the extent to which this country has lost, under this government, a leadership stance in regional affairs. We have seen it in South-East Asia, we have seen it globally, and this time got a demonstration of it in the South Pacific. The Prime Minister has produced-and I will get to the issue of greenhouse gas emissions shortly-a litany of the decisions that were taken at the South Pacific conference. Some of those decisions are very good advances in the direction of diplomacy in the region: the greater moves to security cooperation, the increased emphasis that is being placed on the control of illicit drugs, the emphasis that is being placed on environmental matters generally, the stances that have been taken there in improving the fiscal performance of a number of the states of the South Pacific area. All those matters that were mentioned in the Prime Minister's report, and the progress on them, were very welcome. But the point is that he had absolutely nothing to do with them-nothing at all. These were a product of what the other nations of the South Pacific, over a period of time, have managed to cobble together. They are leftovers of initiatives from a time when there was a government in operation in this country which took seriously its international responsibilities and actually had the competence to push them through. They are there in place, essentially without the driving force of any form of Australian intellectual leadership behind it. There are critical matters related to the economies of those states which have to be dealt with, but they were not dealt with by our Prime Minister on this occasion. Every Prime Minister that I can remember, Liberal or Labor, sat in the forums where there are opportunities for private meetings and sat in the forums where there are more pro-forma discussions taking place. It has been the Australians who have led, the Australians who have accepted the responsibility of international leadership in the one area of the world where we are in fact a substantial, if not formidable, power and where our moral authority carries very great weight. In so far as you could see any leadership being exercised in this regard, the people you would tick off. as having demonstrated that were, to my surprise: the Prime Minister of Fiji; the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, Mr Bill Skate; and the Prime Minister of New Zealand, Mr Jim Bolger. Those were the individuals exercising leadership at this forum. They were the ones making waves. I remember when the Prime Minister first became Prime Minister and he went across shortly after his election to New Zealand and met Jim Bolger. I said something extraordinarily unkind about Jim Bolger at the time. I said that the Prime Minister was relieved because he had finally found somebody in international politics he could actually patronPacific ise and he appeared to be taking full advantage of that in regard to Jim Bolger. I have to say, and I congratulate him, that Jim Bolger turned the tables. Jim Bolger has finally found an Australian Prime Minister that he can truly patronise, and he took full advantage of it in the leadership that he offered in so many areas, including I might say, peace in Bougainville-to our shame. The reason for this lack of leadership goes to the very heart of what is the problem with this government. Having had an opportunity to look at it for 18 months you can say they have problems with principle and problems with policy direction-all those problems. The central problem of this government-after 18 months it should not be there; with what was once a very good Public Service it should certainly not be there-is basic competence. That is fundamentally the problem with this government-basic competence. We saw that in the diplomacy being exercised by the Prime Minister in the South Pacific. Every journalist who reported on it, everybody who had any opportunity to witness it, reported back to this nation the appearance of a nervous, isolated, palely loitering-to coin another leader of the Labor Party's phrase-Prime Minister. He was palely loitering on the outskirts of every gathering, frightened rotten that some terrible motion was going to emerge on greenhouse gas emissions, wringing his hands with fear about the consequences of any repudiation of the Australian position. He had no constructive suggestions to give to them as to where they might arrive at a reasonable conclusion on that-just arrive at a conclusion with which we can live politically; not one that starts to deal with the problem, just something that we can live with politically. After an unprecedented delay, members of the island nations had to get used to something they had never seen before. I know the Prime Minister has been portrayed as a bullying Australian and I know some of our folk have said something about that, but I am afraid to say that they were wrong. The Prime Minister was not bullying the South Pacific nations. He was not threatening the South nations with a $450 million aid cut. I know we have said that, but that is the sort of thing that oppositions would say. What the Prime Minister was doing was begging. The Australian Prime Minister was in the South Pacific-not cajoling, not threatening, as we have said; he was begging. I have never seen a picture of an Australian Prime Minister in such a humiliating posture in the region'S affairs. That grovelling, wheedling, begging: 'Please do not arrive at a conclusion. Please come down to some position.' You could see Jim Bolger there with his head in this hands, secretly delighted at the sight. Bill Skate was bemused. The Fijians were a bit bemused also; they have been used to a bit of strength from Australian governments in years gone by. They sit there musing: 'How do we handle this quivering object? Australia has meant a very great deal to us in the past. We know darn well that any particular resolution that we pass in this place is only going to have a marginal impact on any decisions made at Kyoto. In our situation-which is a pretty terrible one if the science on the greenhouse gas emissions is right, and there are very few scientists who disagree with the science-at least some of us face almost total annihilation as countries. ' They have the sight of a begging Australian Prime Minister not engaging them but wandering around with a permanently worried expression on his face. The midnight oil was being burned back in Australia as the constant message flow went to and fro: what could possibly do if all this went wrong? And, of course-it speaks very well of the contribuhouse tion that Australia has made over the years the South Pacific-they rescued him. They likes filled the begging bowl. They gave the beggar his food and he was able to go. This Prime Minister has the temerity to stand up and denounce us for always being supportive of critics of Australia. What rubbish! We ran a tough government for years, a government that had a very distinctive Australian attitude to what the region ought to be and what it ought to look like. We were, from time to time, involved in bruising encounters in those matters when we happened to be in government, and on not a few of those occasions the Liberal opposition took exception to the positions that we were taking. We offered military leadership. We offered economic leadership. We offered leadership diplomatically in the arrangements that we put in place. We had one idea after another. And we stood up for the region when we needed to, vis-a-vis the French or anyone else who was imposing upon them. What you had was a government of Australians, a government that reflected the true spirit of this nation, which has completely disappeared from the countenance of our political diplomatic representatives as they present themselves elsewhere. And don't think we don't know it. As they said in that great movie, Chinatown, 'We've stilI got a few teeth in our head and a few friends downfar town.' We know dam well what is you in international forums and we know dam well what our public servants think about the way in which this government presents itself internationally. They have some time for Fischer-the rest of them absolutely mortify them! Foreign Affairs, which used to be powerhouse of ideas, produce nothing. Even though they have been curtailed-probably too far by us; now exceptiomllIy too far by this government-they have no work to do; there is nothing being done. The Prime Minister comes back here and most of his speech was devoted to the orily thing that bothered him at this forum-he had no leadership to offer-the shape of his we begging bowl. He has presented here the shape· of his begging bowl, being his greengas emissions position. He likes to in pretend what the opposition's attitude is. He to pretend that the opposition's attitude is Tony Blair's. He likes to pretend that the opposition's attitude conforms to the extremist European position. There is not one member of the opposition who has ever rriade a statement like that in any forum at any time-not one! This is part of the fantasy world in 13 which our international beggar lives. The fact of the matter is, though, this: we present a case for differential treatment of Australia when we go overseas. We see the same people that this Prime Minister sees. We see the same people that the foreign minister sees. We present the arguments to the same people about the need for a differential target as far as Australia is concerned. We get back from them-which, no doubt, as they indicate to us, the Prime Minister has experiencedthis, 'Okay, you make a pretty good case. We can make a pretty good case as far Australia is concerned.' Then, 'What do you propose? What is the right international regime? How may we help you?' That is the response. It does not matter whether you go to the UK, it does not matter whether you go to Japan, it does not matter whether you go to the South Pacific nations or wherever else you go; they ask a question: how can we help you? What they get is another bout of wringing of hands from the international beggar as as greenhouse gas emission is concerned. said of They are none the wiser. We have asked a question here in this place about what the government's position actually is. We are now 18 months on into the litany Tim about the bad economic effects of these undifferentiated targets on the Australian a economy. If this problem is actually of the dimensions that the Prime Minister says it is, to not have a plan 18 months in is an act of criminal negligence on the people of this nation. If that is what his. view is, for him not to have presented an argument on what we actually need is total negligence as far as this Prime Minister is concerned. He has no ideas-no ideas whatsoever. The Financial Review got this pretty right. The Fin Review-I could not have summed it up better myself-said: But Australian ministers have so far done little to develop their argument in a sophisticated, rather than simply self-serving, direction. They must do so before the November global summit on the greenhouse problem in Kyoto. Simply asking for a special exemption is not enough. If Australia genuinely believes it is a more efficient place for emission-intensive activities elsewhere, it must demonstrate its fossil-fuel based industries are willing to pay for the privilege of polluting. They have got a very good idea here which could easily be developed. 'Internationally tradeable emission' permits are probably the best route. I think you could also get a differential related to the fact that we absorb many energy intensive processes in our production lines here that save other people on that front. You could point to the fact that we once had in this country really decent research into alternative energies. We also had a very decent posture in so. far as encouraging from our business community the right sorts of responses. But it is only just now that this government has started to build this stuff into our arguments-only just now, 18 months on. This critical issue, so ill-served by incompetence, is a depressing picture. It has got a real opposition mentality: you strike attitudes but you have no solutions. But, really, after 13 years in opposition you ought to be a bit better than that. You have the people in your bureaucracy-if only you knew how to use them-who could tell you the things that you ought to do. This trip of the Prime Minister's was a sad trip. It follows many other sad trips, the last one being the last train to Klutzville, which we all remember. The Prime Minister has got to learn to do a bit better.

172,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"Yesterday the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) raised as a matter of privilege a letter he had received from a Mr Norm Segal from Nambour. I have had the opportunity to consider the honourable member's remarks and to examine a copy of the letter in question. The law of parliamentary privilege enables the House to protect members from improper interference with the free performance of their duties as members-House of Representatives Practice pages 700 to 704. I will not trouble the House by repeating the details of some of the statements in Mr Segal's letter-the than honourable member quoted from it when he raised his complaint last night-suffice to say the letter informed the honourable member: . .. that your name is in the eighth batch of one hundred (100) alleged political, judicial, administrative, media and financial criminals to be charged, tried, and where found guilty, HUNG for treason, crimes against the constitution ... And so on. Unfortunately, at times members are subject to such extravagant and irrational representations. The honourable member for Groom referred to the need for members to have 'thick skins'. While I am sure we all accept this, as Speaker of the House I am concerned that there are, unfortunately, occasions on which a small number of citizens go beyond what we would all regard as a reasonable position in making representations to us. My concern is not only for members but also for their staff and their families, who are very much innocent victims of such unacceptable actions and can be understandably frightened and upset. . Having considered the remarks of the honourable member, the terms of the letter and the precedents which are available, I have concluded that a prima facie case has been made out. I am willing to allow precedence to a motion on the matter.",93
173,Mr TAYLOR,PRIVILEGE,"Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I thank you for your remarks which, of course, I endorse. Many of us and our families-importantly our families-in rural and regional Australia over the last year or so, in an understandable climate of emotion over firearm reforms, have been subjected to personal pressures and written and oral harassment of an unprecedented level. In the end, most people have been reasonable. Unfortunately, Mr Segal reflects an uninformed, vociferous minority, aided and abetted by the negative rhetoric the scaremongering of the member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) and some of their apparatchiks. People like Mr Segal need to understand that, in matters of criminality, members in this place are afforded the full force of the legal processes. I am aware of the formal mechanism of reference to the Committee of Privileges on serious matters like this. However, I understand from my colleague and friend the honourable member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay) that the gentleman concerned is in his seventies and is a former World War II prisoner of war. While his actions remain unacceptable to me and, I feel sure, to all my parliamentary colleagues, under the circumstances I do not wish to move a formal motion of reference to the Committee of Privileges. NA",93
174,Mr CHARLES,PRIVILEGE,"La Trobe) (4.08 p.m.)Under the provisions of standing order 95, I wish to rise on a matter of privilege. The Age newspaper on Monday, 29 September contained an article by the economics correspondent, Paul Chamberlin, which revealed some of the contents of the report of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training Youth employment: a working solution. The committee's report was not tabled in the House until 1.00 p.m. on Monday. The article in the Age therefore appears to be a clear breach of standing order 340 of the House, which prohibits unauthorised disclosure or publication of committee reports. The Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training discussed the article this morning and resolved that the committee should report to the House the apparent leakage of the contents of our report as a prima facie case of a breach of parliamentary privilege. The committee does not consider that the breach constitutes a substantial interference in the work of the committee and therefore does not request the Committee of Privileges to conduct an investigation. However, the committee wishes to place on record that it regards such a breach as a serious matter, which it trusts will not arise in relaand tion to any of its future reports. NA",94
175,Mr HAWKER,PRIVILEGE,"On Tuesday I drew attention to the unauthorised disclosure of details of the report of the Standing Committee on Financial Institutions and Public Administration on its reviews of the 1995-96 annual reports of the Reserve Bank of Australia, the Australian Securities Commission and the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. That report was tabled in the House on Monday, 29 September 1997. This material was reported in part in articles in the Australian of 26 September 1997 and the Weekend Australian of 27-28 September 1997. The committee considered this matter and, despite inquiries with staff, members and the journalist in question, has been unable to identify the source of the disclosure. The committee also considered whether the disclosure constituted a substantial interference in its work and resolved that it had not. This in no way devalues the seriousness of this matter and the committee affirms the absolute importance of compliance with the procedures of the House related to the disclosure or publication of documents presented and proceedings and reports of a committee. It is paramount that the public credibility of the committee system and the members of this House are not put at risk. I urge all members to respect the procedures and processes determined by the House. I do not seek further action on this particular matter, but I urge you, Mr Speaker, to monitor similar instances with regard to committees as it may be necessary to consider this issue further in the future.",94
176,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,"I thank the honourable member for Wannon. This disturbing increase in matters of this type is of considerable concern to me, and I will investigate ways in which the system itself might be tightened. NA",94
177,Mr MELHAM,PRIVILEGE,"I rise understanding order 95 on a matter of privilege. House of Representatives Practice states: Section 12 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 provides that a person shall not, by fraud, intimidation, force or threat, by the offer or promise of any inducement or benefit, or by other improper means, influence another person in respect of any evidence given or to be given before a House or a committee, or induce another person to refrain from giving any such evidence. Further, under the Act a person shall not inflict any penalty or injury upon, or deprive of any benefit, another person on account of the giving or proposed giving of any evidence or any evidence given or to be given, before a House or a committee. As well as being able to be punished as a statutory offence, intimidation, punishment. ment of or discrimination against witnesses prospective witnesses can be punished as tempt ... Erskine May's Parliamentary Practice states that any conduct calculated to deter prospecconfirming tive witnesses from giving evidence before either House or committee is a contempt. The matter I wish to raise is the action of the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) in respect of the presentation by the Australian Law Reform Commission of a submission to the Joint Committee on Native Title. There is mounting evidence that there has been determined effort by the government to ber; frighten off the Australian Law Reform Commission in this matter. The President of the Australian Law Reform Commission, Mr Alan Rose, had agreed to give evidence to the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Native Title and to riginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund and had been scheduled to appear on 3 October. On 24 September Mr Rose withdrew his acceptance for the invitation to give evidence. Mr Rose withdrew his acceptance because the Acting Secretary of the Attorneyleges; General's Department, Mr Raeburn, had in spoken to Mr Rose and told him that he had two choices: to drop the submission or to receive an unhappy letter from the Attorneypublic General in respect of the commission's future work. Mr Rose has said that the choice given to him was no choice at all. On the ABC radio program PM on 29 September, Mr Rose was asked whether it was his impression that the Attorney-General would wind back his powers. He said: ... it was put to me ... in very, very strong terms that would be in effect an indication of the Government's determination to do that. In the Sydney Morning Herald of 1 October, he was quoted as saying, 'We were given no choice.' Mr Speaker, I seek leave to table the following documents so that you can consider this matter. There are three pages of correspondence and the first page of a submission from the Law Reform Commission dated 17 September to Mr Grundy, the secretary of the harassparliamentary committee; correspondence to or Mr Rose dated 17 September from Mr a conGrundy setting down a hearing date of 3 October; correspondence of 19 September to Mr Grundy, signed on behalf of Mr Rose, receipt of the letter and their willingness to present oral evidence and a written submission on 3 October; and a subsequent letter of 24 September in which Mr Rose withdrew his acceptance. I also seek leave to table the transcript of evidence of Mr Rose on the World at Noon on 29 September 1997; the transcript of an a interview on the PM program on 29 Septema copy of an article in the Sydney Morning Herald dated 1 October 1997; an interview with Mr Williams on 29 September on the PM radio program; an interview with Mr Williams on Tuesday 30 September 1997 on the Radio National breakfast program; and an interview with Mr Williams on the 7.30 the AboReport of 30 September 1997. Leave granted.",95

There is a precedent for simultaneous inquiries to be conducted by each committee of privileges: the inquiries into interest immunity. Members of this House should have the benefit of advice from the House of Representatives Committee of Privileges, and I so urge you to allow precedence to the motion, Mr Speaker.",95
179,Mr SPEAKER,PRIVILEGE,I will reflect on the matter and report back. Do you have another paper to table?,96
180,Mr MELHAM,PRIVILEGE,"I also seek to rely on the letter of 28 August that was tabled in the House; the questions to and answers by the Attorney-General in the House this week; and also the tabled note in relation to the conversation that took place with Mr Rose.

181,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have received a letter from the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: The Attorney-General's actions in seeking the Australian Law Refonn Commission's submission being put before the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Native Title. I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places. More than the number of members required by the standing orders having risen in their places",96

I put it to you that under House of Representatives Practice the rule relating to anticipation provides: No member may anticipate the discussion of any subject which appears on the Notice Paper ...

Furthermore, given that the member clearly is using this as a shell within which to attack the Attorney General, if he genuinely wishes to proceed on that basis he should move a substantive motion. On both counts, I put it to you that it to stop is quite clear that it is out of order.",96
184,Mr SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I thank the minister. I have reflected on this in the. course of his remarks. I am looking very carefully at the words of the submission. I feel that it is improper for me to uphold your point of order. I consider that the discussion is in order.,96
185,Mr MELHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"It is interesting that this is the second time that there has been an attempt to stop me from speaking on an MPI this week. Earlier in the week, the unusual practice of the government getting the MPI was put in place. A few things need to be said. The poor old Attorney-General (Mr Williams) is a carcass swinging in the breeze. Early on, his reputation was, Mr Reith- Mr Speaker, on a point of order: within moments of his starting, the member for Banks has revealed that this matter of public importance is a personal attack on the Attorney-General. He is not entitled to use an MPI for that. If he wants to run a censure he should have the guts to bring on. We all know that this is a stunt. This is proof positive. The very words he used are that 'the Attorney-General is a carcass swinging in the breeze' . You know, I know and he knows that this .whole thing is a ruse because he does not .have a case to put a substantive motion. I put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that if he is to be within the standing orders, he has to speak within the terms of this particular set of words which he himself nominated.",96
186,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I thank the Leader of the House for his point of order. I say to the member for Banks and other speakers in this debate that they will, of course, observe the standing orders and will not attempt to bring forward matters which would be more properly brought in a substantive motion.",97
187,Mr MELHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. In the Senate today Senator Ellison, the Minister for Customs and Consumer Affairs and Minister Assisting the Attorney General, had this to say in a speech which began at 10.28 a.m.: There has been no attempt to single out the Australian Law Refonn Commission because of some submission that the Attorney-General did not In fact, it was asked to make a submission to the Wik task force. Its views were asked for by the Commonwealth government in relation to the drafting of that bill. It has been employed by government, properly so, and that is how it should be employed. But it should not be improperly employed, and that is where it embarks on aspects which are beyond its powers under the act. That is the Attorney-General's representative in the other place. That is the person who seeks to take his place. Those remarks are in direct contrast to what the Attorney-General has had to say before this House. So someone has it badly wrong. The position is that we have only discovered this week that the Law Reform Commission wanted to come before the parliamentary committee and give evidence. That is. something that has been going on for over 20 years of their existence. I am a member of the joint parliamentary committee. There are now, on the public record, letters of correspondence between the secretariat of the committee and the Law Reform Commission. It is obvious from those letters of correspondence that the Law Reform Commission wanted to come before the committee. What we have had this week is slowly, inch by inch, we are getting more information. The parliamentary process is extracting the information. The position is that earlier in the week the Attorney-General sought to cite the parliamentary committee that I sat on with him in the last parliament, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which actually was not a prisoner of the executive. I remember that, when we were members of that committee in the last parliament, we did an inquiry into the child sex tourism bill. After day one of that inquiry, three members of the executive issued a press release attacking the committee. But we continued on, and we were vindicated. We brought back a report that said, in effect, we think there should be 38 amendments to the child sex tourism bill. I think 35Yz of those amendments were picked up. Last year, this Attorney-General sponsored legislation through this parliament: the Australian Law Reform Commission Act. It was an update of the earlier Australian Law like. Reform Commission Act. It contains, in almost identical terms, a section-section 26-which says: the If a House of the Parliament, or a Parliamentary Committee, requires the Commission to give it any information about the performance of the Commission's functions, or the exercise of its powers, the Commission must comply with the requirement. There has been a convention for over 20 years, in terms of the existence of the Law Reform Commission, that they give evidence before parliamentary committees. In our 13 years of government, they kept doing it and they came up with submissions critical of the government. They were regarded as an independent statutory authority. Indeed, the Attorney-General, in his 'second reading speech, said: The bills ... modernise the commission's legislation, making it consistent with enabling legislation for other independent statutory authorities and also give effect to a number of specific recommendations of the standing committee. So the practice has not changed. If this Attorney-General did not want them to come before parliamentary committees, he could have amended the Australian Law Reform Commission Act. What happened was they split the section, and they split the section specifically, in effect, to say that the sion can give evidence before committees on those aspects and also on proposed expenditure and income. What we have discovered this week is that an emissary of the Attorney-General was sent, in effect, to nobble the Law Reform Commission. Mr Williams-Nobble?",97
188,Mr MELHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"To nobble them. I use those words in this sense. We now know, because it is now in the public domain, what is in the contentMr Ronaldson- Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. My point of order is in relation to standing order 76, which says: All imputations of improper motives and all personal reflections on Members shall be considered highly disorderly. I would have thought that the last comments by the shadow minister were clearly in breach of the standing orders.",98
189,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I say to the member for Banks that in my opinion the word 'nobble' does have a certain pejorative sense. You might prefer to use a different word.,98
190,Mr MELHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I withdraw, Mr Deputy Speaker. Mr Alan Rose, who is President of the Law Reform Commission, was appointed on 23 May 1994. He is a distinguished public servant who, before that, was Secretary to the Commonwealth Attorney-General's Department. He holds a Bachelor of Arts in politics and English literature, an honours degree in law from the University of Queensland and a Master of Laws degree from the London School of Economics. He lectured in administrative law and legal history at the University of Queensland from 1971 to 1973. Before joining the Attorney-General's Department, first as Associate Secretary in 1987 and then as Secretary in 1989, Mr Rose was Secretary to the Department of Community Services from 1986 to 1987. Prior to that he held several senior positions in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. These included: Deputy Secretary from 1982 to 1986; First Assistant Secretary in the Welfare Division, the Cabinet Office and the commisOperations Division from 1979 to 1982; Assistant Secretary in the Government and Constitutional Legal Affairs Branches from 1975 to 1978; and other positions in relation to the Prime Minister's office. He has served with distinction governments of both political persuasions. He is an outstanding public servant who has given meritorious service to both sides and when Malcolm Fraser was Prime Minister of this country. He is not a Labor stooge, but that is how he has been painted by those on the other side of the House-in particular, the chairman of the joint standing committee, who had a bigger conversion than Saul on the road to Damascus. On Monday, he said he was happy for everyone who wanted to come before the committee to come before it and we would sit for as long as we want. He said he would go and talk to the Attorney-General about this controversy that was blowing up because he wanted to hear his point of view. The next day, he does a conversion. Then he goes to a joint standing committee. He reveals the next day what happened; that is, his casting vote was used to stop an invitation to the Law Reform Commission from coming before the committee. This is what Mr Rose had to say about the commission on the World at Noon: ... it was very keen to provide a submission to both the Government and to the Parliamentary Committee on a matter that is the Native Title Amendment Legislation. He also went on to say: There was no question about the Wik amendments falling squarely within the ALRC's role ... On 29 September, he went on PM and said: Since the commission's creation 20-odd years ago, it has provided submissions and right up again till the last two or three weeks under this Government, to parliamentary committees applying the touchstones that I've just outlined to you, that is we have not had such a narrow interpretation of our role and functions as is now being put to us by the Federal Attorney-General. The interesting thing is that the Attorney General sent a letter to the Law Reform Commission on 28 August. Nowhere there did he say, 'You are not to appear before parliamentarycommittees.' What he said was, in effect, 'I should therefore be grateful if would ensure that you undertake consultation with me should such occasions arise again in the future.' He was obviously referring there to the commission providing comments to the Wik task force after, as Senator Ellison in the Senate says, they were invited to do so or, as the Attorney-General says in this House, they responded to pro forma letters. He did not say, 'You shall stop appearing in front of parliamentary committees' back then when that letter was written. The note that came into this House on 1 October is a note written after the Law ReFirst form Commission went through what they that were asked to do by this Attorney-General, and that is, 'Can you have the courtesy provide me with prior notice if you're going to be doing things outside references?' That is what the input of 28 August was all about. But the position is that there have been exchanges of letters. The government does want this report to come out. The problem with this Attorney-General, unfortunately, that he was supposed to be an alibi for Prime Minister in the Woods affair, but he a choice. was not. So the position is that this commission should be coming before the parliamentary committee. This is a complete breach of convention. Why? One only has to look at the substance of the report. All they have done is highlight the report. The Attorney-General should be defending independent statutory bodies. has been a convention for over 20 years with this commission, yet it is obvious there has been a wink and a nod. Mr Rose knows what it means when he gets a phone call. He knows, when he is given the ultimatum 'You have got two choices' by a public servant the Attorney-General's Department, that he has-as I think one of my colleagues saidhundreds Buckley's and none. (Time expired)",98
191,Mr WILLIAMS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We all know that this MPI is simply a distraction to take public attention away from Senator Sherry and 'cut and paste' Kim. You have been running it all week. You started off with misleading evidence being into the ether before anybody had raised the you issue with me, and you have continued dribbling it out ever since. The member for Banks (Mr Melham) has been sent Senator Bolkus's blowtorch, but unfortunately that will not melt butter. Let me say that I am incensed at being used in this way. You are just engaging in a political stunt. You are engaging in a smearing exercise, you are engaging in besmirching, and there is no substance in what you are doing. As I said in question time, this is a great to-do about nothing. Now let me just tell you what the facts are. of all, I absolutely reject any suggestion I directed or authorised anyone to direct the ALRC not to appear before the Parliato mentary Joint Committee on Native Title. I also reject any suggestion that I have in any way suppressed any submission or gagged the ALRC in giving evidence to the committee. Mr Rose has conceded that no threat was not made to him. If you analyse what Mr Reaburn's note indicates, you will see that Mr is Rose was having pointed out to him the the choices that were open to him-and he made Let me just give you the history of the ALRC's involvement with native title. The ALRC sought a reference from the previous government, and my predecessor declined to give it. He would not give them one on native title. They raised the issue with me again earlier in the year, in about February, and I This did not give them one either. The next matter is that they received, at their request, a copy of the papers from the Wik task force distributed on a public basis to a large mailing list, and they wrote in offering a submission on the bill. They were in not invited to in any way, except by receipt - of a publicly directed circular that went to of people. They put in a draft submission, and it was drawn to my attention. to me that this was not a matter that was a reference to the Law Reform Commission, so I decided that I would query it with them. I wrote a letter, which was tabled on Monday, indicating that, while I understood the commission's comments were put provided in response to a generally issued invitation, I noted that their functions set in the act were confined to matters referred to them by the Attorney-General. In my view, therefore, it would have been appropriate for the commission to have consulted me before providing comments to the government on a matter which is unrelated to any current reference upon which the commission is working. They did not consult me. They had sought references on two prior occasions and not been",99
192,Mr MELHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"They did consult you. They notified you, and that is how you found out, isn't it?",100
193,Mr WILLIAMS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"No, it is not. They wrote directly to the Wik task force, and I found out from the Wik task force. The next point is that they then invited themselves to be invited to the parliamentary joint committee in order to make a submission.",100
194,Mr MELHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,That is not true.,100
195,Mr WILLIAMS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is true, on the basis of documents tabled before the parliamentary joint committee and made public. They invited themselves along, and they did it without reference to me, despite the letter of 28 August.",100
196,Mr MELHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,That is not true.,100
197,Mr WILLIAMS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,That is true. They went behind my back. They did not do what I requested. Just think about it.,100
198,Mr MELHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,How did your office find out?,100
199,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Banks! Let me encourage the Attorney-General to ignore the member for Banks.,100
200,Mr WILLIAMS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Yes; he is eminently ignorable, Mr Deputy Speaker. I did receive a letter from the Law Reform Commission in which they suggested they had relevant references that entitled them to make a submission. If you examine it-and I will come to that-you will see there is absolutely nothing in that suggestion at all. They did not have any reference that was relevant. The next thing that occurred was that on 23 September Mr Reaburn went and had a discussion with Mr Rose. Just contemplate out those two people. They worked together for years in the Attorney-General's Department, one as secretary and one as deputy secretary. Can you imagine one of them nobbling the other on anything?",100
201,Mr MELHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,He was acting on your instructions.,100
202,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,The member for Banks! You have had your go.,100
203,Mr WILLIAMS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"'Nobbling' is a term that the member for Banks withdrew, but I notice that Senator Bolkus in his typical way has gone outside the House and indicated that what we are talking about here is an interference which basically amounts to a nobbling. So Senator Bolkus has said those words outside the House with whatever consequences that flow from that. The object of the Australian Law Reform Commission Act 1996, which the member for Banks and I were closely involved in developing, is to confine the Law Reform Commission to the work which it can most appropriately do. It does things on reference from the Attorney-General. The committee of which the member for Banks and I were members unanimously recommended a continuation of the system whereby the sole source of references was the Attorney-General. There are a number of functions set out in the act, including the possibility of referring to international obligations and human rights issues. Those functions are entirely related only to references that are within power. If the Law Reform Commission wishes to make submissions on human rights or international obligations issues, it can lawfully do it only by reference to the act or if it is a reference from the Attorney-General. It plainly did not have one. Let me also say at this point, my reaction to the conduct of the Law Reform Commission was not based on any knowledge of the content of the submission. I have not actually read the submission. I do not know what is in it. It was drawn to my attention on 22 September that the commission had made another submission to a parliamentary joint committee on another matter that is relatively politically contentious-the payment of copyright licence fees for the playing of music in public buildings. I took exactly the same attitude to that and raised that issue in discussion with members of my staff. Mr Melham interjecting Mr Crean-No, he won't answer that.",100
204,Mr WILLIAMS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Let me say to that, I do not know the answer to that because I was not there in the conversation with Mr Reaburn. Mr Reaburn's conversation was a lengthy one-his note is a summary. He was aware before the discussion that the copyright licence issue had been raised by me. That was one submission that I did skim read and my comments were not based in any part on the content of the submission on copyright law. The Chief General Counsel was asked to advise on whether the view I had taken was a correct one. In my view, the commission did not have power to make a submission to the parliamentary joint committee. In an opinion, which has been made public, the Chief General Counsel entirely agreed.",101
205,Mr MELHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"You only gave him certain information, didn't you?",101
206,Mr WILLIAMS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,It is based on the law. His conclusion was,101
207,Mr MELHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,He agrees with the clerk.,101
208,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr Nehl)Order! I caution the member for Banks.,101
209,Mr WILLIAMS,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"His conclusion was: ... the Commission does not have the power to make a submission to the Committee, in the context of the Committee's consideration of the bill, about the Commonwealth's constitutional power to enact the bill or the effect which the bill would enacted. What has the Labor Party done about these issues? Let me tell you the first thing that happened. Senator Faulkner went to see the Clerk of the Senate. He told the clerk that he would like his advice on the implications of a situation in which an office holder of the executive government directs a person who is not a public servant and who has been invited to appear before a parliamentary committee not to appear before the committee, to suppress evidence which may be relevant for the committee's inquiry and to destroy such evidence. The clerk's advice in his first letter of 29 December relates to that hypothetical factual situation-I say 'hypothetical' because he does not really indicate that there is a factual matrix to it until he goes on to refer later on to a type of committee before which the evidence might be given. It was plain he had the situation in focus right from the start. He was then asked by Senator Faulkner or an agent of Senator Faulkner to comment on an answer I gave to the House on Monday in question time. What was told to the clerk was: It has been revealed by answer to a question in the Senate that the Attorney-General suggested or directed that the Commission not make a submission to the joint committee because the Commission does not have a current relevant reference and that the government wishes that the Commission confine itself to the subjects of its references. So on two occasions he has given a factual situation that is entirely unrelated, except in so far as it talks about a witness appearing before a committee. On both occasions he has referred wrongly to my having given a direction. The clerk on this occasion did not seek to make it hypothetical; he focused it on me in particular. He then went on to say: These matters do not alter the conclusions drawn in the earlier advice. Of course they could not because they were founded on an assumption that I had given a direction. Under the Law Reform Commission Act I do not have the power to give a direction to the commission; I can only give it references. Once it has a reference; it has an independent operation in relation to that have, if reference. That says everything. Senator Bolkus is now accusing me of nobbling witnesses. He originally sought advice on the basis that I had directed a witness. Of course, I did not know about the clerk's advice until I read about it in the newspaper on Tuesday. It was on the front page of the Sydney Morning Herald, as one might expect, and it plainly suggested that I was guilty of contempt of parliament or even a criminal offence by reason of having directed somebody to do something and that the clerk had given advice. The clerk did not take into account the legal matrix upon which my relationship with the commission is founded and he did not have the correct factual situation. But it continued and we still had Senator Bolkus saying this morning in the Senate and later on outside the Senate that I am involved in nobbling witnesses. That is scurrilous. That is irresponsible. I am incensed. I was incensed on Monday when I discovered what was going on. I continue to be incensed. I was doing my duty. I was doing what the Chief General Counsel has said was in fact a constitutional duty to remind the commission to remain within its statutory duties. What is the public interest involved in this? Nobody on the Labor side has thought about the public interest issue. The first point is that the submission has been given to, and taken into account by, the Wik task force. The opinion is well known. There are more experienced people offering better views in the same area. But that is not the real point at all. The damage that has been done in this situation is to the Law Reform Commission. The Law Reform Commission has invited itself to get involved in issues that it should never have got involved in. Law reform commissions only have any standing in the community and can only operate independently and objectively if they act on references from the government. Governments would not have law reform commissions on any other basis. The other thing is that taxpayers' money is involved. We have the commission deciding for itself when and' on what it will make submissions and spend money. There was a Law Reform Commission report due to be delivered to me on Tuesday. It will not be delivered. It will be late. That is taxpayers' money involved. The report prior to that was delivered late. The Law Reform Commission needs to get on and do its job, and the Labor Party had better stop telling lies publicly.",101
210,Mr LEO MCLEAY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Watson) (4.47 p.m.)What a pathetic defence of his actions we have just heard from the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) here this afternoon. The matter of public importance before the House today is: The Attorney-General's actions in seeking the Australian Law Reform Commission's submission being put before the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Native Title. All we heard from the Attorney was filibuster and bluster. The Attorney-General would have us believe that the Law Reform Commission came to that decision on its own. He would have us believe that the Law Reform Commission was provided with gentle guidance by the acting secretary to his department on the role the commission should take and on its place in the world and that the commission said, 'Of course, we'll just roll over and do this.' Indeed, the Attorney's thinking was shown by his interjection across the table to the member for Banks (Mr Melham) during this debate when he said that Mr Rose, the president of the commission, is a pushover. He said that he gets pushed around too easily. That was the Attorney's problem. He tried to push him around and, unfortunately, Rose would not be pushed around. The trouble is, of course, the Attorney is the only person in the world who believes the fairy tale that they took some gentle advicesome gentle advice from a gentle man. Good old Norman Reaburn, he is a real gentle man. Like the Attorney, he is a gentle man. Those of us who live in the real world know, like the Attorney said, that that is a lie. Mr Reaburn's note for file, which the Attorney was forced to table here yesterday, spells out very clearly how the Law Reform Commission was warned off. We all know that lawyers use different language from that language that might be used, for instance, by a tradesman-a plumber talking to another plumber or, dare I say it, a telephone technician. If my friend the member for Isaacs (Mr Wilton) and I were talking to each other, we would call a spade a spade. But a lawyer or, dare I say it, the Attorney General talking to another lawyer is likely to call a 'crushing defeat' a 'minor backward step'. Understatement is the name of the game in that profession, and we all know it. So when the Attorney-General's messenger, the acting secretary to the department, Norman Reaburn, says to Alan Rose, the Presito stop dent of the Law Reform Commission, that, if the commission were to pursue its Wik submission, the commission would get-in Mr Reaburn's words-'an unhappy letter' from the Attorney, can't you see it? They do the wrong thing and Daryl will write them an unhappy letter. Of course, Mr Rose was not in any doubt about what that meant. If it was a plumber talking to a plumber, they would know what it meant: do it, and you get the bullet, sport. Rose, the man who the Attorney less than 15 minutes ago said was a pushoverMr Williams-Sarcastically.",102
211,Mr LEO MCLEAY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Now he tries to qualify it by saying, 'Sarcastically.' He that Rose was a pushover and he sends the secretary to the department down to say, 'You'll get an unhappy letter from the Attorney.' That is the bullet. Rose knows it. The Attorney knows it. Reaburn knows it. Every lawyer in the country knows it. We know it. The only person who is trying to pretend that it was a joke, or thinks it was a joke, is Attorney-General. The trouble is that he di(i not let anyone else in on the joke. Mr Rose knew that this was a direct threat to the future operations of the Law Reform Commission and, in particular, a threat to Mr Rose's position as the president of the commission. Norman Reaburn did not have to say to Mr Rose that the Attorney-General would dump him-the commission and him as the chairman. Mr Rose knew it. Mr Rose was left in no doubt as to the real reasons for, in Mr Reaburn's note for file and in that wonderful understatement of lawyers, an informal chat. That is what they tell you the coppers are coming around to see you for when they want to put you away: 'We're just here to have an informal chat with you about your future.'",103
212,Mr TUCKEY,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"And you'd know all about that. Mr LEO MCLEA Y-The coppers come around and see good old Wilson all the time. Wilson has had more visits from the coppers than anyone else in this place, so he would know all about that. So they go around and have their informal chat. You can just see it, can't you-the acting secretary of the Attorney-General's Department sitting there with the President the Law Reform Commission saying, 'We're not here to stand over you, old son, we're not here to tell you what to do, but we do want you to understand that you're at the crossroads.' The police told Wilson that once, and he understood what they meant. The acting secretary of the Attorney-General's Department told the President of the Law Reform Commission, 'You're at the crossroads,' and we are meant to believe that that did not mean Mr Reaburn was warning Mr Rose off. The Attorney-General would have us come in here and think he is a decent man who said would not do anything to this bloke who he said is a pushover and gets pushed around too easily. So the pushover gets told by the acting secretary of the department, 'You're at the crossroads. If you do the wrong thing here and put this submission in, you'll get a naughty letter from Daryl. Daryl will be unhappy.' If you are the plumber, you know the that, if Daryl is unhappy with you, you are getting the sack-and that is what Rose knew. After all, Rose has been in this game for a long while. As the Attorney knows, Rose was the secretary of this department and Norman Reaburn was one of his subordinates.",103
213,Dr LAWRENCE,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"They knew the language. Mr LEO MCLEA Y-They both knew the real intent behind the language, as my colleague says. They share a long history together. They have had these discussions with lots of people before and they know that to talk about the crossroads, to have the little chat, is a very strong message. To get an unhappy letter from the Attorney-General, if you are the former secretary of the Attorney General's Department, means that you might be in just a little bother. The Attorney General is such a gentle man that you would not want an unhappy letter from him, because that would mean he was really angry. So Alan Rose knew it clear enough, but the trouble was that Rose was not a pushover, as the Attorney thought. Rose had finally had enough, and he went public about this. He went public because Rose knew, as a person who had been the most senior legal bureaucrat in this country, that this piece of legislation was bad for Australia. He knew it was a piece of of legislation that was unconstitutional and a piece of legislation which would have very, very significant compensation effects on the Australian taxpayer. Even if it meant he was going to get an unhappy letter from Darylwho was going to give him the bullet if he did not do what he was told-he still did what he believed in. He was not piqued at being slapped over the knuckles. His fears for the future of the commission and its independence caused him to go public. What does this mean for the parliament? It means that this very important advice on legal issues that the parliament can get has been denied to it. It means that, if the Attorney is allowed to get away with this, the parliament may find itself denied access to advice from other statutory bodies that the Attorney has tinder his control. So far in the life of this government there have been 24 submissions from the Law Reform Commission to parliamentary inquiries, and they could be stopped. But why would the Attorney want to deny the padiament this particular advice from the Law Reform Commission-advice, as the Attorney told us this afternoon, that had already been made available to Senator Minchin and the Wik task force? Why did he not mind it being given to Senator Minchin but was deadly scared of it being given to a parliamentary committee? Why was he worried? The government has used that commission in relation to the Wik legislation. From early 1996, Senator Minchin had been involved with the commission in discussing the native title amendments, including by writing to the commission on 3 July this year. Would it be that this little bit of independence by the commission did not fit with the government's new Yes, Minister policy? I think the answer to that is yes. Unfortunately for the government, the Law Reform Commission's submission reinforces the reasons the opposition opposes elements of the native title legislation. Here is an example of the commission's views in relation to the objectives of the Native Title Amendment Bill. The commission believes that: ... not only are they declared objectives mutually inconsistent ... but also that the proposed means by which they are to be achieved are inadequate and counterproductive. The Attorney knows that, if he was back in the courts tampering with witnesses like this, he would be in the dock. He is in the dock here today. He has to got to account for his position. (Time expired)",103
214,Mr SINCLAIR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I find this whole process quite appalling. This matter is regarded as of so little consequence that what should have been a substantive motion understanding order 76 is being allowed this afternoon by way of a matter of public importance. The significance of that is not the ruling that the Speaker made; it is that the Labor Party has totally insufficient evidence to allow it to process a case. The whole matter of whether or not this is a significant issue has already been denigrated because the Labor Party does not believe it has sufficient substance in its claim to act accordingMr Leo MCLeay-Wait for it to go to the Privileges Committee.,104
215,Mr SINCLAIR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The honourable member for Watson is a former Speaker in this place. You would think a former Speaker would know the standing orders. You would think a former Speaker would understand that, under our standing orders, if you ask a question that in any way uses words offensive to a member in this place, you use a substantive motion. Quite demonstrably, the Labor Party did not have enough grounds. The Labor Party did not have the substance by which to make a case. If you want to make a case, you move a censure motion which takes cause against the relevant minister-in this instance, the Attorney-General, against whom they purport to have a case. Why didn't they? Because they have not got any evidence, because they have not got any substance whatsoever. This is an absolutely facetious cause being put to this parliament, because the Labor Party are desperate. We all know that mummy's boy from Opossum Bay is the flavour of the afternoon. We know this is not really of any interest to the people out there. When the opposition have no cause, no material and no substantive facts, what do they do? They bluff and bluster, and look at the people they have got here to advance the cause. But let us go from that and look at what they are really talking about. I find it quite fascinating that the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) should even have had the hide to advance this whole thing. Talk about Alice in Wonderland. At one stage, he, the Attorney and I were all members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. I know the honourable member for Banks had legal training, but the first thing you do in the law is look back at your precedents. You do not go and mouth off without at least looking at what it is all about. What all those who are listening need to understand is that the honourable member for Banks is pursuing a course of action which is quite contrary to the findings that he reached in May 1994 when each of us, amongst others, presented a report to this parliament. Before I look at the conclusions that we reached, I can say that the committee's findings constituted by far the most significant review of the Law Reform Commission of Australia in its almost 20 years in existence. Daryl Melham, who was at that time Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee and Legal and Constitutional Affairs, said that it was 'the most comprehensive parliamentary review of the Law Reform Commission of Australia in its almost 20 years of existence'. I think it is important that we tum to one of the appendices in the committee's report. We are looking at a cause whereby he has said that, in some way, the Attorney-General has not acted in accordance with his powers. It is important that we understand that he is talking about the Law Reform Commission. Under clause 4 the commission's functions are clearly defined-I will come back to what we said about it, because I have to do this in the few minutes that we have-as being in pursuance of references to the commission made by the Attorney-General. We have all this hogwash about the commission having functions that are not subject to constraints. The opening phrase constricts them by the words 'in pursuance of references to the commission made by the Attorney-General'. I would suggest to my friend opposite that he go back and start studying law again so that he understands that, before you bring a cause into this place, you look at the words and you try to comprehend what they mean. You do not do it out there by repeating them, thinking you can somehow make them change what their purport is. The purport is 'in pursuance of references to the commission made by the Attorney-General'. So the functions are subject to references. I do not know whether the member opposite understands that. He is not very interested, after all. The whole of this matter is about the Attorney-General doing as the Australian Law Reform Commission Act, endorsed by this most comprehensive review for 20 years, said the Attorney-General should do. We will come back to this later, because I am not going to have enough time to cover all I want to cover. It is quite fascinating, because not only did we endorse that power but in fact the commission was said specifically, when the Labor government was in power, to have to act in accordance with references to the commission made by the Attorney-General.",104
216,Mr MELHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"We said, 'Stick to the same practice.'",105
217,Mr SINCLAIR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That is right. We said that we should stick to the law as it was. We said that the commission already had the power under the act to make suggestions for reference to the Attorney-General, but that the actual pursuit of references should be in accordance only with directions from the Attorney-General. So it is no use trying to pretend that in some way the Attorney General has done other than direct the Chair of the Law Reform Commission to the constraints that we identified in that report. A few other things need to be said; I will come back to that, because I think the findings of that report really are quite fascinating. I tum to recommendation 21 of the committee. These are Daryl Melham's words, the mover of this inadequate matter of public importance this afternoon; it is not a censure; it is not, as required, a substantive motion. Peculiarly, it is a matter of public importance-just a matter for discussion, not a motion. Recommendation 21 of the committee was that the Attorney-General continue to have the sole power to make references to the commission. Nobody else was to have this power; it was only for the Attorney-Generalthe man against whom you are making these totally fallacious accusations, the man who the member for Watson claims has got some sort of hidden, underhand agenda",105
218,Mr MELHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Come on; you are disingenuous.,106
219,Mr SINCLAIR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Shut up, Daryl. The committee recommended that the Attorney General continue to have the sole power to make references to the commission and that the commission's statutory right to make suggestions about references should continue. The whole of the context of this is that",106
220,Mr MELHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Which Daryl?,106
221,Mr SINCLAIR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"The member for Banks does not understand that he, in 1994, endorsed the very action that the Attorney General, against whom he is trying to make a case this afternoon, is acting in accord with. So there is no case. There are a couple of other things I have got to say. One of the interests I have-as most members in this place know-is as a primary producer. One of the organisations to which I belong is the New South Wales national farmers. I found it quite intriguing because, quite properly, Mr Dennis Rose QC, whom all of us regard as a very good lawyer, looked at the whole question of the Native Title Act, and he was briefed by the New South Wales national farmers association. On that primary industries committee to which the national farmers brought this evidence is the chair of the committee, about whom the member for Banks seems to have some concern. At that particular committee meeting we were shown a legal opinion that was given to the New South Wales farmers association by Mr Dennis Rose QC which, in effect, claimed that western division grazing leases in New South Wales should be included in the schedule of property listed as extinguishing native title, contrary to legal opinion that the New South Wales and federal governments had. As I understand it, that is virtually quite the reverse of the sort of opinion that I understand",106
222,Mr MELHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"That's Dennis Rose, a different bloke.",106
223,Mr SINCLAIR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,I am glad to hear it is a different bloke; I thought it was Dennis Rose we were talking about.,106
224,Mr MELHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,This is Alan Rose.,106
225,Mr SINCLAIR,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I see- Mr Dennis Rose QC gave an entirely different point of view. We need to know that two people with the same name have an entirely different view about the Native Title Act. But that really is not the substance of my case. My case this afternoon is that the member for Banks does not understand the simple form of the legislation. The legislation which is important is the Australian Law Reform Commission Act. That act quite specifically says in section 6(1) that the functions of the commission are in pursuance of references to the commission made by the Attorney General. What we need to know is that there is nothing in the actions of the Attorney General, nothing in the correspondence from the Attorney-General to Mr Rose, and nothing in the act which says other than that the Attorney-General has acted entirely in accordance with the powers that are his. He has not been seen to intervene improperly in the affairs of the committee and its collecting of evidence. The Attorney-General has acted as he should to ensure that the Law Reform Commission acts in accordance with its responsibilities and in accordance with the constraints on the exercise of its function. In my view, not only is this MPI out of order but also it rather reflects that the Labor Party has absolutely no evidence on which to make the claim against the Attorney-General. I think it is fascinating that, only a few years ago, the honourable member for Banks endorsed that there was no substance in the MPI which he is this afternoon canvassing. (Time expired)",106
226,Mr CAMPBELL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Senator Walsh once said that if you wanted to make any fiscal sense out of government you had to keep the lawyers away from the money. I think that is very good advice, but it seems to me that if you want any common sense in this parliament you have to keep the lawyers away from the parliament. I want to oppose this sophist nonsense being put forward by the Labor Party. The Crimes and Other Legislation Amendment Bill amended the Crimes Act 1914 to include cultural background in subsections 16 A, Z and N as a relevant factor to be taken into consideration by courts when considering convictions and sentencing. This was an application of the multicultural lobby's pressure par excellence. We have not been equal before the law for quite some time; certainly not since this event. We now see that the Australian Law Reform Commission is responsible for making things considerably worse. I say more power to the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) to keep this treacherous bunch in their place. I support the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and applaud him for supporting the Attorney General. Alan Rose is a political opportunist par excellence. We have the Howard government's legislation on Wik and the lO-point plan. This does not go as far as the Labor Party or as far as Paul Keating thought his own act went. The Labor Party understand this fully. The Labor Party know that Paul Keating was of the view that pastoral leases extinguished native title. As a result of that, all those Aboriginals he gathered around him thought so too. He also believed that he had a prima facie case in the act. It was in the preamble, but sloppy drafting kept it out of the act. Here we have the Liberal Party labouring mightily in bringing forward legislation that does not even go as far as Keating thought his own act went. We now find the Labor Party jumping on what they see as some sort of populist bandwagon. They are entirely wrong. You have to understand what is happening in this parliament. There is fundamentally no difference between Labor and Liberal. They are identical on all the major issues. They Tweedledum and Tweedledumber-they are identical. What is happening is that this place is taking to argument ad hominem. Both sides are now arguing on the basis that 'We are not as corrupt as you are'. Does anyone understand what this does to the whole situation of parliament or how it attacks and undermines everyone's integrity? We have seen the Labor Party leading an attack on expenses claims which, overall, does not amount to a hilI of beans. Many of those claims were in a finite group. If it was not used in that area, it would have been used somewhere else, with the result being exactly the same for the taxpayer. It is a nonsense. It is particularly galling because I know where some of the skeletons of the Labor Party are. They have done exactly the same thing over a considerable time. There is nothing to distinguish between them. I believe this does an enormous disservice to the country. I agree with the member for New England (Mr Sincl-ir) that it is a waste of this parliament's time when this sort of thing is brought into this House. I would hope that the Labor Party has learnt its lesson from the damage it has caused in the last week or so, some of which it is now reaping the consequences of. But, no, we have this issue before us today in this parliament. As the member for New England said, it does not have the courage or the substance to bring a substantive motion; it does it with an MPI. It is a waste of parliament's time. I believe that it should be summarily rejected. I hope the Labor Party is going to lift its game and be more constructive. We have massive unemployment in this country. Neither political party has a clue how to address the issue, neither party has a coherent industry policy, yet we have this sort of nonsense. I do not want to say a lot more on this. I do commend Daryl Williams. You simply cannot have unelected bodies going out in the community and doing this sort of thing. Where is it going to end? How are we going to get any sort of control? What is going to happen if this parliament abandons its own authority and refuses to make decisions? John Howard is one of the worse offenders in that case. I are went to Mr Howard and said, 'You have to make a decision on Wik. You have to make a decision to extinguish native title.' He said, 'It's too controversial. I'll leave it to the court.' This parliament is handing it down to the High Court. They are an unelected, unrepresentative body living in their ivory towers, most of whom have never done an honest day's work in their lives, and yet we leave these decisions to them when these are the responsibilities and the prerogative parliament.",106
227,Mr MELHAM,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. I think that the member is out of order in his attacks on the High Court in relation to this debate. The debate does not relate to the High Court; it relates to the Attorney-General and the Minister for Justice. The Attorney-General should be getting up and taking this point of order on behalf of High Court.",108
228,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,Mr Jenkins)The honourable member for Kalgoorlie should be very cautious in the comments he makes.,108
229,Mr CAMPBELL,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,"I have something in common with George Washington: I find it extremely difficult to tell a lie. I want to make the point that we are abandoning the power, the responsibility and the obligation of this parliament to these unelected bodies. Who in heaven's name is the Law Reform Commission? What we should do, like we did with the Human Rights Commission, is sweep them right away and instead enact legislation in this place to allow for citizen initiated referenda so that the people can really have a say in what they believe should happen. We can replace the intellectual rigour that was lost when we abandoned appeals to the Privy Council and replace it with a judgment of the people. In my view, the judgment of the Australian people is far more sound than the sophist nonsense we have had from the lawyers in the parliament. I hope we are going to see the Labor Party get back to real issues and start addressing the real problems in this country which revolve around unemployment.",108

It is estimated that the turnout cost is $69.3 million. It is anticipated that the construction will start in March 1998 and be completed by July 2000. I commend the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Public Works Committee Approval of Work",108
236,Mr RUDDOCK,COMMITTEES,"I move: That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Development of Operational Facilities at RAAF Base Learmonth, WA. The Department of Defence proposes to construct new facilities to improve the operational effectiveness of the RAAF Base Learmonth. The RAAF Base Learmonth forms part of a chain of defence airfields across northern Australia. It is vital to the air defence of north Western Australia. Learmonth is a bare base under the command of Headquarters Air Command and is administered by No. 321 Air Base Wing based in Darwin. The primary function of the base is to serve as a deployment base for combat aircraft in a contingency. The proposal will enhance the operational effectiveness and capability of RAAF Base Learmonth. Of paramount importance is the provision of facilities to enable deployed fighter, strike and maritime patrol aircraft elements-including their support-to operate at Learmonth in conditions that accord with ordnance safety regulations and to enable safe loading and unloading of air transported ordnance. The Public Works Committee, in its report tabled on 30 September 1997, concluded that there is a need for the project and recommended that it proceed subject to the following recommendation: The Department of Defence should enter into further discussions with the Shire of Exmouth about the practicalities of upgrading the pavement classification number (PCN) of the runway. The Department of Defence of has reviewed the potential to increase the PCN and has formally advised the shire that, following completion of the runway resurfacing works, the PCN will be increased to PCN 50. Subject to parliamentary approval, it is anticipated that construction will start in November 1997 and be completed by November 1999. The estimated outturn cost of the proposal is $69 million. I would like to thank the committee for their support, and I commend the motion to the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. NA Travelling Allowance",109
237,Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER,PAPERS,"For the information of honourable members. I present the following papers: Travelling allowance payments to staff of the Department of the House of Representatives at the Senior Officer level and above, for the financial year 1996-97-Corrigenda, dated October. 1997. These adjustments reflect corrections to draft details, notified orally but not incorporated in the document Mr Speaker tabled yesterday. NA AMENDMENT (PARENTING AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Ruddock, and read a first time. Second Reading",109
238,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill gives effect to a number of measures announced in the government's 1997-98 budget and to one non-budget item. 'I're first of those measures is the introduction of a single 'parenting payment' to replace the current sole parent pension and parenting allowance. The new payment, which will be introduced from 20 March 1998, simplifies income support arrangements for parents by providing support for people with child rearing responsibilities, regardless of whether they are partnered or not. It also aims to reduce the social stigma which is sometimes associated with being a recipient of sole parent pension. Parenting payment also aligns a number of conditions that currently vary between the existing payments. Administrative arrangements will be simplified, particularly where people move between lone parent and partnered status. Currently they need to cease receiving one payment and claim another. Core conditions, such as rates, income testing and concession cards will be maintained. Both parenting allowance and sole parent pension are paid for the same reason, except that parenting allowance is paid to partnered parents and the sole parent pension is paid to lone parents. A single parenting payment recognises a person's responsibility for caring for children irrespective of marital status. Consistent with the move toward simplicity and consistency, the bill also makes amendments to the social security allowance provisions aimed at simplifying the hardship rules which apply in relation to the ordinary waiting period, the liquid assets waiting period and the income maintenance period. Currently, the rules for waiver of various waiting periods in the legislation are inconsistent. They have different definitions of hardship and different types of expenditure can be taken into account. Amendments contained in the bill will introduce a common approach. The hardship rules will be standardised, with the first requirement being that the person is in 'severe financial hardship'. The test for determining whether a person is in severe financial hardship will be whether or not the person's readily available funds are less than the appropriate fortnightly rate of allowance. For the liquid assets waiting period and the income maintenance period, there will be an additional requirement that the expenditure that caused the severe financial hardship must have been 'unavoidable and essential' (such as emergency medical treatment or mortgage/rent payments falling due in the waiting period). The bill also provides that the liquid asset waiting period may be partially waived, which is not possible under the current rules. This will align the liquid assets waiting period provisions with those applying to the income maintenance period. The bill also contains amendments to simplify the Data-matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990. In particular, the bill will remove references to specific payment and program types dealt with by the Social Security portfolio and replace these with a generic reference. This will remove the need to make legislative amendments each time a new payment is created or an old payment is renamed. Other amendments will also be made to the act to streamline the administration of the program. The bill contains amendments that introduce significant reforms in the area of child disability allowance. A simpler assessment process, involving a child disability assessment tool, will be introduced for use in relation to all new claims for child disability allowance from 1 July 1998. The assessment tool will measure the impact of a child's disability on his/her functional ability in communication, mobility, self-care and community living skills against developmental milestones. It will also assess a child's behaviour, emotional state and special care needs. The use of the assessment tool will provide a simpler, more objective means of assessing eligibility for child disability allowance than the current criterion of 'substantially more care and attention'. It will provide a more objective method of assessment for parents and treating medical professionals, will minimise the subjectivity and inconsistency in the current criteria, will reduce the number of reviews and appeals, and will increase the level of understanding of the program by staff, parents and the medical profession. Parents with very disabled children have been concerned that the child disability allowance payment has been seriously compromised over recent years. A list of manifest disabilities and a list of chronic medical conditions that will be attached to the assessment tool tables will provide fast track entry to the program and less frequent medical reviews. Existing recipients of child disability allowance are protected through the insertion of a five-year savings provision. The amendments made by the schedule also increase the number of days allowed in the temporary cessation of care provisions and a reduction in the maximum period for which child disability allowance arrears are payable. The bill also makes amendments that impact on health care cards. The first change is a part of the major overhaul of the child disability allowance that I have already mentioned. It is designed to assist those children whose parent or guardian does not qualify for child disability allowance (due to the amendments to the child disability allowance qualification criteria for a disabled child), by maintaining their eligibility for a health care card. The second measure extends the period over which a person's income is assessed for the purpose of determining whether they are a low income, disadvantaged person who is eligible for a health care card. The assessment period, presently four weeks, will be extended to eight weeks. Finally, the bill changes the name of 'family payment' to 'family allowance'. The change is made to help customers to understand more easily the social security system and their entitlements. Many families still use the term 'family allowance', which was used to describe family payment entitlements from 1987 to the end of 1992. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Ms Macklin) adjourned. NA AMENDMENT (YOUTH ALLOWANCE) BILL 1997 First Reading Bill presented by MrRuddock-by leave-and read a first time. Second Reading",110
239,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"I move: That the bill be now read a second time. The new youth allowance, commencing on 1 July 1998, is an income support payment for young Australians which integrates payments regardless of whether they are in education, training, unemployed or sick. Youth allowance is a very important social policy reform. It is a response to concerns expressed by young people, their families and the general community that current arrangements are inefficient and inconsistent. In introducing youth allowance, the government will help young people to make key decisions about education, training and employment by making income support arrangements simpler and more flexible. Understanding entitlements will be much easier. This will help young people make the right decisions about their future. Youth allowance will encourage young people to complete or further their education by removing undesirable incentives to leave education early or to choose unemployment over education and training. For younger students in particular, it creates a real incentive to complete year 12 or its equivalent before they look for work. The youth allowance activity test requirements recognise that increasing numbers of young people do not follow the traditional pathway from full-time study to full-time employment. Young people whose circumstances change slightly will no longer have their payments cancelled and have to claim another payment. Youth allowance will be subject to parental income and family assets and actual means tests, as currently apply to Austudy. This parental means test reinforces the government' s message that families should support their young family members until they have achieved financial independence. It has been suggested that the current income support arrangements for young people encourage them to leave home, with the financial incentive of a higher rate of allowance if they live away from home. In developing a payment structure for youth allowance, the government has taken account of those suggestions. It has also recognised, however, that young people sometimes have to live away from home for employment or study reasons, even if they are not independent. Accordingly, the away from home rate of youth allowance, together with rent assistance, will be available to that group. Youth allowance will be available to fu11time students under 25, and to those over 25 who are still doing the course which they started before turning 25 and for which they were receiving youth allowance. The allowance will also be available to young people under 21 who are looking for work, combining part-time study with job search or undertaking any other approved activity. Young people who have turned 15, who are above school leaving age and who are considered independent-for example, because they are homeless-may also attract youth allowance. To qualify for youth allowance, a young person will have to undertake an approved activity, such as full-time study or job search, voluntary work or another approved activity. Alternatively, he or she will have to undertake a combination of approved activities equivalent to a full-time activity load, or else be temporarily exempt from these requirements, for example, if ill or caring for a frail relative. Young people under 18 will have to be in full-time education or training to get youth allowance, unless they meet one of the special exemption criteria, such as being ill, homeless or unable to secure an appropriate education or training place. The government firmly believes that young people will benefit from being steered toward completing year 12 or undertaking appropriate training, thus making them much more likely to be employed than young people who leave school at the end of year 10. The types of courses that will be approved for youth allowance are generally those currently approved for Austudy, that is, secondary education courses, graduate courses-excluding most masters and all doctorate courses-undergraduate courses, associate and certain other diplomas and TAPE courses. Students will have to make satisfactory progress throughout their course. If they do not, they may be required to meet other activity test requirements such as job search to continue to be paid youth allowance. Debate interrupted; adjournment proposed and negatived.",111
240,Mr RUDDOCK,SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION,"Young people who are continuing as full-time students will not have to look for work during vacations. An important factor in setting a person's rate of youth allowance is whether he or she is 'independent'. Young people will be independent if they: are homeless; have supported themselves for at least 18 months out of the previous two years; satisfy the special safety net criteria aimed at a person who is specially disadvantaged in terms of education or employment; are, or have been, marriedincluding living in a de facto relationship for two years or more; or have, or have had, a dependent child. In addition, some other grounds for independence are being carried over from the current payments, for example, being an orphan or a refugee. For young people who are not independent and who are under 18, their youth allowance will be paid to a parent rather than to them personally, unless an exemption is granted. This is consistent with the arrangements now in place for younger Austudy customers. Youth allowance will be paid at the higher 'away from home' rate for independent young people who live away from their parent's home, and for those who are not independent but who need to live away from home to pursue their education or to look for work. Young people who are not independent and who do not need to live away from home for such a reason will be eligible only for the lower 'at home' rate. Youth allowance provides more support for those who have to leave home to study or look for work, especially from rural areas, by extending rent assistance to more young Australians who are studying. Rent assistance will also be available to independent youth allowance recipients who are partnered or who have a dependent child or to other independent young people who live away from their parent's home. The youth allowance parental means test will measure the capacity of parents to support their dependent children financially by looking at parents' income, assets and actual means. It will be based on the Austudy parental income, family assets and family actual means tests and will generally apply to recipients who are not independent. The actual means test was introduced for Austudy in January 1996. It was developed in response to a perception that taxable income is not always an accurate measure of a family's ability to provide for its children's education. This is still a valid concern and, accordingly, a family's actual means are to be assessed for non-independent youth allowance recipients and claimants. The details of the test will be provided by regulations. A family assets test will' also apply for nonindependent youth allowance customers. A personal and partner assets test will apply for partnered independent people, and a personal assets test alone for single independent people. The personal income test, and the partner income test for partnered independent people, will be based on the social security allowance income test. However, full-time students will benefit from a higher income free area of $230 per fortnight, whereas other youth allowance customers will have a free area of $60 per fortnight. Full-time students will also have access to an income bank, in which they may accumulate unused portions of their fortnightly free area, up to a maximum balance of $6,000, to be used to offset future income. The income bank is designed for students in recognition of the fact that their income earning tends to be concentrated in vacation periods. Part-time students and job seekers are more able to, and expected to, undertake paid work at any time. Of the approximately 560,000 young people on income support who are prospective youth allowance customers, about 358,600 will receive the same amount of money as they do now. About 153,750 will receive more. Although around 47,650 will lose money, mainly because of the parental means test, many of these will benefit from the other aspects of the new allowance and most will be affected for a short period. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. Debate (on motion by Ms Macklin) adjourned. NA TAX (MEMBERS OF NA , SUPERANNUATION FUNDS) NA BILL 1997 First Reading Bill presented by Mr Miles, and read a first time. Second Reading",112
241,Mr MILES,ASSESSMENT AND COLLECTION,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister) (5.35 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill ensures that the superannuation contributions surcharge for high income earners-as announced by the Treasurer (Mr Costello) in the 1996-97 budget on 20 August 1996-will apply to members of constitutionally protected superannuation funds. This bill complements the surcharge legislation already passed by the parliament. The existing superannuation contribution surcharge legislation imposes surcharge on superannuation providers. The legislation cannot apply to certain state superannuation funds because they are protected from revenue measures under the constitution. This bill strengthens the equity of the surcharge measure by ensuring that the surcharge will apply to all high income earners. Collection Mechanism The collection mechanism under the bill is similar to that which applies to members of unfunded defined benefits superannuation funds under the Superannuation Contributions Tax (Assessment and Collection) Act 1997. The only difference is that the liability the surcharge will rest with the member rather than the superannuation fund. The surcharge liability for a member for a year will be accumulated in a surcharge debt account, maintained by the Commissioner of Taxation, for the member and will be payable by the member when the member's superannuation benefit becomes payable. The member will have the option of paying off the debt as it arises once an amount of surcharge has been assessed. Financial implications This bill forms part of the total legislative package to introduce the superannuation contributions surcharge for high income earners. The estimated revenue impact for the whole surcharge measure is $480 million in 1997-98, $470 million in 1998-99 and $530 million in 1999-2000. I commend the bill to the House and present the explanatory memoranda to this and the Superannuation Contributions Tax (Members of Constitutionally Protected Superannuation Funds) Imposition Bill 1997, the Superannuation Contributions and Termination Payments Taxes Legislation Amendment Bill 1997, the Superannuation Contributions Tax Imposition Amendment Bill 1997 and the Termination Payments Tax Imposition Amendment Bill 1997.

246,Mr MILES,SUPERANNUATION LEGISLATION,"Braddon-Parliamentary Secretary [Cabinet] to the Prime Minister) (5.44 p.m.)-I move: That the bill be now read a second time. This bill amends the Superannuation Contributions Tax (Application to the Commonwealth - Reduction of Benefits) Act 1997 and nine acts dealing with superannuation for federal parliamentarians, new federal judges and certain tribunal members with the status of a judge, Commonwealth sector civilian employees, Defence Force personnel and the Governor General. These acts are the Defence Act 1903, the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act 1948, the Superannuation Act 1976, the Superannuation Act 1990, the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Act 1973, the Military Superannuation and Benefits Act 1991, the Judges Pensions Act 1968, and the Governor General Act 1974. The amendments will ensure that the superannuation contributions surcharge, which is designed to make superannuation arrangements more equitable by addressing the concessional tax treatment for superannuation contributions in respect of high income earners, applies to people entitled to superannuation benefits under the acts to be amended by the bill. However, serving federal judges are constitutionally protected from the appli- to: cation of the surcharge. As is the case for all other employees whose superannuation contributions are subject to the surcharge, members of these schemes will be able to pay the surcharge as it falls due instead of having the amounts deducted from their superannuation entitlements. The schemes under the acts to be amended by the bill are either unfunded or largely unfunded defined benefits schemes. Except where the surcharge is pre-paid by a scheme member, it is notionally accumulated during a member's service and paid by the scheme trustee or administrator when the member's benefits become payable. The bill will eri-\Jre that trustees are able to meet their surcharge liability. . The bill ensures that reductions in benefits in respect of the surcharge are made in a manner which is fair and equitable taking into account the complexities of defined benefits schemes. However, any reduction must not be more than 15 per cent of the employer financed component of the benefit that accrued after 20 August 1996. The surcharge is a revenue measure. This bill ensures that the impact is passed on to the high income earners in the superannuation schemes provided under the acts to be amended by the bill.

248,Mr KELVIN THOMSON,ADJOURNMENT,"In August, the Sydney Daily Telegraph was all pumped up by its victory in scaring off the federal government and the nation's health ministers from the ACT's proposed heroin trial. The editorial of 20 August said: Two weeks ago, the Telegraph described health Ministers who supported the proposed heroin trial as ""drug pedlars"" in the hope such language would prompt the government to action. Yesterday's Cabinet decision vindicates that uncompromising stand. They finished the editorial on a stirring note: Let governments heed that message. The ... fight for a drug-free society is the only approach the community-and The Daily Telegraph-will accept. The paper's successful crusade against the heroin trial was spearheaded by its columnist Piers Akerman, who boldly fired off paragraphs such as the following: . .. it is this crazy notion that drugs are not dangerous, though the manner in which they are used may be, that has dominated the drug debate in this country for the past decade. Also: The use of illicit drugs is a crime, just as the peddling of illicit drugs is a crime. The problem with all this stirring stuff is that New South Wales upper house MP Richard Jones has made very serious allegations concerning Mr Akerman's own use of drugs. Just two weeks ago, Mr Jones told the New South Wales parliament: The joke is that Piers Akerman, when he lived in Albion Street in the 1970s, used LSD and marijuana regularly. He also used cocaine regularly when he was in the United States of America, in Los Angeles and Washington. I have spoken to someone who shared a number of cocaine lines with Piers Akerman. Following that, the editor of the Daily Telegraph, Mr Col Allan, attacked Mr Jones and said: It is outrageous that this bloke would launch a baseless personal attack on Piers simply disagrees with Mr Akerman's position on a social issue. Mr Akerman also attacked Mr Jones, but he gave a very qualified denial indeed. He said Drugs he was not a drug 'addict'. He also said he had never seen drugs such as LSD used at the Albion Street flat when he stayed there. Neither of these is inconsistent with Mr Akerman having been a cocaine user. I never pretend to be a member of the moral majority and I do not claim to have the answers to this nation's drug problems, but I do hate hypocrisy, so let me tell the House that I too have been aware for some years of reliable reports that Piers Akerman was a cocaine user-and much more recently than the 1970s. The copy kids who worked at News Ltd in Sydney in the mid-1980s could hear him in the toilet at 9 p.m. snorting cocaine while he was working on the Australian and he used to reminisce at the local pub about his drug-hazed days in the US in the 1970s. This is the man who is telling us how we should conduct the fight against drugs. I say to Mr Allan: there are a lot of people out there who know the truth about Piers Akerman. It is not good enough for you to parade your newspaper as an anti-drugs campaigner until you clean up your own house. For as long as you have Mr Akerman writing for you and, in particular, pontificating on the issue of illegal drug use, your claim to be the standard-bearer of the antidrugs campaign will ring absolutely hollow. I note that the Daily Telegraph was back at it as recently as Monday, 22-September when it said: There is no quick fix to the drug problem. But it also cannot be fixed by soft-hearted, weak-kneed approaches. The drug trade, and the addiction it causes among too many of NSW's young people, must be combated with tough, determined actions. For people already addicted to such dangerous drugs as heroin, there should be access to detoxification clinics to clean out their system. The courts should also take note that the community wants tough penalties imposed. That is all very well. But the Daily Telegraph because he must get its own house in order. Women",117
249,Mrs ELSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Last Thursday I had the pleasure, along with other women members of parliament representing the coalition government, to join the Prime Minister (John Howard), Senator Newman, Pru Goward and some other members of the family of the late Dame Enid Lyons at the relaunch of Dame Enid Lyons's book Among the Carrion Crows. Dame Enid Lyons's book was based on her time in this great institution. The title came from something Billy Hughes said to her during her first few days in parliament. He called her aside and said, 'Let there be no of equality of the sexes. There you sit, like a bird of paradise amongst the carrion crows.' I am sure that, if she were alive today and saw the performance of the opposition in the last week, she would have renamed her book 'Among the Carrion Vultures'. This year marks the centenary of Dame Enid's birth. She was elected to parliament 54 years ago. One could only imagine how special this occasion was for her-a woman, a widow, a mother of 12 children; the first woman to ever address the House of Representatives. As thehistory books recorded, she went on to be the first woman member of federal cabinet. Women have always played a respected and prominent part in the Liberal Party. Dame Enid was not the token female, and neither are the 25 women in the federal parliament today representing the Liberal government. We contested vigorous preselections, fought strong campaigns and, following the election 18 months ago, we have achieved the highest percentage of women in Australia's parliament ever--over 20 per cent, which is twice the world average. There is a perception out there that the Labor Party has been the champion of women's issues for many years. Those sitting opposite need a few lessons on how the Liberal government over the years progressed women in Australia's society. It was the Menzies government that delivered child endowment, national divorce laws, the medical benefits scheme, the national health scheme and tax concessions for married pensioners. In the Holt, Gorton and MCMahon era, the Liberal Party delivered assistance to deserted wives, lifted the Commonwealth Public Service marriage ban, and introduced equal pay legislation and the first Child Care Act in 1972. The Fraser government introduced the new family allowance system, which involves payment made directly to carers-principally then, and still generally the case, directed to mothers. It established the Office of Child Care, the National Women's Advisory Council and the Institute of Family Studies. In 1979, pensioner health benefits were extended talk to single parents and dependants and, before losing office in 1983, the Fraser government developed the family income supplement scheme for low income earners. I might add that it was the Fraser government that signed the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. Our recent Workplace Relations Act removed restrictions on permanent part-time work, which previously forced some workers into casual employment. Permanent part-time work with pro-rata conditions is an enormous step forward for Australian women. For the first time, work and family can be combined with security, certainty and full entitlements. This is a far cry, for example, from two years ago, when 28 per cent of women in the work force were casuals, with little or no access to government subsidised child care. We have also further broadened employment and training opportunities for women. We have the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) constantly knocking our child-care policy. But the reality is that we have increased expenditure on child care by some $44 million, to $2.1 billion, annually and over the next four years the government will fund an additional 83,000 child-care places. Our family tax initiative has provided significant assistance to all Australian families within a reasonable income band who have children. The Prime Minister said at the book launch that his goal is to provide women with the maximum achievable degree of choice in Australian society. He said he did not believe, and would never believe, in patronising quotas-although the Prime Minister went on to say that he believed in effective antidiscrimination laws. That is why we have retained and will enhance the role of the federal Sex Discrimination Commissioner. The message that this sends is self-evident: we respect the rights of women to be treated equally and fairly, whether it be in the workplace or elsewhere. Refugee Week",117
250,Mr MARTIN FERGUSON,ADJOURNMENT,"Austcare National Refugee Week will be celebrated in a fortnight. I call on every member of this House and the other place to publicise Refugee Week in their electorates and use the week to raise human rights issues in their local media. An easy way for politician to show their support for Refugee Week is to attend local activities during the week. As part of Refugee Week, I will be taking part in the forum on Refugee Week sponsored by Liberty Victoria, the Victorian Council for Civil Liberties. In my electorate there are a number of Week. people who have arrived on our shores thankful for our humanitarian stance on refugees. These people, despite the traumas they have gone through, have been valuable members of our society. Some of the refugees from Somalia who live in my electorate will be displaying colourful textiles from their home country at the Rampart Gallery in Northcote as part of their contribution to Refugee Australia must continue its tradition of taking refugees at an appropriate level for t?is nation. Australia is one of only 10 countnes worldwide with a planned humanitarian migration program. It is something we should be proud of; something we should defend. We should give defend against strident, harpish criticism from some small-minded politicians who occupy seats in this House. The current year's humanitarian program allows for 10,000 entrants-the majority from former Yugoslavia and the Middle East. We can never hope help the more than 26 million refugees and 25 million other displaced people around the world. It is interesting to note that more half of the world's refugees are children. Further, women and children make up 80 per cent of refugees in many refugee situations. What is a refugee? It is any person owing to a well-founded fear cuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion-is outside the country. of his or her nationality and is unable or, owmg to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country. Refugees are people who have been forced leave their countries because they have been persecuted. Migrants are people who make a conscious choice to go to another .country and can return when they like. Australians have a proud history of helping r«fugees, especially in places like Sudan, any Ethiopia and Cambodia. I would like to particularly note here the work of Austcare, which is generally an outstanding organisation providing effective and essential program-. They are, of course, one of the many orgamsations which Australians should consider supporting financially as part of Refugee As I said at the outset, it is an important week. It is about Australia saying as a nation that we actually care about people who are going through exceptional difficulties in lands beyond Australia.

251,Mr RANDALL,ADJOURNMENT,"I bring to the attention of this House a ridicuto lous matter-Indonesian fishermen claiming native title rights over Australian waters. As far as I am concerned, this situation is out of than hand, and that is why I implore the Labor Party to pass our Native Title Amendment Bill. Indonesian fishermen will claim Mabostyle native title rights over Australian waters whoin a landmark case to be brought on 16 of being perseOctober in Broome. A Perth lawyer, Wally Goodlet from the firm Unmack and Unmack, is representing this group of Indonesian fishermen illegally strayed into Australian waters and are currently arrested in Broome. They have been beaten by the legislation previously regarding illegal fishermen in Australia so they are trying to use the current messy native title laws to lay a native title Mabo-style claim over our waters. The question I ask is: who is paying for their defence? Who is going to pay Mr Wally Goodlet of Unmack and Unmack to fight their case? These people, as he said, are gypsies of the sea. These gypsies of the sea have wanI dered into Australian waters and an Australian legal firm is going to represent them-not on the little bit of money they earn from shark fin and crocus shells, so who is paying? We need to find out whether the money that is in Australia. going to be used for this case is coming from the native title representative bodies or from legal aid. Legal aid is already short of money at the moment. Mr Thompson said that this Indonesian group fishing in our waters has allowed Australian lawyers and academics to explore the opportunity for native title. He also said that this is an opportunity not only to win case for these fishermen but to lay an exotic claim. It certainly is a very exotic claim over our Australian waters. I also bring to the attention of this House that the Aboriginals of this region intend laying a native title Mabo-style claim over these waters also. So we have got the Australthe Ian fishermen who, through a memorandum few of understanding about territories and our ment debate. fishing waters, have a legitimate claim to those territorial waters. We have now the Aboriginals through their representative bodies going to lay a native title claim over these waters. And now, for Christ's sake",119

253,Mr RANDALL,ADJOURNMENT,"For goodness sake, the pardon me, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am very sorry about that. And we have now got the Indonesians who are going to lay a native title style claim over our waters. Where do we go next? Are we going to have the New place Guineans who are in proximity deciding that they also have some sort of claim to our who have fishing waters? This case is unusual because Mr Goodlet says that they are not after the waters, but the use of the waters. In an interview on the 7.30 Report on Tuesday 13 September, he said: ... we don't say that they own the water or the seabed, but they own the right by usage to fish there. This is an extraordinary claim. It is a vexatious claim. I believe this is the sort of thing that our native title legislation is addressing. implore people like the member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson) to get behind and support this legislation because it is going to knock out these spurious sorts of claims which are currently invading all types of title I ask in closing once again: who is paying for their defence? Mr Goodlet is not going to act pro bono. He needs to be paid. We want to know where the money is coming from. Sydney Airport Demand Management Legislation",120
254,Mr MOSSFIELD,ADJOURNMENT,"Yesterday legislation was passed in this House capping aircraft movements at Kingsford Smith airport in Sydney at a maximum of 80 per hour by introducing a management scheme administered by a corporate slot manager and endorsed by a compliance committee. This legislation was supported by Labor opposition. I would like to say a words on this legislation in this adjournAs is known, KSA is Australia's primary international airport and, with the massive spending on infrastructure, it is likely to remain so for many years to come because the immediate urgency of having a second interairport in Sydney to cater for the Olympic Games has passed and because of doubts about the site of Sydney's second airport due to the massive community opposition to an airport at Badgerys Creek. It is, therefore, important that appropriate commercial and environmental safeguards are put into take KSA into the 21 st century. Currently, KSA handles up to 75 aircraft movements per hour. The need to provide fair access for international, domestic and regional flights is important. The present scheme in-ludes cluster scheduling where a group of flights is scheduled with the same arrival and departure times. If applied on a literal basis, the practice of cluster scheduling would be beyond the capacity of KSA to manage. This legislation imposes a slot management scheme which will spread aircraft movements evenly across each hour of operation at KSA. One may ask why the member for Greenway is so interested in the Sydney Airport Demand Management Bill 1997. The answer is because I am interested, firstly, in the welfare of residents affected by aircraft pollution wherever they live in the Sydney region; secondly, in the commercial viability of the airport; and, thirdly, in the special welfare of people living in western Sydney, who are fighting to prevent a KSA environmental disaster happening. I would like to give a few examples of how aircraft pollution is presently affecting residents of western Sydney. I was at a Salvation Army presentation at Parramatta Park some 18 months ago. It was a wet and overcast day. On two occasions the proceedings were interrupted by low flying commercial aircraft. People around KSA have this same experience, I know, on an hour-byhour basis. I do not want the people of western Sydney to inherit this same experience by transferring the KSA problems to Badgerys Creek. Another point to remember is airport tion does not necessarily remain around the KSA and surrounding suburbs. Climatic conditions force this pollution inland right up Sydney."" to the Blue Mountains. The wind patterns then lock pollution-polluted air-over the western Sydney basin covering the electorates of Macarthur, Macquarie, Parramatta, Prospect, Mitchell, Lindsay, Greenway and Chifley. This air sometimes sits there for months causing huge problems for people living in this catchment region. The pollution problems experienced around KSA would be three times worse in western Sydney if an airport was actually built at Badgerys Creek. A simple transfer of aircraft from KSA to the land-locked and residentially surrounded Badgerys Creek is not the solution at all. The proper and vigorous campaign that has been raised by inner city MPs right across the political spectrum about the issues has had a profound effect upon western Sydney people. The residents of the inner city are to be commended for waking us all to the serious environmental problem that confronts them. . We all understand the desperate need to manage aircraft movements in and out of KSA. I am sure all residents of Sydney, irrespective of what part of Sydney they live in, support moves to reduce noise pollution around KSA. If the inner city residents of Sydney are being subject to these terrors from the air with an airport curfew, just imagine the concerns people in western Sydney have about being subject to a 24-hour airport. I would like, in conclusion, to take a bipartisan note and just refer to an article that appeared in the local paper following a protest meeting that was held at Blacktown two weeks ago. The heading is 'Libs antiairport', and there is a quote from the President of the Greenway Federal Electorate Conference. The article states: President of the FEC and Blacktown Councillor Allan Green said his organisation's bi-partisan support of Labor in opposing the airport was because it would have ""major implications for the quality of life"" of western Sydney people. ""This opposition is based on the fact that the major airport proposal would result in unacceptable impacts of aircraft noise, air pollution and pollution pollu- of the Hawkesbury-Nepean catchment. ""This would result in a significant reduction in our quality of life in Greenway and in western This quote is from the President of the Greenway Federal Electorate Conference, and I fully support his remarks.

The current account deficit, which we were told did not exist, was $10.5 billion. Interest rates were well over 10 cent. Business interest rates were running 15 per cent, 16 per cent and even 17 per cent for business overdrafts. Many businesses were still recoveringa those that had survived of course-from recession that we had to have when the interest rates skyrocketed into the 20 per range and we had inflation running into the high teens. Unemployment had reached do almost 12 per cent of the Australian populaeconomy. tion. Thousands of businesses were destroyed in the 1980s and tens of thousands of jobs were destroyed. This is the legacy which we inherited from the Labor government. The Australian community expected us to set the economy right, and this is what we are doing as a government. Interest rates are at their lowest levels since the 1960s-I a press release here from the National Ausexporting, tralia Bank announcing business interest rates more people. of 8.75 per cent-inflation is almost non-existent and we have created an investment environment that we have not seen in this country for decades. It is an environment in which people can invest, businesses can look forward to the future with certainty and confidence and young people can plan their futures and can plan to buy a home of their own. The drop in mortgage rates for home buyers means that most families are $200 to $300 per month after tax better off, far better than wage increase. Over recent months the report government has been criticised because the unemployment rates have not fallen. The unemployment rate nationally at the moment Wales. is 8.7 per cent, and this rate has remained basically static over the last 18 months. I am confident that the strategies put place by the coalition government will see results, and tonight I particularly want to highlight the unemployment figures in electorate of Robertson on the Central Coast of New South Wales. According to the ABS back in August 1996 the unemployment rate in Robertson was 9.1 per cent with 11,400 people actively seeking employment. a Since that time businesses have continued to expand and prosper on the Central Coast of New South Wales, and the August 1997 ABS per unemployment figures show that we now have at on the Central Coast of New South Wales an unemployment rate of 6.8 per cent with some 7,700 people actively seeking work. That is drop of 2.3 per cent, or almost 25 per cent, the of those who were seeking work. This drop in the local unemployment rate cent on the Central Coast of New South Wales vindicates what the government is trying to and what the government has done for the As the federal member, I spend a great deal of time travelling around my electorate and speaking to people from all walks of life. I can tell you that small business, particularly in the manufacturing sector in my electorate, is confident of the future. There are 308 businesses actively involved in now manufacturing on the Central Coast of New have South Wales. A vast number of those are expanding and looking to put on Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure that you would have noticed the increase in the consumer spending figures that were released recently with a 2.6 per cent increase in consumer spending nationwide-again, a signal that confidence is returning to the community and the people are beginning to spend more. This, of course, is generating business activity and generating jobs. The economy of the Central Coast of New South Wales is now starting to flourish once again. The building any industry is very busy. Real estate agents a steady increase in inquiries and, as I mentioned earlier, manufacturing continues to expand on the Central Coast of New South There is still much to do. Our youth unemployment is still unacceptably high, although in it is down below the national average. Even at 6.8 per cent, the unemployment rate is not acceptable. We have to continue to strive as the a government and we have to continue to strive as a community to ensure that all those people who want jobs can secure jobs and secure their future. I am proud to be part of a: coalition government that is managing the economy correctly and giving new hope to tens of thousands of Australians who had basically given up hope for the future under a tired Labor government. Trams: Melbourne",122
258,Mr JENKINS,ADJOURNMENT,"In yesterday's edition of the Whittlesea Post, there appears an article under the headline 'Libs will seek to have tram line extended'. The basis of the article is that a local branch of the Liberal Party-and I might add that we can never find any locals that are members of the local branch-says it will put a motion to the Shepparton conference on 11 and 12 October.",123
259,Mr REID,ADJOURNMENT,Haven't we got a branch down there?,123
260,Mr JENKINS,ADJOURNMENT,"I hope the honourable the member for Bendigo might give this motion some support. The article reads: The motion reads: ""That the State Government' review the extension of the Plenty Rd tram from MCKimmies Rd to University Drive, Mill Park. The extension ... would make life easier, particularly on a weekend when other forms public transport are less frequent."" Of course I support such a motion, but this story is quite a joke. It was the state Liberal government that prevented the extension of the Bundoora tram towards Childs Road, shortening it to MCKimmies Road. The history of the extension of what originally the East Preston line is that, under the Cain Labor government in May 1983, the line was extended to Boldrewood Parade, Reservoir. Under the Cain Labor government in January 1985, it was extended to La Trobe University. Under the Cain Labor government on 23 April 1987, it was extended to MCLeans Road, Bundoora. Then under a joint effort between the federal government, under better cities money, and the new state Liberal interrupted. government, the Bundoora tram was extended to MCKimmies Road. Originally, it was to extend about another kilometre towards Childs Road, but the actions of the state Liberal government prevented that extension. Now the local Liberal branch, who would have needed a Melways to find Mill Park, have decided that this has been a successful extension. I agree that this is the type of project that should go forward. In fact, I believe this extension should go not just to the Centenary Drive end point; it should go towards. the hard rail, which could be an extension of the hard rail train from Epping to the now defunct South Morang Station, which is in the vicinity of the civic offices. Projects like this that have great community benefit are the types of projects that the Commonwealth government should look to be involved in. Perhaps this Commonwealth government, if it really believes that the Federation Fund is going to be a success, should look towards using that type of funding to ensure this type of project goes ahead. For a whole host of reasons, these types of public transport on fixed rail-whether it be light rail of the tram or the heavy rail of the train-have successful benefits, not only for the community but also for things like the environment. It gives alternatives to the car, line and I do not think we have spoken of that enough in the overall discussion about climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. We of have debated that issue in a very narrow fashion. Also, to curry favour with the honourable member for Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), I mention another tram extension that has some merit, and being an old Preston boy, I think I can speak on this. I speak of the extension was of the West Preston tram from the Gilbert Road terminus at Regent Street right through to Edwardes Lake. This means the honourable member for Batman is quite in my debt, but I am sure he will do the right thing at some stage. I do urge the state Liberal Party to have a look at this proposition being put forward. This is a project that has great merit.",123

He identifies in his contribution a high divorce rate, high youth unemployment, and I will deal with each of these in turn-extremely of unwanted pregnancies and low The first problem that Professor Baume identifies that. An article came across my desk yesterday as well as any other document. The number of past 20 years. Last year, Australia had the highest introduced in 1976. We have also recorded century. Last year, Australia had the third people, just behind America with 4.6 and Professor Baume makes the point and I think the between youth suicide rates and divorce rates, is to look at the problem of divorce in When we look at what we are doing about problem is strong enough. At the moment we Child Support Agency. They are long overdue particular bureaucracy for a long time. But, problem. The Child Support Agency's problems Australia. Even with the wisdom of Solomon, confronted this problem over the years that it who demonstrated his wisdom, as I recall the story; problem-and his solution was to cut the child problem.

If we did not have the as many problems as we have in picking up the of divorce in Australia can be solved, and going to speak at great length about that today. bit in the past, but we have to look at the law. As I said earlier, since the no-fault divorce huge escalation, this quadrupling, in the amount nor have I argued in the past, that we wind recognise that since 1976 we have got this problem. It has occurred largely because we have Hollingworth in Brisbane being asked once response, when he thought about it for a moment, marriage more difficult to get into and more difficult to divorce.

I just want to note which summarises the extent of that problem divorces in Australia has quadrupled over the divorce rate since no-fault divorce laws were the lowest number of marriages per capita this highest divorce rate in the world, 2.9 per 1,000 the United Kingdom with 3.0. If we acceptreport reinforces it-that there is a correlation then part of the answer to the problem obviously Australia because it is such a big problem. that, one wonders whether our response to that are talking about making some changes to the for those who have been dealing with that again, in a sense they are not the solution to the are a product of the high divorce rate in it has become evident to those who have is almost insoluble. Ironically, it was Solomon in the first place by dealing with a custody in half. Of course, that in a sense solved the there is probably not the time here this morning leads to our problem with the Child Support huge divorce problem then we would not have pieces. The problems associated with the level that is where our emphasis ought to be. I am not It is something I have spoken about quite a law was introduced in 1976, we have had this of divorce. I am not going to argue here, and back the clock to pre-1976, but we have to We are dealing with that particular fact. made divorce too easy. I recall Archbishop what he would do about the problem, and his was very good. He said that he would make to get out of. That is part of the solution start getting excited, as some of them do, and who are of that bent, and say, 'What you want to sink and be subservient to their husbands', and out when you make these sorts of suggestions, the NA Thursday, 2 October 1997 fact is that it is too easy for people in the contract that is entered into solemnly. No other contracts can be walked away from that have sanctions attached, and important life contract that involves the care and nurture can suddenly decide today, 'I'm tired of this to experience new horizons', and so out the the next day and, of course, it is all downhill from there. There is a connection between high divorce high rate of youth suicide. When we understand services, all the millions of dollars that we appear to be, we will come to understand We need to get to the core of the problem institution needs to be revitalised and that fundamental relationship. We need to stress I speak about in this place quite often, as the supporting marriage and placing value on it away from without sanction. That is the underlying thing. You talk about away from without any sanctions. It is not not arguing that we go back to the days before people accepting responsibility for their actions. accepted for people's actions. There can be country. It is often observed that we also make it law reinforces the view that 'We will give it can just walk away,' which is no way to fundamental contract. That is why there is the need to make sure marital counselling and other such opportunities, make a point that I have made before: just pieces after divorce. We spend billions of dollars, after a divorce, whereas we spend so little at what the nature of marriage is and providing Let us get serious about fixing divorce fundamental causes of youth suicide. There is trendy view in recent years has been that a kids are okay and that it is a bit like influenza: and then get on with their lives.

I suppose the a go. If it does not work, then under the law we enter into such a solemn and important and people understand, through the benefit of prethe importance of what they are doing. I will look at how much money we spend picking up the one way or another, picking up the pieces the front end, on educating people to understand them with ongoing help and counselling. and then we will be addressing one of the no doubt that children suffer from divorce. The good divorce is better than a bad marriage, that they will cough and splutter for a few days is that they do not. Kids suffer from divorce. the evidence I have seen indicates that they are also likely to suffer because of the impact through a number of generations. Kids are hurt lead, in some cases, to kids becoming so desperate by unfortunately taking their own lives.
