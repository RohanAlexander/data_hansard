NA It is a vital question about how the budget provided here. The minister tried to answer because there has been some media coverage of antee which every family day care service, every family day care is wanting from the minister-a continue for family day care. That question the minister to stand up and say, ‘No decisions cern that family day care operators have-a der threat and thousands of families across the away money for family day care services. People should also be aware that there community who have been lobbying for this operational an issue of an equal playing field, as they would like to place on the record Labor's view care is entirely different in nature to the operational care centres, because of the nature of the the only contact, training, support and information care scheme, which cannot be provided if there deliver that service.

It has been revealed received over 4,000 letters from family day selves concerned about this funding. This is an a great deal of fear about it and we believe formation about whether or not The fourth issue that I would like to raise the Special Needs Subsidy Scheme. I am glad that the other minister at the table will advise swers on. I have covered three of them. If it continue to raise the other issues.

We do not Council can possibly do its job on the is also in this same expenditure item-child-care we do not see how you will be able to meet without allocating some extra money, and do. So we have questions on a guarantee from the subsidy will continue and on whether any Childcare Accreditation Council. There is available for that, and we are greatly concerned in Senate estimates that the government has care associations and parents and carers themissue that is already in the community, there is that the government needs to provide us with init can guarantee that funding. for some consideration in detail at this point is to see that the minister has arrived.

This is one of the areas in which a speNA cial budget commitment has been made. It is has identified some need and allocated some been boiling for a long time. Before last year's on the Special Needs Subsidy Scheme. We large number of parents affected by the freeze, removed, but we were pleased to see that, into cover, as we understand it, 1,200 children. We seek clarification from the minister was made that it would cover 1,200 children. both the minister and the department, we cannot will work. We would like clarification in this processed to get on to the scheme. Will it have been made to the scheme; what will that over the next four years? That would mean that be of primary school age and perhaps not qualify old to get it. We really want there to be transparency of new places takes place. I am also concerned ing list. If the budget initiative is aimed at with children who-as occurs every day, every this sort of assistance? How does the budget I now raise an issue which I know the minister might be able to provide some proper information. care service, which is I think just across the he has been talking and meeting with that service child who uses the after school and vacation care of them to quite a high degree. The government should, through its child-care funding and has been paying a bulk payment rather than the and it has done so at a much lower rate than The government has been trying to say, ‘Look, ernment because it is a disability service,'-even else about support for children getting into minister in particular have now tried to say, children with special needs and so we don't have mainstream program, we do not think it is our quite ridiculous. This is a program that is operating families dependent on it. It is a child-care wealth's responsibilities. But they would say, force it to close down. But, if your children after school and vacation care program, we will higher rate if those 85 children can The minister knows that there is nowhere placed. He knows that, if this service closes, fore, he regards this as a win-win situation. the only area of child care in which the budget extra funding. This has been an issue which has budget, the government actually put a freeze have been campaigning heavily, as have a very to have that freeze removed. It has not been this budget, there was a new allocation of money on the Special Needs Subsidy Scheme. A statement Although some comments have been made by ascertain from the budget papers how this process of how people on the waiting list will be happen immediately? We understand some changes mean? Will the 1,200 children be phased in some of the children on the waiting list will for the funding they need before being too and accountability in how this allocation about what happens to anyone not on the waitclearing the current waiting list, what will happen week, every month-make an application for deal with any ongoing need in this area? is across in some detail and for which he I give the example of the Carousel childborder from the minister's electorate. I know that regularly. This service is one where every service has a disability or special need, most has been supporting this program, as it special needs subsidy. However, the government usual individual payment for these 85 children would be paid if it were actually for 85 children. this is actually an issue for the state govthough it makes commitments everywhere mainstream services. The government and the ‘This is a specific program for a large number of to fund it at all because, unless they are in a job but the state government's job.' That is extremely well, with 85 children and their program which is directly within the Common‘We're not going to fund it any more. We'll get a spot in a mainstream child-care service or then fund the applications, and it will be at a be placed elsewhere in the community.' else in the community for those children to be these children will not have any support. ThereThe government does not have to continue fundNA ing the specialist service and it will not have cause there are no places for these children ment on this because it really is a serious problem. there are other examples. I do not believe funding, which is welcome-deals with this from the minister in that area. I would also like clarification on the basic this portfolio well before the government had sidy. At that time the subsidy rate was not adequate special needs and deliver some quality outcome new expenditure item does not in any way deal believe anything in the budget indicates any deal with those issues. That is the fourth or like dealt with. The final issue I would raise, before my colleagues of child abuse prevention programs. This budget child abuse prevention programs. Obviously plenty of evidence that the federal government on this issue. We all know-and I am aware that national importance; it is a tragedy. But we in appropriate ways is provided by the federal government. The issue that I would like to raise at this after the budget. On the Friday of budget week, extra $10 million had somehow been found to then, my understanding has been that the $10 from the minister on this-but comes from already allocated in the budget and itemised like some information from the minister about priority, which would have received funding will not receive funding. It seems to follow can be transferred to a different purpose We have not had any clarification from the nouncement, about the process for the allocation sion was made. It obviously was not made prior any way in those papers. We believe that this ernment. This is a very sensitive issue, and in this area. The allocation of extra money to pay Paul. I am extremely concerned about the $10 and dance about the money that it has put but the reality is the majority of programs give us any extra information on this if he budget papers that requires any sort of ongoing to pay any money in the general community beto go into. I would like answers from the governIt is a particular problem at that site, but that the budget item-which allocates some extra sort of problem. So I would like some answers issue of the special needs subsidy. I took over put in place a freeze on the special needs subto enable services to take in children with for them. I would like clarification that this with that.

Since million is not new-and we seek clarification the Stronger Families and Communities program to potentially cover issues such as this.
